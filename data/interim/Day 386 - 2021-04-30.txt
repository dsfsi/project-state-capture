CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Good morning Mr Gama. 
MR GAMA:  Good morning Chairperson how are you today? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am alright how are you? 
MR GAMA:  Very well thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh are you ready? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Gama where we ended off on 
Monday from what I recall was working through the role 
that you played overall in relation to the acquisition of the 
10 
1064 locomotives.  You had explained that you were 
involved in developing the business case but at the TFR 
level. 
 
I just want to ask you when the final business case 
was submitted to the Transnet board we know it was 
approved on the 25 t h of April 2013 did you recommend and 
sign that business case – the final business case? 
MR GAMA:  I would not remember is there a document that 
you have that you want me to look at? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Were you present at the board 
20 
meeting? 
MR GAMA:  I cannot recall whether I was or not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  And then you say that you 
were part of the post tender negotiations you mentioned to 
us and assisted us with the details that you were part of a 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 5 of 137 
 
locomotive steering committee and the co-chairperson 
together with Mr Singh that that you did not become 
involved in the negotiations per se is that correct? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And we know that those post tender 
negotiations 
then 
culminated 
in 
the 
conclusion 
of 
locomotive service agreements which were signed on the 
17 t h of March 2014.  I think you did mention that those 
negotiations ultimately would result in the conclusion of 
contracts, correct? 
10 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And we know then that in May of 
2014 the BADAC and I think after that the board of 
directors agreed to an increase in the ETC, do you play a 
role in that? Were you party to the memoranda that were 
put before the BADC and the board of directors? 
MR GAMA:  Yes 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then I think that we have touched 
on this as well – oh sorry and just to confirm so the – all of 
those steps were at the time where you were the CEO of 
20 
TFR? 
MR GAMA:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We have touched on it as well that 
when you then took up the position of Group Chief 
Executive whether permanently or acting you played a role 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 6 of 137 
 
in the funding of the locomotives?  You played a role in the 
China Development Bank loan and also the club loan, is 
that correct? 
MR GAMA:  No I did not play any role. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well we will come to that.  Did you 
not sign and author certain documentation relating to the 
China Development Bank and the club loan? 
MR GAMA:  I did not author any documents but I was 
involved in taking it to the correct people.  The authors of 
those documents as I have said to you when it comes to 
10 
funding and those are financial people that deal with those 
issues. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright well perhaps you could just 
describe to us what was your role? 
MR GAMA:  Sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What was your role then in relation to 
the China Development loan and the club loan?  These 
were as you know agreements – consultancy agreements 
advising agreements with Regiments in relation to the 
China Development Bank and with Trillian in relation to the 
20 
club loan.  What – how would you describe your role in 
relation to those contracts? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe would it be – maybe it would 
be more convenient if you took one by one Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 7 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say do you have a role in this one if so 
what role? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next one. 
MR GAMA:  Ja I think Chair it would be better if we went 
through the documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  And then ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GAMA:  It would assist him because I could say I had a 
10 
role I really just came in at the tail end of it when people 
have .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  Negotiated and then even the Chief Executive 
and then they will say okay and we now – we now have a 
loan that has been negotiated come let us take a pitch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So well 
MR GAMA:  You cannot – you cannot say you played a role 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think maybe Mr Myburgh could 
20 
take you one by one if that is not too cumbersome. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I – yes I mean each of these the 
China Development Bank loan and the club loan is a topic 
in itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 8 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That I am going to examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Gama – but I just wanted to get a 
bird’s eye view of his overall involvement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If he says he wishes to deal with that 
when we come to the documents that is perfectly in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so I think Mr Gama you for now you 
can say what you remember to have been your role if you 
do not remember that you had a role you can say I do not 
10 
remember that I had a role or if I did have it might be an 
insignificant role but then when Mr Myburgh comes to the 
actual documents then we can go through them. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct Chair as I have said the raising 
of those loans I was not involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  My role would probably be at the tail end – 
insignificant.  There is not anything much that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you did. 
MR GAMA:  That I personally did. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  It is insignificant.  Maybe you will see my 
signature on one or two documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  It does not mean that I played a role. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 9 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja or it might mean it is an insignificant 
role as you put it.  Ja it obviously just depend what the 
content of the documents is. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR GAMA:  Then we can go through it and actual 
arrangement yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then finally were you as you say 
at the tail end were you involved at all in the relocation 
from Pretoria to Durban of the manufacturing facilities of 
two of the OEM’s? 
MR GAMA:  No I was not involved in the negotiation I was 
involved in the approval. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  Alright so you were involved in 
the approval of what?  The amounts and the payments 
etcetera? 
MR GAMA:  Yes in the approval of the relocation. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry. 
MR GAMA:  In the approval of the relocation.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  I want to now look at what 
appears to have been going on behind the scenes.  As I 
understand Mr Gama under your watch you – is my 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 10 of 137 
 
understanding correct that you initiated an investigation 
into the acquisition of the 1064 locomotives? 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And was that investigation incomplete 
at the time that you left Transnet as I have it in October 
2018. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We have seen some reference to that 
in the minutes of the special board meeting of the 13 t h of 
June 2017 that you produced in relation to the affidavit of 
10 
Witness 2, correct? 
MR GAMA:  Ja that was the – I think that was the starting 
point where I was busy with Terms of Reference for the 
investigation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I want to just sketch to you very 
briefly 
the 
evidence 
that 
has 
emerged 
from 
the 
investigations undertaken particularly by the money flow 
stream.  They have led the evidence of an expert Mr Paul 
Holden – Chairperson you will know that he is due to 
continue his testimony in the month of May.   
20 
I should just make this very clear Mr Gama that 
what I am going to say to you now is what the evidence 
that they have presented appears to establish it.  Of 
course we will be up ultimately to the DCJ to decide 
whether it has been or not.  So I want to qualify what I am 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 11 of 137 
 
going to say to you on that basis. 
Firstly what appears is that in – in those instances 
where 
Regiments 
was 
appointed 
as 
the 
Supplier 
Development partner to McKinsey on the 1064 transaction 
advisor contract Mr Essa was paid 50% of all the fees at 
Regiments with laundry payments then having been made 
to Gupta companies.  You want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:  No I am not privy to the report – I have not 
seen it.   I do not know anything about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Secondly in relation to this China 
10 
Development loan funding contract which we spoke about 
what happened there and that as you know was part of the 
funding of the 1064 locomotives.  What happened there is 
that Regiments were paid a success fee and we will come 
to this later of R189 million.  78% of that was paid out to a 
company called Albertime owned by Mr Kuban Moodley, 
have you heard that name? 
MR GAMA:  I have seen the name in the newspapers. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  78% of the R189 was paid out to 
Albertime and then R122 million of that landed up with 
20 
Sahara 
Computers 
– 
was 
laundered 
into 
Sahara 
Computers.  You know that Sahara Computers was a Gupta 
owned company? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then in relation to the club loan 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 12 of 137 
 
which we have also touched upon where you say you came 
in at the tail end and we will go to the documents in time 
there Trillian was paid R93 million.  80% of that 74% - R74 
million was paid to Albertime.  Do you know anything about 
that? 
MR GAMA:  No I do not. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Then 
what 
the 
money 
flows 
investigation has revealed and other investigations is that 
Mr Essa was involved in the conclusion of a number of so 
called BDSA’s Business Development Services Agreements 
10 
essentially would get a commission for brokering a deal.  
He concluded such an agreement with CSR in respect of 
the 359 electric locomotives that had a contract value as 
you know of R18 billion.  Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:  I cannot remember what CSR contract was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And the agreement provides for 
Tequesta which was the – the company that Mr Essa was 
involved in receiving a 21% commission.   
 
Investigation 
has 
also 
revealed 
that 
Mr 
Essa 
concluded a number of these agreements including another 
20 
one with CNR in respect of the 232 diesel locomotives the 
part of the 1064 transaction where the contract value was 
R9.9 billion. 
 
So he had more than half of the 1064 locomotives 
covered by these so called BDSA’s.  You know anything 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 13 of 137 
 
about that? 
MR GAMA:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In fact and now I go outside of the 
1064 what money – the money flows evidence is showing is 
that Mr Essa had a BDSA with CSR in respect of the 359 
electric locomotives to a similar agreement with CSR in 
respect of the 95 locomotives, similar agreement in respect 
of 100 locomotives and there investigation has revealed 
that so far CSR have made kickback payments of 123 
million dollars to Gupta Enterprises.  Comment on that? 
10 
MR GAMA:  No I do not know anything about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The other thing that has emerged is 
that Mr Sharma the chairperson of the BADAC at the 
material times had a matrix of business relationships with 
Mr Essa.  You know anything about that? 
MR GAMA:  I think there was an occasion to investigate a 
relationship.  I think the board did an investigation into Mr 
Sharma. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  Related with business that was called VR 
20 
Laser. I do not know any other. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now you were – you sat on the board 
together with Mr Sharma, is that correct? 
MR GAMA:  It is not correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  Did you interact at all with Mr 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 14 of 137 
 
Sharma? 
MR GAMA:  Ja occasionally. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In what context Mr? 
MR GAMA:  He was the chair of the BADAC so from time to 
time when we went to present I was not a member of the 
board. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this is at the time where you were 
at TFR. 
MR GAMA:  I was at TFR yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  And you are correct in fact in 
10 
those minutes of the meeting of the 13 t h of June which we 
spoke of a little earlier there is reference to that to, is 
there not? 
MR GAMA:  Sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is reference in the minutes of 
the meeting of the 13 t h of June which we spoke of a little 
earlier to an investigation or issues in relation to Mr 
Sharma? 
MR GAMA:  That is correct yes.  It had not been completed 
I think at that time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had not been completed when you left/ 
MR GAMA:  No I am saying we are talking about the fact 
that it had not been completed that investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – oh okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps I could just take you at this 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 15 of 137 
 
point to Exhibit 27 you have it? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Referred to as the Transnet POI 
Reference Bundle.  Could I ask you please to turn to page 
319 part of the MNS report where they deal with a 
relationship between Mr Essa and Mr Sharma.  It is 
Transnet Bundle 6 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Myburgh.  Thank you Mr 
Myburgh did you say page 318? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page – so Transnet Bundle 6. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Exhibit BB27 page 319 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So there you see at 
paragraphs 3.1.15 and 3.1.16 their findings in relation to 
the connections between …o there you see at paragraphs 
3.1.15 
and 
3.1.16 
their 
findings 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
connections between … 
MR GAMA:  Sorry are you using the black numbers of the 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I am using the black numbers on 
the left hand side. 
20 
MR GAMA:  Oh so I am on the right number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR GAMA:  319? 
CHAIRPERSON:  319. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  319.   
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 16 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So there you would have seen the 
matrix of relationships between Mr Sharma and Mr Essa – 
you would have seen this before, correct? 
MR GAMA:  I have not applied my mind to it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR GAMA:  I have not.  Just a fleeting glance. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then the other thing that has 
emerged from the investigations that is of relevance from 
an overall perspective and this relates – this relates to the 
10 
relocation.  You – are you aware of the fact that CNR SA 
concluded a business development supply agreement with 
a company called Becks in relation to their relocation to 
Durban? 
MR GAMA:  Yes I am – I became aware of it Mr Goncalves 
of the CNR consortium came to indicated to us that there 
was such an agreement and we requested that Werksmans 
Attorneys investigate it on our behalf. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then what the evidence points to 
is that Becks obtained a commission of some R67 million 
20 
and money flows intends to deal with this transactions and 
present evidence to establish that Becks is also a Gupta 
link.  Have any comment on that? 
MR GAMA:  I am not privy to the – what you call it the 
conclusions of that investigation.  I have never seen it the 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 17 of 137 
 
conclusions of the investigation so I do not know anything 
about it but I know that when it was raised with me I – the 
first step I did investigation immediately commenced with. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what you see is this sort of 
common 
thread 
that 
runs 
throughout 
is 
really 
the 
involvement of Mr Essa – he is involved in effect in the 164 
transaction advisor contract getting 50% of the fees of 
Regiments.  The funding agreements China Development 
Bank, Trillian, the business development agreements with 
two of the OEM’s.  What connections with Mr Sharma 
10 
etcetera.  You see that common denominator or thread? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this is the person that you met in 
Dubai in January of 2016, correct? 
MR GAMA:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I ask you to go to the bundle 
where certain documents have been added. And let me 
take you to documents relating to your stay at the Oberoi 
Hotel.  Could I ask you to go to – and try and deal with 
them in chronological order so it will be easier for 
20 
everybody.  I want to start off … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Bundle 6? 
MR GAMA:  Which bundle do you want us to go to? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon Bundle 28 your 
bundle BB28.  It is Transnet Bundle 7 Chairperson. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 18 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Bundle 7?  Transnet Bundle 7?  
Transnet Bundle 7 is it here?  Oh I have got it ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could you please turn to page 335 it 
is right at the end.  When I say right at the end it is about 
three pages from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  335? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  Are you there? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Gama I am going to take you to a 
series of four or five documents – Chairperson I must place 
10 
on record in fairness to Mr Gama that as you are aware 
these documents relating to the Oberoi Hotel and this 
featured as you know in Mr Singh’s examination are part of 
the Gupta Leak documents and as you also aware there is 
a project and I actually understand you to have confirmed 
this the other day when dealing with the different witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is a project that is being 
undertaken presently within the commission to authenticate 
these various documents. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So I – I just point that out to Mr 
Gama in fairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Gama at page 335 what you 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 19 of 137 
 
see the first email from the Oberoi Dubai Hotel on the 20 t h 
of January 2016 and it is sent to ashu@sahara.co.za do 
you know who Ashu is? 
MR GAMA:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Have you heard of Ashu Chawla? 
MR GAMA:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He at a point was the CEO of Sahara 
Computers.  You want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:  No I do not know him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And the Oberoi Hotel is sending a 
10 
reservation confirmation to him in relation to you and you 
will 
see 
Reservation 
Confirmation 
your 
guest 
name 
Siyabonga Gama, you going to arrive on Friday the 22 n d of 
January and leave on Sunday the 24 t h of January.  We 
have confirmed those dates already.  Correct? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then over the page 336 you will 
see that you had been right at the bottom booked a deluxe 
suite, do you see that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go back to page 335 what you 
see is that Mr Chawla then also on the 20 t h of January 
forwards this reservation to an email address reading 
salimessa@gmail.com do you see that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 20 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it is your own testimony that Mr 
Essa assisted you in booking this accommodation. 
MR GAMA:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then the second document that I 
want to take you to please is to be found at page 328 and I 
do apologise these are out of chronological order that is 
why I am dealing with them in this way.  At 328 on the face 
of it you find an invoice from the Oberoi Hotel it refers to 
you and under that Sahara Computers.  The company is 
reflected as Sahara Computers.  On the right hand side 
10 
arrival 22 January departure 24 January.  Just before the 
double lines on the left hand side you see the word Billing.  
Opposite that it reads Entire bill to Sahara Computers and 
then *** no pre-auth *** and then the bill appears to have 
come to AED 4650.  You see that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it then appears to have been 
signed by you, would you confirm that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And says that above your signature: 
20 
“I agree that I am responsible for the 
payment of this bill in the event that it is 
not 
paid 
by 
the 
company 
from 
an 
organisation or the person indicated.” 
You see that? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 21 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And would I – is your understanding 
the same as mine that that would then be a reference in 
this case to Sahara Computers? 
MR GAMA:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  To whom would it be a reference? 
MR GAMA:  It was just – it is one of those things when you 
get to check out they show you that bill and they say sign 
here and you sign for the bill. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – well the – I think the proposition 
10 
maybe can be put this way that in the writing that appears 
immediately above your signature the reference to the 
company organisation, there must be a reference to the 
company organisation reflected in the invoice.  Now that is 
one thing.  You seem to be saying, as I understand you.  
What you are emphasising is.  You know, they put this 
maybe as you were checking out, in front of you, set aside 
and you signed it. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which does not necessarily mean that 
20 
the reference in those words to the company is not the 
reference to the company written in the invoice but may 
simple mean that you are saying:  I did not even check.  I 
just signed because it is some what you get given as you 
check out.  So. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 22 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know.  I am not putting words 
into your mouth but I want to try and distinguish between 
the two scenarios. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, as I was telling(?) Chair, they show you 
the total amount.  That is the most important thing and you 
can always check whether they did not put anything that 
you do not know of.  If the bill is what it is, you sign for it 
and I do not know people who then read that fine print but 
- may not what is written there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I can tell you that I tend to read 
quite a lot because I think that nobody will believe me 
when I say I signed without reading, as a judge.  So  
[laughs]  Normally.  And I think that would apply to 
Mr Myburgh too.  [laughs]  So I tend to read a bit and make 
sure I know what is written. 
MR GAMA:   Normally, people look at the amount whether I 
am being charged the correct amount.  In most hotels when 
you check out they let you sign something.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Myburgh. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I suppose then the question is.  
When you checked out, on the face of it, it does not appear 
that you paid this bill or did you? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I did pay for it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there is another – there should 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 23 of 137 
 
have been something else that then reflects a null balance 
because what you signed shows a balance owing of 
4 650,00.  Correct? 
MR GAMA:   It does not show a balance owing.  It just 
shows the total. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.   
MR GAMA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   It just shows how much the amount is. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
it 
says 
balance 
in 
AED 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   ...those show us the amount of the bill.  That 
is all it means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, Mr Gama.  Let us go to page 
317.  So that bill you would have signed, correct me if I am 
wrong, on the 24 t h of January when you checked out? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   24 January ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would have paid on the same 
day? 
MR GAMA:   I would have settled the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   On 24 January 2016? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 24 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And let us have a look at page 317.  
This is an invoice that is addressed from the Oberoi to 
Sahara Computers, on the face of it.  The date is 
2 February 2016.  So that is more than a week later.  And 
you will see there it lists a number of stays including 
yours.  Your name is reflected there.  Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   22 n d January to 24 January and the 
amounts tally up with the invoices 3 to 8.  It is the 
10 
4 650,00 AED.  Correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now what we also put in the bundle, 
is not necessary to go through it, is some invoices of other 
people whose name appear on that list.  Mr Koko, 
Mr Mantsha.  You know them, do you? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I know them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you then go – so that is the 
2 n d  of February 2016.  Let us go to the next document.  
That you will find at page 334.  This is some three weeks 
20 
later.  Another invoice to Sahara Computers.  And again, 
your accommodation is listed there in the amount of 
4 650,00 AED still be owing.  Correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yet you say you paid this? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 25 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I did pay it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say you paid it on the 
24 t h  of January? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have paid it with your 
...[indistinct] credit card? 
MR GAMA:   So, I do not know.  I do not want to take 
responsibility for this document because I did not write it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR GAMA:   It says invoice.  I am sure – maybe it comes 
10 
from the hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   But sometime later because I did not have – I 
could not find a copy of the invoice that I paid, I wrote to 
the hotel, probably in 2018, thereabouts or 2017.  I cannot 
remember.  I wrote to the hotel and I asked them to send 
me my invoice and they did and the invoice will show that I 
paid on the day that I left.  I do not know if my team 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you still have the invoice? 
20 
MR GAMA:   My team has got a copy of the invoice and if 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it would be important to make it 
available.   
COUNSEL:   Mr Chair, we are indeed in possession of that 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 26 of 137 
 
document.  It is perhaps something, when I do re-examine 
Mr Gama, will feature in that re-examination but I can 
confirm that there is such a document and in accordance 
with Mr Gama’s evidence, that account was settled on the 
24 t h of January 2016 and the document of the letterhead of 
the Oberoi Hotel, in fact, demonstrates and reflects a null 
balance on that very day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why has that document not been made 
available to us? 
COUNSEL:   It was most recently collated. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   I have not had sight of it before the day 
before yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, it is not an issue.  
The issue of the – I am happy to hold it over and perhaps 
have a look at it at lunchtime but I am going to deal with 
other things that relate to this invoice in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So.  But we will feed into that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  But what I do want to 
say is that if there are any documents that Mr Gama or his 
legal team have which are relevant or material to any 
aspect of the matters that he is dealing with, the sooner we 
all have those documents, the better.  Particularly because 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 27 of 137 
 
if his counsel is going to re-examine on them, there should 
be earlier on them.   
 
So I understand if it was recently obtained but if 
all arrangements can be made so that we all have them, 
just like the Legal Team makes available documents that it 
will refer Mr Gama to, the same should happen.  So that 
would be helpful.  Okay alright. 
MR GAMA:   Look, Chairperson.  This is two days ago, two 
nights ago.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR GAMA:   This document were suddenly emailed to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   These ones that Mr Myburgh is asking me to 
go through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   They were sent to us two nights ago and 
nothing else.  It just said:  Look, here is a link, open it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
MR GAMA:   So and then it came with these documents.  
There has no one been in.  There has been nothing to say 
what those documents are without ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GAMA:   ...even say there are new documents that you 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 28 of 137 
 
do not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   Two nights ago at ten in the evening, these 
documents arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  What we should 
do is.  I mean, we just need to try and share as early as we 
can and where there has not been adequate time, let us 
see how we can handle those situation.  The idea being 
that we want that to be furnished to everybody.  Okay 
alright. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chair, I just wanted to  point out. 
COUNSEL:   Sorry.  It is important that I place this on 
record.  So what Mr Gama has been moaning is what is 
contained in that second statement because this has been 
in the manner in which he has been dealt with.  I am sure 
that you will give him the opportunity to place on record 
what his concerns are but certainly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   ...there was no context to when we received 
these documentation two nights ago and that is the thing 
20 
within which he has been dealt with in these proceedings 
and he is aggrieved by that fact.  I must just put that on 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes  Mr Gama, do you feel in your 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 29 of 137 
 
evidence now that you have been able to deal adequately 
with these documents? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, it does not delineate from the fact that a 
lot of these things – the manner in the way it which 
documents are distributed.  To me, it is just designed to 
create some kind of an ambush where you do not know that 
you have a document.  You never discussed it.  But people 
who will say to you:  Oh, please have a look at this 
document.  This is the new pagination.  But they do not tell 
you there are new documents that you have never seen.   
10 
 
It is not just this matter.  There is a matter – I 
was here - I was being asked on whether I met President 
Zuma.  And last week, I received new documents which the 
Commission has had since October last year that says 
there was a function in Durban that was sponsored by 
Transnet.  But I have been asked a question beforehand 
and you cannot help, Chair, but think that you get asked 
questions and they designed, merely to just ambush you.   
 
People have documents they withhold now.  And 
then they are hoping that maybe you might say something 
20 
that would then not corroborate the information that they 
have.  This is not the only thing.  I have talked about the 
tore(?) documents in the past. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR GAMA:   The affidavit that taught(?) – had attested to 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 30 of 137 
 
which were in the possession of the Commission which 
were not been given to me which are not been given 
timeously.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR GAMA:   I can go on and on.  There are many of these 
particular things that come through.  That these – there is 
also the ...[indistinct] documents that just came through 
with this document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR GAMA:   ...that were not there before but you do not 
10 
get a warning, Chair, to say:  We have these new 
documents.  You just get given.  Or, here is your new 
bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No.  One.  Well, if you are asked 
about a document that you have not had enough time 
about, just raise that and we will look at that so that, if at 
all possible, that can be deferred so that you have had 
time to look at it to the extent that there documents that 
you have been given where you do not know what the 
context is or what the issues are about it.  You wish to be 
20 
advised.  Please say so, so that you can be advised and 
then we will do what we can to make sure that there is 
fairness.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Perhaps I could also just place 
this on record.  Of course, the Commission’s investigation 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 31 of 137 
 
is an ongoing investigation and there are various work 
streams.  I was, in fact, provided with certain of these 
documents by the Money-flows’ work stream after Mr Gama 
gave his evidence.  The other set of document, which we 
will come to now, it is a donation to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation.  Those documents were provided to me by an 
evidence leader.  I think it is called the TNA Work stream.  
So that is how we came to get them.  So, perhaps, that 
also needs to be taken into consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So sometimes documents are 
10 
within the possession of the Commission but they are not 
in a particular work stream.  They are with a different work 
stream. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one work stream gets to know about 
them ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...at a certain stage. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The other thing, which is also 
important, Chair, to bear in mind is that the relevance of 
20 
these Oberoi documents also impacted on Mr Singh’s 
evidence.  So it is important for us that Mr Gama has 
confirmed that the author - at least one of these streams.  
So they have other implications and they come to be here 
not only in relation to Mr Gama.  I think the Chair must 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 32 of 137 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but maybe you could consider of the 
future that if documents are sent there are some email or 
something that says ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Identifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what they are and where they fit into 
anything in the whole matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is a point well taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of course, Chair, if you go to the 
10 
index, you could always work out where it was before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what are the new items. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But it more – that could certainly be 
done better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we go to page 334, Mr Gama.  On 
the face of it, it appears that Mr Duduzane Zuma and then 
Mr A Gupta also stayed in that hotel after you and that 
20 
Sahara Computers was billed.  Correct, on the face of it? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I cannot talk to this document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sure. 
MR GAMA:   Its authenticity, its truthfulness.  I did not 
draw it.  And as I say, it purports that there were amounts 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 33 of 137 
 
outstanding at times when they were not.  So I do not know 
how those people work and how they deal with those 
issues but for me, it is not my place to comment about that 
document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I then take you, please, to 
page 310? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now this is a Times Live article that 
appears 
to 
have 
been 
published 
on 
the 
7 t h  of September 2017.  Did you read this ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   On what page did you say? 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Page 
317. 
 
It 
is 
250.317, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you have occasion to read this 
article in or about the time that it was published? 
MR GAMA:   I cannot recall.  There quite a lot of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you recall having been 
contacted by the journalist for comment? 
20 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The journalist appears to be Cow 
Cohen.  Can you recall that person having contacted you? 
MR GAMA:   I have spoken to so many journalists.  I 
cannot...  I cannot confirm whether I have spoken to this 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 34 of 137 
 
one or not.  I mean, I have not had time to read this 
article.  It is also one of those new documents... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us see ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   I would need time to read it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR GAMA:   I am saying I would need time to read it and 
see what it says. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, you have not read it? 
MR GAMA:   No, no.  I have not read it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  So we can deal with – could 
10 
you do that over lunchtime? 
MR GAMA:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then I will deal with that after 
lunch if that is suitable.  Let me then take you, whilst we 
are 
working 
through 
these 
new 
documents, 
to 
the 
Truham(?) document.  If we can get that out of the way.  
That you will find at page 314.   
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is a document that you have 
provided us with and it appears that there was an 
20 
investigation regarding allegation of plagiarism.  Is that 
correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, that is the document I told you about. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   That is the institution had done its own 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 35 of 137 
 
independent investigation of the matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And so they were investigating 
plagiarism?  Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   They were investigating the McKinsey 
allegations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, I see.  The first paragraph: 
“I would like to inform you of the outcome of 
the Truham(?) Investigation into the allegation 
of plagiarism against you...” 
MR GAMA:   As a result of the McKinsey – remember, the 
10 
allegation was that someone at McKinsey had made input 
into my academic work.  So what they call it – that is of – 
as a result of that.  As you read that document, it says 
that: 
“On 6 August 2018, the Truham(?) office was 
made aware of an allegation of plagiarism 
against you.  The source of allegation on the 
statement from the global consulting firm, 
McKinsey. 
We understand the statement you have been 
20 
made in response to press and social media 
coverage in South Africa on the matter...” 
 
And then they talk about the statement which is 
credited to a McKinsey spokesperson.  We have dealt with 
that at length at our last discussion. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 36 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So let us go to the decision or 
outcome.  That is at the foot of page 315.  It says under 
the heading, Decision and Outcome: 
“After full consideration of the evidence, the 
Academic Board convened by conference call 
on 
29 
May 
2019 
during 
which 
they 
unanimously agreed that no action be taken at 
this time due to inconclusive evidence...” 
 
Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, that is what it says. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then over the page: 
“However, as I hope you could understand, the 
Academic 
Board 
also 
agreed 
that Truham 
should 
reserve 
the 
right 
to 
re-open 
the 
investigation should the South African Police 
investigation 
prompted 
by 
McKinsey, 
Section 34(1) one filing, yield a final report 
which includes inculpatory evidence specific to 
your Capstone Project academic work not 
previously 
available 
to 
Truham’s 
20 
Investigation...” 
 
Correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to ask you a few 
questions about the next paragraph. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 37 of 137 
 
“In making this decision, the Academic Board 
specifically 
noted 
evidence 
related 
to 
Ms Jacky Vermose(?) role in the project and 
considered whether or not her contributions 
were 
in 
violation 
of 
Truham’s 
policy 
on 
editorial assistance...” 
 
So I think previously they had spoken about the 
fact that a woman assisted you to some extent with the 
editing.  Is that then her name, Jacky Vermose? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then the next sentence says: 
“They 
also 
noted 
evidence 
relating 
to 
Mr Spencer Horne, any role he may have 
played and considered whether or not he 
assisted in any way that would have been in 
violation of Truham’s policies...” 
 
Who is Mr Spencer Horne? 
MR GAMA:   Horne is a McKinsey Consultant that was 
working with SAGA. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what role did he play? 
20 
MR GAMA:   No, that was a document that he sent to us. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.   
MR GAMA:   Which was a research document that was – I 
think 
it 
was 
either 
a 
Pricewaterhouse 
or 
McKinsey 
document.  Some research that was related to what we are 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 38 of 137 
 
doing, to say he could also look at this as part of what he 
would cite if you thought it was relevant.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I want to take you to the JZ 
Foundation documents.   
MR GAMA:   I do not think we can discuss those, these 
documents that I have asked for that I have not yet 
received. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR GAMA:   But we can if you wish.  Maybe I can then tell 
you ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR GAMA:   ...at that point if it has got a bearing or not on 
us. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let me deal with that in 
fairness to you.  Yesterday, the doc – you are right.  You 
asked for certain documents and we made a request on 
Transnet.  What we received yesterday and I do not know if 
you have seen it.  Is a statement by Amverno Makungha.  
Have you seen that?  If you go to page 338, right at the 
back.  Perhaps I can take you through it first because what 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   338? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   338.  I think it is the second last 
page, Mr Gama.   
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 39 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is headed – and it is a short 
document.  So let me take you through it and then we can 
work backwards.  It says” 
“Response to the judicial service commission 
inquiring on state capture on Transnet support 
of 
the 
former 
President, 
Jacob 
Zuma’s 
events...” 
 
And she then sets about answering the questions 
or the things that you had asked for.  Firstly, question:  
The programme for the Youth Day event.  She says that: 
10 
“Transnet’s 
Corporate 
Affairs 
sent 
a 
representative to support the event and for 
monitoring if the event took place. 
Hard copy programmes are distributed on the 
day of the event. 
Corporate Affairs does not have copies...” 
 
The next question that was posed or document 
that was asked for - was the report from Transnet Group 
Communication on the function. 
 
She says: 
20 
“Transnet received publicity through the event 
since Corporate Affairs ensured that such 
events should have the Transnet logo featured 
on the branding materials such as banners, 
programmes, 
including 
on 
plasma 
screens 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 40 of 137 
 
used in the events, programmes and banners. 
Transnet ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   I can see the document.  I do not think there 
is a need for us to read the whole thing and maybe you can 
ask what you want to ask. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I would like to go through it, if I 
may? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   She goes on to say: 
“Transnet was also recognised during the 
10 
programme as one of the donors. 
Most of the times when I attended, the event 
would be well-attended with strong media 
coverage...” 
 
Then you had asked about any photography from 
the aforementioned function.  She says that: 
“Corporate Affairs did not procure the services 
of a photographer for these events. 
The prominent department that captured the 
event was colleagues from the Government 
20 
Communication and Information System...” 
MR GAMA:   Sorry, Mr Myburgh, through you, Chair.  In 
any – we have been told that there were – there was an 
SABC video or something of that nature.  So we wanted a 
video on the photography because – ja, they were saying 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 41 of 137 
 
that 
there 
is 
somebody 
that 
they 
could 
not 
see 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   ...in sitting on a table somewhere.  So I 
thought I would assist the Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   ...in terms of identifying that person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   ...but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that would be important. 
10 
MR GAMA:   But that be video has not been forthcoming.  
So if we can be given that video ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   ...one can be able to assist the Commission in 
terms of who that person was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Is that a video that Transnet, as 
far you know, should have or SABC? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, Chair, we will come to the 
video now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is an affidavit on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GAMA:   The Commission has got the video. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in the documents that was given 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 42 of 137 
 
to Mr Gama, it includes that affidavit on – someone 
actually looked at the video.  And then having received 
those documents, he then made a request for certain 
further documents and one of those requests was any 
photography.  So we have a video, as I understood it, this 
relates to photography.   
 
Then what this lady goes on to deal with...  
Sorry, if I could just...  Question(?) full(?) report on 
Ms Anya ...[indistinct] Youth Day event in relation to 
represented Transnet, the aforesaid event.  Well, she 
10 
seems to have answered that.  She says: 
“The attendees at the Annual Presidential Golf 
Challenge were invited by the Department of 
Public Services and Administration as the 
coordinating department. 
The 
Corporate 
Affairs 
Department 
was 
responsible for the branding part of the event. 
The 
attendees 
were 
invited 
through 
the 
Coordinating Department...” 
 
So would that been the latest document?  Let us go 
20 
back to the documents that you were given on the 6 April 
which then gave rise to your request that we have dealt 
with.  Those documents we find commencing at page 
250.16 and, Mr Gama, to shorten my examination of you, I 
am going to take you to what I consider to be the key 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 43 of 137 
 
documents, they are also not in perfect chronological 
order.   
 
Let us start with page 250.53.  You will see that, if 
one tracks the chronology, things seems to have begun 
with this request for donations towards the Jacob G Zuma 
Foundation by this 01.12 on the 3 January 2015.  Do you 
see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it was addressed to you and it 
says in the first paragraph: 
10 
“On behalf of His Excellency, the President of the 
Republic of South Africa, Mr Jacob Zuma, we would 
like to offer you in your capacity as Acting CEO of 
Transnet the opportunity to contribute towards the 
Jacob G Zuma Foundation Youth Day event which is 
to be held at the Durban ICC on Saturday 20 June 
2015.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you then go to page 51 you will 
20 
see that there is memorandum dated the 8 June 2015 
which you signed on the 12 June 2015, that you see at the 
foot of page 52 and ultimately what was approved was the 
recommendation at paragraph 12: 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 44 of 137 
 
“It is recommended that the Acting GCE approves 
for Transnet: 
1. To pay a donation towards the Jacob G Zuma 
Foundation Youth Day event.” 
Goes on to describe it. 
2. That corporate and public affairs coordinates  
Transnet’s participation including branding. 
3. Acting GCE recommends stakeholders to attend 
the event.” 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Gama, can I ask this 
question?  I expected that this recommendation would also 
recommend the amount of the donation that they were 
recommending that you should – that Transnet should give 
– but I do not see on the recommendation – I do not know 
whether someone in the …[intervenes] 
MR GAMA:   Just two lines above that, under financial 
implications, 
they 
have 
written 
an 
amount 
there, 
20 
Chairperson.  Okay, no maybe it is just the …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 10.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I can see 10, I did not see it before, 
I can see 10 now.  Maybe it is just the use of the article “a” 
in the recommendation, to pledge “a” donation as opposed 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 45 of 137 
 
to the donation which is mentioned above.  Okay, but the – 
your understanding is that the recommendation was that 
you should, as Acting Group CEO of Transnet, donate that 
amount that is written in paragraph 10. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that you sign on the 12 June 
2015.  If I could then ask you to go to a letter written to 
Securus(?) on that day.  That you find at page 49.  There 
you will see …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 49? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   49, yes, Chairperson.  There they – 
you write back to them: 
“Thank you for inviting Transnet to support…” 
Etcetera. 
“We confirm that Transnet will partner with your 
foundation and pledge a donation of 500 000 and 
my colleague…” 
A lady we have dealt with or whose memo we have dealt 
with. 
20 
“…will interact with your office.” 
And you sign that on the 12 June 2015.  Correct. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then if I can take you please to 
page 26.  So that is 12 June.  On page 26 one finds an 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 46 of 137 
 
invoice from the Jacob G Zuma Foundation dated the 17 
June reflecting an amount due of R500 000 and it is sign 
p.p. on behalf of Ms Dudu Myeni the then executive 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Jacob 
Zuma 
Foundation, 
is 
that 
correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then the event presumably we 
know occurs on the 20 June.  If I could just take you to 
what happens after that.  Would you please go to page 28? 
MR GAMA:   28? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   28, yes.  Here is a memorandum that 
is addressed to you dated the 30 July 2015.  If you go to 
page 29 you will see that you signed it, I will just ask you 
to confirm, on the 4 August 2015.  Would you confirm that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what you were approving, if I 
read this correctly, Mr Gama, was the recommendation that 
it is recommended that the Acting GCE assign the attached 
sponsorship/donation 
contract 
or 
the 
Jacob 
G 
Zuma 
Foundation, is that right? 
20 
MR GAMA:   The contract, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the contract was entered into 
afterwards. 
MR GAMA:    Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now that contract you find at page – 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 47 of 137 
 
or let us call it an agreement at page 30 and you will see 
at page 32, clause 1.9, there is the donation of 500 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you should go to 30 and then 
you move onto another page, is that right? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the agreement commences at 
page 30 and I had taken Mr Gama to page 32. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where at clause 1.9 there is 
reference to the R500 000, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if I could take you please to 
page 34 at clause 7.2: 
“The Jacob G Zuma Foundation Youth Day event:  
(a) 
1 x table of 10 Transnet guests at the event. 
(b) 
The Acting GCE will be seated at the main 
table with the host, His Excellency President G 
Jacob Zuma. 
(c) 
An opportunity for Acting GCE to address the 
honoured guests and student.” 
That is what you were getting for – in part for your 
20 
R500 000, correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at 9.1: 
“For this duration of this agreement Transnet shall 
be named as a sponsor and/or donor on all publicity 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 48 of 137 
 
material or media related to this agreement which 
shall include media interviews, newspaper articles, 
flyers, posters, banners, etcetera .” 
Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So we have seen then that on the 4 
August you authorised the conclusion of this contract. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now just incidentally, with reference 
to clause 7.2 did you attend this Youth Day event, were 
10 
you seated at the table with President Jacob Zuma? 
MR GAMA:   No, the Acting GCE attended. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR GAMA:   The Acting GCE attended whoever it was at 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second?  Are you at page 42?  
What page are you? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   34. 
CHAIRPERSON:   34? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Alright, what – your answer, 
Mr Gama, was that the Acting Group CEO of Transnet was 
sitting at the table with Mr Jacob Zuma? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, he attended, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Were you not the Acting Group 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 49 of 137 
 
CEO at the time? 
MR GAMA:   Not on the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not on the particular day?  Okay, so you 
were at Acting Group CEO but on the day somebody else 
was acting in your position? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  And who was that? 
MR GAMA:   And that is what I wanted to try and help the 
Commission with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
MR GAMA:   Because, you know, when people say there is 
an identified black man sitting on the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   But maybe I could identify him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GAMA:   Because he must have been that person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you cannot remember his name or 
you can? 
MR GAMA:   No, no, I just suspect that it could it have 
been any of three people who are Durban-based Transnet 
20 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but you are saying you yourself did 
not attend the function. 
MR GAMA:   No, no, I was out of the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 50 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So did you – was someone whilst 
you were out of the country then appointed formally to act 
as the Group Chief Executive, it would have been that 
person? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it would have been one of three 
people, who were they? 
MR GAMA:   Mr Socikwa was based in Durban and he was 
the CE of Port Terminals so I suspect that it could have 
either been him or his COO Mr Gwala or one of his General 
10 
Managers Mr Ndlovu.  Those are the people that I 
remember have represented me in one or the other 
functions in Durban when I could not attend.   
CHAIRPERSON:   For the transcribers, Mr Socikwa, would 
be S-o-c-i-k-a, is that right? 
MR GAMA:   Socikwa, S-o-c-i-k-w-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  S-o-c-i-k-w-a and the other one 
would be Mr Gwala, G-w-a-l-a and then Mr Ndlovu and I 
think everybody knows how to spell Ndlovu, I would hope 
so.  Ja.  Okay, alright, Mr Myburgh? 
20 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:   Mr Chair, if you will permit me.  It 
seems a little misleading to me, this line of questioning 
and I will tell you why.  Mr Myburgh finds it appropriate 
simply to refer to the provisions of clause 4 of the 
agreement and I was waiting for him to make a reference to 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 51 of 137 
 
the so-called annexure A and it would not be correct to 
simply suggest to Mr Gama without making reference the 
contents of annexure A and I have that letter which seems 
to constitute annexure A, what this donation was to be 
used for and so it is not simple, that one must understand 
that annexure A is what is referred to in clause 4.  So if Mr 
Myburgh is not aware of the existence of the letter which 
constitutes annexure A, I am happy to give it to him, but in 
fairness to Mr Gama because you see, annexure A makes it 
clear what that donation was aimed at. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Annexure A in the bundle that you are 
talking about? 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:   Mr Chair, it is annexure A to this 
very agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:   And in fairness that is what ought 
to be put to Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:   If Mr Myburgh does not do it then I 
will do it in re-examination. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can do it in re-examination, let 
us allow Mr Myburgh to run his questioning the way he 
plans to.  He might be tending to refer to annexure A later 
than now, in terms of timing.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  I understand my 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 52 of 137 
 
learned friend says he has annexure A.  Perhaps it is 
something that I can also get from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is not here? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:   Part of the Commission’s bundle, 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Alright, so that was 
on the 4 August.  If we go to page 28 – sorry, we have 
10 
dealt with 28.  If you go to page 25 you will see then that 
also on the 4 August you approved that payment, is that 
right? 
MR GAMA:   Page 20…? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 25, so you approved the 
payment of the R500 000 on the 4 August. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if we go to page 40 you will 
see that the contract is signed on the 13 August, but it is 
not signed by you.  Do you recognise who signed that? 
20 
MR GAMA:   Ja, it is signed by – it says M Sekonyela, the 
general manager in the Operating Public Affairs. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then finally to conclude the 
chronology, on the 19 August, if you could go please to 
page 24, payment is then effected. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 53 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Page 20…? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   24, Mr Gama.  Confirm that? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I can see it, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I want to take you to the 
affidavit that you find at page 16. 
MR GAMA:   One six? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One six.  The affidavit of Simphiwe 
Madlala, a forensic investigator with the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is Simphiwe? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Madlala. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Madlala, ja.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Forensic investigator with the 
Commission and he says at paragraph 3: 
“The purpose of this affidavit is to record the 
analysis conducted on the video footage provided 
by the SABC to the Commission relating to the 20 
June 2015 Youth Day event organised by the JGZ 
Foundation.” 
And then if I could just take you to a few paragraphs of 
this.  At paragraph 7.2, says that: 
20 
“In instances where the podium appears the footage 
shows the person or persons who addressed the 
event with the background JGZ Foundation logos 
appearing behind then.” 
7.3  
The full stage from where speakers addressed the 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 54 of 137 
 
audience is visible on the footage.  I can confirm 
that the only branding and logos visible on the 
stage are those of the Jacob Zuma Foundation.  
There are none for Transnet. 
7.4 
The footage does not show any Transnet logo or 
other branding anywhere at the event. 
7.5 
The footage shows almost half of the President’s 
table. 
7.6 
At the former President’s table he was seated next 
to a woman who I am unable to identify on his left 
10 
side, probably the former Premier of KZN, Mr Senzo 
Mchunu seated on the right hand side. 
7.7 
I could identify the following other persons at what 
appears to be at the former President’s table.” 
And then he lists a, b, c and d. 
7.8 
I was not able to identify Mr Gama seated at what 
appears to be the former President’s table nor 
anywhere else on the footage.  I am able to identify 
Mr Gama because I have seen him before in the 
media.” 
20 
So your – as I understand it, your answer to that is that the 
person who was Acting in the GCE in your stead attended 
this function, is that correct, Mr Gama? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 55 of 137 
 
7.9 
The 
footage 
shows 
three 
guest 
speakers 
who 
addressed the event including the former President, 
Ms Duduzile Myeni and Ms Bathabile Dlamini.  
Another gentleman who I cannot identify facilitated 
the introduction of students to the event.  Some of 
the students appeared on the stage and inter alia 
passed their gratitude to the former President and 
the Foundation.  The footage does not show Mr 
Gama addressing the event on that day.” 
Do you know whether the person who went in your place 
10 
would have addressed this event as you were supposed to 
have done of as the Acting Chief Executive was supposed 
to have done? 
MR GAMA:   That is why I asked for a report from the 
corporate affairs department of Transnet.  I do not know 
whether – what Transnet has given appears to look like a 
report.  Normally there should be a report.  That report 
would answer those questions and unfortunately, I had 
delegated that to some else, I was not available at that 
time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   When somebody has been acting in your 
position when you are out of the country for whatever 
period would they have reported back to you on a function 
such as this to say I attended that function on your behalf 
or something like that and it went well, everything went in 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 56 of 137 
 
accordance with the agreement or would they not? 
MR GAMA:   Normally when …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or they would give you a report, for 
instance? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, when somebody has been acting they will 
give a report that also gives you a summary of the 
significant decisions that they took.  So within that context 
they would then also give that report.  All of those types of 
reports would be freely available at Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But from your memory you cannot 
10 
remember whether he said or she said he or she was 
there?  He attended, you cannot remember, you would 
need the report to remind you. 
MR GAMA:   I thought the report would have assisted the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   In terms of whatever it is that Commission 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   But I am not sure what needle in the haystack 
20 
we are looking for here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, but what I am asking is, from 
memory you cannot remember whether you told you that 
they intended or not? 
MR GAMA:   No, they wrote in the report that the Acting 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 57 of 137 
 
GCE attended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MR GAMA:   They did write in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR GAMA:   So that is why I asked for the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, a request – that request has 
been made, Mr Myburgh, to get the report? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We requested that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then what we got back was this 
10 
– effectively a report, answer to questions by Nomvela 
Makunga. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   She being the corporate affairs 
person who says that she attended this function or this 
Youth Day event.  She was asked who attended and 
represented Transnet.  She gave an answer, she does not 
say 
Mr 
Gama 
did 
and 
nor 
does 
she 
say 
that 
his 
replacement, for want of a description, did.  So Mr Gama’s 
request was made on Transnet, DCJ, and this is what we 
20 
got from her, herself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Okay, no, that is fine.  I 
guess that maybe she should be asked to depose to an 
affidavit and answer specific questions or she should be 
called, if possible, because it should not take long. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 58 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, in the light of what Mr Gama 
has said, further investigation is required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And certainly, if he can assist us by 
having a look at the video footage we can also – I presume 
that can also be arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Maybe what you can also do, 
Mr Gama, if you can tell us now, the names of the three 
possible persons, Mr Socikwa, what his name is and Mr 
Gwala and Mr Ndlovu so that, if need be, the Commission 
10 
can try and get in touch with them to see who of them was 
acting in your place. 
MR GAMA:   Ja.  Chair, maybe to avoid speculation 
because I also do not want to speculate like other people 
who come to the Commission here and speculate.  If the 
Commission could provide me with the video I could be of 
assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Immediately? 
MR GAMA:   The Commission has go the video from which 
Mr Madlala wrote this affidavit? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   Yes.  He said …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How quickly can that be done, Mr 
Myburgh do you know? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 59 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   How quickly can that be done, do you 
know? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I do not, I was provided, as I have 
already said, with this information by the TNA stream.  I 
can make enquiries in relation to that over lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But in any event Mr Gama has given 
the three names already, as I understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright and then at paragraph 7.11 it 
10 
says in the last line that: 
“Mr Siyabonga Gama was never introduced as a 
guest at the event.” 
Well, I presume from what you are telling us that that 
makes 
sense, 
subject 
to 
investigation. 
Can 
I 
then 
…[intervenes] 
MR GAMA:   Ja, Mr Gama was out of the country on that 
day. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Whereabouts were you? 
MR GAMA:   Sorry? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Whereabouts were you? 
MR GAMA:   Well, probably with some comrades in St 
Petersburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I then, before I go to a more 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 60 of 137 
 
substantial topic let me, whilst we are dealing with the new 
documents, let us go to the one right at the end, page 340.  
This is an affidavit from Susan Albertyn, dealing with your 
cost payment and she says at paragraph 5: 
“Transnet’s 
finance 
department 
searched 
the 
Transnet records and requested Standard Bank, 
Transnet’s bankers at the time, to search its 
records for any payment to Transnet by Mr Gama in 
December 2009.  No evidence of any payment could 
be found in Transnet’s records or by Standard 
10 
Bank.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   I commented on this on Monday but I can 
comment again.  The bank could not go back as far back as 
2009 in terms of its records so if the bank had been able to 
go back we could have been able to find that but the bank 
statements that I could get, I think they only go as far back 
as November 2010 which is a year that we could not get.  
 
In as far as Transnet records maybe it is one of 
those miscellaneous amounts that it is hardly able to see 
20 
because it is probably too small for Transnet but if we had 
gone to my bank statements it would be easily found. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So let us then turn to the 
3.3 notice that was issued to you in relation to Ms Gigaba’s 
evidence.  Please would you go to page 124?  Are you 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 61 of 137 
 
there? 
MR GAMA:   250.124? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.124,  yes.  So you were issues 
with this 3.3 notice and attached to that was the first page 
of Ms Gigaba’s affidavit and then the portion relevant to 
you, those you find at page 128.   
Now the first paragraph of relevance is paragraph 31.2.  
What is reflected there is that she says that Mr Gigaba 
also told me that Siyabonga Gama would be appointed as 
the 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
of 
Transnet 
before 
the 
10 
appointment was made.   Now Chairperson you will correct 
me if my recollection is wrong, I think you could hear this 
witness better than I could late on Monday, but as I recall 
her evidence on questioning by you Chairperson she 
indicated that this was actually supposed to be a reference 
to Mr Gama being reinstated as the Chief Executive Officer 
at TFR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is what she clarified ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I don’t know if you want to comment 
on that at all, so her evidence was that she had heard that 
20 
you would be reinstated before you were, I think that is her 
crisp summary,  have you got any comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   I don’t know Chair, I mean what is it that I 
could comment on, I mean I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 62 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at paragraph 31.3 Mr 
Gigaba also told me that he intended to speak to Mr Gama 
to appoint his sister, Ms Gugu Gigama, to Transnet.  To the 
best of my knowledge Ms Gugu Gigama was appointed and 
remains in the employ of Transnet.  Do you want to 
comment on that?  
MR GAMA:   Ja, I don’t know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR GAMA:   I don’t know about this, I don’t know anything 
about this. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Could I ask you please 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you were reading from 
paragraph – Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   31.3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know a person called Gugu 
Gigaba by any chance? 
MR GAMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know her.   Were you ever 
approached 
by 
anybody 
to 
appoint 
or 
facilitate 
the 
20 
appointment of Mr Gigaba’s sister to Transnet, or TFR? 
MR GAMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, let’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would not be in a position to say 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 63 of 137 
 
whether or not such a person was employed by Transnet or 
a division of Transnet at some stage or another, you would 
not know that? 
MR GAMA:   No, it is not in my personal knowledge Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, well let’s go please to page 
250.104. 
MR GAMA:  104.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So on page 104 on the face of it you 
find three emails, starting at the bottom, from Gugu Gigaba 
10 
dated the 15 t h of April 2016 it seems to be addressed to a 
person having the email address Nkunezi Gigaba and it 
says please find attached the CV as requested, do you see 
that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then the next email is from Malusi 
Gigaba and you see it is the address Nkunezi Gigaba so 
presumably the first email went to him.  The second emails 
is Malusi Gigaba dated the 25 t h of June to Mr – is that Mr 
Buthelezi, Halomoli Buthelezi was he your Chief Operating 
20 
Officer? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it says here with the issue – 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 64 of 137 
 
could you translate that for us? 
MR GAMA:   No, no, no I am not your translator Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Perhaps 
you 
could 
assist 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if Mr Gama won’t assist “herewith 
the issue [speaking in vernacular] well I guess technically 
we should get a translator who will translate it but 
basically it saying here is the issue that we talked about or 
that I talked about.  Okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ashange is written there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The issue we talked about just 
incidentally Chairperson when I was going through these 
documents with the investigators one of them typed these 
words into Google translate and there appeared “the issue 
we had talked about”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Okay, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so that is an email from Mr 
Gigaba to your CEOO, Mr Buthelezi and then what you see 
20 
at the top is an email from Ravi Naya who was he? 
MR GAMA:   He was the CEO of TFR. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The CFO?  And he writes to Mr 
Buthelezi and re ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh he was the CEO of TFR? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 65 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After he had moved to Group CEO of 
Transnet? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he writes to Mr Buthelezi and he 
says “thanks Chief”, do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now do I understand you to say you 
know nothing about the fact that your COO was dealing 
10 
with this? 
MR GAMA:  No I don’t.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did he not speak to you about it? 
MR GAMA:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then if you go to page 105 there 
is a request to appoint Ms Gigaba to a position, is that 
correct?  It is a bit difficult to read but the purpose of the 
memo says, the purpose of the submission is to request 
the approval of the Chief Operating Officer, Transnet, to 
appoint and I presume that is Ms Gigaba, to the position of 
20 
Manager Continuous Improvement Factor from 1 February 
2017 via – and I don’t know what is missing there, 
appointment process, do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what the recommendation 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 66 of 137 
 
reflects at page 106, paragraph 12, it is recommended that 
the Chief Operating Officer and here you see it better, 
approve the appointment of Ms Gigaba to the position of 
Manager Continuous Improvement in the Organisational 
Development & Performance Department via the Executive 
Appointment Process, subject to the outcome of the 
necessary Transnet Human Capital processes. 
 
Now what is the Executive Appointment Process Mr 
Gama?  On the face of it ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   That’s where they appoint persons without 
10 
having to go through the external advertising process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it is not a competitive process in 
other words? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, it was where if for instance you find 
somebody with a particular fleet of skills that you have 
been looking for and you have got the CV and it talks to 
what you want you can then do it via that type of process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is it Mr Myburgh, where does it 
say, what does it say? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So at the end of paragraph 12, at 
20 
page 106 it talks of the Executive appointment process 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is recommended that the Chief 
Operating Officer Transnet approve the appointment of Ms 
Gugu Gigaba to the position of Manager Continuous 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 67 of 137 
 
Improvement 
in 
the 
Organisational 
Development 
and 
Performance Department via the Executive Appointment 
Process subject to the outcome of the necessary Transnet 
Human Capital processes.   Oh, so it is the Executive 
Appointment Process that you were asking about?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so Mr Gama your answer is that 
that is a process that enables or that dispenses with a 
competitive process for the position. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, it dispenses with the external advertising. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, but internal advertising does it 
require that? 
MR GAMA:    You can still interview the people but you use 
the knowledge that you have which is the CV in terms of 
saying, identifying the talent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so what I want to understand 
because you didn’t just say it dispenses with advertising, 
you said external advertising, so I am trying to see whether 
it doesn’t require external advertising but it does require 
that internally they should be made you just meant and 
20 
there should be competition within. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, normally but it is not – there could be 
exceptions, normally when you appoint people externally 
you would have exhausted the internal advertising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Processes ja, ja, okay so generally 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 68 of 137 
 
speaking even with this process it is expected that there 
would be an exhaustion of internal competition. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whether you go outside or you don’t 
go outside but there would have been that internal 
competition. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GAMA:    But sometimes also Chair there are specific 
streams of talent or capability which we know that they are 
10 
scarce skills like engineering or certain ...[indistinct] skills 
that through there is the human resources people are 
aware that those are scarce skills, for instance it is difficult 
nowadays to find a diesel mechanic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  I thought at some stage there were 
lots of those in South Africa. 
MR GAMA:   Yes there were lots but there has not been a 
lot of intake in Technikons and those types of places for 
those kinds of skills and then we have been promoting for 
instance that we will find young people who want to train 
20 
as diesel mechanics because a lot of the young people 
nowadays they want to use the laptops, IT, but we still 
have diesel trains that we will be running for the next 30 
years and if there isn’t anyone who is coming through it 
becomes a problem, so that is why we started the 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 69 of 137 
 
academies to try and deal with these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja, so you say there are – there 
would 
be 
certain 
skills 
that 
the 
Human 
Resources 
Department for example would know are difficult to find. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that in regard to those 
skills then there can be an appointment without even 
internal competition or were you just making the point? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, there can be an appointment without even 
the internal ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Internal competition. 
MR GAMA:   ...competition yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the basis that we know these skills 
are scarce, I guess that they would know that they are not 
inside these skills, ja. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, because all the time there’s an audit of 
the skills that they have and they know what they are 
looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   Mr Myburgh?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson I see that it one o’clock, 
20 
perhaps this is a convenient time to break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us take the lunch break and we 
will resume at two o’clock.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 70 of 137 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama could I ask you please just 
to go to page 250.112.   You will see that Ms Gigaba was 
then employed in a letter of appointment or offer of 
appointment was made to her on the 26 t h of January, do 
you see that at page 112? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know whether she was then 
10 
employed?  
MR GAMA:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you ever meet Gugu Gigaba? 
MR GAMA:   No, I do not know her. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR GAMA:   I never met her. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, then I would like to go to the 
Times Live article please and that you will find…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am sorry, so Mr Gama, somebody 
who is appointed under this process that we talked about, 
20 
which does not necessarily require outside advertisement, I 
think that is what you said.  If it is somebody who is not 
coming from within the organisation, do you know how they 
would normally find such a person or whether there might 
be somebody in the department who is aware that there is 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 71 of 137 
 
a position that requires the skills and they know, somebody 
has got those skills they talk to them or do you know 
whether the – it is a situation where people just write and 
say, I have got this qualifications if there is position for 
me.   
I 
am 
just 
wondering 
if 
there 
has 
been 
no 
advertisement how somebody gets to know that there is 
such a position in a big organisations such as Transnet 
and its divisions? 
MR GAMA:   No, there are many ways and in terms of how 
10 
it could happen, sometimes you get referrals, for instance, 
when I look at this particular one, it looks like it is 
something which was in the total quality management 
space, which is the links six sigma.   
It is around improvement of processes and trying to 
make sure that you have less waste, and all of that, at 
some point, it became a very important aspect in terms of 
the kind of work that they were doing, so process 
improvement, continuous improvement was key.  
And then there were a lot of people that we were 
20 
able to get from outside it and there were specific 
manufacturing 
organisations 
that 
were 
targeted, 
like 
NAMPAC, the breweries…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which could help people with such 
things. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 72 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Which had these kinds of skills Mondi, Sappi 
all of those so - and then, once you had some of those 
people who come in, some of them then recommended 
others. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GAMA:   That they had worked with tote say look are 
you still looking for more people, we also know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Myburgh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  I would like to 
return to the Times Live article that you found at page 
250.310.  Now Chairperson our learned friends have 
provided us with a copy of the invoice that we spoke about.  
Could I hand – and we have made copies, could I hand it 
up? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have put handwritten pagination as 
250.341.  So it will come right - but at the end of the 
bundle we will obviously add it formally to the bundle in 
20 
due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, but in the meantime you said 
we must go to what page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   310, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 73 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.310.  Mr Gama we - your invoice 
we have been provided with will be added to the bundle 
right at the end, you have a copy in front of you do you 
want to say anything about it now before we go to the 
article? 
MR GAMA:   No, I think if you look at the invoice it will say 
to you, it will show you all of those numbers and then at 
the end of the bottom there it will say 24/01/16 which is the 
date on which I left.  It will say paid, so I think that will 
indicate that when I left that place I paid for it, but I did 
10 
just ask the hotel to send me a copy and this is the copy 
that they have sent because I did not have a copy. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps I could just - and obviously 
I need to study this document but if you compare it to 328 
perhaps you could do that now. 
MR GAMA:   Three? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Three, two, eight. 
MR GAMA:   Twenty-eight. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see that if you compare 328 to this 
document on the right hand side, it ends after rate.  So you 
20 
do not have a printed on date nor the cashier, nor the 
page.  Does your document 341 does it reflect the date 
upon which it was printed? 
MR GAMA:   The date when they printed it? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 74 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   I do not see anything on the invoice itself.  It 
probably will be in the email that they sent to me in terms 
of when they sent it to me, when I requested for it.  I do 
not see any dates there it just shows the arrival date, 
arrival time and the departure time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright well let us perhaps deal with 
that in the context of the Times Live article at 310. 
MR GAMA:   And in fact I think it is slightly different in the 
sense that on that - on the other one it just says departure 
I think it is just a custom number they just put 12, here it 
10 
says 823, so which would have been more live document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, what did you say? 
MR GAMA:   I am saying if you look at the one on 328 
versus 341 at departure the only different that I see there 
is that the time, it has got the time as well. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ah. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the times for departure are different 
in regard to the two. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the time for arrival seems to be the 
20 
same on both. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so if we then go to 310 and I 
take you through this article if a may and ask you for your 
comments along the way.  So it starts off by saying or it is 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 75 of 137 
 
headed Transnet CEO Dubai hotel stay, how Gupta’s got 
the bill? And it starts off by saying: 
“Two months before being permanently appointed as 
Transnet Group CEO Siyabonga Gama CEO enjoyed 
a two night stay at the five star Oberoi Hotel in 
Dubai apparently courtesy of the Gupta family.  
Gama has confirmed meeting key Gupta Lieutenant 
Salim Essa during the stay but denies that the 
Gupta’s paid for him.” 
Is that correct?  
10 
MR GAMA:   Yes.  
“The leaks Gupta emails have revealed a booking 
confirmation email to Gupta owned Sahara systems 
chief executive, Ash Chawla under Gama’s name.” 
We have seen that, correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Chawla then forwarded the email to  
long-time Gupta family associate Essa, who until 
recently was a 60% majority shareholder of Trillian 
Capital Partners, financing consulting firm that 
20 
netted 
millions 
in 
contracts 
with 
State 
owned 
entities Transnet and Eskom.” 
Do you have any comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   Comment on the paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I suppose what we have seen 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 76 of 137 
 
is that Chawla then did forward the emails to Essa, that we 
have seen. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I have seen that the forwarding of the 
email.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Trillian was formed when CEO Eric  
Wood broke away from his partners at Regiments 
Capital company, which already had established 
business links with State owned companies.” 
Did you ever know that that is how Trillian was formed with 
Mr Wood breaking away from Regiments? 
10 
MR GAMA:   I think it is things that we came to 
understand.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR GAMA:   There was a session from Regiments that was 
asked in favour of Trillian at the point when it happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Wood last month bought Essa’s 
shares in Trillian that would have been August 2017. 
“But when confronted with allegations that Gupta’s 
or their associate had picked up the tab Gama 
insisted he had paid his own way.” 
20 
Is that what you said?  
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Gama also provided an invoice 
which  
he claimed to be from the Oberoi and which is 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 77 of 137 
 
stamped paid.  The invoice does not show the 
hotel's name, does not say who settled the bill and 
was printed in June 2017 a year and a half after he 
stayed at the Oberoi Hotel and around the same 
time he was approached for comment by Times Live 
for the first time.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I did not have a copy of the bill.  So I 
approached the hotel to send me, I just gave them the 
dates when I was there. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but this paragraph reflects that 
you provided the journalist with an invoice. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, it could be this invoice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But how can I be that invoice 
because it is recorded here unless it's wrong, that the 
invoice does not show the hotel's name. Does not say you 
settled the bill and was printed in June 2017. 
MR GAMA:   He probably got it wrong. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, do I understand that you say 
that you sent this invoice 250.341 to the journalist? 
20 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right?  
MR GAMA:   Yes, there is not any other.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “The leaked emails reviewed 
however  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 78 of 137 
 
that a month after Gama stay in February 2016 the 
Oberoi emailed Chawla’s a statement for Sahara 
Computers outstanding account.” 
I think we have seen that, correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, we have seen that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “On the account Gama’s bill is listed  
as 
unpaid, 
including 
that 
of 
Denel’s 
Board 
Chairperson Mr Dan Mantsha and Eskom head of 
generation Matshela Koko.  The amount is the same 
as on the invoice Gama provided.” 
10 
We have seen that, correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes we saw that this morning.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, can go back to the invoice 
before one, the journalist there says that the invoice that 
she is talking about or he is talking about was stamped 
paid. I see the words paid here, but I do not think that is 
stamped paid. 
Can any of you see stamped paid or a stamp with 
paid because I think that is what I expected somewhere it 
20 
says stamped paid. 
MR GAMA:   I also did not - this one has got the hotels 
names so I do not know how they would say it did not have 
the hotel name.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 79 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   So it is inconsistency and so one cannot talk 
on behalf of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if you look at the invoice there is 
no stamped paid.  Then there is an error because there is 
the hotel name and then the invoice that the journalist had 
according to this paragraph was printed in June 2017.  Can 
you see that 341 was printed in June 2017? 
MR GAMA:   I cannot see any dates on that but I do have 
the actual email that was sent to me, so I do not have the 
10 
dates on here, I do not know where the person gets the 
dates from. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When we were at the 1,2,3,4,5 the 
6 t h character of in the middle of the page.  Quote: 
“I can confirm that Salim Essa of Trillian was a 
contractor of Transnet Gama said.” 
Did you provide that information to the journalist?  
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Quote: 
“When I was in Davos, I received a request for a 
20 
meeting 
from 
Essa 
since 
I 
have 
travelled 
on 
Emirates Airlines, he suggested he meet me in 
Dubai during the stopover since he was in Dubai at 
the time Gama continued.” 
Is that correct?  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 80 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Quote: 
“I agree and he suggested that we – sorry, that he 
will reserve a hotel room which I paid for he said 
adding that Trillian and Regiments contracts were 
later cancelled by Transnet.” 
Is that correct?  
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Gama explained that Essa quote  
raised the issue of his involvement in Trillian which 
10 
was being formed as an off shoot of Regiments.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, it must have been the discussions that I 
had with Essa when I was in Dubai.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you remember on Monday, when 
you gave evidence, your evidence was that there had been 
no mention of Trillian and there was no mention of a 
migration from Regiments to Trillian.  You spoke in the 
abstract about the potential formation of a wholly owned 
black consultancy company. 
20 
MR GAMA:   That is correct, Chair, but on Monday, it was 
now five years after I had met Essa, this one is probably 
more correct because it was probably still fresher in my 
head in terms of what I think is there.  This is 2017, this is 
four years ago and so if you ask me now, six years later, I 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 81 of 137 
 
cannot give you exact, exact but I think the contexts and 
the discussion remains the same. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So tell us what you and Mr Essa 
discussed about Trillian in Dubai? 
MR GAMA:   Do you want us to read the article which looks 
a little bit fresher or you want me to try and recall, I would 
need to read this because this happened in 2017, Chair.  In 
terms of one's memory, and at that time, I would say it was 
still a bit fresher.  I cannot remember word for word, but I 
think the context as I have said of creating a black owned 
10 
firm with the consulting capabilities, South African owned 
was really the key thing that was being discussed.  So, you 
will see in 2017 Trillian had then also had informed by that 
when I met Essa I think it was still a concept.  So I think 
those are the differences. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well you say here that Essa raised 
the issue of his involvement in Trillian, which has been 
formed as an offshoot of Regiments, of course, the loan 
which you authorised payment of that was to Trillian in 
December of 2015, not so? 
20 
MR GAMA:   We going to have to have to look at the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that you had not 
intended to go to Dubai or stop there and spend two nights 
prior to Mr Essa calling you, that is a change in your plan 
that or get as a result of that call from him? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 82 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I wanted to buy the dress that was my 
whole intention.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR GAMA:   And then when he called then I got the idea 
that in any event when I am stopping there I could just stay 
one night longer.  It sounds like tonight, early hours of the 
morning.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, and then. 
MR GAMA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
10 
MR GAMA:   And then I just spend one night and then I 
left, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you may have been there for 
around 24 hours or just over 24 hours. 
MR GAMA:   I say 36. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About 36?  
MR GAMA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR GAMA:   Between 30 and 36, I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  
20 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so initially, were you going to 
spend the night at all there – you were going to have a 
stop over by and then proceed? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I was going to stop over and I think the 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 83 of 137 
 
stopover was fairly long…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, quite a few hours. 
MR GAMA:   It was seven or eight hours at the airport and 
then continue. 
MR GAMA:   Then continue, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. So you say in terms of the two 
nights, it might look like two nights in the normal way but it 
was less than 48 hours?  
MR GAMA:   Yes, no absolutely.  I would have arrived 
there probably one or 2am there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR GAMA:    And then…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then of course, in the hotel you 
have been booked the previous night. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, the hotel starts charging you from 7 
o'clock the previous day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In relation to that paragraph what I 
have been asking you about whether or not you authorised 
payment to Trillian in December, perhaps you could just 
20 
keep your finger at 318 sorry, 311 and then turn to page 
250.72. 
So 250.72 this is an invoice from Trillian for Leader 
Ranger of the ZAR 12 billion club loan facility and you 
were 
being 
charged 
Transnet 
R82million 
with 
VAT 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 84 of 137 
 
R93million. Is that correct that you authorised that the 3 r d 
of December 2015? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The month before you meet Mr 
Essa? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, except that this is Trillian Asset 
Management 
which 
is 
a 
capital 
raising 
entity, 
as 
I 
understand it, it is owned by someone else, a different 
person. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if we go back to 311. 
10 
MR GAMA:   So I do not know at which point Essa 
assumed any ownership of Trillian, whether it is this 
Trillian or it is another Trillian.  I think you may have the 
name, but I think there were something called Trillian 
Capital I think that could be Trillian Consulting.  So I do 
not think it is the same entities that we are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, they might be related companies.  
MR GAMA:   Yeah, they could be related parties, in terms 
of 
maybe 
ownership 
but 
this 
one 
of 
Trillian 
Asset 
Management was a different entity. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you said? 
MR GAMA:   And it could also quite possible Chair that 
when we are talking in 2017, you now know the name of 
the entity that was eventually formed to be this Trillian 
because if you read this newspaper article, it says that 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 85 of 137 
 
Wood last month bought Essa’s shares in Trillian, so I do 
not know those dealings, I am not privy to that but lots of 
things could have happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what page did you say we must go 
to Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I taken Mr Gama to page 72, I would 
want to go back now to the article at 311, Chairperson.  So 
then the next paragraph says: 
“Essa said the expertise would remain the same as 
core resources would be migrated from Regiments 
10 
and that the quality of work for Transnet would be 
unaffected Gama told Times Live.” 
Did you say that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I must have.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and then: 
“Gama was booked to stay in the deluxe suite for 
two days between January 22 and 24, 2016.” 
It says that: 
“You were permanently appointed as GCEO in April 
2016 after acting in that position from April 2015.”  
20 
It goes on to say: 
“Flight bookings found in the leaked email show that 
AJ Gupta was in Dubai for half a day at the same 
time.  Gama denied ever having met with Ajay 
Gupta, saying he only met Essa in Dubai and later 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 86 of 137 
 
confirmed he had met Essa on previous occasions 
at the Transnet offices.” 
Was that referred to those two occasions that you have 
testified about? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then there is a lot in the next 
page.  It is not particularly relevant but can I take you four 
paragraphs from the bottom of page 312: 
“Information from the leaked Gupta emails revealed 
a contract between Hong Kong based company 
10 
Tequesta 
owned 
by 
Essa 
and 
locomotive 
manufacturer, China South Rail which resulted into 
Tequesta netting around R5.3billion in consultancy 
fees since 2014. CSR one of four companies was 
awarded the line share of Transnet R50billion 
locomotive procurement project in 2014.  Gama in 
July this year announced Transnet had appointed 
Workman's attorneys to conduct an investigation 
into these claims, which include whether or not 
Transnet was overcharged and if it followed its own 
20 
procurement processes.” 
Do you want to comment on any of that? 
MR GAMA:   I think the investigations which we started in 
June or July 2017 were occasioned by these reports that 
we received and I think we then received there also a 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 87 of 137 
 
formal letter from the EFF with much more detail, which we 
then gave to Workmen in order for them to undertake the 
investigation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it goes on to say: 
“Advocate Geoff Budlender was also tasked to 
investigate Trillian by its former Board Chair Tokyo 
Sexwale.” 
It concludes by saying: 
“His report released at the end of June 2017 said 
Transnet 
paid 
around 
R105million 
to 
Trillian 
10 
between April and June 2016 some of which appear 
to be work Regiments had actually done,” 
Do you want to comment on that?  
MR GAMA:   Yes, it was on this basis that there appeared 
to be - what do they call it?  Between Regiments and 
Trillian, they appeared to be a lot of fights that they picked 
up amongst themselves after Regiments had asked us to 
cede the work to Trillian and then when Transnet had paid 
some of these invoices to Trillian then Regiment had come 
back at a later stage and said look, this invoice should 
20 
have been paid to Regiments or there were claims that the 
people were not Trillian people they were Regiments 
people. 
We started getting very confused at Transnet as to 
what was Trillian and what was Regiments and it was at 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 88 of 137 
 
that point – because now people had to generate credit 
notes and debit notes, it seemed that there was disputes 
and arguments even amongst them as to whether the 
people who had done the work had left Regiments to 
become Trillian.  
So you know if somebody has been working for you, so 
somebody came to the company, they were Regiments at a 
point and then they say no, we are no longer Regiments or 
part of Trillian we are continuing with the work and then this 
other new people who are Trillian and then Regiments comes 
10 
back later and says no but you know these people to be 
Regiments people why do you pay Trillian?  It was that kind 
of confusion that started to arise and then we then said look 
we do not want to get involved in whatever it is that they 
were doing because Regiments had written to us to say there 
was a re-engineering exercise that they were performing and 
this is as a result of that re-engineering exercise Trillian 
would now do the work.   
 
They then came back maybe in August or September 
I cannot remember saying that re-engineering exercise that 
20 
they wanted to do had not succeeded and that therefore 
everything would now go back to Regiments. 
 
We now found ourselves at the centre of trying to say 
was this invoice Trillian was it Regiments it was whatever 
then?  I just said to the legal team look there is lots of things 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 89 of 137 
 
that are going on here that I do not understand it is just 
better for us to extricate ourselves from this connection that 
was this – was this sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It sounds like sounds similar to what I 
have heard in relation to Eskom McKinsey and Trillian and 
Regiments but I do not see what is confusing as far as I am 
concerned because if you are Transnet you have a contract 
with Regiments and they have done the work you owe 
Regiments not somebody else.  If some of Regiments staff 
resigns or move elsewhere you pay Regiments.  It is their 
10 
own story what they do.  You have a contract with 
Regiments.   
MR GAMA:  Ja I think what you did not hear Chair they wrote 
to us in March on the reports – Regiments wrote to us in 
March and say we are ceding the contract to Trillian so then 
the cession took place and then the invoices were now being 
paid to Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would… 
MR GAMA:  And then at a later date Regiments then says 
you paid … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should have paid us. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not them. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what… 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 90 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:  And then we are saying to them we are not the 
ones that should be trying to manage your disputes as 
Transnet and then they were writing all kinds of letters to 
say but even the people that came there they were 
Regiments people you knew that etcetera, etcetera.  That is 
when we then just said look we had been told by Regiments 
that they are ceding the contracts to Trillian and that is why 
we paid Trillian.  If Regiments is saying they want to hold 
Transnet liable for something which they are saying belongs 
to them but was paid by Transnet to Regiments – I mean to 
10 
Trillian that was the confusion Chair I was not confused 
about who we should pay but we are now getting into nitty 
gritty of things that had nothing to do with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Perhaps whilst we now 
dealing with Trillian and this club loan there something that 
is on our radar can we perhaps just deal with that?  The club 
loan 
documents 
if 
we 
going 
to 
deal 
with 
them 
in 
chronological order need to start please with page 298 – 
250.298 and this is a memorandum to the BADAC as we 
20 
know it from yourself that is what it reflects requesting to 
appoint Trillian as lead manager in the 1 billion ZAR 
equivalent club loan.  If you go to the end of the document 
Mr Gama page 302 the recommendation was that the 
acquisitions and disposal committee  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 91 of 137 
 
1. Approve the appointment of Trillian in the place of JP 
Morgan as a lead manager with the 1.5 billion dollar 
ZAR 
equivalent 
club 
loan 
which 
was 
previously 
confined to JP Morgan. 
2. Approve 
the 
termination 
of 
JP 
Morgan’s 
ZAR 
syndication loan. 
3. Delegate 
authority 
to 
the 
GCE 
to 
approve 
all 
documentation relating to this confinement. 
And that is something that you recommended yourself on the 
22 n d of September 2015.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what was the cause of or the need 
for the termination of JP Morgan’s ZAR syndication loan? 
MR GAMA:  Ja.  So Chair this is a memo which when I sign 
it it is five days old.  Can we agree with that as I mean seven 
days old can we agree with that Mr Myburgh?  It is compiled 
by the Group Treasurer because we are going to have to 
read into the record what the Group Treasurer told us as the 
compiler of the document.  So he compiles the document on 
the 15t h – is it the 15t h? – oh okay it… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In September 2017 – well you know… 
MR GAMA:  It is 17 September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When they write dates like this. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know whether 17 is the date or 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 92 of 137 
 
the year but … 
MR GAMA:  Ja I start with the year but a lot of people start 
with the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  With the date ja.  Ja he started with the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so that is the date – ja the day – 
MR GAMA:  So he starts on the 17t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  September 2015. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the next one is signed on the same 
10 
date. 
MR GAMA:  Ja so those two could have been together to 
sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and the next one signed the day  
MR GAMA:  On the 18t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you signed on the 22n d of 
September. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
MR GAMA:  So when you read into the record you need to 
20 
then say you ask the question and then the two of us can 
then go to the board of the document to find out the 
questions that Mr Myburgh wants to ask. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As to why it was necessary to 
terminate JP Morgan’s mandate.  What part do you want to 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 93 of 137 
 
go to? 
MR GAMA:  So in the discussion under discussion he says 
under number 12 that when it became apparent that JP 
Morgan – maybe let us start it a little bit earlier.  On number 
6 or maybe at number – at number 4 he says that there were 
two tranches to this.  One is a US dollar 1.5 billion facility 
and the other one is a standby facility of 1 billion dollars. 
And then he indicates that JP Morgan had been appointed 
through a confinement to lead the club – the ZAR club as a 
substitute for the US dollar standby facility to bring the 
10 
overall costs of the transaction lower and to avoid foreign 
exchange exposure.   
 
And then at number 6 he then says Transnet 
considered a dual tranche to fund the Chinese locomotives 
acquisition. 
 
And then at number 7 he then says it was decided to 
utilise the 1.5 billion from CDB and JP Morgan was to 
underwrite the ZAR equivalent funding which was then the 1 
billion.  So JP Morgan was initially going to underwrite 1 
billion dollars.  
20 
 
He then says it would have enabled Transnet to meet 
the rating urgency requirements.  And then consequently 
there was a revised term sheet and mandate letter with CDB 
as a result of that and then he says Regiments Capital was 
appointed as a 1064 locomotive funding advisor and he then 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 94 of 137 
 
says that one of their SD initiatives was to develop other 
smaller black owned organisations in the industry and that is 
when then this Trillian Asset Management then arises – he 
says it is one of the beneficiaries of that initiative. 
 
If we then go into JP Morgan he says that it became 
apparent that JP Morgan would not be able to deliver the 
ZAR loan Regiments and then Regiments engaged with its 
SD beneficiaries to see if there were options available to 
Transnet. 
 
And he then says that Trillian would be able to 
10 
deliver on Transnet’s requirements for a club loan deal at a 
price and tenure which was most comparable to both the 
CDB loan and the Morgan proposal. 
 
So he then moves away from the initial underwriting 
which was – JP Morgan was going to do the 1 billion 
according to this. 
 
Then he moves to a club loan which means different 
banks would now syndicate different amounts to create the 
same thing.  I think they called it lended – I cannot – I think 
they used a word lended funding. 
20 
 
The reason they said they went for this was because 
it would be cheaper to do a blended loan with different banks 
than for JP Morgan to do one where it underwrite it itself. 
 
I think that was the discussion but I was not party to 
the discussion so everything that I know is the things that I 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 95 of 137 
 
was told and listening. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so you confirm then if I 
understand you correctly that the Group Treasurer Mr 
Ramasabudi 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was the actual author of this. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This memo. Alright.  So that is 
something you signed on 22 September 2015 can you then 
please go to page 250.63.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before we go there with regard to this 
memo Mr Gama my understanding of the fact that you were 
the most senior person among the signatories. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of that memo and that the memo was 
directed at a higher authority I would imagine. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
A 
committee 
of 
the 
board 
my 
understanding would be that you would be the one taken to 
be the owner of the memo.  Now I must explain what I mean 
20 
when I say the owner. 
 
As far as the – the committees is concerned to whom 
the memo was addressed if they wanted to hold anybody 
responsible about what they were told here they would look 
to you because you are the most senior person who – who 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 96 of 137 
 
signed whether your subordinates got anything wrong that 
would be between you and your subordinates. Would that be 
a fair understanding? 
MR GAMA:  Ja.  Some of these issues Chair are complex 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  And we always had to make sure that the people 
who – so somebody would have come for instance I probably 
would have called Peter to say okay you guys have come up 
with this can you explain for me 1, 2, 3, 4 and then they 
10 
would explain and I would say okay now it makes sense.  
And then on that basis then I would sign and then we go to 
the committee but I would not even attempt Chair at the 
committee to try and explain this myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GAMA:  We would get the compiler, the treasurer to go 
to the committee to explain this because this is what they do 
for a living.  This is what they wake up to go to work to do. 
The Chief Executive is the General Manager.  A Chief 
Executive… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are specialists. 
MR GAMA:  Yes these people are specialists in their area.  
The Chief Executive is somebody who tries to bring a lot of 
different issues together but you cannot be a Jack of all 
trades.  Ja. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 97 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so what you are saying is – is what 
you are saying this?  That yes to a certain extent the 
committee would be entitled to look to me. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I am the most senior person who 
recommended. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am expected to recommend what I 
understand. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot recommend something I do not 
understand. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there would be an understanding that 
there might be certain intricacies in respect of which I might 
need specialists. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To come and explain some of the details. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
20 
MR GAMA:  That is correct and in fact when the memo is 
still new it is still even fresh in your mind what they have 
explained to you but if you meet the same memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja years later. 
MR GAMA:  Years later you … 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 98 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will not remember. 
MR GAMA:  You will not remember because it is not – it is 
not your bread and butter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do I understand that you then relied 
heavily on the advice of Mr Peter? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And this was in August – sorry 
September of 2015? 
MR GAMA:  September 2015 yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I just want to – to mention to you there 
is evidence before the commission that Mr Peter in August of 
2015 and other months received so called invoice tracking 
schedules from Mr Wood at Regiments. 
MR GAMA:  Sorry he received what? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So called invoice tracking schedules 
from Mr Wood at Regiments that indicated payments being 
paid to Gupta Linked shell companies for example Homix 
etcetera.  It indicated how payments made to Regiments 
were then split out amongst various companies.  Did you 
20 
know anything about that? 
MR GAMA:  No I do not know anything about it.  You are 
saying he knew about … 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am saying there is some evidence 
before the commission that you received invoice tracking 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 99 of 137 
 
schedules which reflected how amounts paid to Regiments 
were disbursed amongst various companies. 
MR GAMA:  (Mumbling). 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is saying there is evidence that has 
been led before the commission which reflects that around 
this time September and other months of 2015 or thereabout 
he Mr Peter was being furnished with invoice schedules 
showing how money that had been paid to Regiments was 
being divided or distributed among certain companies related 
to the Gupta’s or associated with the Gupta’s.  Is that correct 
10 
Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that is what he is saying. 
MR GAMA:  So that is what he is saying.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is what he is saying and he is 
asking whether you know anything about that 
MR GAMA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think you have said – ja.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So perhaps I can just and I do 
appreciate that you have not been party to this.  Let me just 
20 
explain it in a little bit more detail. 
 
So the evidence before the commission and of course 
I premise all of this again DCJ on the fact that it is a – it is 
not to say that you will accept this but there is some 
evidence that reflects the following Mr Gama and that is that 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 100 of 137 
 
Regiments were appointed as McKinsey’s skills supply 
development partner in relation to the 1064 transaction 
advisory contract and they were appointed in circumstances 
where there was an agreement that Mr Essa would get 50% 
kickback of Regiments fees payments to them and Mr 
Moodley would – Kuban Moodley would get 5%.  
 
Now the two entities nominated by those gentlemen 
were Mr Essa payments were made to a company by the 
name of Homix and in the case of Mr Moodley payments 
were made to a company by the name of Albertime. 
10 
 
So what these invoice tracking schedules would show 
is amounts paid. So they came in from Mr Wood from 
Regiments they would show that X amount was paid to 
Regiments and then it would reflect that 50% was due to 
Homix and five 5% was due to Albertime. Those are the 
schedules that there is evidence of.  Mr Peter having 
received and incidentally it is something that still needs to 
be dealt with Mr Singh also is still to be – this is still to be 
put to him but there is also some evidence to the effect that 
he similarly received those schedules. 
20 
MR GAMA:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You do not know about that? 
MR GAMA:  No, no I do not know anything about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then I did put to you yesterday for 
what it is worth that you probably have heard that Mr Singh 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 101 of 137 
 
had eight safe deposit boxes at Knox Vault – you have heard 
that have you? 
MR GAMA:  No I do not know the number.  I have heard this 
concept of Knox Vault as you know I did write to the 
commission about it because my name was also at some 
point associated with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you.. 
MR GAMA:  I do not know the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You heard about the company and you 
heard that he had some safety boxes but you do not know 
10 
the number? 
MR GAMA:  Yes, no there was a newspaper article Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
MR GAMA:  That said there was these vaults. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  As I understand it is safety deposit boxes and in 
– in that newspaper article my name was cited. So I had 
occasion then it was in 2019 to write to the commission to 
say I see my name next to this Knox Vaults but I think we 
have since come back to indicate that no my name should 
20 
not have been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GAMA:  It should not have appeared there.  But I know 
that Mr Singh’s name also appeared next to that.  I think it 
was also – it was my name and Brain Molefe and Singh but 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 102 of 137 
 
some of that is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well I think perhaps it is appropriate to 
place formerly on record as you know Chairperson that there 
is certainly no formal evidence from within the commission 
that Mr Gama has or had a safety deposit box at Knox 
Vaults. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then perhaps just to end that off 
Mr Peter well certainly his mother I do not know if you know 
10 
anything about this she – he or she had seven safe deposit 
boxes there. 
MR GAMA:  No I do not know anything about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay well I suppose we all keep our 
money in different places.  Now that is then the 22 nd of 
September 2015.  Take you to the – the next document in the 
chronology and that you find at page 250.63. So remember 
the memorandum that you recommended was placed before 
the acquisition or it was meant for the acquisition and 
disposal committee. 
20 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you see that on this 1s t of October 
2015 they then resolved essentially exactly the same as your 
recommendation. Correct? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 103 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then if you go over the page on the 
18t h of November 2018 this document is addressed to 
Transnet by Trillian.  The document you will see that you 
signed. 
MR GAMA:  Where are you now? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon I am at page 64 the 
page after the – the resolution. 
MR GAMA:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Of the DADC. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV 
MYBURGH SC:  So this is a letter 
seems 
of 
engagement letter really dated the 18t h of November from 
Trillian to Transnet and you will see at page 250.66 that you 
signed this document. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And so did Mr Peter. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it signed on behalf of Trillian by 
Mr Daniel – is it Ray? 
MR GAMA:  I think it says Roy. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Roy.  Had you ever met Mr Daniel 
Roy? 
MR GAMA:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Had you ever met anybody from 
Trillian? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 104 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:  Ja which Trillian?  These Trillians there are 
many of them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This Trillian – this letter comes from 
Trillian Boutique Asset Management. 
MR GAMA:  Yes.  I do not know Mr Roy. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But had you ever met anyone from this 
company? 
MR GAMA:  Yes I thought that you had said that Mr Wood he 
bought some shares from Trillian.  I had known Wood from 
Regiments. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this is a letter of engagement – it is 
the R12 billion club loan facility and if you go over the page 
to 65 you will see that at 3.1 the third paragraph R82 million 
due and payable upon execution of the club loan facility 
agreement relating to the transaction. Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So that is 18 November 2015.  You will 
see if you now go to page 72 that on the same day 18 
November 2015 Trillian then furnish Transnet with an 
invoice, do you see that? 
20 
MR 
GAMA: 
 
Yes. 
 
The 
invoices 
were 
I 
think 
they 
accompanied this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.   
MR GAMA:  They probably accompanied this agreement and 
are related to … 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 105 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR GAMA:  That document that you were showing me earlier 
that Mr Ramasabudi. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay. 
MR GAMA:  Wrote ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So do I understand that the work had 
then already been done?  Is that what you are saying? 
MR GAMA:  Sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Had the work already been done or …? 
MR GAMA:  No, no I am saying that – if I take you back. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  To where we were.  If I take you to 303. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  There is a document at 303. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja we are going to come to that in the 
chronology. 
MR GAMA:  Yes so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you take – when you say take you 
back you mean take you forward? 
MR GAMA:  No we were there. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I – we were not at 303 I think the 
document you are looking for... 
MR GAMA:  We were in the page before. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  That is when  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 106 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR GAMA:  When you said let us go to the next page I went 
to this page but you were somewhere else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think you meant 298 Mr Gama. In 
other words it is linked to that Ramasabudi memo. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That you approved.  Absolutely. 
MR GAMA:  I am saying all of this they should be read 
together. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes no absolutely.   
MR GAMA:  Because they are part of the same letter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We get the – we get the memo, we get 
the BADAC resolution and then we get the letter of 
engagement – said we must read it together. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And we get the invoice.  So I think the 
only point I am making is perhaps I could just ask you to 
comment on this.  There is a letter of engagement in other 
words these people are saying this is what we are going to 
20 
do.  Right.  And we are going to be paid upon the execution 
of the club loan facility. They tell you that on the 18t h of 
November 2015 and on the same day they send you an 
invoice that you see at page 250.72.  Correct? 
MR GAMA:  Yes except that the memo that we just gone 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 107 of 137 
 
through Ramasabudi claims that they have been working with 
him for five months previous – this is the memo that we sent 
to the board.  So he says at page 300 point 24. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay Mr Gama, Trillian has not 
existed for five months.  That is the point ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Well, I do not know.  I am just telling you what 
Ramosebudi says.  So he says I have been writing to these 
people for five months and then he then writes another 
memo to say find this agreement which is the agreement 
that we are going through now.  This is what we are 
10 
discussing now with Mr Myburgh, in November.  He then 
says here is an agreement that you must sign.  So I am 
saying all of these things are related.  We must not look at 
them as if they are not related.  The first thing that 
happens is the memo.  It is the memo that goes to the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Committee. 
MR GAMA:   ...to the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR GAMA:   Then the committee approves.  Once the 
20 
committee approves, you then get the resolution.  And then 
he writes another memo attaching this agreement and that 
is the one I said that I said we must not pretend as if they 
are not related.  And he writes another memo, attaching 
this, to say can you please sign the agreement based on 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 108 of 137 
 
what was approved on the 1 s t of October.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, Mr Gama, I fully appreciate they 
must be read together but if I take you back to the invoice.  
Do I understand what you are saying there is, as far as you 
are concerned, this work had already been done? 
MR GAMA:   According to what I have just showed you on 
page 300.24.  He says that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  I am sorry, Mr Gama.  You have 
talked about page 300.24. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that paragraph 24 you are talking 
about? 
MR GAMA:   It is paragraph 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 250.300? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it reads ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Financial advisor negotiations  
support 
the 
Trillian 
provided 
through 
this 
20 
entire process took in excess of five months 
which was done at risk with the expectation of 
compensation only on successful completion of 
the transaction.”   
 
That is what he said. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 109 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Yes, that is what he said.  So I am saying if 
you take it from that, then you are saying this work that 
has been done for five months before this and then he then 
attaches this agreement ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   ...to the other memo.  So it is now month six.  
So I think you have to assume, according to him, it is now 
the sixth month and then here is an invoice.  So I am 
saying to you, Mr Myburgh, that if it cannot be that you 
think that as soon as the agreement is signed, then there 
10 
is an invoice.  According to Mr Ramosebudi, he is saying 
they have done work for six months.  That I cannot vouch.  
I have never been... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what you are saying is.  I guess your 
answer should have been a yes to Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are saying, based on what you were 
told, you understood that work had been done for five 
months? 
20 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you are saying is.  Whether that 
was factually true or not, you do not know. 
MR GAMA:   That I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 110 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   But I am just saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   ...from what – yes. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja. 
 
You 
say 
that 
was 
your 
understanding. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And then what we see – so 
that was your understanding and then what see is, if you 
10 
go to page 73. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where is the agreement that 
Mr Gama says ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We will come to the memo but I think 
he refers to, Chairperson, in the chronology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is another memo and I am 
going to come to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the invoice is dated 15 November 
20 
– oh, sorry – 18 November 2015.  And then if you go over 
to page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is the invoice?  I am trying to 
make sure I do not lose you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The invoice is at page 72, 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 111 of 137 
 
Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.72. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, these documents are too far apart. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it makes it difficult to ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to follow. 
MR GAMA:   That is what I was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR GAMA:   That we got all of them together and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not possible, Mr Myburgh, even if it 
is after today.  Maybe because of the complications of the 
– of pagination.  Is it not possible to take ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We could try ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...all of that together and put them at the 
back ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We can try. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the right sequence. Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There would be duplication but that is 
fine.  Then we know where to find all of them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We will do that, DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 112 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So the invoice is at page 
72.  At page 73 is the payment advice dated the 
19 t h of November.  Is that also your signature? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama? 
MR GAMA:   Oh, is it 75? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   73. 
MR GAMA:   73? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 250.73?  Point 73.  Because I am 
looking at page 73 but ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.72 and 250.73. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  It seems that it will be 
important to keep on saying 250 because ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...there may be confusion if we just say 
so because there is a 73.  Okay 250.73. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So that takes us to the 
19 t h of November 2015.  Now, if I can take you, please, to 
20 
the second memorandum that Mr Gama has been referring 
to and the agreement that you asked about Chairperson.  
That memorandum, you will find back at page 303 – 
250.303.  This is now signed by Mr Gama on the 
3 r d of December 2015.  And Mr Gama, you confirm that you 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 113 of 137 
 
have signed it on the 3 r d of December 2015? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And is this again – this is something, 
it 
seems, 
that 
is 
addressed 
to 
you, 
Mr 
Peter 
and 
Mr Selinga from Mr Ramosebudi.  So he is again the author 
of this document in effect.  Is that right? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the recommendation is.   
“It is recommended that the acting GCE and 
the 
GCFO 
sign 
off 
on 
Trillian 
Asset 
10 
Management’s invoice for services rendered to 
and behalf of Transnet in this capacity as 
Trillian’s originating and coordinating mandate 
leader ranger or ZAR 12 billion club facilities.”   
 
Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At then takes us back.  So after you 
have signed that on the 3 r d of December 2015, presumable 
if you go to page 72, that is then what caused you to sign 
the invoice on that day? 
20 
MR GAMA:   Yes.  So, as he says in his recommendation, 
either commence that me and the acting CFO signs on the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   Yes but it is the same day. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 114 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, DCJ, when you asked about the 
contract.  There is no contract from what we can work out.  
The closest one gets to it is really the letter of engagement 
that you will find at 64, which is a formal letter signed by 
Mr Rooi and Mr Gama and Mr Peter.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gama, you confirm that?  When you 
talked about a contract, you are referring to the letter of 
engagement? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
10 
MR GAMA:   I think in that the parties tried to put in place 
whatever the expectations were, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then, if you go to page 74 you 
will see this is a bank record of Trillian which reflects and 
this we get from colleagues of ours in Money-flow.  On the 
4 t h of December 2015, there is an incoming payment of 
R 93 480 000,00.  Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that was the money paid.  And 
then if you go down about the middle of the page, you see 
an 
entry 
8 December 2015. 
 
The 
sixth 
entry, 
8 December 2015, there is a payment out to Albatime of 
R 74 784 000,00.  Do you see that? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 115 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We then also, Chairperson, attached 
some parts of the transcript relevant to or relating to the 
evidence 
of 
Mr 
Mohammed 
Mohammedi 
and 
Mr Ramosebudi.  Mohammed Mohammedi was called within 
this stream.  Mr Ramosebudi was called within the Money-
flow Stream, as you might remember. 
 
Can I just take you, please, to page 76?  It is an 
extract from Mr Mohammedi’s evidence.  And at line 18, 
Advocate Phillip Makena SC said: 
10 
“Do you know why Trillian was paid that 
amount?  What was or what did they do to be 
paid that amount?” 
 
Mr Mohammedi answered: 
“Well, it is alleged that they were a supply 
development partner to Regiments.   
That is the information that is being presented 
but in discussion and that I have had, they are 
unable to find any documentation or any 
evidence that Trillian did in fact work on the 
20 
ZAR Club Loan.   
We do not believe – we are not able to.   
We have discussed this with the previous 
Treasurer.   
We 
asked 
for 
simple 
documentation, 
et 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 116 of 137 
 
cetera...” 
 
Are you able to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   Well, I think the Treasurer, Mr Ramosebudi, is 
the right person to talk to this.  I cannot talk to this.  I was 
given the impression, Chair, and given the understanding, 
as we have read together those documents, that Trillian 
had done all of this Club Loan arrangement work.  And so I 
do not know if I have to go and say let us look at what the 
work was, what it is that I would look for.  I do not know 
but the Treasurer indicated to us that they have done the 
10 
Club arrangements.  So I would not be able to comment on 
what Mohammedi is saying, what he saw or what he did not 
see. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama, did you yourself witness 
any work being done?  You must remember that Trillian is 
an offshoot of Regiments.  Did you witness any work being 
done by anyone at Trillian? 
MR GAMA:   Mr Myburgh, I have said to you that I did not 
do any of this work.  It is – I did not get involved in this 
financial things.  So my involvement is when Ramosebudi 
20 
says we must go to the ADC.  Trillian has been doing this 
work.  We must change from JP Morgan, we must change 
from Underwriting to create a Club Loan and these are the 
people who have done that work.  So I never even been to 
the Group Treasurer ’s office. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 117 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you can either ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   I cannot ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can neither dispute ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   I cannot dispute it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when it was done? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I do not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So when somebody says it was not done, 
you cannot say anything. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they say if it was done, you do not 
10 
know? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, let me then take you 
to Mr Ramosebudi.  If you have a look at page 250.80.  My 
colleague, Mr Chaskalson SC says:  “Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said which point?  Zero, eight point 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.80.  Eighty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eight, zero.  Okay.  Yes, continue. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   My colleague, Mr Chaskalson SC 
says:   
“Well, the evidence will show that the amount 
of R 93 480 000,00 was paid into Trillian’s 
bank account on 4 December. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 118 of 137 
 
Are you aware that four days later, 80% of that 
amount, 
being 
R 74 780 000,00 
was 
transferred to Albatime?” 
 
He says: 
“I am not aware of that.” 
 
And then he is asked: 
“Well, can you think of any reason?  Did 
Albatime played any role whatsoever in the 
Club Loan?” 
 
He says, well, he does not know.   
10 
 
Now, Mr Gama, just again to point out that on 
these invoice tracking schedules that were provided to 
Mr Peter, payments to Albatime were actually reflected.  
And then over the page, page 81, fourth line.  Did you – he 
asked him:   
“Did you ever encounter Albatime at all?” 
 
In the second line: 
“No, I have never encountered Albatime.” 
 
And then he refers to Kuben Moodley.  Did you 
ever meet Kuben Moodley? 
20 
MR GAMA:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, incidentally, prior to giving this 
evidence, Mr Ramosebudi at page 232, he was asked by 
Mr Chaskalson: 
“Had you seen anyone from Trillian actually 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 119 of 137 
 
arranging the loan?” 
 
Then Ramosebudi said: 
“At the beginning when we were dealing with 
this they were not there.” 
MR GAMA:   Sorry, he said what? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He said: 
“At the beginning when we were dealing with 
this they were not there.” 
 
Chaskalson says: 
“Yes, 
they 
were 
not 
there 
and 
the 
10 
arrangements were being made by people then 
at Regiments.” 
 
Ramosebudi said: 
“That is precisely true.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  Where are you? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, I am reading...  Chairperson, 
this is not in the – these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am reading from page 232 of the 
transcript of Day 314.

CHAIRPERSON:   Not in the bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Please just repeat 
what you read because I was not able to connect with 
...[intervenes]  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 120 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So at line 21 Advocate Chaskalson 
says: 
“Had you seen anyone from Trillian actually 
arranging the loan?” 
 
Ramosebudi: 
“At the beginning when we were dealing with 
this they were not there.” 
 
Advocate Chaskalson: 
“Yes, 
they 
were 
not 
there 
and 
the 
arrangements were being made by people then 
10 
at Regiments.” 
 
Mr Ramosebudi said: 
“That is precisely true.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you have any comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   So what are you saying?  Are you saying 
Mr Ramosebudi says the people who did the work were 
from Regiments but he decided to tell us we must pay 
Trillian? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That seems to be what he said when he 
is being questioned by Mr Chaskalson. 
MR GAMA:   So perhaps the work was done but by other 
people and not by Trillian but he then decided that he 
would mislead us and tell us that Trillian had been doing 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 121 of 137 
 
the work.  I think that is the sum-total of it from what 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Certainly that is what, from your point, 
you would say if you said his memos said to you Trillian 
had done the work over the previous five months. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say now, he says Regiments did 
the work.  You would then say but that is not what he said 
in the memo here, if that is how you understood his memo. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, because I think it is then misleading. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So perhaps I could, just to finish off 
on this, take you to Exhibit BB-27.  That is the Transnet 
POR Reference Bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, I must say.  I think we will 
adjourn about quarter to five, just so that you can pace 
yourself properly. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that Bundle 6? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is Transnet Bundle 6.  Yes, 
Chairperson.  Exhibit BB-27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And that is on what page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I would like to take you, please, to 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 122 of 137 
 
page 398. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And could I just direct your attention 
because there is reference here also to the statements 
made by Mr Ramosebudi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So could I ask you, please, to have a 
look at 398, paragraph 2.7.29 from the MNS report? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, furthermore, in our interview 
10 
with Ms Matshepo – and we know that she is from 
Regiments.  She confirmed that: 
“All the work done in relation to the Club Loan 
was executed by Regiments.  By the same 
token, Messrs P Ramosebudi and Alani Magele 
confirmed in our interview that they only dealt 
with 
Ms 
Matshepo 
and 
Mr 
Wood 
from 
Regiments...” 
MR GAMA:   So, you are saying this is a different stream?  
Did you establish then why Mr Ramosebudi had claimed 
20 
that Trillian did the work? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you have any comment on that, 
Mr Gama? 
MR GAMA:   I was not there.  I cannot comment on it.  I am 
asking ...[intervenes]  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 123 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   I was asking a question whether – was 
Mr Ramosebudi ever asked why he said Trillian did the 
work when it was done by Regiments? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before we talk about that 
question.  I just want to make sure you understand two 
points, 7.29 at page 398 to the extent that you might not 
know Ms Matshepo, who is referred to there, she used to 
work for Regiments.  You might or you might not know.  
She used to work for Regiments.  She has given evidence 
10 
in the Commission and she did move to Trillian at some 
stage coming from Regiments. 
MR GAMA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So MNS, from what we see here, did 
interview her as well and so she is the one here who, 
according to MNS, confirmed that all the work done in 
relation to the Club Loan was executed by Regiments.  I 
think in relation to Eskom to – you will recall, earlier on I 
said what you were telling is similar to what I have heard 
in relation to Eskom, McKinsey, Trillian and Regiments. 
20 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because in – under Eskom too, Eskom 
paid a certain amount of money.  I think R 30.4 million or 
R 34 million, 
I 
cannot 
remember, 
to 
Trillian 
in 
circumstances where is that dispute as to who should have 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 124 of 137 
 
been paid and it seems that it is Regiments who had paid – 
who had done the work but I think somebody like Mr Singh 
might at some stage just find that Trillian had made – had 
done the work but I think he seems to accept now that it 
looks like Regiments had done the work but Trillian was 
paid. 
 
So she testified in regard to the Eskom situation 
as well and said it was Regiments which had done the 
work.  So it looks like here too, in relation to Transnet, she 
says: 
10 
“In regard to the Club Loan, Regiments had 
done the work but Trillian was paid..” 
MR GAMA:   And maybe that is why, Chair, I was saying to 
you earlier that we got confused because Regiments 
started writing lots of letters to us saying that we have 
paid the wrong people but I do not think it was in relation 
to this one.  What I do not understand, still, is.  If 
Regiments did the work why there now another entity too... 
CHAIRPERSON:   To do what? 
MR GAMA:   To invoice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe they did not allow it to 
invoice.  [laughs] 
MR GAMA:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe it is invoiced and the question 
was whether either Transnet or Eskom decided to honour 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 125 of 137 
 
the invoice even though another entity have done the work, 
you now.  So.  But with regard to the question you asked, 
Mr Myburgh might be able to answer but I can just say this 
that when Mr Peter – was it Mr Peter or Mr Ramosebudi, 
who 
testified 
under 
the 
Money-flow 
Work 
stream, 
Mr Myburgh?  I think it was Mr Ramosebudi. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Ramosebudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  That is another work stream.  It may 
be that he was asked about that aspect or he might not 
have been asked because – but their focus is different.  It 
10 
is more on Money-flows.  So I cannot remember whether he 
was asked or not.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He talked about why he wrote the memo 
that he wrote which you understood to be saying Trillian 
had done the work. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, that is what I have known all 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   ...from what he had told us but now you are 
20 
saying no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   When he says, even himself, that it was 
people from Regiments.  So I do not know what caused him 
to say to us it is Trillian. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 126 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, yes.  Mr Myburgh, you had asked 
the question ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I just want to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...maybe that has not been answered 
because I interrupted. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think the important thing, Mr Gama, 
to appreciate is what actually going on around you here 
because when you look at Money-flows.  Money-flows 
reflects this.  From the 3 r d of December, you signed an 
invoice.  From the 4 t h of December, R 93 million is paid to 
10 
Trillian.  On 8 December 2015, 80% of that is paid to 
Albatime.  Albatime is linked to Gupta money laundering.   
MR GAMA:   H’m.  Ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So just pick up on 398.  You talked 
about letters being written by Regiments and you did not 
think that it applied here.  I just want to take you to 
paragraph 2.7.31.  It reflects that: 
“On 12 September 2016, Regiments wrote a 
letter to Transnet and recorded the following in 
relation to the Club Loan, the payment of 
20 
R 93 million for the Club Loan. 
This fee relates to work done by Regiments for 
the capital raised in transaction management 
and hedging advisory services related to the 
1064 Locomotives Funding together with the 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 127 of 137 
 
Club Loan of which Regiments invoiced and 
was paid the relevant fee...” 
 
So it is not that they have allowed someone to 
get the fee.  They say that they invoiced and were paid. 
“While it was originally anticipated that JP 
Morgan would be appointed – arranges for the 
Club Loan and Regiments would assist JP 
Morgan in the execution thereof. 
As you are aware, Regiments had requested 
Transnet ultimately took over full responsibility 
10 
as lead managers with all the incumbent work 
being performed by Regiments. 
This work was completed by Regiments in 
December 2015...” 
MR GAMA:   Ja, it was...  I do not know what to call it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see, Mr Gama.  You met with 
Mr Essa the next month in Dubai. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. [laughs] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then I just wanted to ask 
you, please, to go to page – Bundle 7, DCJ at page 168. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that page 250.158? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, this is the original 168. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Yes, I have got it.  Have you got it, 
Mr Gama? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 128 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, if I could ask you to – perhaps 
you can turn to the beginning of the file at page 7.  So your 
finger at 168 and then please turn to page 7.  Okay.  So 
can I just direct your attention – so this is part of the one 
of the 10.6s that you were issued with and at paragraph 
1.15 you specifically address in additions in the allegations 
in the …[intervenes] 
MR GAMA:   Sorry, page 7, no paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are we not in this – no, you are in – 
sorry, can I ask you please to go to bundle 7, it is your file. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that has got your affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  EXHIBIT BB28.  I do apologise. 
MR GAMA:   Okay, we go to page 7, you said? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   7 please. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is part of one the 10.6s that 
was issued to you.  Paragraph 1.15. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You specifically address in addition 
to the allegations in the aforementioned affidavits or 
20 
statements (annexures) your involvement in the following. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, paragraph 1...? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Point 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not at paragraph? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 129 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I am at page 7 of bundle 7, 
Exhibit …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, I am looking at page 6. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   EXHIBIT BB28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am looking at page 6.  
Okay, I have got page 7.  Ja?  And the paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   1.15 you specifically address in 
addition to the allegations in the aforementioned affidavits 
or 
statements 
(annexures) 
your 
involvement 
in 
the 
following.  Have a look at subparagraph 2: 
10 
“R1 billion equivalent club loan involving Trillian as 
lead arranger.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Asked to address your involvement 
in that.  If you go then to page 168. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say at paragraph 53 at 
paragraph 1.15.2 of the notice: 
“I had no involvement with the R1 billion equivalent 
20 
loan involving Trillian as lead arranger.” 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, maybe it is too 
late in the day, I just seem not to find the pages you are 
referring to.  I have got – I am on Transnet bundle 7. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 130 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I am at page 168.  Are you talking 
about 250.168? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, the original 168. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where I am but... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is page 53 of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Ja, it is page 53 of the affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then I am referring the witness to 
paragraph 53, so that is right at the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay, now I can see. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it says at paragraph 53 at 
paragraph 1.15.2 of the notice.  That is the regulation 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The notice at page 7? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At page 7, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but – because also when I was at 
page 7... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I could not see the paragraph you were 
reading from. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, so DCJ …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At paragraph 7 my first paragraph is 
8.2.2.4. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, are you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it 7 of 15? 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 131 of 137 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, it is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it under 1 – I have, you know, 
when you come to – then it is BB28 the green divider. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you have got Mr Gama’s 
statement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, how does bundle start? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I was looking – I think I was 
looking at Mr Gama’s statement, that is the first document 
that I have. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How BB28 starts, Chairperson, is: 
“With your directive...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   BB28 starts with in the indices or one 
index. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then after the index there is a page 
with Mr Todd’s names all over and Mr Makwanazi. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think we have got it – we have to 
be going fundamentally wrong, DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe Mr Gama’s statement was 
20 
slotted in the wrong place. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   May have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after the statement I have go the 
10.6 directive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 132 of 137 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which starts on page 3 black numbers. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you could go to page 7 of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. Ja, you see, I was looking at page 
7 of Mr Gama’s statement.  I think that is where – now I 
can see. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So at page 7, that is part of the 
10.6s, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now I have got both pages. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there you will see paragraph 
1.15.2 and the answer to that appears at page 168. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You answer is at 53: 
“I had no involvement.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I can say it again without any fear of 
20 
contradiction that I had no involvement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama, what we have seen is that 
you were the final signatory on the recommendation that 
served the [indistinct], you then signed the letter of 
engagement, you then signed the invoice and you were 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 133 of 137 
 
also a signatory to a preceding memorandum authorising 
you to do that and you say you no involvement?  
MR GAMA:   Mr Gama, read it for me again, 1.15.2. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I suppose you have got to read it 
with 1.15 as well: 
“You 
specifically 
address 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
allegations in the aforementioned affidavit your 
statement …[intervenes] 
MR GAMA:   No, no, I am saying 1.15.2 at page 7. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
10 
MR GAMA:   Read it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have to read it, you will bear 
with me for a moment, together with the leading paragraph, 
talks about your involvement in the following: 
“The 
R1 
billion 
equivalent 
club 
loan 
involving 
Trillian as lead arranger.” 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Your involvement. 
MR GAMA:   Yes and then I say to you I had no 
involvement with the R1 billion equivalent loan involving 
20 
Trillian as lead arranger.  I do not know anything about it, I 
still do not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are we then – did we get the number 
wrong or what are we …[intervenes] 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 134 of 137 
 
MR GAMA:   Ja, you were talking about R1 billion, it was 
R12 billion that we have been discussing.  There is a huge 
difference between R1 billion and R12 billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It should have been the 1 billion 
dollar. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, so you want me to answer questions – 
that is why I say to you I have no fear of contradiction on 
that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that the approach that you 
adopted to your affidavit? 
10 
MR GAMA:   No, it is not an approach, I do not know how 
many lead arrangers, what do you call it, how many loans 
that Trillian did.  So you asked me about a particular loan 
and I say to you I do not know anything about it, it is too 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us just get – let us get this clear.  In 
the top directive: 
“You are asked to address in addition to the 
allegations 
in 
the 
aforementioned 
affidavits 
or 
statements and annexures your involvement in the 
20 
R1 billion equivalent club loan involving Trillian as 
lead arranger.” 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – and your answer is: 
“I had no involvement with the…” 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 135 of 137 
 
And you quote: 
“R1 billion equivalent loan involving Trillian as lead 
arranger” 
And from what you are saying your point is, if they 
mentioned 
the 
R12 
billion 
then 
you 
would 
answer 
differently? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I would answer that differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   Because, remember, Chair, I am not the 
Group Treasurer.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   I do not know how many loans that what do 
you call it that Trillian did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   The only one that I know is the R12 billion, 
that one I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you are saying - yes but this for 
R1 billion… 
MR GAMA:   The 1 billion I was not involved, I do not know 
anything about it, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know of there having been more 
than one club loan. 
MR GAMA:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know of there having been more 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 136 of 137 
 
than one club loan. 
MR GAMA:   I would not know how many club loans are 
there at Transnet.  Transnet has got many, many loans.  
Got many loans, different institutions.  I think close to one 
hundred and something billion, if I am not mistaken. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, that brings me to the 
end of my questioning in relation to the R12 billion club 
loan.  This is a convenient time to adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, we are going to adjourn 
now.  What is your estimate of how much more time you 
10 
will need to finish all the evidence? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Accumulatively probably one day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But could be done easily I think over 
two night sessions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I was thinking about two nights.  I 
think what I would like both teams to do is to see whether 
there are evenings next week when everybody would be 
available because if I have got dates, maybe a few dates, 
maybe two, three, or whatever but maybe two, three other 
20 
dates could be given for the following week, evenings, just 
evenings. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So that I am going to look at what 
evenings are open next week, maybe that other week as 
30 APRIL 2021 – DAY 386 
 
Page 137 of 137 
 
well so that we if possible can slot Mr Gama in.  We can 
negotiate these dates because they are short notice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we can find dates that suit everybody 
we will use them.  If we cannot fine then we will give more 
reasonable notice and just fix other dates.  So maybe Mr 
Myburgh and counsel for Mr Gama, you can talk and then 
you can - Mr Myburgh, you can let me know over the 
weekend what dates have you got available. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, Mr Gama, thank you for 
availing yourself, we are going to adjourn and then if you 
come back next week it will be evenings that have been 
agreed, maybe early that other week if – so but if we 
cannot find dates that suit everybody then we just give 
reasonable notice.  But thank you. 
MR GAMA:   Thank you very much, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 3 MAY 2021
