PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 09 DECEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson we are ready.  There 
is just two housekeeping matters to get out of the way.  
One of which relates to the second witness scheduled for 
today 
and 
maybe 
we 
could 
start 
with 
that 
first 
Chairperson? 
10 
 
We 
have 
scheduled 
today 
Mr 
Khoza 
and 
Ms 
Verushni Naidoo.  In regard to Ms Verushni Naidoo 
Chairperson we received the affidavit only yesterday after 
four – late afternoon.  It is an affidavit of some 56 pages I 
think with annexures – it runs up to 237 pages.  So we 
have not had a chance to look at the affidavit.   
The deadline for that affidavit was towards the end 
of November.  Extensions were asked and we had agreed 
amicably with the other – the legal representatives for Ms 
Naidoo that they could submit but they should submit on a 
20 
particular date.  Well that also did not happen so we only 
received it yesterday. 
 
So in the light of that Chairperson we are in a 
predication from our side to proceed with her evidence 
today.  I have communicated with the legal repre – with the 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 4 of 84 
 
attorney in particular I do not think he will be here this 
morning.  We had indicated to him that he will start later 
because we will start with Mr Khoza this morning. 
 
So what we will be requesting from the Chairperson 
is to have Ms Naidoo’s evidence postponed to a later date 
and – ja we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does Ms Naidoo know why the affidavit 
was not ready on time so that we could have proceeded 
today? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not know whether she knows 
10 
Chairperson I have not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is she here? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not think she is.  No – I see the 
shaking of heads Chairperson I do not think she is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have not dealt with her directly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us – let – us deal with Mr 
Khoza’s evidence and then when we finish with it then you 
can raise the matter of Ms Naidoo again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On Mr Khoza Chairperson he – he is 
represented by Mr Cooper and I would like him to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Place himself on record. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 5 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Cooper would you like to place 
yourself on record?  You can do it from where you are if 
you are able to? 
ADV COOPER:  Yes good morning Chair.  It is Athisten 
Cooper from the firm Ka-Mbonane Cooper and I am Mr 
Khoza’s attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There was also an aspect Mr Cooper 
10 
and I were discussing before we start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is about also a default in regard to 
the filing of Mr Khoza’s affidavit on transactions.  Mr Khoza 
has 
duly 
cooperated 
and 
filed 
an 
affidavit 
on 
the 
suspensions 
and 
we 
followed 
up 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
transactions but that has not been forthcoming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the intention was we could touch 
on both the suspensions and the transactions today that 
20 
the failure to file on the transactions impacts on that plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And perhaps Mr Cooper could address 
the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When was he supposed to let the 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 6 of 84 
 
commission have his affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The date was – the first date given 
Chairperson was the 16 November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or on the 16 November I beg your 
pardon he was given a request for information with a due 
date of the 1 December to file the affidavit.  Mr Cooper can 
confirm that as well.  I do not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Cooper do you want to say 
something about the failure to file an affidavit dealing with 
transactions so far? 
ADV COOPER:  Yes Chair thanks.  So Chair the position of 
Mr Khoza has – has always been that – that he in 
conjunction with our firm has been in the process of 
preparing an affidavit.  The latest request for information 
with Mr Seleka and his team sent to Mr Khoza it traversed 
many issues not only the transactions which Mr Seleka is 
speaking about but there is probably about ten other 
20 
subject matters and that – that extends to subject matter 
which Mr Khoza is not offhand familiar with and it would 
require us to go through archives of documentation and 
source information and then prepare something. 
 
As of the 25 November we did communicate to the 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 7 of 84 
 
commission that at this stage Mr Khoza was not in a 
position to file an affidavit and we would once we have 
consulted with Mr Khoza further let the commission know of 
our – our position.   
 
On the 30 November we did receive a summons 
from the commission and in the summons it advised that Mr 
Khoza was required to appear at the commission on today 
– today and to address the affidavit which he has 
submitted to the commission and that affidavit being the 
affidavit on the suspension of the executives together with 
10 
the issues arising therefrom.   
 
So on that basis we were under the assumption that 
Mr Khoza would be asked to come here today to address 
his affidavit and we were not aware and we would have 
thought that we had the commission aware that we had not 
filed anything and we were not yet of a certainty to file an 
affidavit on the other issues.  And it is – and I must say 
again it is not merely just those two transactions those 
pre-payments but there is approximately ten other issues 
and ten isolated separate issues. 
20 
 
So that unfortunately that is our position today and 
I cannot take it much further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I suspect that the ten other issues you 
talking about would fall under the topic of transactions that 
Mr Seleka is talking about?  Ja, ja Mr Cooper. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 8 of 84 
 
ADV COOPER:  Chair if you just allow me to read some of 
the issues which arise in that – and these are the topics.  
Okay.  So some of the other issues are the addendum to 
the 
Hendrina 
Coal 
Supply 
Agreement 
naturally 
the 
guarantees and thereafter we go onto the T Systems 
contract. 
 
We 
talk 
about 
the 
Eskom 
and 
McKinsey 
[00:07:40] plan. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja 
all 
of 
those 
are 
– 
fall 
under 
transactions. But it is fine it is okay.  What I do gather from 
what you say and what Mr Seleka has said is that Mr Khoza 
10 
is giving his cooperation to the commission.  There may 
have been some hitches and misunderstanding about what 
his evidence would cover today and you may be needing 
more – you may have needed more time to prepare the – 
an affidavit that deals with other matters.  That is what I 
am gathering.  Is that correct? 
ADV COOPER:  Yes Chair that is our position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think that it is fine we will cover 
the suspensions today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you and Mr Seleka must finalise the 
date by when the other affidavit must be filed.  And if you 
do not reach agreement then I will fix the date.  We do not 
have time.  The commission is running out of time for oral 
evidence.  We were meant to finish all oral evidence by 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 9 of 84 
 
end of this year which is end of this month effectively next 
week.  We find ourselves having to go into next year in 
regard to some witnesses which we would want – we 
wanted to avoid.  So there is – there are serious time 
constraints.  So that should just be borne in mind in ting to 
assist the commission with your affidavit and also on the 
deadline.  So it should not be too long.  Okay.  Alright.  
Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
10 
MR KHOZA:  Thank you Chair.  I suppose Mr Khoza will be 
prepared to take the affirmation or the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR KHOZA:  Zethembe Wilfred Khoza. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
20 
your conscience? 
MR KHOZA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 10 of 84 
 
say, so help me God. 
MR KHOZA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Khoza; you may be seated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
we will use the bundle, Eskom Bundle 14 – Eskom Bundle 
14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Mr Khoza’s exhibit is – affidavit is 
found in Exhibit U30.  You found it Mr Khoza?  Mr Khoza 
the affidavit starts on page 273.  Now that is the black 
10 
pagination on the top left hand corner.  Please assist Mr 
Khoza quickly.  
MR KHOZA:  Yes correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have found it there.  Thank you.  
So the affidavit starts there – it runs up to page 286 – 286.   
MR KHOZA:  Ja that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that.  There is a signature 
there by the deponent.  Is that your signature? 
MR KHOZA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm that.  The affidavit is dated 
20 
21 October 2020.  You confirm that this is your affidavit Mr 
Khoza? 
MR KHOZA:  Confirmed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson I will beg 
leave to have the affidavit admitted as Exhibit 30.1. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 11 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Zethembe Wilfred 
Khoza started at page 273 is admitted as Exhibit U34.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  30 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  30? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja – 30.  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that will be U30.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Khoza just by way 
of a background we will then as you have heard this 
morning being discussed confine ourselves for now to the 
issue of suspensions.  A lot of evidence has been led 
10 
already before the commission and most of which has 
become common cause if you one looks at the evidence. 
 
So just by way of a background Mr Khoza we see 
from the evidence that you were one of the board members 
newly appointed to the Eskom board on the 11 December 
2014. 
MR KHOZA:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Could you tell the Chairperson how 
did you become appointed to serve on the board? 
MR KHOZA:  Okay we were – as I said I retired from 
20 
Telkom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please address the Chairperson. 
MR KHOZA:  I retired from Telkom and since Telkom was a 
public service quite a number of people knew me and I 
received quite a number of requests to serve on the boards 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 12 of 84 
 
for public and private and Eskom was one of them.   
 
I used to accept the nomination and submit my CV 
and that is what I did even on Eskom and then I received 
the invitation to serve in Eskom from the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you received nominations to serve? 
MR KHOZA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where would you have received the 
nominations from? 
MR KHOZA:  As I said I received quite a number of them.  
Even though I cannot recall individually but I did fill out the 
10 
documentation should be available because I did not keep 
a copy at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So prior to – or at the time when you 
are appointed to serve on the board of Eskom where were 
you working? 
MR KHOZA:  No I was retired at home. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were retired. 
MR KHOZA:  And I was doing just small construction work 
as a sub-contractor on existing contractors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And prior to your retirement where 
20 
were you working? 
MR KHOZA:  I was working at Telkom SA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you – oh sorry in what position? 
MR KHOZA:  I serve as a Managing Executive for 
Customer Services. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 13 of 84 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know any of the board 
members 
you 
served 
with 
at 
Eskom 
prior 
to 
your 
appointment? 
MR KHOZA:  Not really.  The only person that I met during 
our – was Mark Pamensky.  Mark Pamensky was working 
for Blue Label at the time and Blue Label was distributing 
our prepaid cards and prepaid phones.  So now and then in 
maybe 
once 
a year 
we used to meet with all the 
distributors to get their concerns and also to set the 
targets for the other year. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you came to know him in those 
interactions? 
MR KHOZA:  Yes professionally I knew him there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know Dr Ngubane? 
MR KHOZA:  No I did not know Dr Ngubane personally or 
ever work with him close.  I knew him as a chairperson and 
as a Premier and as a Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  A chairperson of? 
MR KHOZA:  SABC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you never knew him personally? 
20 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know Kumalo – Romeo 
Kumalo? 
MR KHOZA:  No I knew Mr Kumalo as a – he was Vodacom 
and he was a competitor so we now and then we used to 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 14 of 84 
 
monitor how they the business. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But did you know him? 
MR KHOZA:  Not personally.  I never met or talked to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You never met with him? 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Venete Klein? 
MR KHOZA:  No we have not met. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Verushni Naidoo? 
MR KHOZA:  No we did not meet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mariam Cussim? 
10 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think did he not say Mr Seleka he only 
knew Mr Pamensky? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Out of the board members he did not 
know them.  Is that correct Mr Khoza? 
MR KHOZA:  Yes Sir that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  You – did you know 
the Gupta brothers? 
20 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You never dealt with them? 
MR KHOZA:  No I never met them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You never met them? 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 15 of 84 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Have you ever spoke with them on the 
phone? 
MR KHOZA:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know the evidence of Mr Khulani 
Qoma – Qoma? 
MR KHOZA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That the board meeting where Mr Koko 
was about to be suspended you walked out and called one 
of the Gupta brothers and after you called him the Gupta 
brother called the Minister – Minister Brown.  Minister 
10 
Brown 
then 
called 
Dr 
Ngubane 
who 
apparently 
communicated 
to 
him 
that 
Mr 
Koko 
should 
not 
be 
suspended and that is what happened. 
ADV COOPER:  Chair if I may interject? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV COOPER:  Chair the question Mr Seleka is asking Mr 
Khoza is something that was put to Mr Khoza a few days 
ago – probably a week in the form of that affidavit and we 
have not addressed that affidavit.  And Mr Khoza is intent 
on addressing that affidavit – the specific one on Mr Qoma 
20 
so if I may suggest on Mr Khoza’s behalf that perhaps that 
be something that is also addressed and I was under the 
impression that we were just discussing the suspension 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the suspensions would include that 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 16 of 84 
 
type of question.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Thank you Chair.  The – yes I 
communicated with the attorneys for Mr Khoza a while back 
before we formally got the affidavit from Mr Qoma  That 
while back included the evidence of Mr Qoma at the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee and I forewarned that 
this issue will be pursued but we will be provided with an 
affidavit in due course by Mr Qoma which we did finally 
gave it to him but the information had already been shared 
with them because Mr Qoma does not say anything 
10 
different in the evidence – in the affidavit here.  B 
 
But this is relevant to the suspension Chairperson 
in this way.  And I do not know why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the story about a request for an 
affidavit that as I understand Mr Cooper seems to be 
recent.  Was the request for an affidavit recent? 
MR KHOZA:  No the – at the very beginning Chairperson in 
my email to respondents I had requested that this issue be 
addressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  In his affidavit? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In Mr Khoza’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So before he filed this affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before he files this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because I – I had communication 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 17 of 84 
 
directly with Mr Khoza prior to him invoking … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Being represented. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I send an email to both ultimately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which they saw and the issue was 
pertinently raised as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Cooper what do you say?  Mr 
Seleka says before this affidavit was filed he had raised 
the issue directly with Mr Khoza in an email to say this 
issue should be addressed in the affidavit.  I do not – I did 
not see anything addressing it in the affidavit but obviously 
that cannot be a reason for the question not to be asked. 
ADV COOPER:  Chair we – we are not suggested that any 
questions should not be asked just for a matter of 
housekeeping.  Mr Qoma’s affidavit was given to Mr Khoza 
but not with – with an accompany Rule 3.3 Notice 
20 
requesting him to address it and perhaps by coincidence 
yesterday we sent correspondence to Mr Seleka and his 
team requesting them to let us know if they expect Mr 
Khoza to address Mr Qoma’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If they had – have they had raised it 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 18 of 84 
 
obviously it needed to be addressed is it not? 
ADV COOPER:  Well I would have expected or Mr Khoza 
would have expected a Rule 3 Notice to be accompanied as 
it was in previous times and based off of those Rule 3.3 
Notices that was when we – we responded with an affidavit 
addressing and – those specific affidavits which are 
attached to those Rule 3.3 Notices.  On this occasion 
however we did not receive anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay I – as long as he was alerted 
that this would be raised I will allow that question because 
10 
what is important is that you have an idea what your – you 
will be questioned about. Okay let us carry on.  So I will 
allow that question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank – thank you Chair.  Yes Mr 
Khoza that is the question should I repeat it or you know 
the question?  In fact I believe Mr Qoma says you were the 
one who told him the story. 
MR KHOZA:  That is not correct.  I addressed the same 
issue because the first time I heard about the issue was in 
the Portfolio Committee Inquiry and I did indicate to say I 
20 
never said it and I never done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the allegation that when Mr Koko 
was before the committee would – that would have been 
the P&G Committee? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the board Chairperson. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 19 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the board – he was before the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  He was about to be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
The 
board 
had 
called 
him 
for 
suspension and… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Were 
they 
not 
called 
before 
the 
Committee rather than the board?  I was under the 
impression that the actual – the executives who were 
suspended were called before the P&G Committee rather 
than the board? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh not that suspension Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh another suspension? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a different suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  After Mr – Mr Koko had come back from 
this one.  Mr Khoza you could assist there because 
apparently… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well if it was another suspension 
not the suspension that I am talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it may well be that you may be 
going out of the scope because I am talking about these 
suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the executives and Koko – Mr Koko 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 20 of 84 
 
was one of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if – but if it was a separate 
suspension that has got nothing to do with the suspension 
of the executives on the 11 March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you may be – the question might be 
falling outside these suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Through the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my  - I thought you were talking about 
10 
these suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  No it was raised only to show the 
connection with the Gupta brothers Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not – not for the suspension per se.  
But that Mr Khoza might have had some communication 
directly with the Gupta brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well maybe when he comes back you 
20 
can – you can deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you – Mr Khoza and you will 
address it further in your affidavit in due course. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 21 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Have you had any dealings with Mr 
Salim Essa or any interaction with him? 
MR KHOZA:  No, no interaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now let us deal with quickly the 
suspension issues.  We understand that the board which 
started on the 11 December 2014 had its induction on the 
26 t h or is it the 16 January 2015? 
MR KHOZA:  January. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That board had a scheduled meeting on 
10 
the 26 February 2015.  You recall that? 
MR KHOZA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that – that meeting was cancelled 
on short notice. 
MR KHOZA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The next meeting the board would have 
which was a special meeting was called on the 9 t h – 
convened on the 9 t h March 2015.  You remember that? 
MR KHOZA:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this meeting… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Seleka I do not know if there is 
much with regard to the meeting of the 9 t h that you really 
want to explore? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you not go straight to the 11 t h. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 22 of 84 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the 10 t h and the 11 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am just following the sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us go to the real issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Should we go to the/// 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  And in that meeting – 
the meeting of the 9 t h or the attitude of the board on the 9 t h 
cost ultimately the meeting to be called with the Minister 
on the 11 March 2015, recall that? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then on – in that meeting of the 11 t h.   
The minister comes.  There are various meetings on the 11t h.  
But the key meeting is where the minister is present.  And 
you deal with that in your affidavit.  And perhaps you could 
then relay to the Chairperson what, in you recollection, did 
the minister discuss with the board. 
MR KHOZA:   The minister came to the meeting and the key-
issues that the minister discussed, it was a concern in terms 
of the operations of Eskom.  The issue of the load shedding 
20 
was affecting the country, the economy and the people of 
South Africa. 
 
The second one.  The financial issues at the time.  The 
minister stated that they received an email or an advice to 
say Eskom is unable to pay the salaries by end of March and 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 23 of 84 
 
all other financial constraints that the company existed at the 
time.   
 
The minister felt that we need to do a deep-dive into the 
organisation so that we understand the issues on a first-
hand basis and we are able to resolve the issues. 
 
And the areas that were identified that the minister 
spoke to.  She spoke about the finance, she spoke about the 
load shedding, she spoke about the delay in a build 
programme which was yield to a huge costs. 
 
She spoke about the issues that were taken place in 
10 
procurement that has been on the media or been a concern 
in the organisation and the functioning of the organisation at 
the time.   
 
And the investigation should not be interfered by 
management.  It is supposed to be seen to be independent 
and give the board the basis to understand. 
 
The minister further stated that, she is not there to tell 
the board what to do but it is up to the board to apply their 
mind to do a deep-dive into the organisation so that they 
understand the issues on a first-hand basis. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So there seems to be – what is it – 
ambivalence in what you are saying about the minister there.  
On the one hand, he says she cannot dictate to the board.  
On the other, you have said that she identifies certain areas 
within Eskom which she considered problematic. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 24 of 84 
 
 
She said the executives should not impede the inquiry 
and you ultimately say, although she did not direct, it was 
clear that she wanted the board to read between the lines. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what do you think you needed to 
read between the lines? 
MR KHOZA:   Because...  As I said, the first meeting of the 
9t h, the chairperson did address us about the issues that 
were taking place in our organisation.  And he did mention 
the issue of having an inquiry which is...   
10 
 
And that is going to be – seem to be credible, according 
to the words of the chairperson.  And we felt at the time, we 
did not have enough time ourselves as the board to 
deliberate issues amongst ourselves.   
 
We have not even met as the board, as the board 
meeting was for the 26t h.  Therefore, we might not have 
enough information at hand.   
 
However, the insistence of the chairperson to say he has 
got instruction from the minister and the president at the 
time.   
20 
 
Even some board members did argue why the need on 
just 
resolution, 
to 
say 
as 
per 
instruction 
from 
the 
shareholder, then we must do the inquiry because we might 
not have enough information at the time.   
 
And we have not sat as the board to set up the strategy, 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 25 of 84 
 
how we are going to deal with the issues, how we are going 
to deal with the sub-committees and engage the executives 
in terms of the issues that we have seen.  We never debated 
amongst the executives to find out the first-hand information.   
 
So as the minister went and spoke in the same manner 
as the chairperson, that gave us the assurance to say the 
shareholder is aware. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, in other words, when the minister 
came there, she was consistent with what Mr Tsotsi had said 
in the meeting of the 9t h? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  and that resulted in the board 
deciding on the inquiry as well as the suspension of the 
executives? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you had the confidence to do that 
after the minister had addressed you? 
MR KHOZA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You had the confidence to do so after 
the minister had addressed you? 
20 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that in paragraph 38, page 281 of 
your affidavit, you also say that it was the minister who 
raised concerns about the area of finance.  That is 281, 38. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 26 of 84 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So is that what led to the 
suspension of the financial director? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the minister talk about suspension? 
MR KHOZA:   Even though it was not explicit, but the fact 
that the executive should be set aside so that the inquiry 
carries on with the full credibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, did she talk about the executives of 
some members of the executives stepping aside? 
MR KHOZA:   It was said that the executive in the 
10 
environment that are going to be investigated, needs to step 
aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To step aside? 
MR KHOZA:   To step aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that come from the minister or did that 
come from some of the board members? 
MR KHOZA:   No, it did in the same point came from the 
minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the minister? 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  At that stage, what was your 
understanding by the time the minister left the meeting, what 
was your understanding of how many executives would need 
to be suspended or would need to step aside and who were 
those on your understanding? 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 27 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   On my understanding at the time as it was 
presented before, it was supposed to be the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Matona? 
MR KHOZA:   Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KHOZA:   And Mr Marokane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   And Mr Matjila. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was supposed to be the three? 
MR KHOZA:   That is the three that was mentioned earlier. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KHOZA:   By the chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But that was also the feeling when we left the 
building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in the meeting of the board that took 
place before the minister came, was there mention of the 
suspensions at that stage or not? 
MR KHOZA:   It was a mention of the environment which was 
affected. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the stepping aside or the 
suspension? 
MR KHOZA:   No, it was not mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As yet. 
MR KHOZA:   No. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 28 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not – the stepping aside of the 
executives was mentioned for the first time during the 
meeting with the minister? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and it was three executives who 
were to step aside as you understood the position? 
MR KHOZA:   As I said, even though it was not explicit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But it was the in the environment which was 
mentioned earlier ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   ...to have in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   Which led us to request the minister to come 
and address us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am saying is.  On your 
understanding. 
 
By 
the 
time 
the 
minister 
left, 
your 
understanding was that certain executives needed to step 
aside.  Is that right? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that there were three of them.  Was 
that the correct number, at you understood the position at 
that time? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And do you recall who they were at 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 29 of 84 
 
that time or you did not know their names but you knew it 
was going to be three executives? 
MR KHOZA:   No, I did not know their names at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but you knew it was three? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know to which portfolios they 
were attached at that stage? 
MR KHOZA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So which departments they were in charge 
of.  Is that something you knew or you are not – you cannot 
10 
remember? 
MR KHOZA:   At the time, it was not clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.   
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Khoza...  Thank you Chair.  
Mr Khoza, maybe you need to clarify to the Chairperson 
because in your affidavit it appears that when the minister 
left, four areas had been identified.   
 
And that even though some board members were against 
20 
the suspension of the FD, because the minister had raised 
concerns in regard to it, you decided to have her suspended.   
 
So it seems after the minister had left and I want you to 
clarify to the DCJ.  Is this correct, that when she left, you 
knew that four – she had raised four areas of concern as 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 30 of 84 
 
opposed to only three. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct.  The minister had a concern on 
four areas. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And are you saying at the time, you did 
not know who occupied these areas? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the finance director, you would have 
known, the CFO.  Because she was in the meeting on the 
9t h, she was in the meeting of the 11t h which took place in 
the morning.  So you would have known your finance 
10 
director? 
MR KHOZA:   No, you...  Definitely, you could know the 
individual.  As I said, at the time, the FD – we knew the FD 
is the Financial Director. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   We knew the CEO’s. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   That was the CEO.  But what I am saying, in 
the meeting that we had on the 9t h, there was no name 
attached and there was no talking about the suspension of 
20 
the executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Okay.  I see.  But fair enough.  I 
understand.   
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC: But then on the 11t h, you would have 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 31 of 84 
 
known.  Oh, if these areas are the ones identified, then Mr 
so and so is in that area.  Mister so and so is that area.  So 
they are the one perceptible to suspension.   
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that correct? 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Now that is interesting from the 
point of view of what you say Mr Tsotsi has said because 
when Mr Tsotsi was deliberating with the board, he says he 
had three persons in mind to step – for them to step aside.  
10 
Do you recall that? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That he had three persons in mind? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When the minister leaves the meeting 
after the 11t h, now there are four persons to be suspended.  I 
mean, there are talks between the board about the fourth 
person but ultimately she also gets suspended.  Do you 
remember that? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Mr Tsotsi, on his evidence, says his 
instructions came from a meeting in a Durban where he met 
with the president and Ms Dudu Myeni.  That is President 
Jacob Zuma at the time and Ms Dudu Myeni.  And he was 
given three names there.  Remember, he came to the 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 32 of 84 
 
meeting and said it is an instruction from the president? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The outcome of the meeting of the 11t h 
is curios in this sense.  On the evidence of Ms Suzanne 
Daniels, she says on the 10t h she is called to Melrose Arch.  
You would have heard her evidence? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, I heard. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  She is called to Melrose Arch by 
Mr Koko 
and 
there 
she 
meets 
with 
Mr 
Koko 
and 
Mr Salim Essa and in that meeting being asked about the 
10 
process for suspensions.  She is also told four executives 
will be suspended.  Four, not three.  And the names are 
given.   
 
It turned about to be exactly the executives that the 
board will ultimately suspend.  And Salim Essa, apparently, 
according to Ms Suzanne Daniels, introduced himself to her 
as the minister’s advisor.  Minister Lynne Brown’s advisor.   
 
So it is a coincidence that the minister comes to the 
meeting and articulates not three but four areas of concern 
which is consistent with what Ms Suzanne Daniels said she 
20 
was told at Melrose Arch?   
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
Is 
it 
a 
coincidence 
or 
is 
it 
an 
orchestration?   
MR KHOZA:   [No audible reply]  
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 33 of 84 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What do you say to the Chairperson? 
MR KHOZA:   I do not think I can comment on that because 
the minister, I think, spoke as a shareholder and when she 
mentioned the issues about the finance, she was specific to 
say she received a request or instruction or a say which 
state that they might be unable to pay the salaries by the 
end of March.   
 
So that was a specific issue that she mentioned.  So 
what is in her mind and what is Suzanne Daniels comes up, I 
do not think I qualify to comment on that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, you would be concerned, would 
you not, if somebody from outside of Eskom knew on the 
10t h of March that certain executives were to suspended and 
that is somebody outside of Eskom, outside of government 
and was, according to Ms Daniels, asking for advice as to 
what procedure should be followed if you want to suspend 
executives at Eskom.  You would be concerned about that, 
would you not? 
20 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, definitely I will be concerned about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because at that stage, the – you as a 
member of the board did not know anything about any plans 
for the suspension of any executives on the 10t h? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 34 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And you see, Ms Daniels tells one of 
the executives, would be suspended executives about what 
she had been told at Melrose Arch, Mr Dan Marokane who in 
turns, tells Ms Tsholofele Molefe.  And this happens the night 
before. 
10 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
So 
at 
the 
dawn 
of 
the 
11t h of March 2015, these people know only by reason of that 
they are going – they might be suspended or they will be 
suspended. 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Mr Khoza, did you as the board 
questioned the minister in regard to the suspensions? 
MR KHOZA:   I think the – because the minister did explicitly 
said so and so and so and so needs to be suspended or be 
20 
suspended.  She left it to the board to apply their mind and 
make their decisions.  And even state that she is going to be 
around and available to hear or if we need her.  It is difficult 
to create the opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Khoza.  It is clear from your 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 35 of 84 
 
affidavit, is it not, that even though the minister may not 
have expressly said there should be suspensions.  It is clear 
from your affidavit that your understanding was that that is 
the direction the minister wanted the board to take. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, it was my opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So if you thought that the minister 
wanted the board to take a certain direction, you would be 
entitled to question the minister on that, is it not?   
10 
 
Because you would be able to say:  Minister, I hear that 
you say you do not intend to instruct the board as to what it 
should do and that they need to apply its mind to the issues 
and make its decision.   
 
But when you say A, B, C, D it is clear that, as far as 
you are concerned, there should be suspensions.  And then 
question him.   
 
Would you not have been able to say to – to do that? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct.  I think maybe at the time, we 
did not ask such questions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
MR KHOZA:   There was a lot of debate with the minister 
and other questions that we asked the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But maybe I do not recall us going across like 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 36 of 84 
 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, part of the concern that I 
have is that what does come out, both – what does come out 
of your affidavit, which I have read, as well as the evidence 
of some of the board members, including Dr Ngubane, is 
that. 
 
One gets the impression that maybe the whole board or 
some members of the board thought:  Well, if that is what the 
shareholder wants, if that is what the minister wants, then 
we will fall in line.   
10 
 
Without interrogating the need for certain things to be 
done and the justifiability of those things being done.  What 
do you say to that? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct.  As I said, the – on the 9t h 
when we questioned the chairperson, he was explicit to say 
his instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KHOZA:   And his instruction from the shareholder and 
the presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR KHOZA:   So that is where we felt uncomfortable to say:  
Is it correct?  Is it definitely the minister?  And the minister - 
then we find – it is better to call the minister as we cannot 
question the president. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 37 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   Because it is our shareholder and was 
available in our meeting, the induction meeting and was 
willing to discuss the issues with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KHOZA:   So when it comes like that, one would form an 
opinion to say, since it was an instruction and you have 
verified(?) that the minister is aware of the environment and 
the possible suspensions, that is sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KHOZA:   And the fact that she left it to the board to say 
10 
he cannot instruct the board or dictate what the board is 
supposed to do.  It is up to the board to deliberate and come 
with it.  So I felt that it was left up to us as the board to 
make decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So you say to the chairperson 
ultimately the decision was the board's decision. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Even though the platform for the 
decision making was created by the minister.  She gave you 
20 
the platform under which you could make the decision by 
telling you of the problematic areas. 
MR KHOZA:   As I said, the chairperson and the minister 
speak from the position of authority. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 38 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   Then they can really influence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one of the points you made earlier 
was that one the 9t h, you or some members of the board felt 
that they were still too new at Eskom, which was true, was it 
not? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You probably still needed quite some 
time to understand how Eskom works and to understand all 
the issues.  Do you not feel so? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   We did.  But when we looked at the MOU 
which said if maybe the company is not operating efficiently, 
it has got financial difficulties, the minister can intervene or 
the shareholder can intervene.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KHOZA:   In my view, I see that in that point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KHOZA:   To say maybe that is an intervention which is 
required to address the situation at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Of course, if that is the 
20 
situation, then the minister would instruct you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not?  If it is a situation which is 
provided for in the Memorandum of Incorporation, then he 
can say this is what must be done.  
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 39 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But here he was – she was not saying 
that.  She was saying:  I am not instructing you.  So 
obviously, it was not that situation.  Do you not agree? 
MR KHOZA:   I do agree but taking into account that we 
were just being appointed and maybe it was the first time 
before we even interacted as a board, the chairperson 
presented this dilemma and now we are meeting the 
minister.   
 
Maybe because of that, we could not have developed 
10 
such good dialogues with the minister.  So we felt, because 
the chairperson already laid down the grounds and indicated 
that it was an instruction ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which the minister was not confirming. 
MR KHOZA:   Even though ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said the minister said:  I am not 
instructing you. 
MR KHOZA:   As I said, technically and politically you can 
pass the statement without...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
20 
MR KHOZA:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you able to say the minister 
confirmed that – confirmed what Mr Tsotsi had told you on 
the 9t h, namely that she was instructing you, the board to do 
A, B, C, D?  Are you able to say that? 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 40 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   No, I cannot say that.  Because what I say 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, what Mr Tsotsi said on the 9t h, namely 
it was an instruction from the minister to the extent that he 
said that, that was not confirmed by the minister expressly, 
at least. 
MR KHOZA:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But are you able to say, implying she 
did confirm it or are you not able to say that? 
MR KHOZA:   I can say so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR KHOZA:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us move on Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the executives gets suspended and 
they are paid to stay at home.  Mr Khoza, is that right?  They 
were suspended on full pay.  They were suspended on full 
pay. 
20 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And they write letters.  At least two 
of them write letters.  But one of them takes you to court and 
take you to the CCMA.  The indication is they want to come 
back to work.   
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 41 of 84 
 
 
They want to come to their employment but instead the 
board engages in what you referred to as exit meetings in 
your affidavit.  What was the reason for exiting them? 
MR KHOZA:   As I said, one of the board member, I think it 
was Mr Khumalo, raised it in our meeting to say he had 
interacted with some of the executives and the intend or the 
inclination is that they would like to separate with the 
company as this was damaging their names in the market 
and the inquiry was going to take long, up to three months, 
which they cannot keep their lives on hold for so long.   
10 
 
That was mentioned in the meeting which led to a 
resolution by the board to say, if then, then we must look at 
the separation agreement.  
 
And there was a board meeting and there was a round 
robin which then requested the three of our members, 
executives to engage on separation if need be. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I have noticed in your affidavit, like 
other directors who have come to testify, they do not put a 
date when exactly was this indication made to them that the 
executives want to separate.  Can you recall when? 
20 
MR KHOZA:   I think the board resolution was on the 
4t h of May.  If I am not mistaken.  Or the 4 t h or 5t h of May.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the resolution that authorised some 
of the board members to engage in discussions with the 
suspended executives? 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 42 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Yes, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But you see, on the 4t h of May 
already, meetings had been arranged.  Let me put it this way.  
Before the 4t h of May, Ms Suzanne Daniels says she was 
instructed to arrange meetings for the 4t h of May where the 
executives would be engaged in, what you referred to as exit 
meetings.  So it seems to have been done before the 
4t h of May. 
MR KHOZA:   Okay.  I cannot comment on that.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You cannot ...[intervenes]  
MR KHOZA:   If it is a fact, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And Ms Molefe has testified here 
and in her affidavit also, she says: 
“When I arrived at the meeting of the 4t h of May, 
Mr Khumalo did this opening statement (that she 
understands) that I want to separate from the 
company.” 
 
And she says: 
But I told him no.  You are misconstruing my letters 
20 
to the company.  I want the company to provide me 
with the terms of reference for this investigation that 
is being appointed and because I hear conflicting 
views.  Give me the right reasons why you have 
suspended me.  I do not want to leave.  I want to 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 43 of 84 
 
come back. 
 
Were you in that meeting? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, I was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You heard her say these things? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, she said so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So clearly, she wanted to come 
back.  Because I see in your affidavit you say only Mr Koko 
wanted to come back.  So that cannot be correct. 
MR KHOZA:   At the time.  At the time.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what I am saying ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which time? 
MR KHOZA:   The meeting of the 4t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the meeting of the 4 t h ...[intervenes]  
MR KHOZA:   Which ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Ms Molefe indicated that she wanted to 
come back. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
20 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I also understood your affidavit to be 
suggesting that none of the executives, except for Mr Koko, 
indicated that they wanted to come back.  That is my 
understanding of your affidavit as well.  Did I misunderstand 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 44 of 84 
 
it or is there something that I am missing? 
MR KHOZA:   I think it is a time lapse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   Because – eventually, I think the approach 
was, she was willing to go later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But ...[intervenes]  
MR KHOZA:   At that time ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...at the first meeting, she did not want. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now why did you not as representatives of 
the board accept if she said I want to come back and say:  
Okay, there is no problem with that.  We do not have a 
problem with you coming back as long as it is after the 
investigation 
has 
been 
completed. 
 
And 
stop 
the 
negotiations.  Why did you not do that? 
MR KHOZA:   I think after she mentioned that, there was not 
much discussions.  I think the meeting stopped with her.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is not the recollection.  My 
recollection of the evidence of one of the witnesses who was 
20 
there.  Is it Ms Klein? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Klein? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, she was also there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And certainly, Ms Molefe, in her 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 45 of 84 
 
evidence, suggested that Mr Romeo Khumalo kind of 
marched 
her 
towards 
accepting 
that 
there 
should 
be 
discussions about exit.  Am I right Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you remember that?  I think 
Ms Molefe said something like Mr Romeo Khumalo said to 
her something like:  You the inquiry, the investigation could 
take quite some time.  So maybe we should talk about 
separation or your exit.  Do you remember anything along 
those lines? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   In my understanding that was an opening 
statement which was made by Mr Kumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR KHOZA:   Because he made an opening statement and 
then she had to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KHOZA:   And after she responded I think she was 
quite upset. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   And the meeting did not go further than that 
20 
after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But initially that was what the opening 
statement of Mr Kumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So are you saying that Mr Kumalo 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 46 of 84 
 
did not after Ms Molefe had made her remarks did not 
pursue the matter of discussing her possible exit on that 
day. 
MR KHOZA:   No, in my recollection he did not insist after 
she mentioned it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KHOZA:   It was part of his opening statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now just tell me this, his opening 
statement as far as you are able to remember, what did he 
say? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   I think he mentioned the suspensions and 
the difficulties that the board gone through and the fact 
that it was rushed to the executives and he understand that 
the executives are not comfortable, etcetera.  And he 
indicated to say the inquiry might take little bit longer than 
expected and there are requests that has gone to the 
Chairperson or said that people want to settle and hence 
we came with the proposal for settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the gist as you remember it. 
MR KHOZA:   As I recall it.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So when did you have 
another meeting with Ms Molefe or somebody from the 
board have another meeting? 
MR KHOZA:   Thereafter I think there was a communication 
between the Chairperson of the People in Governance 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 47 of 84 
 
which is Venete Klein with all the correspondence.  The 
only time I saw a correspondence from her was on the 25 
May which I then at the time responded to it on the 3 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So at what stage on your 
recollection did she indicate her willingness to leave, that 
is Ms Molefe. 
MR KHOZA:   I think it was after the 3 r d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the 3 June?  
MR KHOZA:   After the 3 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, but in the meantime there had 
10 
been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between herself and 
…[intervenes] 
MR KHOZA:   Communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Communication between herself and Ms 
Klein or Mr Kumalo. 
MR KHOZA:   Especially with Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KHOZA:   Because I think she was asking questions on 
the 25 May of the settlement, of the bonuses and etcetera, 
etcetera that was list in that particular one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   So it was just looking at the administration 
and the benefits that are associated with the settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 48 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why did – oh, I understand from your 
affidavit that the board, when it suspended the executives, 
as far you know, had no problem with them coming back in 
due course. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why then did the board want to spend 
money to facilitate their exit if they wanted to leave? 
MR KHOZA:   I thought maybe at the time, as I said, some 
of them did allude to their letters to say maybe the 
relationship between the board and themselves they felt is 
10 
broken and they felt that maybe the board does not need 
them anymore.  So based on that, I think that is where the 
decision was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you think the board still needed 
them? 
MR KHOZA:   To my view, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why did it not say to them we need 
you, there is no need for you to go, there is no need for – 
why did it not take the view that Eskom does not have 
money, it is going through financial difficulties, there is no 
20 
need for Eskom to spend money to facilitate the exit of 
people that it needs. 
MR KHOZA:   I think the agency that was expected 
because they were suspended for three months pending 
the investigation and the enquiry started quite earlier, 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 49 of 84 
 
when the investigation was still carrying on and some of 
them were not prepared to wait till the end.  That is my 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but then that is their problem, is it 
not?  If you, as the board, still needed them, still needed 
their services and they wanted to leave then that is their 
problem, why should you give them money to leave when 
you do not want them to leave? 
MR KHOZA:   As I said maybe because it was raised to say 
maybe 
the 
trust 
relationship 
has 
been 
broken 
and 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as the board was concerned had 
the trust relationship been broken? 
MR KHOZA:   No, I think on the emails, on the 
correspondence, it was indicating to say that is how the 
executive felt and so because that is how felt then the 
board have decided on that what do you call, a round 
robin, for the particular board members to go and engage 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I leave aside the question of which 
20 
executives said that.  I leave that aside for the time being 
but you, as the board, did not believe that there was any 
relationship that was broken or any trust that was broken, 
am I right? 
MR KHOZA:   In terms of the investigation that is correct. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 50 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But in terms of the influence that was 
created by the Chairperson at the BM of the 9 t h it indicated 
some issue about management that I think were still needs 
to be addressed and the fact that the Chairperson said is a 
lot of issues that needs to be dealt with and is crafted in a 
document which was available that does not needs to 
charge individually at the time when we suspend them.   
I do not know whether those things does indeed 
influence the board but at no stage we discussed the issue 
10 
of charging individuals even though we did raise it on the 
11 t h to say why we do not – we suspend them to say 
pending the investigation or they just put aside, if we have 
got issues let us just charge them but then the feeling at 
the time said we do not have information on that.  So that 
might have created a perception. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you, as a board had not taken 
any view, had you? 
MR KHOZA:   No we did not take any view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The relationship between the board and 
20 
these executives had broken. 
MR KHOZA:   No, we did not take a view or any resolution.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, actually you did not even 
discuss that aspect, did you? 
MR KHOZA:   No, we did not. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 51 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not. 
MR KHOZA:   Until we find that request and the discussion 
with Mr Kumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then you took the decision 
that you must pay, offer them money so that they could 
leave Eskom, is that right, as a board? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct, it was a normal settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  What were you settling? 
MR KHOZA:   According to the advice that we got at the 
time from the experts in HR or whatever, is just to say 
10 
normally if there is a dispute of this particular nature they 
go the settlement route and the proposal of the settlement 
route was then discussed at the board and the board 
agreed to 12 months and with certain benefits should they 
have and that and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the board had no dispute with these 
executives, as I understand the position, you enter into a 
settlement if there is a dispute, is it not, to settle that 
dispute, is it not? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what dispute was that between the 
board and these executives?  
MR KHOZA:   There was no dispute at the time because – 
but the issue was that they are suspended and the 
executives were not happy for being suspended. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 52 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but otherwise there was no dispute. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the board was going to be happy for 
them to come back and I assume if at that time after they 
had come back the board had grounds to say some of them 
must be charged with misconduct, that would be a separate 
issue. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the suspension was never meant to 
be used to charge them in terms of misconduct. 
10 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So we come back to the question 
that I posed to Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein that I do not 
understand why the board decided to spend as much 
money as it did, millions of rands, to pay these executives, 
these three executives to get them to leave when they say 
and you say – certainly Dr Ngubane says and you say we 
had 
no 
problem 
with 
them 
coming 
back 
after 
the 
investigation had been completed.  I mean, I am sure you 
know this having worked in the corporate world at high 
20 
level that an employer would pay an employee some money 
if the employer does not want the employee to continue 
and the employee still wants to come back.  So there you 
have that tension, the employer does not want this 
employee anymore, the employee wants to continue.  So 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 53 of 84 
 
the employer then says okay, I am offering you so much, if 
you accept it you must sign that you will resign, you will 
leave.  So that is understandable but where you, as the 
board, say to me we did not want them to leave, we were 
happy for them to come back and yet you go ahead and 
pay as much money as you paid them for them to leave.  I 
do not understand it.  Are you able to defend this decision? 
MR KHOZA:   I am not defending the decision, I think 
maybe the issues that took place, the noise that was on 
the media and maybe dissatisfaction of the executives and 
10 
maybe later to the board when the letters were coming in 
or whether people were talking to Romeo suggesting that 
they resolve to make sure that at least let us offer them the 
package with those who wants to go so that they can go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But then nobody in the board out of so 
many people, nobody says it does not make sense that we 
should pay people who we feel – who we have no problem 
coming back, we should pay them so much money.  Why 
are we paying them?  If they want to leave let them leave, 
let them resign like everybody resigns if they want to leave 
20 
and explore other opportunities, we do not have to pay 
them, why must we pay them?  Nobody says that. 
MR KHOZA:   I think the challenge is that most of the 
issues and debate were – took place on the 11 t h on the day 
when 
they 
were 
suspended. 
 
There 
was 
a 
lot 
of 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 54 of 84 
 
disagreement between the board – between some of the 
board members and the Chairperson or did not agree with 
the process.  However, eventually, we agreed - they agreed 
with the process and when at the end of the day the 
documentation that was supposed to be submitted, which 
Dr Tsotsi said it is available, does not come forth, I think 
that was well discouraged the board members. 
 
So, as I said, it can be a number of things that 
might have - in the minds of people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, in the end if the board 
10 
makes a decision they must be able to defend it, they must 
not make decisions that they cannot defend.  You accept 
that? 
MR KHOZA:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But obviously if at some stage they may 
have thought that they could defend a decision but 
subsequently on reflection they feel that they cannot 
defend it they must be honest enough to say look, having 
reflected on this, we cannot defend it, we can see that we 
should not have made this decision.  But obviously, if they 
20 
feel that the decision was right they must be able to 
continue to defend it.  You accept that? 
MR KHOZA:   I accept that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is your position as we talk, 
are you able to defend the board’s decision to suspend 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 55 of 84 
 
these executives at the time that they suspended them? 
MR KHOZA:   The decision to suspend the executives at 
the time when we suspended, as I said, it was based on 
[indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the information [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR KHOZA:   On the information that was available at 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have information and all of that, 
processes, did you in terms of process, in terms of 
10 
substantive validity of the decisions do you feel that you 
are able to defend it or that it was defensible?   
MR KHOZA:   No, I think at this time when we suspended 
the executives based on investigation that was going to 
take place without charging them, I agree that we can 
defend that because it was a decision that we want to deep 
dive and understand what is happening the organisation.  
But maybe when they approached the executives, come 
across as dissatisfied and wanted separation packages, 
maybe did not go then apply our mind to say what was the 
20 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you look at the payment of 
these millions to the executives to leave that is the part 
where you think the board might not have applied its mind. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 56 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   Because the feeling was that they were 
going to come back and then the request to circle, maybe 
we just go with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Because, you see – well, Dr 
Ngubane conceded that even the suspensions, they should 
not have happened, if I recall correctly, and Mr Seleka will 
tell me if my recollection is incorrect but I think he made 
that concession.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The concession, Chairperson? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That the executives should not have 
been suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, he did.  He said the board would 
lose in court, certainly if these executives went to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But, you see, part of the issue that 
the Commission is looking at is why these executives were 
suspended, who initiated these suspensions and why did 
they initiate them?  You know, based on your own 
evidence, that the suspensions of the executives were not 
initiated by the board. 
20 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi said he was called to a 
meeting in Durban at the President’s official residence, 
that meeting took place on the 8 March 2015, Ms Dudu 
Myeni was there and the President came into the meeting.  
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 57 of 84 
 
There was Mr Nick Linnell and I think there was somebody 
else, there were two other people, I think.  According to Mr 
Linnell and Mr Tsotsi there was Ms Dudu Myeni’s son and 
apparently there was also Mr Masangayi or somebody and 
that this is where Mr Tsotsi was told for the first time about 
the idea that certain executives at Eskom should be 
suspended and this is where you he was told about the 
need for an enquiry to be conducted and he says that at 
the end of the meeting or at some stage Mr Zuma asked 
him 
whether 
he 
knew 
which 
executives 
were 
to 
be 
10 
suspended and Mr Tsotsi confirmed because those had 
been dealt with in the meeting but he says at that stage it 
was only three and not four, they did not include the 
financial director.  So you ask yourself the question where 
did Ms Myeni take the idea, if Mr Tsotsi’s version is correct 
and if Mr Linnell’s version is correct, where did Ms Dudu 
Myeni get the idea that certain executives at Eskom should 
be suspended?  Did she get it from the then President, Mr 
Zuma?  How did this idea come to Mr Zuma?   
It does not appear like something that came from 
20 
the minister because according to Mr Linnell and Mr Tsotsi, 
at the end of that meeting Mr Zuma said – suggested that 
Mr Tsotsi should introduce the idea of an inquiry and the 
suspensions to the board and he would talk to the minister 
about it.  You know, so the two of them had homework to 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 58 of 84 
 
do.   
And I seem to have read in an affidavit by Minister 
Brown that she does not seem to have known about this 
issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the eight at least, you know?  So the 
question arises, who outside of Eskom initiated these 
issues, the board of Eskom, being new as it was, initially it 
was disinclined to go along this route on the 9 t h but once 
the minister confirmed in effect that this is what the board 
10 
should at least consider and to say impliedly instructed the 
board to do, the board was prepared to go along, 
suspended these executives.  But a month later, a month 
later – or before that, if Ms Daniels’ evidence is correct 
and if Mr Masango’s evidence, Abram Masango’s evidence 
correct, then on the 10  March, one day before the board 
made this decision, Mr Salim Essa knew that there were 
going to be suspensions and he even knew who the 
executives were who were going to be suspended, he 
mentioned them to Ms Daniels and Mr Koko knew about 
20 
them if Mr – if the evidence of Ms Daniels and Mr Abram 
Masango is correct.   
 
And Ms Molefe’s name had not been concluded in 
the Durban meeting but on the 10 t h Mr Essa mentioned the 
financial director, so there were four names now and then 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 59 of 84 
 
the Minister comes to the meeting on the 11 t h.  Now 
remember you said in the board meeting that happened 
before 
the 
Minister 
came 
on 
the 
11 t h 
the 
issue 
of 
suspensions was not discussed.  So the minister came and 
when the minister spoke, she spoke on the basis that 
executives who were in charge of four portfolios, I think 
you said she spoke about four portfolios, is that right? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She did not mention names but the 
understanding was that the executives who were in charge 
10 
of the portfolios concerned would need to step aside of 
something like that. 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right?  But you did say at that 
stage there was a mention of three, so you might need to 
clarify that but other evidence is that the executives who 
were 
in 
charge 
of 
four 
portfolios 
that 
the 
minister 
mentioned were the ones who were to face a possible 
suspension according to the minister, so – and this Mr 
Essa, 
who 
mentioned 
four 
executives 
on 
the 
10 t h, 
20 
introduced himself, rightly or wrongly, to Ms Daniels as an 
adviser to the minister and the minister comes on the 11 t h 
and talks about – and includes the finance portfolio as an 
area to be investigated whereas in the Durban meeting the 
finance portfolio had not been included and therefore the 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 60 of 84 
 
financial director was not one of those contemplated. 
 
And then, about a month later after the executives 
have been suspended Mr Brian Molefe is seconded to 
Eskom but what you might not have known, as the board, 
or some of you or maybe the whole board, is that what I 
was told by Mr Henk Bester a few weeks ago in this 
Commission who says in 2014 he met with Mr Salim Essa 
on something unrelated to Eskom and I will not bother you 
with the details but one of the things Mr Salim Essa said 
was that they, whoever they were, were very powerful, they 
10 
had already had decided who would be the next boss of 
Eskom, it would be Mr Brian Molefe, Mr Bester must wait 
and see or something like that and indeed Mr Brian Molefe 
becomes the next boss of Eskom. 
 
And then, of course, Mr Anoj Singh follows him and 
I have heard evidence here, they are still going to come 
and put their side of the story, but I have heard evidence 
from witnesses to say at certain stages, during a certain 
period, they, both Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Brian Molefe, used 
to go to the Gupta house and they used to get some money 
20 
from the Gupta house which those people said they 
witnessed. 
 
So the question arises, was this board, of which you 
were a member, not being influenced, maybe manipulated 
from outside Eskom and from outside of government to 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 61 of 84 
 
make 
certain 
decisions 
and 
it 
allowed 
itself 
to 
be 
manipulated like that? 
MR KHOZA:   Based on the evidence that you just led, it is 
possible.  It is unfortunate that maybe on the meeting of 
the 9 t h the Chairperson at the time, Mr Tsotsi, did not 
mention where the information came from because if it was 
known that it was question of Dudu Myeni, which is not 
working for Eskom, the debate was going to be completely 
different.  
 
However, he came across as the information that he 
10 
believes in it himself, as a Chairperson, that it comes from 
the shareholder, so – and it comes from the President and 
those are the people that are shareholders of the company. 
 
So at the time, myself, I took it very serious to say 
the intervention of the shareholder and the intervention of 
the President, it means there are issues.  But if he 
mentioned that it was Dudu Myeni, etcetera, etcetera, as it 
comes on revelation, maybe the approach was going to be 
completely different and maybe it was not going to lead to 
the suspension of executive, if we knew the information.  
20 
But with the information that we had at the time and the 
verification that we tried ourselves to verify with the 
shareholder at the time, we thought it was enough, then it 
means then the Chairperson does have information, he 
does have a file which is sitting with him, as he stated to 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 62 of 84 
 
us, that he is going to give us in due course and that the 
suspension of the executives is about us to understand the 
deep dive.  We believe in him and hence then suspension 
was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KHOZA:   The issue of the meetings of the 10 t h, also 
we were not aware, it was never brought into our attention, 
we were not aware of it.  Maybe if we were aware of it then 
maybe the tone of the meeting of the 11 t h was going to be 
completely different. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if that evidence is true, namely 
about that meeting, those two meetings of the 10 t h, 
involving – one involving Mr Abram Masango and Mr Koko 
and Mr Salim Essa, the other one involving Ms Daniels and 
Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa at Melrose Arch, if those 
meetings did take place and what the two witnesses, Mr 
Masango and Ms Daniels, say was said at that meeting is 
what was said, what would you make of that. 
MR KHOZA:   If that is correct then it means it was 
influenced from outside. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, yes.  Mr Seleka from my side I 
think I have covered most of what I really wanted Mr Khoza 
to cover but if you still have something you can continue, 
so that when we finish – so I am not taking the tea break 
but I think he has dealt with most of the things that I 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 63 of 84 
 
wanted him to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you wanted, thank you Chair.  
Just one more thing Mr Khoza you again on the evidence of 
Mr Kholani Koma, when you were acting as the Chairperson 
of the Board and you had opportunity to call him to your 
house you know his details he goes to your place, you talk 
about that advice he was giving you in regard to how you 
should handle Eskom and in that meeting, oh is it that 
meeting when you were driving somewhere, that you say to 
him about the suspended executives that you were involved 
10 
in there exit negotiations and that they could have asked for 
more but they did not.  Would you have given them more? 
MR KHOZA:   No and let me talk about it because now you 
keep on talking, harping on Kholani Koma’s information.  Dr 
Ngubane resigned on the 12 t h of April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who resigned on the 12 t h of April? 
MR KHOZA:   Dr Ngubane resigned as a Chairperson on the 
12 t h of April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2017? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, midnight there was a media released by 
20 
Suzanne even though it was maybe appropriate by the 
Minister, by Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By Ms Daniels, ja. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, and that morning of the 13 t h I have not 
seen the email that when Dr Ngubane resigned then it was 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 64 of 84 
 
indicated that I will be acting in his place.  So when I saw it 
in the morning then I went to the office and that is where I 
meet Kholane, Mr. Khomo and Mr. Khomo came to my office 
and just indicated the willingness to say we need to improve 
the reputation of the organisation and it is a time that maybe 
I can change if I want to leave a good legacy etcetera, 
etcetera.   
Then I said as reputation manager then I will 
welcome that please go and prepare it and he went to 
prepare it and I told him that on the weekend of the 17 t h,18 t h 
10 
I will have a function at home so I am not going to be around 
because it was already planned.  If anything urgent then they 
can bring it home because I will be at home by the weekend.  
So Kholane came in my place when I had a function, when I 
was so busy.  There were certain documents that I signed, 
then he briefly discussed to say he is going to send me the 
proposal that he has but the proposal it is based on the 
reputation damage that was caused by the Gupta emails and 
the people that emanate from it are not seeing and Koko 
Masela and Brian Molefe, etcetera.   
20 
Then I said okay it is fine we will look at it when you 
come back and that was the end of the meeting and all of a 
sudden now he makes up the long story on the issues to say 
I went and spoke about the Minister and all other things 
which were never discussed and then on the 18 t h he sent a 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 65 of 84 
 
document.  I could not open the document because I was 
busy that particular weekend and when I opened the 
document he had all sorts of other allegations and we were 
failing to do the fiducial duties of the Board etcetera, 
etcetera.   
Which was not what we communicated or whether we 
never discussed it and he went further and it was distributed 
to other Board members that were my colleagues and it was 
also distributed to the Minister’s office and it eventually 
leaked to the media.  It was his opinion not attested by 
10 
anyone and now he added a lot of issues that were never 
discussed.  So the issue of me discussing all what he talks 
about the Minister, myself, the Gupta’s I do not know where 
it comes from.  The only issues meanings that was 
mentioned by him to say the most of the reputation damage 
only occurred because of the leak emails and the leak emails 
refer to the three people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The point which I was raising with you 
is a different one Mr. Khoza he says: 
“That it was on or about 30 March 2017 that you were 
20 
on your way with him to make an announcement on 
the KPMG results at Koeberg social impact in the 
Western Cape.  Mr. Khoza had bragged to me about 
how he led the charge on exiting the three Eskom 
executives namely Tsholofelo Molefe, Dan Marokane 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 66 of 84 
 
and Tshediso Matona.  Mr. Khoza said they all could 
be, could have negotiated better offers but appear to 
be ready to leave as soon as possible.  Mr. Khoza 
appeared very pleased with himself as he related this 
story.” 
That is the part…[intervene] 
MR KHOZA:   It is unfortunate that that information is not 
correct Chairperson.  I was not involved with Mr. Matona, I 
was not involved with Dan Marokane’s final settlement, I was 
not involved with, what you call – the only involvement was 
10 
with Tsholofelo and it was late as a request to the 
Chairperson who got me then.  So I never - it is impossible 
that I have said that and there was no need because we are 
all arguing, we all agreed to say it will be the 12-month 
settlement that was a Board resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Off cause for what it is worth you have 
already said you believe that the Board did not apply its 
mind properly with regard to this separation and the payment 
of the millions.  But I just want to make the point that the 
fact that when it came to Ms Molefe the Board was prepared 
20 
to go far above the 12-month salary.  It seems to reflect the 
determination to say we must make it possible for her to 
leave.  So even when she rejects the 12 months that the 
others may have accepted it looks like the Board wanted to 
go not an extra mile a lot of extra miles to make it possible 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 67 of 84 
 
for her to leave.  You, you understand? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And in fact Chair they settled her at 18 
months not 12 months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they settled at 18 months, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No the point I was making with Mr. Khoza 
is that while the others accepted 12 months when it came to 
her she wanted much more and the Board was prepared to 
10 
give her much more which seemed to reflect on the part of 
the Board a determination that she should leave you know.  
The Board was prepared to go beyond what it was prepared 
to pay the others. So it does not reflect a Board that wanted 
these executives back because if she wanted more than 12 
months which had been agreed by the Board, one would have 
expected the Board to say well we will give you the same 
thing 12 months, if you do not want 12 months come back.  
You understand that? 
MR KHOZA:   No I understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and do you accept that seems to 
have been the case. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept that? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 68 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Just two last things 
Mr. Khoza, I do see from your affidavit you say you 
participated in Mr. Marokane and Molefe and Mr. Koko’s 
meetings for exit.  So those three you participated on except 
Mr. Matona? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is 1, number 2 is that Ms Daniels 
talked about the Board having determined to get rid of the 
executives and she referred to the meeting, the minutes of 
10 
the 23 r d of April 2015.  Ja, that is the meeting where the 
Board approved the secondment of Mr. Molefe. 
MR KHOZA:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you recall?  That is in the minutes. 
But the point I want to mention to you is how the Board deals 
with the issue there of the suspended executives.  So Ms 
Klein is set in a capacity as the Chairman of SES committee, 
that is what social and ethics? 
MR KHOZA:   Social and ethics. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Reported that she had received the 
20 
letter from the Minister in which confirmation of the removal 
of the director was recorded and I think they referred to Mr. 
Tsotsi there because he has been removed now on the – oh 
well removed or resigned 30 March 2015 now we are in April.  
Ms Klein confirmed that the Minister also raised a number of 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 69 of 84 
 
issues.   
The next paragraph it was further reported that the 
Minister had also requested that the process of removal 
which was followed by the Board be noted.  Ms Klein also 
updated the Board on developments regarding the possible 
settlement between Eskom and one of the suspended 
executives who had requested that his suspension be 
changed to leave and I think that is Mr. Matona.  Did you 
know that?  At the CCMA he said his suspension should be 
converted into a special leave. 
10 
MR KHOZA:   Okay, no I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not know that? 
MR KHOZA:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Board was unanimous in rejecting 
this proposal.  But you were present at this meeting so can 
you recall this was discussed?  It is in the minutes let me go 
to the next point.  It was also reported that whether the 
suspended executives resigned or not the independent 
enquiry into Eskom’s affairs must continue as originally 
planned.   
20 
It was pointed out that there may be a problem with 
the auditors refusing to sign off on the financial statements 
while the enquiry was proceeding and that that would result 
in serious matters of compliance.  So Ms Suzanne Daniels 
was saying that paragraph that whether the suspended 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 70 of 84 
 
executives resigned or not an independent enquiry must 
continue was one of the indications that the Board expected 
the executives to go away.   
Already, well on her version already in April but I 
mean we know there is evidence before then but at least on 
her part. 
MR KHOZA:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You see there?  
MR KHOZA:   I hear you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair we do not…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is the issue about the acting 
appointments I could touch on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me ask this before maybe would 
that be your last? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That will be the last. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr. Khoza why did you and all the 
other members of the Board kick Mr. Tsotsi out of the Board? 
MR KHOZA:   Chair the way you put it, it is as if we had 
boots to kick him out of the meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he resigned but the fact of the 
matter is that the Board made it very difficult for him to 
continue as I understand the position either it passed the 
vote of no confidence on him or it was about to pass a vote 
of no confidence in him.  Is that true? 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 71 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And according to Dr Ngubane I think he 
and two other members of the Board and I do not know if you 
were one of them were mandated by the Board to talk to him 
to try and in effect get for him a dignified way to get out of 
Eskom by resigning which they did achieve.  Were you one of 
the members who accompanied Dr Ngubane?  
MR KHOZA:   No, no I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you pass a vote of no confidence 
or were you on the verge of passing one if he did not resign? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   It was mentioned in the discussion to say 
maybe we got the challenges with him which emanated from 
the documents that he said he got documents and when the 
documents were requested it did not come forth and I think 
the other aspect were the interference with the executives 
and there were quite number of issues that were raised and 
unfortunately it was done by the audit and the risk and they 
listed them and he was asked to respond on them.  One of 
the issues it was the - Mr. Nick Linnell who was brought to 
the Board without the knowledge of the Board and we felt 
20 
that there are more things that was not communicated 
properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take some of these about Mr. 
Linnell, what was your problem as the Board with Mr. 
Linnell? 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 72 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   The issue of Mr. Linnell when it was brought 
to our attention my understanding he was like a presidential 
resource that could be used because that is a person who is 
sitting with information and down the line it came back to say 
he was not contracted to Eskom as an employee or as a 
contractor or any process that has been followed to identify 
him.  Yet he already started according to what Mr. Tsotsi 
agreed or maybe testified here to say the document of the 9 t h 
was already drafted by Linnell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You people, the Board were told by Mr. 
10 
Tsotsi about Mr. Linnell and you were happy to make use of 
his services.  You had no problem, you did not say has he 
not been contracted properly, has procurement processes 
been followed.  You did not ask that did you? 
MR KHOZA:   We did not ask that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not ask that before you embraced 
his services. 
MR KHOZA:   It is correct on the day when he was 
introduced because he was introduced as a solution to the 
problem that we were dealing with the suspension of the 
20 
executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But on the 9 t h he already started working 
before he even introducing the Board but if and when he was 
introduced in the Board he was introduced as a presidential 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 73 of 84 
 
resource, not a person that you going to utilise but it was 
just a person who is sitting with information that is going to 
be utilised.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But what was your complaint against Mr. 
Tsotsi in connection with Mr. Linnell because I understood 
from the charges that were prepared by the Board against 
Mr. Tsotsi and from the evidence that has been given by Dr 
Ngubane and maybe Ms Klein, that as far as Mr. Linnell was 
concerned the Boards complaint was that Mr. Tsotsi had not 
followed procurement processes for Eskom to use Mr. 
10 
Linnell’s services.  Was that your understanding of what the 
Boards complaint was? 
MR KHOZA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did not ask as the Board before 
using him on the 11 t h, you did not ask Mr. Tsotsi have you 
followed procurement processes. 
MR KHOZA:   When he introduced him he said he was given 
resource by the presidency and he has been looking at para-
status and his got lots of documents that he is sitting with.  
So he was not the person who was supposed to be employed 
20 
by the time my version of understanding at the time, was that 
he was not going to be employed by Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   But however he was going to be used as a 
resource, he come from the presidency but later it was not 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 74 of 84 
 
the fact because then it was then he was supposed now to 
be seen as a consultant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KHOZA:   That now he is helping us in the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did not seek to have any 
confirmation about him being employed by the presidency or 
appointed by the presidency or being somebody who would 
be paid by the presidency as at the 11 t h, is it not? 
MR KHOZA:   No at the 11 t h it was not but I think as later 
because it came up on a very hot meeting and tense 
10 
situation that was there and he introducing in that space and 
he was going to deal with certain issues.  At the time then 
nobody asked the questions and I think after that then 
people start following it up then it was realised that he did 
not come up correctly so he was just being imposed on us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As well one Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein did 
not say what you are saying when this was put to them 
namely we thought he would be paid by the presidency 
because I think that is what in effect you are saying.  That is 
not what they said from - as far as I recall from there 
20 
evidence what emerged is an acceptance that they did use 
the services of Mr. Linnell on the 11 t h and after whether it 
was the full Board or the PNG or other committee.  He was 
allowed to make a contribution and so on and then suddenly 
the Board blames Mr. Tsotsi and does not blame itself for 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 75 of 84 
 
making use of his services without first checking whether 
procurement processes have been followed.   
That is problematic do you not agree?  It is like you 
were just looking for something to use against Mr. Tsotsi 
because you knew on the 11 t h as a Board that if you are 
going to use somebody, there may be a need to follow 
procurement processes but you did not check before you 
used Mr. Linnell and said allowed him to assist committees.  
Do you understand? 
MR KHOZA:   I understand but as I said I am not aware of 
10 
other meetings that he attended, I do not know.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well I think he did Mr. Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   He did attend other committee or other 
committees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was invited a couple of times to Dr 
Pat 
Naidoo’s 
build 
and 
something 
programme 
that 
committee. 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What is it Mr. Khoza?  
20 
MR KHOZA:   That was build.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the build program.  He was invited 
to assist the PNG in regard to how do you - what process 
should be followed to present the, to give the person a 
notice to make representations before you suspend them.  
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 76 of 84 
 
He advised on that, in fact you took his advice on that, you 
took his advice on that? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes they did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, He was also at the PNG and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so there is that problem and then 
there was an issue of an allegation that he had issued a 
media statement without the approval of the Board.  Do you 
remember that? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it one of the reasons? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   It was one of the reasons, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but when I asked Dr Ngubane and Ms 
Klein here it appeared that they were not sure that he had 
done that namely issue a wrong statement that should not 
have been issued but also I ask the question, why would the 
Chairperson of the Board issue to the media a media 
statement that he knows need, that he knew needed to be 
approved by the Board first issue it without the Board 
approval.  What would he be seeking to achieve.  They did 
not give me any satisfactory answer maybe you will give me.  
20 
What will he be seeking to achieve? 
MR KHOZA:   I am not aware of maybe the details of it as I 
was acting at the time some of the preparation that they 
used to deal with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you do not know about that part? 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 77 of 84 
 
MR KHOZA:   I do not know about that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you certainly, your loss of confidence 
in him did not relate to that because you did not know 
anything about that or is the position that when the Board 
dealt with this issue and was showing that it had lost 
confidence, you did not take part in that because you were 
already acting COO. 
MR KHOZA:   I was already acting yes I was not acting at 
all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright so you did not take part 
10 
in that. 
MR KHOZA:   I was there as a Board member. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were there but you refrained from 
expressing any views.   
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I think the Board accepted that the 
statement had been leaked, remember that the discussion 
you accepted that it had been leaked and Leo Dlamini 
explained to the Board and the focus in the meeting shifted 
20 
from Mr Tsotsi to Leo Dlamini because he told the Board 
that he had given a draft statement to the media desk of 
Eskom.  Do you recall that explanation?  And now it was 
about whether is he the one who authorised the statement 
to be sent out before he could get the authorisation of the 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 78 of 84 
 
Board.  So Mt Tsotsi was left off the hook on that one well 
not left off the hook it sounds negative but he – the Board 
did not seek to a portion blame on him.  Do you remember 
that? 
MR KHOZA:   It is quite some time but there was debate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, there was debate.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright you wanted to quickly deal 
with the acting appointments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they will not take long. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They will not take long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because Mr Khoza will come back for 
transactions and some of it can be dealt with at that stage 
as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Mr Khoza in the meeting of the 19 t h 
of March, 19 of March 2015 that is where Mr Tsotsi is in 
trouble.  There are signs of him being in trouble, there is a 
note minuted there that the people who were acting in the 
place of the suspended executives were allegedly called in 
to a meeting and knew beforehand that they would be 
20 
acting.  The Board needed to find out how this happened.  
They were apparently called into a meeting and the acting 
CE met with them.  This seems to have been an issue for 
the Board that they knew beforehand that they would be 
acting. 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 79 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there was an allegation that they 
had met with Mr Khoza. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With Mr Khoza at this time you were 
the acting CE. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there an allegation as to the date? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is no date noted here 
but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you meet with them Mr Khoza? 
MR KHOZA:   No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure? 
10 
MR KHOZA:   I am 100% sure.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you have a meeting on the morning 
of the 11 t h of March that is the day of the suspensions? 
MR KHOZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe around 8 o’clock with Mr Tsotsi 
and Mr Abram Masango, Ms Valente-Dlamini I do not know, 
I cannot remember who else.

by officials of the DPE before the day of the suspensions 
and apparently this meeting was to tell you about the 
suspensions and that you would be acting. 
MR KHOZA:   Not necessarily. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh not necessarily? 
MR KHOZA:   Not necessarily. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson why? 
MR KHOZA:   I think one of the people at DPE called but 
he – that was on the 11 t h when the Minister was on the way 
and they were finding out to say there is a rumour to say 
10 
people are going to be suspended and the people in 
governance said do I know anything then I said no.

MR KHOZA:   On the 11 t h.

CHAIRPERSON:   Is Ms Naidoo here with her lawyer, not 
yet? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, my junior informs me that they 
sent an email asking that I inform them of the outcome of 
the postponement.     
CHAIRPERSON:   What kind of way of doing things is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well I had a communication with my 
learned friend, well not my – the attorney for Ms Naidoo 
about the lateness of the affidavit I said I will bring it 
before the Chairperson and …[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The lateness of their affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, of their affidavit that we received 
yesterday.  I think he waited for me to indicate what is the 
position going forward hence this email Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But wasn’t Ms Naidoo not supposed to 
09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321 
 
Page 83 of 84 
 
be here when we started in the morning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She was Chair, yes that is the email 
they sent.  The email says what my junior has said to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is unacceptable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is unacceptable.  So why were they 
not here at 10 o’clock do you know? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yesterday Chairperson they had been 
told that there was uncertainty about proceeding today but 
I corrected that and said we will proceed and he came back 
10 
to me and said well okay please tell me that we are 
coming.  I said yes but now I have seen your affidavit 
which is so many pages long let me ask the Chairperson 
but you will be scheduled to proceed in the afternoon.  
Your witness, your client is scheduled to proceed in the 
afternoon.  I indicated the time which is 14h00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so maybe they were expecting that if 
the evidence proceeded that they would be here at two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Here at 14h00 I think that may well be 
so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright we will adjourn her evidence then 
another date must be arranged.

09 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 321
