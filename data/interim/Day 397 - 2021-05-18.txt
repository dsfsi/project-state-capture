Page 5 of 241 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson would appreciate to 
deal with that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you say you represent Mr Koko 
as well today? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, no  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   No Chairperson I am not 
representing Mr Koko today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   In fact I have never represented 
10 
him.  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.    Okay. 
ADV LITTLE:  Thank you Mr Chair.  It is Nigel Little from 
Shannon Little Attorneys. My client is Mr Salim Essa.  Mr 
Essa likewise received a note last night and that is why we 
are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let me just get the spelling of your 
surname. 
ADV LITTLE:  L-i-t-t-l-e 
CHAIRPERSON:  L-i 
20 
ADV LITTLE:   t-t-l-e Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  t-t-l-e. 
ADV LITTLE:   The conventional spelling Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  No, no that is fine.  I 
think when you came to chambers I did not get – I seem to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 6 of 241 
 
have had something that you did not say – I thought it was 
another witness.  Now that you have mentioned it is Mr 
Salim Essa of course I am quite interested in Mr Salim Essa 
as you would know. 
ADV LITTLE:   We have noted Chair and likewise Mr Essa 
has some interest in the – (talking over one another) here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well there was correspondence I think 
now that – now that I know you represent him I can be – 
understand your remark about correspondence between 
yourselves and the secretariat. 
10 
ADV LITTLE:   Yes Chair there is certain things we took 
issue with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LITTLE:   In some of the proceedings here and in 
some of the correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is this an indication that he would 
be prepared to come and give evidence here? 
ADV LITTLE:   I think Mr Essa is comfortably ensconced in 
Dubai but we happy to – to cooperate if there is something 
that the commission wishes to enquire of Mr Essa – we are 
20 
happy to cooperate.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think that the correspondence that 
would have gone from the secretariat to your office not so 
long ago would have enquired whether – if the commission 
were to set aside time for him to appear he would be 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 7 of 241 
 
prepared to – he would undertake to appear.  I am not sure 
if there has been a response.  I would be interested in 
knowing you might or might not wish to say now or you 
might let me know in due course what his position is. 
ADV LITTLE:   Yes Mr Chair we have – we are in the 
process of preparing a response.  I am happy to discuss it 
with you.  There are a number of things we take issue with 
and we will deal with it in due course.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LITTLE:   But we are happy to discuss it with you 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV LITTLE:   As you would make time available for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  Maybe what should 
happen because you are here in due course maybe you 
could discuss with Mr Seleka or the legal team and they 
would brief me on the discussions. 
ADV LITTLE:   Yes I think Mr Seleka did indicate to me 
Chair earlier on that he would after he has finished with his 
session today have a discussion with me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV LITTLE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So the witness could 
be sworn in or affirmed. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 8 of 241

prescribed affirmation? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  If so please raise your… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I do not think that that will be 
recorded.  Do you mind taking your mask off.  I think there 
is enough social distance otherwise what you say will not be 
recorded and it is important that it should be recorded and 
then maybe speak up a bit.  Start afresh please. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Sameera Sooliman. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to making the

truly affirm. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 9 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for 
availing yourself Ms Sooliman to assist the commission.  
Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I should say that Chair on short 
notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes on short notice.  We appreciate that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I see that you have put your mask 
back on.  If we will be able to hear you that is not a 
10 
problem.  My concern is that we might not hear you. But if – 
if we can hear you that would be fine but based on what 
happened when you started the oath I do not think we will 
hear you.  Is that fine?  Okay.  I think there is enough social 
distancing.  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Sooliman also just keep your mic on.

who you are, where you work and what do you do? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I am Sameera Sooliman.  I am the travel 
10 
agent from a company called Travel Excellence based in 
Lenasia.  My duty is to do travel arrangements, air tickets, 
accommodation and packages for my clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes when did you start working for Travel 
Excellence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It is about 8 – 7 years ago.  7 to 8 it is 
going to be 8 years this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that takes us back to about what 
2013? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  20 – ja correct.  Well 2016 so say from 
20 
about 2014I was part-time with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  And then after 2016 I was full-time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did you come to work for them? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So my colleague Halima Allana and I used 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 14 of 241 
 
to work together in a travel agency called Freeway Travel. 
We met there.  Thereafter we were retrenched and I was 
employed at a company called Harvey World Travel.  Halima 
did not join me.  She started her own company.  In 2016 we 
were retrenched from Harvey Travel and I contacted Halima 
to ask her if I could join her in her company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Did you start on a part-time basis 
and later you were appointed permanent. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes so I was actually expecting in 2016 so 
I was working from home and once after July so it was July, 
10 
August, September I started on a full time basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Seleka do you want to get 
her to deal with the background to Travel Excellence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Ms Sooliman 
that is on page 1565.2.  If you could tell us about Travel 
Excellence.  Who – who… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja this will be non-controversial stuff I 
would imagine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja. 
 
When 
was 
Travel 
Excellence 
20 
established if you know Ms Sooliman? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Travel Excellence was founded in 2013 by 
Mr Sharief Allana and his daughter Halima Allana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it – or who owns it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Mr Sharief Allana owns it.  He owns the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 15 of 241 
 
company and Halima Allana is his daughter who was with 
him in the business and then I joined in after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And does this travel agency 
specialise 
in 
any 
area 
– 
flight 
arrangements, 
hotel 
accommodations so on. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir we do flight arrangements, hotel 
accommodations, tours, everything that a travel agent 
should do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it have its own licence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No we are – we work as non-iata agents 
10 
and then we work under consortiums to issue tickets for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it acceptable to work without a licence 
for a travel agency or what is the position?   
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a licence required? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  You do not need a iata licence so long as 
you ticket through an iata agency which we were doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Which is what you do. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what entity do you normally use for 
20 
that purpose? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Sorry Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What entity do you normally use for that 
purpose that has got a licence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Oh you mean how… 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 16 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What travel agency that has a licence. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Oh Serendipity Worldwide Travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  We were using them all these years but 
due to the Corona they – they lost their business – they 
liquidated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you offer any credit to your 
clients? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  We do Sir a 14 date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell us about the credit you… 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So we normally have corporate clients that 
we know quite well and we give them a 14 day account. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes. 
 
Okay 
and 
how 
big 
is 
the 
organisation Travel Excellence. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  We are a very small organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  We just consist of three – three of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  About three of you. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Three of us.  It is Halima, myself and one 
staff member. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka do you 
want to take from that to the next topic? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Sooliman evidence 
has been led quite extensively here before the commission 
about particularly one of your clients and I would like you to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 17 of 241 
 
tell the Chairperson about him and how you came to know 
him.  That is Mr Salim Essa.  Can you do that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I can.  Okay so when I was working at the 
travel agency in Houghton I was introduced to Mr Essa and 
I cannot remember through who. You know when you are in 
the travel agency you just get referrals as per how you 
work.  So he was introduced to me and ever since he was 
my client and I used to handle all his bookings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the name of the travel agents you 
were working for when he was introduced to you? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I was working for Harvey World Travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  They have also into liquidation now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Harvey World Travel does not exist in 
Houghton anymore yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay.  Continue how you working 
relationship started and so on. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So like I said it was a referral and I was 
contacted 
by 
him 
and 
I 
used 
to 
do 
all 
his 
travel 
arrangements for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was from when in terms of year? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So it would be around about 2015. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 18 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you – well 2015 you would have 
been with Travel Excellence is it not. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No Sir 2016 I left Harvey World Travel but 
I used to deal with – you see Harvey World Travel used to 
work on commission. So obviously the money was not 
enough for us so – because Halima being my friend and she 
had an agency so I used to do the bookings and some of the 
bookings she used to handle for me through her company – 
through Travel Excellence literally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you – I understood you to say in 
10 
2014 you were working for Travel Excellence on a part-time 
basis. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct Sir so 2014 and 2015 – 2015 – so 
literally when we left Freeway Travel okay I went to Harvey 
World Travel; Halima started Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And which year was that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  2000 and.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you went to Harvey? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Harvey World was 2013 because that was 
the time we were both retrenched from there and she 
20 
started her business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were both retrenched from Harvey. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  From Freeway – from Freeway Travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Freeway Travel. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir in Ridgeway. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 19 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  In 2013. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you went to Harvey. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I went to Harvey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she went to start Travel Excellence. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Travel Excellence.  But I did not start 
Harvey immediately I was without a job for a year a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So when did you start with Harvey? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I started only with Harvey Travel in the 
beginning of 2016 so it was there only for like six months or 
10 
so.  So in the time being of 2000 and – from 2013 to 2016 I 
was working from home through Halima.  I was being – She 
was doing bookings for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let me get this clear.  From 
when up to when were you working for Harvey? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So Harvey Travel would have been I think 
a period of eight months. So it would have been like 2015 
and then or maybe a little earlier than in 2015 because I 
was expecting in 2016 I remember I was like three or four 
months pregnant when I left there because then the 
20 
company closed down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would have worked for Harvey 
from when… 
MS SOOLIMAN:  You know Sir I cannot remember exactly 
the date we had no contacts or nothing. So it is 2015 for a 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 20 of 241 
 
few months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on – hang on.  No hang on.  You 
were working for Harvey from when to when?  I do not 
necessarily expect you to tell me the exact dates I just want 
to have an idea. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  2015 to 2016 – early 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you say it was for about eight 
months? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes around about eight months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  From sometime in 2015 to 
10 
sometime in 2016. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  2016.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But did you say in 2014 you were 
already work – doing some work for Travel Excellence on a 
part-time basis? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So when you were at Harvey were 
you also on a part-time basis? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So 2015/2016 part of those years you 
20 
were part-time at Harvey. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Earning commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at Travel Excellence when did you 
become full-time or permanent? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So if I – 2016 – July I gave birth and 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 21 of 241 
 
straight after that.  So a month or so after that by August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Alright. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Ja.  Obviously three months temp first and 
then – it was first a three month temporary employment and 
then obviously full after that.  But 2016 by August or so I 
was working with Halima already on a full time basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  And no other company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After you had given birth you gave birth in 
2016. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And after you had given birth you started 
with them? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With Travel Excellence. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – initially on a temporary basis. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It was … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say… 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It was on a – it was like – you know like 
any company you get a three month probation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it was probation. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct Sir. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 22 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And thereafter you became 
permanent? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you become permanent after about 
three months or so? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay alright.  So – so when 
you started interacting with Mr Salim Essa when he was 
introduced to you was he introduced to you when you were 
acting or doing work for Harvey or for Travel Excellence. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:  He was introduced to me at Harvey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Harvey? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Around about 2015 or 2016 or can 
you not remember? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No, no it could be 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  No that is fine.  And then 
when you stopped working for Harvey he went over with you 
20 
to Travel Excellence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  He did but there was not so much travel 
being done during that period because I was not employed 
as yet and like I said to you I was expecting so I was not 
doing much work until August of 2016. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 23 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I am ... 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes he was – he did – as my client… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ultimately he came to you. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  As my client Sir I used to do his travel 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but is the point you are making that 
when you started with Travel Excellence after you had given 
birth he did not immediately come over to Travel Excellence 
but he did come over in due course? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  He did come over I cannot tell exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Immediately? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes I cannot remember when was the first 
ticket I issued for him when he came over though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Back to Travel Excellence. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You said you cannot 
remember who introduced him to you. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Sir you know in our community. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was just a referral. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It was a referral.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Somebody referred him to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay alright. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka.   
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 24 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you – thank you Chair.  Again Ms 
Sooliman I noted a couple of years there 2013, 2014 and I 
think that is why the Chairperson was trying to clarify.  If 
you look at your affidavit paragraph 16 you say there that – 
well let us see 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Hm 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us see 15 – 15. 
“Whilst I was employed at Harvey World I 
was introduced to Mr Salim Essa whom I 
then serviced as a client.” 
10 
 
Then 16 says: 
“After 
a 
while 
many 
of 
the 
employees 
including myself were let go from Harvey 
World.  I then contacted Mr Allana and 
joined her at Travel Excellence around June 
2013.  As Essa being my client followed me 
to Travel Excellence.” 
 
So you may want to clarify … 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Okay so Sir remember Halima and I 
worked together at Freeway Travel. We were dismissed at 
20 
the same time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Okay in 2013.  In 2013 we were dismissed.  
Obviously me being unemployed I kept in contact with 
Halima so if I had any personal clients she could handle 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 25 of 241 
 
them for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I but think Mr Seleka is asking you 
about the fact that … 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Mr Essa came … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on Ms Sooliman.  We 
cannot both speak at the same time.  Wait until I finish. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka is asking you about the fact 
that in paragraph 16 of your affidavit you say that  
“I then contacted Ms Allana and joined her 
10 
at Travel Excellence around June 2013.” 
 
So you say you went to Travel Excellence in June 
2013 in your affidavit whereas in answer to my questions 
you said you joined her permanently only in 2016. So what 
do you say about that discrepancy? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  What I am saying is in 2013 when we left 
from Freeway Travel she started her business and I was 
unemployed Sir.  So I had to take my clients with me to her 
but I am not saying Mr Essa booked with me from 2013 at 
Travel Excellence.  Okay I said he followed me.  I did not 
20 
say he started booking at 2013.  I was employed – 
unemployed and I went to work for a company called 
Usimass [?] which is a normal arithmetic company in order 
to earn a salary obviously to look after my family.  I – and 
then in 2016 the gentleman from Harvey World contacted 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 26 of 241 
 
me and said we worked with him.  He was somebody that I 
worked with at Freeway Travel said he is opening his 
company Harvey World would I like to join him.  That is 
when I joined him in 2015 for the eight-month period.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So basically end of 2013 and 14 I was 
unemployed and I did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  I understand that.  When you 
say in your affidavit you joined Ms – is it Halima? Allana. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Allana. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say at Travel Excellence 
around June 2013.  Is that factually correct? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Chair, yes, I was – I was not with her 
fulltime, sir.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you joined her ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I wanted her to hand over some of my 
clients because her company had only started in 2013.  So 
it was not running.  Remember, Nana(?) Hajer(?) Agency 
does not run a full company.  It is like literally one laptop 
and 
one person with the 
clients to get in. 
 So I 
20 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I want is.  What do you 
mean when you say you joined her ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I joined ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...at Travel Excellence – hang on, hang 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 27 of 241 
 
on, hang on.  Just wait until I have finished.  Okay? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you mean when you say you 
joined her at Travel Excellence around June 2013. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Well, literally, I handed over some of my 
clients to her in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So if I ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   For her to take as her clients or for what 
purpose? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   For – the – there are people that I used 
to get.  I used to refer to Halima to make a booking and I 
used to earn a commission on the booking that she used to 
make for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is that what you were talking 
about when you said initially you were part-time with Travel 
Excellence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you were talking about? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just listen to questions, Ms Sooliman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I will. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 28 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just cool down, be calm, listen to the 
questions and answer them directly. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Sooliman, so you joined, as 
you say, Travel Excellence.  You do say that Mr Essa 
10 
followed you as a client.  Now in your affidavit you have 
specifically 
referred 
to 
certain 
bookings 
that 
were 
requested by Mr Essa on behalf of two individuals or two 
gentlemen.  One is Mr Anoj Singh and the other is 
Mr Koko.  I would like you to first deal with the request – I 
mean, the – ja, the request in relation to Mr Singh.  If you 
could tell the Chairperson how Travel Excellence came to 
do bookings, flight bookings for Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry Mr Seleka.  Before she 
does so.  Ms Sooliman, will you explain how the payment 
20 
arrangements you may have had as Travel Excellence with 
Mr Salim Essa, whenever you made bookings, how did 
payments occurred?  Did he have an account with Travel 
Excellence or did he not have an account with Travel 
Excellence?  Does Travel Excellence open an account for 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 29 of 241 
 
every client or what is the position? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay.  So we do not open up accounts 
for everybody.  We only open up accounts for people that 
we know and that is only thereafter(?).  We do not open up 
accounts for everybody off the street.  So we would only 
give them a two-week period.  Sometimes, I mean, the 
tickets used to be issued and paid the very next day but we 
did give that leeway of 14-days.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Is that the basis – did you have an 
account with Mr Salim Essa? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   We did, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay continue, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  So this, 
Ms Sooliman, I was asking how it came about that you 
serviced and if we could start with Mr Singh in particular.  
Whether you even know Mr Singh and how you came to do 
flight bookings for him.  Yes? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay.  So, I do not know Mr Singh from 
anywhere.  Like I said to you, sir, we get referrals in the 
travel industry.  He was referred to me via Mr Essa. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I never ever met him, you know, on a 
face to face basis, like, to say this is Mr Singh and this is 
Sameera.  It was either on a telephone call or a Whatsapp 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 30 of 241 
 
message.  And then I would receive a message to say:  I 
was referred to you by mister so and so and kindly do a 
booking for me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did you have or did you have an 
account created for Mr Singh? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, sir.  If it was anybody referred to me 
by a certain person, that person to get in to, basically, 
because I would take a word from the client that I knew.  I 
would not up open new accounts for anybody.  So it would 
then – I know which is not the right thing to do because we 
10 
are a very small company.  We did not have big account 
systems but just for our record.  Because in travel 
agencies you do not have a big account system but for our 
record purposes and payments, we used it to name it after 
the person that referred the person to us as a guarantor.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, when you took a particular client 
as the guarantor of another client or another person. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would this be an arrangement that you 
made with the person you regarded as the guarantor or 
20 
was this just your own internal arrangement?  You would 
not speak to, for example Mr Salim Essa, and say we will 
take you as the guarantor for Mr Singh because we do not 
know Mr Singh but we know you and this means that if he 
does not pay we will expect you to pay.  If that was the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 31 of 241 
 
case.  Would you have that kind of discussion with the 
person you regarded as the guarantor? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Absolutely.  I would ask him first if I 
could make a booking without payment and then he used to 
say to me no problem.  If there is a problem, contact me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  And would you do that with 
every other client who introduced somebody if you are 
going to take that client as the guarantor? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, sir, I would not.  It would be – in the 
travel agency you do not even keep account because if I 
10 
issue a ticket with an airline, I need to pay immediately.  
So there was only, like, maybe one or two of my very good 
clients that used to book with me that I used to give them 
that privilege.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Salim Essa was one of them? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So the arrangement, 
20 
I mean, from that explanation to the Chairperson.  The 
basis on which Mr Salim Essa either referred or introduced 
you to Mr Anoj Singh, was it on the basis of you having him 
as a client or simple rendering a service to him? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja, sir, he used to help me get a lot of 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 32 of 241 
 
clientele.  He used to help me to get a lot of clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   He used to help me to get a lot of 
clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So because of the service I provided to 
him, he used to give me a lot of referrals.  I did not know 
whether Mr Singh would book with me more in the future 
10 
but depending on my service, maybe he would. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, you have referenced in your 
affidavit, page 1565.4, paragraph 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not want to forget this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is urgent.  Maybe you or your 
junior could during the tea break – well, maybe not the tea 
break but I think your junior could do this in the meantime.  
20 
Inform Mr Koko’s legal team that we can have a hearing 
tomorrow.  So, during the day session.  So they can be 
here at ten.  Remember there was that issue yesterday that 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 33 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We said they would be informed today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  I am sorry to have 
interrupted your questioning but I do not want sitting on 
this delay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  No problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Chair is not double booking 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I hope not.  I do not think so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well – but you will let me know 
if you know something that I have forgotten but I do not 
think so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I was told last night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will talk it during the tea break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will not have a tea break today 
because we started late. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But – ja, let us continue. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 34 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Sooliman, in your affidavit 
you referenced seven bookings that you made on behalf of 
Mr Singh.  Mr Singh has largely accepted that you did – 
Travel Excellence did make the bookings.  But he raised 
issues in regard to your invoices.  And I know that you deal 
with those concerns of his in your next affidavit.  We are 
waiting for the signed one.  But perhaps you could tell the 
Chairperson insofar as, one, Mr Singh says...  Well, let me 
not tell you what he says.  Let me ask you.  These 
bookings that you made, who paid for these bookings?  
10 
And you take, if you like, you could take the Chairperson 
through each one of them and I could do so for you.  
Paragraph 22.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think lead her to say which one, 
when, from where to where, who paid and whatever 
because each time you can indicate that Mr Singh admitted 
that the trip did happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where he did not, obviously, you 
would have to say that.  But we could get over this quite 
20 
quickly because for most of the trips, the only issue that is 
disputed is who paid ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one or two things.  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 35 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let us get going on those. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Sooliman, let us start 
on paragraph 22.1.  The booking, you say, was requested 
from Mr Singh to fly from Dubai to Johannesburg on 
8 June 2014.  You say:   
“I cannot recall who made the request.   
Mr Singh was issued with a ticket number...” 
 
And the number is given.  You refer to the 
10 
Annexure SS1.   
“I do not know how Mr Singh flew to Dubai.  
The total costs charged was R 9 100.00.   
The 
invoice 
was 
addressed 
to 
Mr 
Singh 
although it was charged to Mr Essa’s account.  
I cannot recall whether I spoke to Mr Essa or 
Mr Singh but one of the two gentlemen phoned 
me to tell me the driver would be dropping off 
money in cash to settle the invoice which 
indeed took place.  Attached hereto the cash 
20 
receipt dated 16 July 2014...” 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So on the first one, you seem not to 
recall who called you in order to have the payment made. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Not the payment but the booking.  The 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 36 of 241 
 
booking and the – yes, the booking and the payment 
literally. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because the booking was requested.  I 
cannot remember.  There were a few people that used to 
requests his bookings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just face the Chairperson because I 
want you to address the Chairperson. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   The booking was requested – well, there 
was a booking made for him.  I cannot remember exactly 
10 
who used – who did the first booking but it must have been 
Mr Singh because most of his bookings, he used to call me 
to make a booking for him.  He used to call or he used to 
message me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is he? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Mr Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Anoj Singh used to call you for most 
of his bookings.  Is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you are saying? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes.  Yes, he used to call me for a few of 
these bookings, not all of them. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
Well, 
you 
said 
most 
...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Most.  Because he had a holiday 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 37 of 241 
 
packages – his partner contacted us though. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So I cannot say that he contacted me for 
that booking.  So he did contact me for his bookings but 
when it comes to the payment, I cannot recall who phoned 
me to say the payment will come to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   You understand?  Because the booking 
was made for him.  Like I said, his account went under 
Mr Essa because Mr Essa was my – was the guarantor of 
10 
his bookings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   But Mr Singh paid for his bookings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Singh paid for his bookings? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   For his bookings whenever he travelled.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So when he had called you and asked 
you to make a booking ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he would pay for his booking? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   He would say:  I would send you the 
20 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would send and ultimately he would 
send it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue, Mr Seleka. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 38 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Take them one by one, I think so that 
there will be clarity.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   With regard to the booking or the trip in 
paragraph 22.1.  You say that the invoice was addressed to 
Mr Singh although it was charged to Mr Essa’s account and 
you cannot recall if you spoke to Mr Essa or Mr Singh but 
10 
one of the two men called you to tell you that the driver 
will be dropping off money in cash to settle the invoices.  
So you say in regard to this one you addressed the invoice 
to Mr Singh.  Is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, sir.  For our records. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now would you address the invoice to 
him only in regard to those bookings where he had called 
and asked you to make the booking or would you address 
the invoice to him even in regard to those bookings where 
either Mr Salim Essa or his secretary has called? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay so when Mr Singh was travelling 
himself, all those invoices would have been made out to 
Mr Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because it was his air ticket. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 39 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Although for my record on my statement 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   ...it would go onto Mr Essa’s account and 
next to it I would write Mr Singh.  So I knew it was payment 
for him ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   ...that needed to be collected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so if Mr Salim Essa called or his 
10 
secretary to say please make a booking for Mr Singh, the 
invoice would be addressed to Mr Salim Essa and then you 
would make a note that it is in respect of Mr Singh.  Is that 
what you are saying? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, sir.  It was Mr Essa’s booking for 
him.  The invoice would be made out to Mr Essa 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it was a booking for himself? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   If it is a booking for Mr Anoj Singh, 
whoever would call me, the invoice would be made out to 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To that person? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 40 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And you would expect 
payment from that person? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So in this case, in regard 
to 22.1, you had addressed the invoice to Mr Singh.  So I 
take it that he would have been the one who had called to 
ask you to make the bookings? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Like I said, he could have called or 
maybe his partner.  So either one of them could have 
called. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, one of the two. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct.  But that was only the Dubai – 
Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka, what did Mr Singh say 
about this?  How was this one paid or do you want to put 
that to her? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   According to Mr Singh – well, in 
respect of all of them, he said he paid himself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 41 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How he paid, it was not clear on how 
he paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I think one of the methods he 
mentioned was that it was a cash payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he said sometimes he made cash 
payments, sometimes he said he made EFT’s and I think 
sometimes he talked about ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He sent a driver – cash payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot remember something like – I do 
10 
not know whether it was a voyager miles or something like 
that.  I am not sure.  Did he used to pay cash? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Most of the times he paid cash, sir.  I 
think there was maybe one occasion, that was a holiday or 
something ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   ...that an EFT was done but most of the 
time it was cash payments.  I must be honest.  I did not 
voyager booking.  Voyager bookings can only be made by 
the client themselves. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Now, and did he also, as far 
as you know, do EFT’s?  Transferred money ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Hardly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hardly? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Hardly.  It must have been only one 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 42 of 241 
 
which I am not even sure.  I think it was one transaction 
that we did for a holiday vacation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   But the EFT came via somebody, not 
through him himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Now when he made cash 
payments, how did that go – how did he go about doing 
that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   He used to sent me a Whatsapp or a call 
...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   ...and said that somebody would be 
dropping off the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And most of the times, it used to be 
dropped off at my place.  I was living in Maple at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Our offices were in Lenasia. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   It was much easier to drop it off by me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And payments used to come to me.  Then 
I used to ring my office and say I have received so much 
for mister so and so.  Kindly receipt it out.  So I never use 
to have a receipt book at home. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 43 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because the receipt book was in the 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And immediately on that day, the cash 
used to be deposit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now you say, so he would 
call first or sent a Whatsapp message. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And say somebody would then drop the 
10 
cash. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the cash would be dropped at your 
home? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now, do you – did you know 
whether the person who was dropping the cash was his 
driver or did you not know that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sir, I did not know because there were 
different gentleman dropping it off all the time.  So it was 
20 
not like one specific person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That I can tell you I know who the driver 
is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And would you make out a receipt 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 44 of 241 
 
each time? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not be able to make receipts 
at home or would you make some receipts? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, they did not take receipts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not take receipts? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No.  Receipts were not given.  Receipts 
were kept in my office ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   ...for record purposes to show that I 
10 
received the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   But ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They never asked for receipts? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you offer then receipts at some 
stage? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Well, they never ever asked for it.  So I 
never gave a receipt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because you know in travel, you actually 
do not give a receipt.  Your air ticket is the proof, is 
actually a receipt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   You know in the old days we used to get 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 45 of 241 
 
those tear-off tickets.  So that was literally your proof of 
receipt only.  The E-tickets, they have only started like a 
few years back now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Okay continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In respect of this 
particular, I think, invoice which is marked SS2.  And you 
can go to it on page 1565.13.  Yes, Mr Singh raised a 
question mark there.  You said the invoices are issued to 
Mr Singh.  If you go to the – against his name, passenger, 
Singh/Anoj and you have route, SA/Dubai.  Is it Dubai? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And back Johannesburg, I think. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know the date?  Words appear 
there, “ticket void/COB”.  Mr Singh questioned this that the 
tickets ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where are  you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page 1565, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 13. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I forgot to mention that.  It is a tax 
invoice.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we are looking at the table that 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 46 of 241 
 
sets out the details of passenger and route ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the column route, the words appear 
there “ticket void/COB”.  And ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   1565.13? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 13.  Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Under route.  There is a table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what does that mean “ticket 
void/COB”? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Can I explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I am asking you to do. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So, basically, in a travel agency we do 
not earn commission, right?  You know everything is zero 
percent commission.  As Nana Yata(?) Agent, a new ticket 
through a Yata agent, we get charged for everything that 
we issue, okay?  So literally on that day, probably the 
ticket was issued for a specific date.  I can just give you 
20 
an example for the 16 t h of April.   
 
And then afterwards I would get a call to say:  
No, I am not travelling on the 16 t h of April at four o’clock.  I 
am travelling at 23:25, for example.  The ticket needs to be 
voided and reissued with the correct time and the correct 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 47 of 241 
 
date.  We get charged for it.  COB is a Change of Booking 
fee.  So any booking that you make, any airline, you have 
to pay a change of booking fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So ticket void does not mean that you 
never use the ticket.  If you go to SAA and you check that 
ticket, which we did give to Mr Phule, it shows you the 
flown(?) sector(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So that ticket was used, it was not 
10 
voided.  The reason why we write ticket void is because we 
have voided that ticket on Monday and we reissued another 
ticket.  So we need to charge R 350,00 because we get 
charged for it through our consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so that R 350,00 is the charge for 
changing the tickets? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   It is the charge for changing the ticket 
and voiding it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So it was probably a change of time or a 
20 
day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And it was a reissue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Literally(?). 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 48 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But otherwise, what would have changed 
would be the times ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Or the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or flying or the dates? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but in the end, effectively, the 
same ticket would be used? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Absolutely.  It would have been reissued 
10 
with a different time or a different date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  Alright.  Continue, 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So in this – okay I 
think that was the only aspect that he queried.  So on the 
next page 1565.14, it is a receipt.  Can you tell the 
Chairperson what this is? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   The R 9 100,00 could have been a 
change of class booking.  So normally, when somebody 
travels, you get different classes of bookings and it is 
20 
higher fare for each class that you book.  So the 
R 9 100,00 was upgrading fare which had to be paid for 
because I had to pay the airline and it was sent to me in 
cash payment and that is what the receipt is for.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that relate to the same booking as 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 49 of 241 
 
we find at page 1565.18? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that receipt is dated 16 July 2014, 
page 1565 point...  Yes, that page.  What were you – the 
cash paid to Sameera.  Is that yourself? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the next page, which is page 
1565.15. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   H’m? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson what this 
document is? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before we proceed.  Let us 
just cover this.  Did anybody ever pay for Mr Anoj Singh’s 
bookings other than himself or his partner? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, Mr Singh paid for his bookings 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody ever paid for him? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Not as far as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Including Mr Salim Essa? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, payment maybe would have been 
given by Mr Singh to Mr Essa to get to me but definitely I 
would get a call from Mr Singh to say:  I will send the 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 50 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes.  So I am not aware of anybody 
paying for his trips. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So the only thing that Mr Salim 
Essa did was to introduce Mr Anoj Singh to you? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, as a client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that you took Mr Salim Essa as 
Mr Singh’s guarantor? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But even that was not something that 
you discussed with Mr Salim Essa or you did discuss that 
10 
with him? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I did say that previously, sir.  I did tell 
him about it, that I am going to use him as my guarantor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So that in case I do not receive the 
payment, what do I do? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So other than that, namely that 
Mr Salim Essa introduced Mr Anoj Singh to you and two, 
20 
that you had a discussion with Mr Salim Essa that you 
would use him as a guarantor. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Other than that, the bookings that were 
made in respect of Mr Singh’s travelling.  You are saying 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 51 of 241 
 
well, bookings that either he phoned and asked you to 
make or his partner phoned and asked you to make.  Is 
that right?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in terms of Mr Singh would phone 
and say he would send somebody to come and make 
payment. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that almost all the time, 
maybe only once – almost all the time it was cash. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There may have been one or two times 
when it was EFT. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I cannot say two times, I think it was 
about one, that I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is one that you – okay, no, I am trying 
to make sure I understand, ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja.  Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  Do you know whether 
in your affidavit you have covered all the bookings that you 
20 
ever made for Mr Singh or are there others that you might 
not have covered? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sir, let me be honest with you, whether I 
gave it or not, when Halima was approached in 2018, all 
the travel documents were already given to her by the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 52 of 241 
 
Hawks.  Yes.  And then she just gave a cover up with all 
the bookings.  So every single booking.- you see, because 
like I said to you, in small travel agencies you do not have 
an accounting system because we were a non-IATA agent 
but Halima is the accountant and a consultant.  So for her 
records she used to have statements for each person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And which saved us is that everybody’s 
date of travel would be on the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So she picked it up from there because, I 
mean, many years ago my computer crashed, hers was the 
only one that managed to save. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I mean, they managed to get the 
information off.  When the Hawks came to her they got the 
information from her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you said she got the information 
from the Hawks? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, so literally we had the information 
20 
but they came to her and said give me a proof of this and 
give me a proof of this, which she did later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is like they already knew. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja, ja, they already knew because they 
had gone to South African  – this ticket that you are talking 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 53 of 241 
 
about, it is South African Airways.  That was given to 
Halima and then she just gave a repeat copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   It was given to her from SAA already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but is your answer that as far as you 
know you have covered in your affidavit all the booking 
that you made for Mr Anoj Singh or is the position that you 
do not know whether it covers all of them?  What is the 
position? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, it does cover. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It cover all of them. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   It covers, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay.  Mr Seleka, 
continue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. Back to that page, Ms Sooliman, 
1565.15.  I was asking you to explain to the Chairperson 
what is that document? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   You mean the bank deposit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, page – yes you are on that page, 
1565.15. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so this is the – our statement, 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So what do you need me to explain, 
please? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 54 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Explain to the Chairperson what it is 
and what do you seek to show in respect of it. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so basically when payment is to 
come through to me at my place when it was cash – most 
of the time obviously cash.  I would, like I said to you 
previously, I would ring the office and say Halima or the 
lady who was there, I have received payment and it was for 
this ticket.  They used to receipt in the office in Lenasia. 
Like I said to you, I never worked in the Lenasia office, I 
always worked from Johannesburg.  And then we would 
10 
deposit it in the account. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that was a deposit made on the 16 
July 2014? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, in July, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now I remember that in respect of this 
booking Mr Singh said he agreed that he travelled on that 
date but that it was a Transnet-related trip. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Whether his outbound trip was a 
Transnet trip, that I do not know because I only issued the 
Dubai/Johannesburg [indistinct – dropping voice] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And that was paid to me, as you can see 
from the invoice and you can see as per the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka just keep your eyes on 
the real issues. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 55 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the main issues are he did 
booking bookings for Mr Anoj Singh and the next thing is 
who paid. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she has already said that for – I do 
not know whether she said most or all of the trips, 
bookings that she made for Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Anoj Singh 
for them.  That is the important issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now there may be some details that are 
important but a lot of them might not be important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, Ms Sooliman, you say in paragraph 
22.2 of your affidavit, it is at page 1565.4 – have you got 
it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to that trip – well, you say  - in 
regard to that trip you said: 
“Mr Essa settled this via EFT to my Nedbank 
20 
account.  I subsequently transferred this from my 
Nedbank 
account 
to 
the 
account 
of 
Travel 
Excellence.  I also attach hereto the receipt issued 
on 6 August 2014.” 
That is in respect of a trip where you say: 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 56 of 241 
 
“The booking was requested by Mr Singh’s partner 
and it was for Mr Singh and her to fly from 
Johannesburg on 6 August 2014 to Dubai and back, 
Johannesburg on 12 August 2014.” 
You say: 
“Mr Singh and his partner were issued with ticket 
number...” 
You give the ticket numbers and you say the total cost was 
R60 000 which was charged to Mr Essa’s account.  Is that 
true? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, Sir, it was done into my personal 
Nedbank account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because obviously we needed the 
payment immediately.  Sometimes if you do it like, you 
know, with different banks, it takes some time, so probably 
the cash was arranged between the two of them and given 
to Mr Essa.  As Mr Rohan checked my Nedbank account, I 
could not even remember, he saw this transaction of 
60 000 which then was written there from – it was done 
20 
from Mr Essa’s account but it was obviously for Mr Singh’s 
travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At this time you were – which is August 
2014, you were still on a part-time basis with Travel 
Excellence. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 57 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, do you want to take her to 
those annexures? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  If you would please turn to 
page 1565.17 and you will have to compare it – well, Mr 
Singh raised some discrepancies in regard to the amount 
but let me draw your attention to the main point that he 
was raising.  The invoice on page 1565.17 has a date of 
10 
31/07/2014. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is that amount of 60 000 but this 
invoice date is before the travel date, August 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, the dates on the invoice 
do not correspond with the dates you give in paragraph 
22.2 of your affidavit.  What do you say about that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   You mean the invoice date and the travel 
date is different? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, look at the invoice at page 
20 
1565.17. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There the date given is 31 July 2014, it 
does not say that is the date for travelling so I do not 
know, maybe it is the date when the invoice was issued 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 58 of 241 
 
and the account number given is 3000365.  Whose account 
is that, do you know? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so that account number, like we 
said to you was allocated to Mr Essa, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because nobody else had an account 
with me, Sir.  So literally when Halima used to do – she 
had an account number for each person that we did an 
account for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So that would go on her invoice but as 
you can see, on 1565.16 there is an invoice on the 31 July 
generated through from Serendipity Tours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry …[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   The page before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are going to page 1565.16, what do 
you say about that invoice? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so that invoice was issued on the 
31 July from Serendipity.  That was the day we actually 
issued the air ticket. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does that date appear? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   In the little box on the right hand side, 
where it says document number, date, account number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it says date without saying date 
issued or date of travelling.  What date is it? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 59 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, Sir, if you see on the right hand side 
- you know, the invoice that has got Serendipity tours 
written on the top? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see the box you are talking about on 
the right hand side. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So it says date 31/07/2014, right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what I am saying to you is that it 
does not indicate whether that is the date for travelling. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the date of the issue of the invoice.  
10 
So I want you to explain what date it is. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is the date of the issuing.  So there 
is system QuickTrav on travel agency …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Date of the issuing of the invoice. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And air ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   The invoice and the air ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the air ticket. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct.  So as soon as I issue an air 
ticket with Serendipity with my consortium immediately 
20 
within the day before the end of the evening I received and 
invoice like this which got the date on the top.  That means 
that is the day I issued the ticket, it is not the date of 
travel, it is the day I issued the air ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so the date of travelling 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 60 of 241 
 
would appears somewhere in the body of the invoice.  I see 
that in the column in the middle at page 1565.16 it says 
passenger Dep date, is that the date of departure, dep 
date?  H’m? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Correct and then says route and then 
says class. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then says Anoj Singh and then it 
says 06/08/2014, would that be the date of departure? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there is a hyphen, then it says 
12/08/2014, would be the date of arrival back? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Return. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So is that the invoice that 
you issued, that is now at page 1565.16 that you issued in 
respect of the booking that you talk about at paragraph 
22.2? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And what is the – what is the tax 
20 
invoice on page 1565.17? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, that is, like I said to you, it is for 
our records in our travel agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the total on the invoice at 
1565.16? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 61 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so 1565.16 is what Serendipity 
Tours charges us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Remember, we are travel agents, we get 
corporate fares, Sir.  If he had bought this direct from 
South African Airways he would have paid a ticket of 
48 000 per person but being in the travel industry so long 
each consortium gets corporate fares.  So we gave him a 
corporate fare which was R18 000 cheaper per air ticket.  
So they charge us this price and we – I mean, we need to 
10 
live, we need to make a commission, so basically the one 
where you have got here on 1565.17, is what we charge 
the client and what the client would pay us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I see in the invoice at page 
1565.17 that the total appears to have been R60 000, is 
that correct? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is right, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the total on the invoice at page 
1565.16 is it 53 420? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the total on that one. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say that is what you would get 
charged as Travel Excellence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 62 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would then – for the total to go 
up to 60 then you added your commission. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes and remember, we pay ticketing fees 
to the consortium as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So from that commission we pay the 
consortium ticketing fees and they are using Galileo 
system, we have to pay for.  So all that money does not 
come to us, it is literally what we have to pay as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay.  But now you 
10 
issued this invoice to Mr Anoj Singh, is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that at page 1565.17 you wrote Mr 
Anoj Singh and then you wrote “walk in”. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   It was just a record for us as how we 
used to, you know, because like I said to you, I allocated 
his account to Mr Essa.  Just it was just something that 
Halima used to – because he was new client, so she just 
named him as a walk-in client although he was not walk-in 
client, it was via telephone. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Now where is something 
that shows that Mr Salim Essa settled this account of 
R6 000 via EFT? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   There is an EFT on the back page, if you 
see, 1565.18.  There is my personal account. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 63 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is at 1565.18?  What is that 
document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, explain to the Chairperson. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Oh, so this is the EFT that was done into 
my Nedbank account.   
CHAIRPERSON: Ja, but did Mr Salim Essa transfer the 
money from his Nedbank account to your Nedbank account  
to your Nedbank account?  Or did he transfer it from his 
account to your Nedbank account? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
and 
then 
you 
subsequently 
transferred 
it 
from 
your 
Nedbank 
account 
to 
Travel 
Excellence account. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, as an immediate payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is there dates that appears on 
page 1565.18 in terms of this amount? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The date is… 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot see. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This entry – it is 2014/08/06 or 05, I 
20 
cannot see the last one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now do you still have this Nedbank 
account? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sir, I do not have it, this was taken by Mr 
Rohan, I do not even have this.  He brought it to us then I 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 64 of 241 
 
was called in first for the… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
closed 
the 
account 
or 
what 
happened? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, no, I have account but they were 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that is what I am asking you. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, I have the account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you still have the account at 
Nedbank, same account? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So which means that this 
having been 2014, if this has not been done, you could ask 
your bank account to provide information as to where that 
money came from or do you have that, Mr Salim Essa – Mr 
Seleka?  I apologise.  I apologise.  Have you got that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have we got that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Save for the description here, Chair, 
we – if I understand the Chairperson’s question, save for 
the description we see in there, it does indicate for Salim 
20 
Essa, payment for Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does it indicate? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, the – after the 60 000, this 
amount and then there is description.  Description says 
part payment for Salim Essa. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 65 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would it say part payment for Salim 
Essa? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the description. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, because – well, we should get a 
proper record or affidavit from the bank. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes from the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That says their records show that this 
money that came into Ms Sooliman’s account came from 
whose account where.  Now it may be that in terms of the 
laws of evidence it might not be necessary to have an 
10 
affidavit on the basis that a bank record will be enough but 
you can apply your mind to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but we need to know where it came 
from. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And entered through her account and 
also what we need is whether on the day that she will say 
she did this it was transferred into an account of Travel 
Excellence and what is that account.  Do you recall how 
20 
soon after you had received this money in your account 
you transferred it to Travel Excellence account? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I think when Rohan give a statement, 
when I saw it at the first meeting that we went.  We 
actually saw the EFT done on the same day from my 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 66 of 241 
 
account into Travel Excellence account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but what I am asking is, this was a 
payment that was made in 2014, is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sorry, Sir/ 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was a payment that was made into 
your account in 2014? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am asking is whether after you 
had become aware that Mr Salim Essa had transferred 
money into your account, that did not belong to you, that 
10 
was meant to be transferred to Travel Excellence? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How soon thereafter did you transfer it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   The same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be the same day or…? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, yes, the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, she says the investigators – Ms 
Sooliman, 
are 
you 
saying 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
the 
investigators have the document, the then document that 
20 
shows that you transferred the money on the same day? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, Mr Seleka.  I did not have anything 
of this sort so when I went to the first meeting with Mr Javu 
and Rohan, he brought this out to me and he even – I think 
he saw the transaction where it was EFT’d to Travel 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 67 of 241 
 
Excellence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, those are the investigators, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that must be explored so that we 
have got the full trail. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is proper evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because it is an issue that is 
disputed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you will give your cooperation 
to whatever needs to be done, is that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I did previously as well, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  And then if you look at 
page 1565.19, what is that?  What is that document? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so like I said, we needed to keep 
records of money coming in, whether it was EFT, whether it 
was credit card, whether it was cash payment because we 
20 
obviously gave Serendipity money so we needed to know 
for who the ticket was and when the money was received.  
So obviously when I – when the EFT came in to me, I then 
sent it to Travel Excellence and they made the receipt out 
for their records. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 68 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a receipt dated 6 August 2014 
and it is written Anoj Singh#S,Nike and then it is written 
R60 000 only, invoice number AS87301.  What does AS 
stand for?  I am on page 1565.19. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, I am just checking whether it is an 
invoice number – oh, it is our number, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So A just means account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  And S? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Where is S?  Oh, I do not know what the 
10 
S is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know but it is your reference, 
it helps you inside Travel Excellence to locate it and see 
who it belongs to. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Basically it was just a receipt so Halima 
knew that the account number - you know, the invoice 
number 87301 was the invoice and that was the payment 
for the invoice.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I see that below R60 000 which is – 
it is 60 000 actually but I guess it refers R60 000, it is 
20 
written EFT - Salim Essa.  Who wrote out this receipt? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   We had a girl working in the office so 
she used to – one of the admin girls, so she used to make 
receipts out for us in order to keep record of payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who would have told her who the money 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 69 of 241 
 
came from and what the money was for? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I would tell her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have told her? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  And that was that trip 
dealt with in paragraph 22.2.  Mr Seleka do you want to 
proceed? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  There is a question just 
before we move on, Chair, because Mr Salim – Mr Anoj 
Singh on this particular aspect, he queried the date of your 
10 
invoice, which is 31 July 2014 and a date of payment, 
according to the bank document you show on page 16 – I 
mean 1565.18, the date which I have read out with some 
difficulty, I think is 6 August 2014 and which shows that Mr 
Salim Essa made the transfer but he says you could have 
created the invoice after the fact and backdated it in order 
to match the R60 000 which you say is a bank transfer by 
Mr Essa, an EFT transfer by Mr Essa. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So what you are saying is that the 
receipt and the invoice date do not tally? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, okay, got to instructions 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Ja, the invoice you said is the 31 July, 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The EFT transfer. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   On what, on the 6 August? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 70 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, on the 6 August. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would have been – it could have 
been made but that you might have created your invoice 
after the fact, after the date of that payment and backdated 
it in order to match the 60 000 that is allegedly paid by Mr 
Essa so that you can link him to Mr Essa as Mr Essa 
having made the payment for him. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So, Mr Chairman, that is not possible 
because the invoice on 1565.16 for the 31 July, if you can 
10 
find out from Serendipity Tours is automated – it is like as 
soon as you issue the ticket the invoice shoots out.  So I 
find that there is something like this and he does not come 
to me, I have not done this invoice, this invoice has come 
from my consortium, I do not have the QuickTrav system to 
backtrack it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, according to him, he paid for this 
invoice – I mean for this, yes, the invoice himself. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   He could have given the money – he 
obviously gave the money to Mr Essa who then in turn 
20 
EFT’d it to me.  Who could I – do not know where else I 
could have got the money from because it is tallying up to 
the invoice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then lastly on that Serendipity’s 
invoice to you, there is a date at the foot of the page on 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 71 of 241 
 
the left hand corner, just by your thumb. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of 13/11/2018 and he was querying 
that as well. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I honestly I do not know where this – it is 
probably the IATA system that came.  I mean, you can see 
this is a system-generated invoice.  I do not know what this 
date is here at the bottom.  It says IATA, so it is probably 
the IATA billing number, the date of the IATA billing.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, but you …[intervenes] 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   You know, the billings used to come out 
every fortnight, so probably that was the billing number. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is not an invoice Travel 
Excellence generated. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, this is not Travel Excellence invoice, 
it is Serendipity. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Seleka, I quickly had a look at 
the various paragraphs in which Ms Sooliman deals with 
bookings for Mr Essa, it would seem that the difference in 
20 
their versions is narrowed down, can be narrowed down to 
two in terms of what is really important on the big picture. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She has said that most of the bookings 
that she made for Mr Anoj Singh Android were paid for by 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 72 of 241 
 
Mr Singh, okay, all except one which you said was cash but 
on her she has also said in the affidavit that she has 
confirmed in her oral evidence that there is one that was – 
there was one account for Mr Singh that was settled by Mr 
Salim Essa by EFT.  
Now she has testified about that, the only other one 
where it would appear or from her affidavit Mr Singh did 
not pay for his one which is in paragraph 22.7 of her 
affidavit starting at page 1565.6 and going to 1565.7.  That 
is a booking for Mr Singh to fly from Johannesburg to 
10 
Dubai on 24 February 2017and back on 27 February 2017.   
She says she cannot recall who made this request 
but she says Mr Singh was issued with a ticket and she 
give the ticket number and she says she also booked a 
ticket for Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Mr R Gupta, for these 
flights together with visa’s for Mr Varoon Gupta, Mr V 
Gupta and Mr Srikant Singhala.  She says the invoice was 
addressed to Mr R Gupta and was charged to account 
number C000349 which was the account belonging to 
Sahara Computers, the Gupta owned entity that is what she 
20 
says in her affidavit.  
She then says the total amount invoiced was R134 
560, and then she says: 
“To the best of my recollection, I received a call 
from Mr Ashu Chawla who was our contact person 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 73 of 241 
 
at Sahara Computers who informed me that a driver 
would be dropping off the money in cash.  This 
indeed took place, seeing as a driver dropped R170 
000 in cash shortly thereafter.  The difference would 
have been for settlement of outstanding fees on 
their account, CSS26.  This cash was again given to 
a friend who in turn made an EFT payment to our 
Travel Excellence FNB account.” 
It seems that is the only other hooking involving Mr Singh 
that she says was not paid for by Mr Singh.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, she says to the best of her 
recollection, she received a call from Mr Chawla.  You have 
heard me read what you have written here. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Chair, remember that this affidavit is 
being written on behalf of myself and Halima.  This first, 
this one here was written by Halima, she used to deal with 
Mr Chawla and Sahara Computers.  So between Halima 
and I we use to split the account, so she can clarify that 
when she comes on the stand.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, this is affidavit is not written on 
behalf of yourself and Ms Allana, it is your affidavit. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   We both had the same affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   We both had the same affidavit. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 74 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well your affidavit is, your affidavit.  You 
did not both sign this one, you are the only one who signed 
this one, is it not? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, I signed it, but okay that is what - 
the story on 22.7, Halima was the one who used to deal 
with Sahara Computers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So yes, we used to - I mean, it was both 
a Travel Excellence account, but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you know nothing about it? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, no I used to see the bookings being 
issued and stuff.  I am not saying I do not know about it 
but when it used to come to the accounts and some of the 
bookings like for the Gupta passengers, and the visas, 
etcetera, Halima used to deal with the Gupta account, and 
then that booking was made for Mr Singh was made when 
Mr Chawla contacted Halima to make the booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the question is, do you have 
personal knowledge of what you wrote in paragraph 22.7 or 
is it something that is only known by Ms Allana? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, I know about it because every 
booking that Halima made, so I make we can see each 
other's emails and we can see each other's bookings.  So I 
am aware of the booking, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you did not deal with the people 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 75 of 241 
 
in regard to this booking yourself?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you have written here is based on 
the records. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, I know that the booking took place 
because everything is on my computer, right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS SOOLIMAN:   But I was not consulted to make the 
booking but I am aware of the booking, yes, for sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so where you say: 
10 
“To the best of my recollection I received a call from 
Mr Ashu Chawla who was our contact person at 
Sahara Computers, who informed me that a driver 
would be dropping off the money in cash.” 
Are you talking about something that you have personal 
knowledge of? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Of the cash? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the call. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Of the call from Mr Chawla, so he rang 
Halima to tell her that the monies will come. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he did not ring you? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, he rang Halima.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that part of the affidavit is not 
correct. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, it says here, advisement…[intervene] 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 76 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says, I received a call from Mr Ashu 
Chawla. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   From Mr Jabu, the first affidavit that 
came when I went to Sandton was the one that Halima 
gave the statement to the Hawks, okay and then Mr Jabu 
and Mr Rowan said to me that I need to agree to all of this 
so she gave the first affidavit and I agreed to all of this 
and we both had to sign the affidavit. 
So the only second one that came in was to sign 
10 
corrections was when we were approached by Mr Jabu.  So 
where it means I this affidavit was for where Halima and I 
both had to speak in one day - literally, they did not call 
me on that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, who was doing that, I mean an 
affidavit is for a single person, you know.  Another one can 
confirm, if they confirmed.  If you say I received a call it 
must be because you received the call not because that 
your colleague received a call. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, you must – Chairperson so let me 
20 
tell you the first when we were called in, in March, I was 
not called in, I went in on my own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Called in by whom? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   By Mr Jabu and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The investigators? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 77 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And Mr Rowan I think it was in Sandton.  
So they called her in and I myself went as well with her to 
accompany her.  And then he said to me, that we have the 
affidavits from Halima and we just need to clarify that you 
agreed to receiving the payments, okay.  
Thereafter we were – the affidavit was sent to us 
which I agree to everything but the call from Mr Chawla 
Halima used to get a call from Mr Chawla for the collection 
10 
of payment.  
Thereafter we were both taken to the police station 
to sign the one affidavit and there only after that recently 
where we started with Mr Jabu and we had our two 
separated affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying one, it is not true that 
you received a call from Mr Chawla about - in regard to 
this booking?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   Halima received a call from Mr Chawla 
and I received the payment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you did not receive the call.  
MS SOOLIMAN:   No.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and did you know Mr Chawla to be 
Travel Excellence, a contact person at Sahara Computers? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Absolutely.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 78 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and it is also not true that Mr 
Chawla informed you that a driver would be dropping off 
the money in cash, is that right, he did not inform you 
because he did not call you? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, he informed Halima and she in turn 
informed me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you say - and then you say this 
indeed took place, that is the dropping off of the money in 
cash, is that right, you say that took place? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, he did drop off the money in cash, 
10 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you receive the money?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   I did, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. Now, have you read this 
affidavit in separation for giving your evidence?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   I had read it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Again, have you read it again recently, 
maybe yesterday? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, sir the new one that I signed 
yesterday, I did. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no this one in preparation for giving 
your evidence, have you gone through it again? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I did, but I did not see this one where it 
says I because we were - you know, the one where you 
asking me why it says I received a call from Mr Chawla.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 79 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I obviously not been in the law, you know 
in that, I did not know that we had to do two separate ones 
and where it says me, Halima or me Sameera because this 
affidavit was written by her first, we were questioned about 
it and all we did was it was sent to us and we had to sign it 
together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now, is there anything else in this 
affidavit where you talk as if it's something you have 
personal knowledge of, but you actually do not have 
10 
personal knowledge of that you are aware of, or would you 
need time to have a look, again? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, I can tell you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is there something else? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, there is one more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, tell me? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So there is one more for Mr Koko, 
because Mr Koko’s travel arrangements Halima originated 
the booking, okay.  Let me tell you how, the email came to 
me, okay.  I probably was not available at that day, but 
20 
both of us can see each other's emails.  So in order for us 
to get the work done quicker, while I was not available, 
Halima started making the booking and she originated the 
booking. Thereafter she handled the booking, she did the 
visa’s, she did whatever.  The only other time that I got 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 80 of 241 
 
involved was when the payment came. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, in regard to Mr Koko?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, in regard to Mr Anoj Singh 
bookings for Mr Anoj Singh? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, everything eels is, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Everything else is fine? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have personal knowledge of it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just this particular one that we have 
discussed? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, I did know about the travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the call did not come through to you. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair. That reminds me 
Ms Sooliman of another issue that arose when Mr Koko 
was testifying, which is and we can get that out of the way 
quickly, paragraph 14 of your affidavit. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:    Paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 14, one four, page 15, 65.3. 
Are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   15, 65.3. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 81 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It reads: 
“I 
have 
provided 
the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission with the documents I still have in my 
possession, including documentation attached to 
your previous affidavit.” 
Then there is some corrections they have made with your 
signature. I would like you to explain to the Chairperson 
how did the affidavit read first, originally, and what change 
have you made? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay, so it says here: 
“I provided the investigators of the Commission with 
the documents I still have in my possession, 
including 
documentation 
attached 
to 
previous 
affidavit.” 
That means I had it personally.  You know me, I have the 
documents personally and then the investigators picked up 
that this was from Ms Allana, so I was called back to the 
police station because the previous affidavit submitted to 
the Hawks was by Ms Allana.  That is why there is a plus 
20 
sign there and it says Ms Allana, I had to go back to the 
Commission and have it resigned. So basically in the 
previous affidavit by Ms Allana, not by Sameera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the first – what is the first – what did 
the first affidavit say that was not correct? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 82 of 241 
 
MS 
SOOLIMAN: 
 
 
The 
first 
affidavit 
said 
that 
the 
documentation attached to the affidavit previously is held 
by myself, but it was not held by myself it is held by Ms 
Allana and she is the one who did the affidavit that was 
submitted to the Hawks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So should the correction then be on 
two respects, should the correction be on two respects?  I 
still have in my possession; with the documents I still have 
in my possession? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I do not have the documents in my 
10 
position Halima has the documents in her position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you say here paragraph 14: 
“I 
have 
provided 
the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission with the documents I still have in my 
possession.” 
Was that factually correct when you said that in the 
affidavit at that time? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sir, I never said that in an affidavit, like I 
said to you the first affidavit…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This one? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   This one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you say that in this one? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  This one was typed up with Mr Rohan the 
investigator, therefore he called me back where he added 
in Ms Allana's name to resign it. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 83 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what did you intend this to read, 
what did you want to say? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I was not – where it comes to the Hawks, 
I was not approached by the Hawks at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Only Halima was approached by the 
Hawks.  So that statement is for Halima, not for Sameera, 
that is why I was called in again.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So did you provide the investigators of 
the Commission with any documents at all? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Me myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You, yourself. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, sir, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so that was supposed to be 
something that Ms Allana would say. 
MS SOOLIMAN:    Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not you.  
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say the investigators had 
prepared an affidavit for Ms Allana and how did that come 
20 
to be in your affidavit there, did they take that you knew 
the same information, you provided the same documents, 
or was just a mistake on their part? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sir, I suppose it was just a mistake, 
because I was not called in at all.  I just presented myself 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 84 of 241 
 
to accompany Halima, because I knew the people that we 
were dealing with, right.  So that day, I was not called in at 
all, I myself went in with Halima. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you dealt with this in your 
supplementary affidavit? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   With this one here?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, this one they have not – they have 
only made me do that addition where it is written Ms Allana 
and the signature, that is all. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there should be a supplementary 
affidavit Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That explains properly why we have this 
paragraph in there.  She has this paragraph in her affidavit 
and how that came about and what actually - whether she 
disowns the paragraph in its entirety in the sense that it 
was some – it was a paragraph that should only have been 
in her colleague’s affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or whether it should have been in her 
affidavit with some qualification of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think with regard to Mr Anoj 
Singh I do not know if you – if there is something else of 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 85 of 241 
 
significance that you still wanted to question, that you still 
want to question here on, if so, you may proceed.  
But from my point of view, I think in terms of 
important things she has covered and there may be some 
dispute about whether a particular trip happened or not but 
I am not sure if that matters much.  
The point is there are two points or three points.  
The bookings were made, travelling happened for most of 
the trips, and she says Mr Singh paid for most of those in 
cash and he paid once by EFT and there was once when Mr 
10 
Salim Essa settled his account, Mr Anoj Singh’s account.  
Then there is the arrangement relating to Me 
Chawla that trip, she did not receive the call from Mr 
Chawla, her colleague received it and told her about it but 
she received the payment.  Is that correct?  
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the – it seems to me that as far 
as Mr Singh is concerned, that is the substance of the 
evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no, that is correct Chairperson and 
20 
particularly that none of the trips are disputed it has been 
taken, except for the purpose of the nature of the first 
which Mr Singh says it is a business trip and I think his 
argument is that it would have been paid by Transnet.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but in the context of her evidence it 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 86 of 241 
 
seems to me that it is neither here nor there because 
whether it was paid for by Transnet or by himself it does 
not matter for purposes of the Commission's investigation.   
The important thing was whether they were paid for 
by Mr Salim Essa and in so far as there may be something 
to be made of the cash payments, but that is a different 
matter.  They is no dispute between them, Ms Sooliman 
and Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Anoj Singh himself said most of the 
payments were cash payments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so we are at 1 o'clock, I think we 
should adjourn for lunch and then when we come back, she 
can deal with bookings for Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will she be dealing with the bookings 
relating to Mr Zwane? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not her, Chair Ms Allana.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright so she deals with Mr Anoj 
Singh and Mr Koko only. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Only. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is shaking her head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, not with Mr Koko’s booking was like I 
explained to you just now.  It was an email sent to me, but 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 87 of 241 
 
Halima originated - she did the entire booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, well, let us see when we come back, 
because I see here in paragraph 23 you say: 
“During December 2015, I received a request from 
Mr Essa to arrange flight tickets for a Mr Matshela 
Moses Koko.” 
So let us when we come back you can clarify whether that 
is something you have personal knowledge of, in the sense 
that you did receive the call or whether it is one of those 
where the paragraph should have been in your colleague’s 
10 
affidavit. Okay, let us take the lunch adjournment we will 
resume at two, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank – thank you Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You remembered to contact Mr Koko’s 
lawyers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As usual where they say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Sooliman shall we proceed – we are 
in Eskom Bundle 18(b).  Chair I am still – okay I will – there 
are certain details she gives in regard to that.  She talks 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 88 of 241 
 
about in paragraph 22.7 which I thought should be drawn to 
your attention but I am still waiting for that affidavit which is 
signed.  So Mr Sooliman let us deal with the travel 
arrangements for Mr Matshela Koko.  And that you find on 
page 1565.7 of the bundle we are dealing with.  And so in 
the course of your explanation to the Chairperson you will 
explain what you personally know and the role that you 
personally played and distinguish what you did to what if Mr 
Allana was involved to what she did.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think on paragraph 23 you say in 
10 
December 2015 you received a request from Mr Essa to 
arrange flight tickets for a Mr Matshela Moses Koko and two 
of his family members.  These being a Ms Mosimo Elizabeth 
Koko and a Mr Pheeha Koko.  Did that happen?  Did you 
receive such a request from Mr Essa? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Mr Chair first I need to apologise I think it 
is the first time I testified.  In the beginning when you asked 
me when my child was born it was not 2016 it was 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes so I do apologise.  It is the first time I 
20 
am testifying so I was a bit nervous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Okay where it comes to Mr Koko you have 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 89 of 241 
 
asked me I received a request.  Absolutely correct I received 
an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  From – from Mr Essa. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct.  The email is attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I received an email requesting bookings to 
be made for Mr Koko however Halima and myself do receive 
each other’s emails. I was not present to arrange the – to do 
the bookings – the actual booking. So you will see in the 
next emails Halima made the actual booking – air tickets 
10 
were then issued and was sent off to Mr Essa by Halima.  
Visas were done and was sent through to Mr Essa through 
my staff member Sajida at the office.  Okay so where it 
comes to the arrangements of the flight yes it was emailed to 
me but she then over the booking and the only other part 
was then when the email had come through for the payment 
which I then received the payment from the driver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka do you want to take it 
from there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think if she says there is an email 
she received from Mr Essa let us go there.  I do not 
remember seeing it.  I do not know if it is here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that email here Ms Sooliman? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 90 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is a string of emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it attached to your affidavit? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  There was a whole string of emails that 
came through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are talking about an email you 
would have received from Mr Salim Essa in December 2015. 
With regard to Mr Koko because you said you received an 
email. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes I did receive an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well probably it is not here because if it 
10 
was here one of us would know 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No we would have known yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What – what you have attached Ms 
Sooliman is what you say CSS28.  Now if you go to SS28 
which is on page 1565.41. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 41.  So there are emails and 
obviously you have to read them from – from the top up.  
There is a string of emails which start on page 1565.45.   
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So from the top up is an exchange of 
emails. Maybe you can explain that to the – I do not know if 
you are familiar with all of them but they are attached… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us start with this.  Are you 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 91 of 241 
 
certain that the initial request came by way of an email? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to a phone call? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir it was via an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are certain.   
MS SOOLIMAN:  Probably… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was December 2015. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the email that the evidence leader has 
referred you to there is on that page an email from Sahieda 
or Sajieda to salimessa@gmail.com sent on 23 December 
2015 at twenty to twelve in the night. The subject is visa – 
one visa for travel and it says 3 x Koko family visa.  But that 
is not an email from Mr Essa. The one on top of that is an 
email from Mr Essa to yourself dated 3 January 2016 but for 
now we are looking for December.  If we do not have that 
email here do you know whether you can access it and get it 
for us? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir Halima has it on her laptop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got it on the laptop? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes you mean requesting the booking? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja from Mr Salim Essa to you in December 
2015. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 92 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay will you arrange for that to be 
given to the legal team? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  I think Mr Seleka a short 
supplementary affidavit can be done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which refers to paragraph 23. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And say this request referred to in 
paragraph 23 was made by way of an email from Mr Salim 
Essa to me.  I attach that email to this affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  So – so – okay Mr – I guess 
we do not need at this stage to go to these other emails 
because she says the email can be accessed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can obviously deal with them in terms 
of your plan at whatever time you want to deal with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Yes if necessary.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 93 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the issues that arise here if I 
may go into them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Mr Koko’s evidence.  So Ms 
Sooliman the trip here relates to what you have said and we 
have seen from the evidence is a request to Travel 
Excellence to do flight bookings for Mr Koko, his wife and his 
child from Indonesia to Dubai.  You confirm this is what it 
relates to? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes I confirm. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That was the one leg of the trip.  The 
other trip – okay that one leg was on the 4t h of January 
2016.  The other leg is on the 5t h of January 2016 from 
Dubai back to South Africa. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm that you did that booking? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is not in dispute 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So just to – Mr Koko admits that 
Travel Excellence did that booking for both legs for the leg 
from Indonesia to Dubai and from Dubai to Johannesburg.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he accepts that the booking was made 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 94 of 241 
 
by Travel Excellence and he says he never asked Travel 
Excellence to make the booking himself and I think from your 
side you say you have – you are not saying that he asked 
Travel Excellence as I recall here and he thinks that Ms 
Daniels from Eskom a colleague of his must be the one who 
had – who asked Mr Salim Essa to ask Travel Excellence to 
make the booking.  I do not think that there are any issues 
between the two of you on that aspect. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No but I do not know who Suzanne Daniels 
is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Okay.  So – so here you 
confirm that it was Mr Essa who requested that bookings be 
made for Mr Koko and his two family members. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes the email will confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall by any chance what date that 
email was or you cannot?  We will see it in any event when 
we see the email. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I think it was maybe around about like in 
20 
January I cannot remember the exact date maybe 16t h or 
somewhere around there.  No, no it cannot be I lie.  Because 
he travelled on the 4t h or 5t h of January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I do not know the date. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 95 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you say in here it is during December  
2015. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes I do not know the exact date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine we will see it when it – 
when we get there.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well did you have those emails 
which are from 22 December 2015 on those pages I have 
referred to but we will wait for the right email.  
MS SOOLIMAN:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What I am talking about is if you go to 
10 
page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe while Mr Seleka is looking for the 
right page do you – did you ever have any interactions with a 
Miss Suzanne Daniels from Eskom in relation to any matters 
relating to Mr Koko? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Not at all.  I saw her name for the first time 
in an article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MS SOOLIMAN:   I do not know who she is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have never interacted with her. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Never Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes if you – I have given you that page of 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 96 of 241 
 
1565.41. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then Point 45 – 1565.45.   
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the string of emails. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Starting from 22 December 2015. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see that on the – so we are starting 
from the top – from the end to the beginning on page 
10 
1565.44 at the bottom of that page I see an email where 
Halima Allana is copied.   
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes correct I see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Would you have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us say first who the email was 
from and to who it was to and what the date was and the 
subject matter.

it related to? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell us who it was from?  Visas Mileto

10 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Climax Tourism was our visa agent in 
Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was another travel agent – agency that 
you went to see. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No we – we cannot do visas ourselves in 
South Africa for Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So we have an allocated agent in Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  That does visas for us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So Haja at Climax Tourism LLC was the 
agent at that time that used to do our Dubai visas.  Because 
in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry who was Haja?

CHAIRPERSON:  Your – your… 
MS SOOLIMAN:  She was our – our agency – she was a lady

MS SOOLIMAN:  Not necessarily she did visas for anybody

10 
that time to do visas for Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she was independent? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and – but you would ask her to do visas 
for you? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  And you say visas 
miletovisas@climaxtourism was a travel agency in Dubai. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were using. 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct.  A tour operator and visa agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so – who would have specifically 
made the request for – for Climax Tourism to assist with the 
visas for Mr Koko? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 99 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Okay so we received an email with copies 
of the passports for Mr Koko and his family and then Sajeeda

CHAIRPERSON:  Well – I am sorry Mr Seleka said for Mr 
Koko. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not apparent from this that it was for 
Mr Koko.  Who was this – who did this email relate to? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So Sajeeda sent the passport copies.  She 
is the lady that works for us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  She sent the copies to our visa agent in 
Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Whose visas was she dealing with? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  The three visas for Mr Koko and the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  The two of them – the family members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Seleka continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes so did you say who 
specifically made the request from your side? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To Climax Tourism? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes.  Sajeeda sent the email through.

Page 100 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know Mr Seleka whether we 
need to bother about those details. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is common cause the – the 
visas were applied for processed by Travel Excellence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The only issue is that actually I do not 
even think it is an issue because Mr Koko says I never asked 
10 
them and they are not saying he asked them.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To do that.  So as far as I am concerned as 
far as the visas are concerned she cannot assist more. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because what she is saying is not 
disputed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think we need to move onto … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Move on yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the details about the travel agents 
outside of South Africa in the end it is neither here nor there.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right.    
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 101 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what – what may be important is to 
go to these emails that you referred to at page 1565.41.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that email Ms Sooliman the first one 
from the bottom it came from Sajeeda and it was addressed 
to salimessa@gmail.com do you know that email address 
salimessa@gmail.com? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose email address is it? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It is – well it is Mr Essa’s email I am not 
10 
sure if it was the receptionist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  But there is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you use it when you were interacting 
with Mr Essa or his secretary? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes we used to use it quite often. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And the subject is 1 Visa for 
Travel.  Who is Sajeeda?  Or is it Saheeda? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Sajeeda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja who is that? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  She is the consultant that works at Travel 
Excellence offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  Now she seems to have 
sent an email to Mr Essa’s email address and she says  
“3 x Koko family visa.  Thanks or much 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 102 of 241 
 
regards Sajeeda – is it Mahet” 
MS SOOLIMAN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you know about this email at the 
time you said you have access to one another’s emails is 
that right? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes.  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Did you know about this email? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It was with an attachment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And then the one at the top 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Just before that I see two people 
seemed to be copied there Mr – I mean Ms Sooliman in that 
email the Chairperson was talking about of Sajeeda.  There 
is 
cc 
Sameera 
Travel 
Excellence 
and 
Halima 
Travel 
Excellence is that you being copied there? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Together with Ms Allana? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes it is because Sajeeda is just our 
20 
consultant and whatever work she does she has to copy us 
in in order for us to know what is happening in the office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you remember receiving this email? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes absolutely. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 103 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then at the top there is an email from Mr 
Salim Essa Sunday the 3r d of January 2016 at 13:53.  On the 
face of it it appears to be an email to you Sameera 
Sooliman, is that yourself? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the subject is Forward, forward 1 
Visa for travel.  And then the attachments.  Are Travel 
10 
Matshela Koko Moses, Travel Mosimo Elizabeth Koko and 
the last one Pheeha Koko.  Can you explain to the 
Chairperson why was this email being forwarded to you if it 
is a forward to you? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  It does show as it was forwarded to me but 
I do not know for what reason because I do receive the 
copies anyway of the visas.  So I am not sure why it was 
sent to me again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you talking about the top email Mr 
Seleka? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Chairperson.  The one of the 3rd of 
January 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you – do you remember receiving 
it – having received it around that time or you do not? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Well it shows that it was sent to me so I 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 104 of 241 
 
must have received it on my laptop definitely because it was 
the time we were dealing with the booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS SOOLIMAN:  But I did have copies of the visas 
irrespective I did have copies of the visas.  I do not know 
why it was forwarded to me again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your understanding of – if you 
have any what was the message being sent to you?  I see 
there is nothing written.  It just says attachments. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes there was no message it was just 
10 
forwarded to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So it could have been in error – in error Mr 
Chair because everybody did get copies of the visas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes then there is an email quickly in Ms 
Sooliman on page 1565.50.  In fact two emails.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am hoping we can be done with her by 
three o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we can – I can hear her 
colleague’s evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 105 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the evening session. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we need to – ja – try and move fast. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  1565.50? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 50.  There is – are you there Ms 
Sooliman? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So there is the top email from Mr Salim 
Essa on the 4t h of January 2016.  And then there is a 
10 
message. 
“Okay please go ahead.” 
 
Just below that there seems to be the first email on 4 
January 2016 at 17:55.  It seems to be sent by Mr Halima 
Allana Travel Excellence it says: 
“Salaam Mr Essa please confirm the below.” 
 
Were you aware of that email? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes Sir like I said we used to receive each 
other’s email so I am aware of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  And I was copied in it anyway. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka.  This is all still about 
the – the trip. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes this one relates to the change of his 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 106 of 241 
 
booking from economy to business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja but why do we need to go into 
details about it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja we – no not the details Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because it is common cause. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja – not the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us look for – let us look for those 
things that are in dispute.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us use our time to establish what 
10 
evidence there is in regard to issues that are in dispute. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because this – as far as the visas and this 
trip Mr Koko admits their role of Travel Excellence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then Ms Sooliman the – the issue 
that Mr Koko raised pointedly in regard to this aspect was 
the payment.  There is a payment and maybe you can 
explain to the Chairperson rather how you were paid for the 
service that you rendered in respect of this booking and the 
application for visas? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:  So Mr Chair we did the bookings obviously 
the cost of the booking with the visa was R100 000.00.  I do 
not know Mr Koko from anywhere. I do not know Suzanne 
Daniels from anywhere.  The only means of receiving the 
payment we received it from Mr Essa.  I know that his – that 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 107 of 241 
 
Mr Koko is saying that the R100 000.00 could have been 
from Mr Essa’s travels.  Okay.  But if you go into our records 
there were two sets of bookings.  One for Mr Koko’s family 
and one for Mr Essa’s family.  Mr Koko’s family was 
R100 000.00 which we received payment on the 20t h of 
January.  We deposited it and we receipted it for that.  Okay.  
Mr Essa flew out I think his wife flew out in December he 
flew out in January something like that.  His bookings if you 
work out according to the tickets worked out to R118 000.00.  
We do not – we do not have the R118 000.00 all at once 
10 
because we had an account for him.  So he gave the money 
to a colleague who was in turn supposed to give it to us but 
that colleague was a client of ours at Travel Excellence as 
well and he paid us in drips and drabs to make up the 
amount for Mr Essa’s ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
ultimately 
was 
the 
amount 
of 
R118 000.00 in respect of Mr Essa paid? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Yes it was paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ultimately.  And your own – in the records 
of Travel Excellence are there records that showed when it 
20 
was paid for in drips and drabs? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct.  Halima has the statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  And she has written on there the amounts 
that come in. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 108 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Because if you see our statements we have 
an amount of a ticket say for instance R68 000.00 and 
R30 000.00 was paid towards that ticket she would write in 
and allocate R30 000.00 was paid from this to that.  Balance 
so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So well Mr Koko put up a letter from Mr 
Essa’s attorneys that was yesterday which said that on the 
20t h of January an amount of R100 000.00 in cash was paid 
but it was for Mr Essa not for Mr Koko.  Your response is 
10 
that Mr Essa’s cost of his travelling was not R100 000.00. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was R118 000.00. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was Mr Koko’s costs that came to 
R100 000.00. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that cash payment you say was 
definitely in respect of Mr Koko’s travelling? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say in regard to Mr Essa payment 
was made but over a period. 
MS SOOLIMAN:  Correct.  Actually Mr Essa paid in full the 
person who was supposed to give it to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 109 of 241 
 
MS SOOLIMAN:   But like I said, he was another client and 
he was falling – he was paying in drips and drabs.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would Mr Essa have given the 
money for his own ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Because ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...travelling to somewhere else rather 
than give it to you directly. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   He was not in the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was not in the country? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he sent it to somebody else? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who did he send it to? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   One of Halima’s clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So Ms Alana would be able to tell 
us the name of that person? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And she will be able to 
deal with those payments? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, sir.  She deals with the 
20 
payments.  So she can give you a breakdown. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Also, Mr Chair, I need to ask you.  If the 
payment did not come for Mr Koko, how did he paid it?  
And he proved how he paid the tickets to me. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 110 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  He says he had never – he 
never 
had 
anything 
to 
do 
you 
with 
your 
or 
Travel 
Excellence, Mr Koko.  He says he had paid his travel, his 
own travel agency. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Which is Thompsons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thompsons for that.  So, but he had 
asked Ms Daniels to assist him with regard to the visas and 
he says Ms Daniels must have decided to ask her friends 
to sort them out for – and that is how Travel Excellence got 
do the visas and the bookings. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you – in your own mind, you are quite 
clear 
that 
the 
payment 
of 
R 100 000,00 
on 
the 
20 t h of January was not for Mr Essa but for Mr Koko? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no doubt? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I do not have a doubt because there is 
no other payment made for his ticket. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   And these are exactly R 100 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Sooliman, I have shown you 
the emails that are attached to Mr Salim Essa’s attorneys.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 111 of 241 
 
That email where Mr Essa says on the 18 t h of January 2016 
that he is sending R 100 000,00 with Shahid to cover, he 
says, “this and the 11 t h and leave me with some credit”.   
 
That email comes after what seems to be a 
booking communication between you and him.  And the 
amount there for his ticket appears to be R 54 836,72.  So 
if 
the 
amount 
was 
R 54 000,00 
and 
he 
is 
paying 
R 100 000,00, does that not explain why he says he is 
paying for this and that will leave him with some credit? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   But he says that I am paying for this and 
10 
the 11 t h.  So the 11 t h was the previous trip that his child 
and his wife flew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   So if you count up those three air tickets 
it worked about R 118 000,00.  It leaves you with no credit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you may want to provide us also 
with information relating to the trip you say was of the 11 t h. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Sorry, can you repeat that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You may want to provide us with 
20 
details ...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...of the information – of the trip you 
say was of the 11 t h. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Okay. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 112 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Chair, I think that was the only 
contention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think that covers...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Koko.  So, basically, it appears that 
you only did the visas for Mr Koko and his family members 
and his flight bookings from Indonesia to Dubai and from 
Dubai to Johannesburg. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And throughout this you interacted with 
10 
Mr Salim Essa because you say he is the one who 
requested you to make the bookings. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you never interacted with Mr Koko 
or Ms Daniels? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think that covers that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
is 
in 
the 
supplementary affidavit, whether there is anything that 
20 
relates to Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, there is a paragraph, I think, but I 
am ready to regularise that affidavit, Chairperson, because 
I have the signed ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 113 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...portion of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the supplementary?  I am talking 
about the one that came yesterday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It came this morning, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, this morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the signed portion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is on page 1565. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 67 point 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, have you got – you want us to 
replace – okay let me have... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That page ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, talk to me about this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chairperson, I have given you – 
oh, 
what 
the 
orderly 
has 
is 
the 
entire 
affidavit 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...which is the original.  The affected 
pages, which can simply be replaced, is 1565.67.7. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And point 67.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the first page also has only one – 
oh, okay, no the initials are in different ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes ...[intervenes] 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 114 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is that the only page that is affected? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Sooliman, let us look at this 
affidavit in order to admit it.  We looked at it this morning.  
It starts on page 1565.67.1.  It is titled Supplementary 
Affidavit.  It ends on page 1565.67.9 with the deponent’s 
signature on page 1565.67.8.  Is that our signature? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You signed the affidavit on the 
17 t h of May 2021.  You confirm that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm that the affidavit is true 
and – the contents of the affidavit are true and correct? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does the affidavit have annexures as 
well? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [No audible reply] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does it have annexures? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, then I ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what is at page 1565.67.11?  Is 
that not an annexure?  Are those not annexures that come 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 115 of 241 
 
after that?  Is that others annexures to that affidavit as 
well as 1565.67.10? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, from point 10 onwards.  What 
seems to be tax invoices from Serendipity. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, and air tickets. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
that 
an 
annexure 
to 
your 
supplementary affidavit? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   No, I was only given these two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which ones? 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   From one to nine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.   
MS SOOLIMAN:   67.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   To 67.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it does like – well, in – I am looking 
at 20 – paragraph 29: 
“In response to the evidence of Mr Singh, I 
attached hereto the computer generated tax 
invoices received from Serendipity for both 
20 
Ms Sing and R Gupta. 
I further attached hereto the tickets issued to 
both Ms Singh and R Gupta. 
Ms Singh and R Gupta from the tickets used...” 
 
So you are attaching certain annexures to the  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 116 of 241 
 
...[intervenes] 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the supplementary affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the supplementary... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at page 1565.67.10.  Can you see 
that? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a computer generated tax invoice. 
10 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ou see in paragraph 29 that I have just 
read ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say:  I attached hereto the computer 
generated tax invoices received from Serendipity. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [Indistinct] [Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So one of you just did not mark them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That must be SASS-1 and then the one 
20 
at 1565.67.11, that must be 2.  And you then referred to 3 
and 4 which must be page 1565.67.12 and – yes, then 
there is a – that must be 12 and then 13.  That must be 
one attachment, I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 117 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you have got 1565.67.14 which 
must be – which I think goes to point 15.  Those are your 
annexures to the affidavit? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, Mr Seleka, you need to have this 
properly marked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, marked.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She needs to have them marked or you – 
they need to be marked.  I do not think she must mark 
them. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we will admit it once everything 
is in order. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  I see that the supplementary 
affidavit just sought to clarify certain things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In Mr Anoj ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which are discrepancies.  Ja, okay.  You 
have – you confirm the contents of your supplementary 
affidavit as true and correct? 
20 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it deals with matters that are within 
your personal knowledge? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Except where it is clear from the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 118 of 241 
 
context? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not in your personal knowledge? 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright.  Are we done with her? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That concludes the end of my 
questions for Ms Sooliman, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Ms Sooliman.  
10 
Thank you for availing yourself once again to assist the 
Commission. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We appreciate it.  Okay. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you have had the experience now. 
MS SOOLIMAN:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay.  You are excused. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may I provisionally beg leave to 
have this admitted as an exhibit, pending the proper 
marking of the annexures? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 119 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you not arrange for her or for 
somebody to talk to her and get it marked in the meantime? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no urgency to provisionally 
admit it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but somebody can just speak to her 
and that can be done so that it does not – I will take a 
short adjournment now while you arrange for the next 
witness. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  That will be ten minutes.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka, are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, we are, 
Chairperson.  The next witness is Ms Halima Allana and 
she is ready to take the oath or affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, Ms Allana, thank you 
20 
for availing yourself to help the Commission.  Thank you, 
switch on your mic and the registrar will administer the 
oath or affirmation to you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS ALLANA:   Halima Allana. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 120 of 241 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to making the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MS ALLANA:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will give  
will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  
If so, please raise your right hand and say so I truly affirm. 
HALIMA ALLANA:   I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated.  Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, before 
10 
you 
is 
bundle 
19 
and 
I 
am 
going 
to 
ask 
for 
the 
Chairperson’s guidance.  Ms Allana has submitted an 
affidavit to the Commission which is on page 353.261.5 of 
that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These extension of the page numbers.  
Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 353.261.5.  Now it has been 
incorporated in EXHIBIT 41 which is Mr Zwane’s exhibit of 
bundles.  We have to mark this one appropriately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, all you are saying is that it is in a 
20 
bundle that contains documents relating to Mr Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which have already been marked 41.1, 
41.2, his affidavits.  But let me do… 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 121 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this her only affidavit?  I think there is 
another one, is it not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a confirmatory of hers where 
she confirms Ms Sooliman’s affidavit and that is in the 
bundle we were dealing with 18(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then we have that affidavit which 
she submitted to the Hawks which we have now kind of put 
behind in 
view of her own 
affidavit directly to the 
Commission. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this is her main affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, go through what you need 
to go through. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Allana, on page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she will cover bookings in relation to 
Mr Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And a bit on Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But she is explaining something that 
may not be an issue anymore, Chair. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 122 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  And do we not – what 
about travel bookings that were made by their agency that 
relate to Mr Gama? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we saw it yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then Mantsha, I think Mr Dan 
Mantsha. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and Mr Mantsha. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I think it would have been 
10 
convenient for them to cover everybody so that they do not 
have to come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  It is not covered in their 
affidavits, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja  No, what I am saying is, to the 
extent that their travel agency made bookings in respect of 
other people even if they fall under different work streams 
it would have been convenient to make sure that once they 
are here they give oral evidence in respect of everybody 
that they make bookings for so that they do not have to 
20 
come back.  So that would have been much better. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Convenient, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I guess it might be too late because 
those other people would not have been notified. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 123 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But soon after this I think you must talk 
to the people involved in the other work streams so that 
arrangements can be made for them to then come back and 
just deal quickly with those issues, they should not delay 
too long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is just a pity that it was not 
arranged otherwise we could have saved them from having 
to come to the Commission twice.  Sorry about that, Ms 
Allana. 
MS ALLANA:   No problem, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.  Okay, let us 
continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Allana, in that bundle page 
353.261.5 it is an affidavit which read: 
“I, the undersigned, Halima Allana…” 
Is that you? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, that is me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Confirm that is you.  The affidavit is 
fairly short, it runs up to page 353.261.8.  Do you see 
that? 
20 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a signature above the name 
Halima Allana, do you confirm that to be your signature? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, that is my signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit is dated 12 May 2021.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 124 of 241 
 
Do you confirm the contents to be true and correct of this 
affidavit? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do.  Chairperson, I beg leave to 
have – oh, the affidavit has annexures, Ms Allana. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From page 261.9. So 353.261.9 to 
353.261.51. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
10 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, I beg leave to have this 
affidavit admitted as exhibit – the Chairperson and I should 
agree on, U41.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   U41.3? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, together with the 
annexures thereto. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, why do you sound doubtful or 
uncertain about the exhibit number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is because of 41 belong to Mr 
20 
Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is fine, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Halima Allana which 
starts at page 353.261.5 is together with annexures 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 125 of 241 
 
attached to it admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as 
EXHIBIT U41... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the 3 at the end? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   3, yes, Chair.  Thank you, Chair. 
AFFIDAVIT OF HALIMA ALLANA FROM PAGE 353.261.5 
TOGETHER WITH ANNEXURES HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT 
U41.3 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Allana, thank you for assisting the 
Commission.  Your colleague, Ms Sooliman, has mentioned 
10 
you a couple of times.  Could you please by way of a 
background tell the Chairperson who you are and your 
connection with this company which is being mentioned, 
Travel Excellence? 
MS ALLANA:   Good afternoon, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon. 
MS ALLANA:   I have been in travel for many, many years 
and as Mrs Sameera Sooliman …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just sorry, just drop the mic, further 
back, yes. 
20 
MS ALLANA:   Yes.  As Mrs Sameera Sooliman started, we 
worked together at Freeway Travel.  This was before 2013.  
I am not aware of the exact dates but I think I could have 
started there in 2011.  In 2013 – beginning of 2013, to be 
precise, February, I started my own travel agency which I 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 126 of 241 
 
registered – my dad basically is a director but he has 
nothing to do with the running of the travel agency, it was 
all me, myself.  And Sameera at that time was working still 
at Freeway Travel and then she joined me later on.  It 
would have been the end of 2013 beginning of 2014, 
around that time, but I the interim, as she was expecting 
she would still pass me over bookings to do for her on her 
behalf.  We were not partners at that time, we did become 
partners in the business, not on paper, in the business, in 
2014. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you say you became partners in 
business but not on paper what does that mean? 
MS ALLANA:   Because my dad is still the director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ALLANA:   But we are – we basically run the company 
50/50.  In that sense we both have the same say in the 
company dealings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, from 2014. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Because her evidence was that 
she was part-time with Travel Excellence. 
MS ALLANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Until 2016 but she did later on say she 
gave birth in 2013. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 127 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ’13, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
she 
had 
initially 
linked 
her 
commencement 
of 
permanent 
appointment 
at 
Travel 
Excellence with the time after she had given birth and 
initially she had said she gave birth in 2016, I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we did not ask her whether the fact 
that she clarified the year when she gave birth to be 2013 
when it affected the question of when she started at Travel 
10 
Excellence. 
MS ALLANA:   I think she was confusing the 2016 and 
2013 but she did start fulltime at Travel Excellence in 
2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2014.  Okay, alright.  Okay, so maybe 
when she does a supplementary affidavit, Mr Seleka, she 
will address the issue of whether given that she had now 
said that she gave birth in 2013 whether it affects what she 
said, namely that she started at Travel Excellence on a 
fulltime basis in 2016. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Yes, in 2014 she became 
fulltime at Travel Excellence. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she became a partner with you in 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 128 of 241 
 
the business. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have and equal say on the 
business. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Did she work part-time at 
Travel Excellence at any stage? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes before she became fulltime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS ALLANA:   So while she was pregnant with her baby 
10 
she was working then part-time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And, Ms Allana, also just explain 
to the Chairperson briefly how big is the company, if it is a 
company, the number of employees you have.  We know 
that you do travel bookings, if you could explain to the 
Chairperson the bouquet of services that you offer. 
MS ALLANA:   Okay, Mr Chairperson.  We are a fairly 
small company, a baby company, as such, because we only 
commenced in 2013.  We have always just had – it was just 
20 
myself, Sameera and maybe another staff.  So at the 
moment now we have Sajeeda, but fairly small.  Basically 
there has always just been three ladies and because we – 
well, Sameera has children, so just Sajeeda and I have one 
child as well, we generally tended to work in our own time 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 129 of 241 
 
as in we did not have to come to an office although we had 
an office, so the office was manned by the girl and I would 
be sometimes at home and Sameera would be, because 
she is picking up her children from school, it was not like a 
job where we had to sit, you know, in the office, but we did 
all our work in our own time and that is why we have the 
system of the copying of the cc’s of the emails.  So if I am 
out somebody at least is attending to the work whether it 
be myself, whether it be Sameera, whether it be the girl at 
the office.  So it was basically a very flexible job for us 
10 
mothers so we could also attend to the children.  Travel 
Excellence, since it started, we were favoured by good 
clientele and it grew.  Obviously not a huge growth, I 
mean, we are still only three but as in service wise a very 
good service and a very good client base. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Sooliman has testified before the 
Chairperson about a particular client of hers who moved 
with 
her 
from 
her 
previous 
employment 
to 
Travel 
Excellence and this is Mr Salim Essa.  Did you come to 
know Mr Salim Essa? 
20 
MS ALLANA:   So Mr Essa basically was Sameera’s client.  
I only knew of him, I seldom interacted with him because it 
was basically via email.  I would always reply to his emails 
or – you know, with regard to work but on a personal level 
I did not know him and generally in travel it is quite normal 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 130 of 241 
 
for clients to move with their travel agents so if I worked at 
Freeway Travel and I left to go to another travel agency 
you 
would 
find 
because 
now 
I 
have 
established 
a 
relationship with my client they want to come with me 
because they are comfortable dealing with me and I know 
how they work and I know what they like, what their 
preferences are.  So you always tend to keep your clients 
with you whenever you move.  So even with myself when I 
started on my own a lot of my regular clients from these 
other – like from Freeway Travel or, you know, the travel 
10 
agencies I may have worked before would come with me so 
in the same case Mr Essa moved with Sameera when she 
came and joined me.  So I did not really know him on a 
personal level but yes, I did do his work at times because, 
as I mentioned, we all could see each other’s emails and 
we just – the object was to get the work done and to give 
the client the quotation and make sure that, you know, we 
get the sale as I said because we all need business. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And – okay, that is on the one hand Mr 
Salim Essa.  What cropped up also in her affidavit is the 
20 
name Mr Ashu Chawla.  Did you know him? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, I did know Mr Ashu Chawla, Mr Ashu 
Chawla was again referred to us through Salim Essa where 
by the entire Sahara account was given to us through 
Salim Essa whereby he introduced Sameera to Mr Rajesh 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 131 of 241 
 
Gupta and said you know what, deal with these ladies, they 
are awesome, they are good travel agents, they look after 
you and from there I got to know Mr Ashu Chawla because 
he handled all the Sahara travel as per se and he would 
normally email me, so it was basically Halima, I need a 
booking or Halima, please help with this fare or -you know, 
all via email.  I did know him on a personal level, I have 
met with him quite a few times and so that is how I got to 
know Mr Chawla. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So did you say know him on a personal 
10 
level? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes because we developed a relationship.  
Obviously I have been booking for him for now six years.  I 
mean, like I visited him, you know, to drop off tickets or – 
just like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Did you know Mr Zwane, 
Mosebenzi Zwane? 
MS ALLANA:   No, I did not know him on a personal level, 
I do not know – I only knew I made bookings for him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson about a 
20 
booking you made which involved Mr Zwane? 
MS ALLANA:   So we were asked to check through our 
records for any bookings made for Mr Zwane and I did pick 
up and email that I received from Salim Essa which was 
actually addressed to Sameera, but remember we tended to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 132 of 241 
 
everybody’s emails whereby he requested flight bookings 
for himself and Mr Rajesh Gupta and for Mr Zwane and 
when I replied back to the email I actually sent it to him 
and I cc’d Mr Chawla because anything to do with Mr 
Rajesh Gupta I would obviously include Mr Chawla because 
he was Mr Rajesh Gupta’s travel PA, as such, so any travel 
bookings for the Guptas we would send it to Mr Chawla.  
So I replied back to Mr Salim Essa to say this is the 
bookings we have made and this is the fare and did you 
want to proceed and generally they would go back and – 
10 
they would reply back and say okay, go ahead and issue 
and as we had an account for them, you know, 14 days.  
Sometimes they would pay in seven days or sometimes 
they would pay in 14 days.  We would just issue and then 
obviously the pay would come later.  We had that sort of 
trust factor because we knew them in that sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Just take it slowly, can you recall 
the date – if you could tell the Chairperson the timeline, 
the date when you received the email, what …[intervenes] 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, the email was received on the 4 
20 
September, if I am not mistaken, I do have the copy of the 
email, it is in the annexures but it was definitely the 4 
September and – ja, it would be the 4 September, that is 
when the booking was initiated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see an email …[intervenes] 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 133 of 241 
 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, it was on the 4 September. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Give us the page number? 
MS ALLANA:   353.261.19. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 19, the one marked HA5. 
MS ALLANA:   The annexure is HA5 but the page number 
is 353261.19. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So then explain – just tell the 
Chairperson, the email from who to whom on which date? 
MS ALLANA:   So this basically is an email from 
Sameera’s email to Salim Essa stating flight bookings for 
10 
Mr Rajesh, Mr Salim and Mr Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So somebody is copied there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying to look for Mr Zwane. 
MS ALLANA:   It is on the next page, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS ALLANA:   It is 20.  So it was two separate emails.  
One was for Mr Rajesh and Mr Essa and the other one was 
for Mr Zwane.  I had book all on the same date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS ALLANA:   And the same route. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the same route – are you able to 
take us through that please? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, okay, so it is – do you want the dates 
of travel as well. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 134 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, you can give the dates. 
MS ALLANA:   Okay, 13 September, Johannesburg to 
Dubai, 14 September Dubai to Delhi, 16 September Delhi 
to Dubai, 17 September Dubai to Zurich, 20 September 
Zurich to Dubai, 21 September Dubai to Jo’burg. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  So you say for – how many 
were you booking for? 
MS ALLANA:   There are three bookings here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, mention the names. 
MS ALLANA:   Mr Rajesh Gupta, Mr Salim Essa and Mr 
10 
Mosebenzi Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  And the route for all three of 
them was the same? 
MS ALLANA:   The route for all three of them is the same 
and the dates for all three of them is the same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the same.  So you said to the 
Chairperson it was Mr Essa who requested you to make 
that booking? 
MS ALLANA:   The reason why I say that, I do not have an 
email from Mr Essa but the bookings were sent to Mr Essa, 
20 
so it is most probably Mr Essa because obviously the 
booking was sent to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the booking sent to him is in 
respect of all three persons. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes.  All three persons sent to Mr Essa. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 135 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how was payment made for the 
service you rendered? 
MS ALLANA:   So as per my records when I did a check, I 
have a payment which was made on the 5 September which 
amounts to R166 290 which is for these tickets and 
obviously the – not obviously, I know the ticket was issued 
on the 5 September and the payment was made at the 
same time.  So this payment was made for this.  I just 
cannot recall who did the payment because it was an EFT, 
but I do not recall who did it if it came from Sahara 
10 
account or if it came from another account. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you think – oh, the bank account in 
which the payment was made, does it still exist? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, that is my company account.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you think the bank would be able to 
show you where the payment from? 
MS ALLANA:   Where it came from?  I am sure.  I am sure 
if we can get a record, I am sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja, I see in paragraph 12 you 
talk about there is payment, right on top on page 353.261.7 
20 
and it reads: 
“On 5 September 2014 a payment in the amount of 
R166 290 for the air travel as mentioned above was 
received in Travel Excellence’s ABSA bank account.  
I, 
unfortunately, 
cannot 
recall 
from 
whom 
we 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 136 of 241 
 
received the EFT payment.  A printout of the bank 
statement in which the transaction is reflected is 
attached hereto marked HA14.” 
Now that HA14 is on page 353.261.44 but it is a very fine 
print. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, I see that, there is just a reference 
Sameera, so I do not know where it came from but it could 
have been …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your bank can say, hey? 
MS ALLANA:   I am sure the bank will be able to tell us 
10 
where it came from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if you can arrange that because you, 
being the client, it would be a matter of going to the bank 
or phoning them and …[intervenes] 
MS ALLANA:   They will give me the name of the account 
it came from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we need something that says that in 
regard to this transaction, this deposit or transfer that 
came into this account and such and such a date, it came 
from whose account in which bank and so on.  Ja, that is 
20 
what we need. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you and just before you go 
back, I see the pages that come after that page A14. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 137 of 241 
 
MS ALLANA:   [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MS ALLANA:   Oh, the pages after 14 is [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, yes.  HA15 and so on. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us deal with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 353.261.45 there is – what is 
that?  What is that document? 
10 
MS ALLANA:   It is a passport copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both passport copies. 
MS ALLANA:   That is Mr Rajesh Gupta’s passport copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is written Rajesh …[intervenes] 
MS ALLANA:   Rajesh Kumar Gupta, that was his full 
name, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And it has got his identity number 
there. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is his picture. 
20 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know that, have you met him? 
MS ALLANA:   I have never met him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have never met him. 
MS ALLANA:   No. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 138 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was this – was his passport given to 
you? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you …[intervenes] 
MS ALLANA:   He – it was emailed to me by Mr Chawla. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By Mr Chawla. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
that 
was 
for 
purposes 
of 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS ALLANA:   Yes part of – we needed everybody’s 
10 
passport details because when they travel we have to make 
sure the name is exactly the same on the passport and we 
need to insert the passport numbers in the bookings to do 
their online check-ins or visas, everything related to travel 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then the next page that is 
353.261.46. 
MS ALLANA:   That – yes that is Mr Salim Azeez Essa’s 
passport copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and there’s an ID number provided 
20 
there. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the picture there, is that his 
picture? 
MS SOOLIMAN:  That is his picture. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 139 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you said although – did you say 
although you didn’t interact with him, but you knew him? 
MS ALLANA:   Well, I knew his picture yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You knew his picture. 
MS ALLANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but had you met him even once? 
MS ALLAN:  I met him only once like for two minutes, I 
think I went to go drop off a ticket or a passport, it was just 
basically outside ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright and we go to the next 
10 
page, namely 353.261.47, what do you have there on that 
page? 
MS ALLANA:   That’s Mr Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane’s 
passport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and did you ever meet him? 
MS ALLANA:   No, never, this was also sent to me via 
email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and who sent it to you? 
MS ALLANA:   I cannot recall…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t recall? 
20 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, it could have been Chawla. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay 
what 
purpose 
was 
his…[intervenes]. 
MS ALLANA:   Also, to make the flight booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To make the flight booking? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 140 of 241 
 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It means Mr Mosebenzi Joseph is one 
and the ID number is provided, and his picture is given 
there and then the next page 353.261.48? 
MS ALLANA:   This is Mr Surya Kant Singhala’s passport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS ALLANA:   He is Mr Rajesh Kumar ’s nephew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rajesh Kumar Gupta’s nephew? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS ALLANA:   He is Mr Ajay Gupta’s son. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, was he travelling as well? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, he was travelling, although I think, his 
route was – I don’t know if it was the same, I can’t recall, it 
could have been the same, I have the ticket attached 
but…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS ALLANA:   The routing, let me just check that the 
routing was the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, he also travelled on the same routing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay and just for the sake of 
completeness, page 353.261.49, what is that document? 
MS ALLANA:   This is Surya Kant Singhala’s Indian 
passport.  So, he held two passports, one was Indian, and 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 141 of 241 
 
one was South African. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any understanding as to 
whether he was related to anybody among these people? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, he was Mr Ajay Kumar ’s son which was 
Mr Rajesh Kumar ’s nephew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, yes and the next page 353.261.50, 
what is that document? 
MS ALLANA:   The back page of Mr Surya Kant Singhala’s 
Indian passport, the back page, the bio data page.  If you 
look at that page you can see, name of father is Ajay 
10 
Kumar Gupta, name of mother is Shivani Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the next page 353.261.51, what 
is that document? 
MS ALLANA:   This is Mr Ashu Chawla’s passport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you ever meet him? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, I met him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is his picture? 
MS ALLANA:   This is his picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ashu Chawla and the ID number is still 
there. 
20 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he also going to travel, or he was 
not travelling? 
MS ALLANA:  No, he was not travelling on this trip he just 
initiated the booking – well not initiated the bookings he 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 142 of 241 
 
was involved in making the bookings or changes to the 
bookings as per se and I sent all the emails of the tickets 
to him.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  The – was this the 
only or were there other bookings that you have had to 
make for Mr Zwane – involving Mr Zwane? 
MS ALLANA:   When I checked initial records with regards 
to his name, I could only pick up this one, so I’m not too 
sure if there were others, I don’t think so because I did 
10 
search all my emails with regards to past travel and this 
was the only booking, I could find. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, now in regard to Mr Chawla there 
is a paragraph in Ms Sooliman’s affidavit …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you go there, Mr Seleka, 
she says these are the only ones, I don’t think that these 
cover some of the trips that are in the outer report, isn’t it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no they don’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they were made – they appear to 
have been made by Travel Excellence, isn’t it? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not, the others, we could pick up 
these…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the one, for example about the 
…[indistinct] and Zwane, were they not made by Travel 
Excellence? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 143 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We couldn’t pick that up from the 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but from the outer report, what’s 
your recollection of who had made – the trip with the choir, 
the trip for the choir, my – or that may have been made by 
Mr Chawla, without the travel – without this particular 
travel agency. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the – what is it, the information 
go to the extent of only showing that the choir travelled 
with Mr Zwane and Mr Ashok Narayan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it doesn’t indicate who did – 
arranged the bookings, the flight and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no that’s fine, let’s continue 
then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Allana, there is a paragraph in 
Ms Sooliman’s affidavit which is in a different bundle, 
Chair, I could simply read to her, or should we go there? 
MS ALLANA:   You can read it, it’s fine, you can 
read…[intervenes]. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I can just read it to you.   
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, Mr Seleka I am trying to go 
back to the witness’ affidavit, and I thought I had 
it…[intervenes]. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 144 of 241 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
the 
page 
numbers 
– 
it’s 
261.5.6.7.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   353.261.5.6.7.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m this number is just too long 
[laughter]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I’m giving you pages for the entire 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I only want the first page Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 5 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   353.261.5? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja you can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Allana, I will come back to 
your affidavit but because we’re dealing with these names 
including Mr Chawla in her affidavit, Ms Sooliman was 
asked about this paragraph and she mentioned that you 
would be more – the appropriate person to ask about this 
and the paragraph reads in Eskom Bundle 18(B), just for 
the record, page 1565.6, paragraph 22.7, 
20 
“A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from 
Johannesburg to Dubai on 24 February 2017 and 
back on 27 February 2017.  I cannot recall who 
made this request, Mr Singh was issued with ticket 
number, and the number is given, we further also 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 145 of 241 
 
booked a ticket for Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta, for this 
flight together with visas for Mr Varun Gupta and Mr 
Surya Kant Singhala.  The invoice was addressed to 
Mr R Gupta and was charged on – was charged to 
account number, C000349 which was the account 
belonging to Sahara Computers, the Gupta owned 
entity. 
 
The 
total 
amount 
invoiced 
was 
R134 
560.00”. 
 
To the extent that I’ve read, do you have any 
recollection of this? 
10 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, I do recall the booking with Mr Anoj 
Singh and Mr Rajesh Gupta and I’m sure Mr Singhala.  The 
booking was made, the payment was invoiced to Mr Rajesh 
Gupta, if I’m not mistaken – the invoice, sorry was made 
out to Mr Rajesh Gupta but the payment, I think, came from 
an EFT, it was an EFT. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let me read further, it says here, 
“To the best of my recollection I received a call from 
Mr Ashur Chawla who was our contact person at 
Sahara Computers who informed me that, a driver 
20 
would be dropping off the money in cash.  This 
indeed took place, seeing as a driver dropped off 
R170 000 in cash shortly thereafter, the difference 
could have been for settlement of outstanding fees 
on the account. This cash was again given to a 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 146 of 241 
 
friend, who in turn made an EFT payment to our 
Travel Excellence, FNB account”. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, so it was quite common, when Mr 
Rajesh travelled with another person, depending on the 
nature of the travel, either Sahara Computers would pay 
for it, or the other person involved. I cannot recall 
precisely 
but 
it 
could 
have 
been 
made 
by 
Sahara 
Computers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then in a paragraph thereafter you 
say, 
10 
 
“In the past we had frequently assisted the Gupta’s 
with booking flights for themselves or for other parties on 
the request of either the Gupta’s or Mr Essa, is that 
correct? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, we often did do bookings for other 
parties on the request of the Gupta’s or for that matter, Mr 
Essa, whereby they gave us instructions to book.  As you 
know, you can even see with Mr Zwane, we do not know 
him, but we were given instructions to book for him 
travelling with the Gupta’s or even travelling with, maybe 
20 
even solo but it was not – it was quite normal, sometimes, 
that they gave us other people’s bookings to book, even 
though we didn’t know the person travelling, personally. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, would you have known the Gupta’s 
prior to you establishing Travel Excellence or during the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 147 of 241 
 
time of its existence? 
MS ALLANA:   No, the Gupta’s were introduced to us after 
Travel Excellence was initiated.  So, they were referred to 
us by Mr Essa and they became our account holders after 
that, where Mr Essa stood guarantor and said to Samira, 
you know what, you can trust them, you can give them an 
account, you can do their bookings, you know, they’re 
definitely good for their word. So, we gave them that 
facility and thereafter, that’s when we held that whole 
Gupta account and they in turn also gave us other referrals 
10 
and booked for other people and we got quite a few 
referrals from Salim Essa, from the Gupta’s, you know, 
other clients that we then built up a client base from – for 
Travel Excellence, you know, quite a big client base in that 
sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This client base, referred to you by the 
Gupta’s, were you able to determine whether these are 
Government officials, Ministers, or just ordinary people? 
MS ALLANA:   No, ordinary people, ordinary companies, 
Sechaba Computers, just basically, normal companies, not 
20 
Government officials.  There were, for example, I don’t 
know who Mr Zwane is but there were some names that I 
booked for, I didn’t even know they were Ministers of high 
profile people, because we were just given names, and we 
were told book. So, I wouldn’t even know if I was booking 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 148 of 241 
 
for a Government or a high profile person but come later, 
then I realise, oh, this was a high profile person.  So, the 
referrals for, maybe, high profile people, I think the 
Gupta’s booked directly, but they gave us other companies, 
you know, normal companies we dealt with everyday travel 
businesses in that sense, not to say high profile people 
only as such. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, if we could, as the Commission 
then give you names of certain persons, you would be able 
to search in your records as to whether these people, you 
10 
would have booked for them at the behest of the Gupta’s or 
Mr Essa? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, if you gave me names, I could search 
my emails, our records, we have lost a few records, but I 
have emails which is dated a few years back and I could 
search as per the name, if you gave me a name. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, then, lastly there was a query 
raised by Mr Koko in regard to that R100 000 payment – 
well a cash slip which is signed by you, I think it’s signed 
by you for the R100 000 payment said to be – to have been 
20 
received on the 20 t h of January 2016.  Ms Sooliman says 
the payment was delivered at her house, but the cash slip 
bears your name and we were wondering how did that 
come about? 
MS ALLANA:   So, Mrs Sooliman never really issued any 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 149 of 241 
 
receipts the receipt book used to stay in the office.  If Mrs 
Sooliman received cash, it was at her house and she would 
WhatsApp me or call me and say, Halima I received so and 
so from Mr Essa or whoever it was being and I would issue 
a receipt or I would instruct the girls in the office, please 
issue a receipt because if I was not in the office then the 
receipt book is in the office.  So, it could have been me or 
it could have been one of the girls and we would just issue 
a receipt based on her verbal consent that she received 
the money.  So, bear in mind, we’re a small travel agency 
10 
and when we started we weren’t – we could not afford, like, 
big accounting systems so everything was done manually 
over the phone and you’re trying to be a working mother, 
you’re trying to juggle a whole lot of things, so there is that 
little bit of error, it’s cash and she takes an EFT or if it was 
Mr Essa – you know, just small little minor things whereby 
you could have done some small little error on the receipt 
but generally we had a record of all the tickets issued and 
the monies coming in and we knew that it came from Mr – 
Sahara Computer ’s account or Mr Essa account or Mr Anoj 
20 
Singh account, we were aware of those details and also if 
they had accounts, payments would not come – if a ticket 
was R55 000, hypothetically, not necessarily we would get 
R55 000 they would give us R30 000, one week later R10 
000 or – you know one week later R5 000, it would come in 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 150 of 241 
 
batches which we would then allocate. So, when they say 
that the R100 000 is not allocated to this particular person 
or in Mr Koko’s case it was not allocated to him we have – 
they have no ground to really believe that it’s true because 
these people were booking on a continuous basis and the 
money was coming in on a continuous basis.  So, we could 
not pin this amount was for this person as per se, we knew, 
okay it was for the Sahara account, put it to the Sahara 
account, this ticket was issued on the Sahara account.  
Obviously, I’m not going to give you a ticket and not take 
10 
payment for it, so if I gave you this ticket and it was on Mr 
Essa’s account and the payment came for that, it was 
booked on the basis of this person.  So, we obviously are 
not going to give you a ticket for free, Mr Chair, I mean, we 
would have got the payment for it. So, if they cannot prove 
otherwise that this payment was not made or we just gave 
a ticket randomly because we felt, you know, I want to give 
Mr Koko a ticket because I don’t even know him, it sounds 
very ridiculous. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, did you have an account for Mr 
20 
Anoj Singh? 
MS ALLANA:   No, not particularly Mr Anoj Singh, because 
Mr Anoj Singh was a referral for Mr Essa.  So, Mr Essa 
stood as a guarantor for quite a lot of the new referrals we 
got because Mr Essa introduced Samira to Anoj Singh, Mr 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 151 of 241 
 
Essa introduced Samira to Mr Rajesh Gupta, Mr Salim Essa 
introduced her to – you know, a few clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, I’m asking because earlier on 
you did mention Mr Anoj Singh in relation to…[intervenes]. 
MS ALLANA:   Well just like, example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As an example? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
alright 
now 
you 
also 
say 
something along the lines that if a payment was made it 
couldn’t be pinned down to a particular person, is that 
10 
right? 
MS ALLANA:   It would be pinned down to a particular 
account so if a payment was made and Samira got it from 
the driver and the driver says, okay this is from – example 
sake, this is from Mr Ashur Chawla or this is from Mr Anoj 
Singh or, it will be pinned down to that account and then I 
know, okay, this payment of R50 000 was for Sahara 
Computers, this payment of R50 000 was for Mr Essa, this 
payment of – obviously because of the tickets we issued 
for those particular accounts. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well that would be in respect of 
somebody for whom you kept an account? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, for somebody that – for whom you 
didn’t have an account would you always be able to pin the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 152 of 241 
 
payment to a particular person…[intervenes]. 
MS ALLANA:   Yes, for people who did not have an 
account we would collect the payment straight away and 
allocate 
it 
to 
that 
person 
straight 
away, 
you 
know, 
hypothetically Mrs Allana came and booked a ticket, and it 
was R10 000 I would receipt it there and then issue the 
ticket only after the payment was received because we 
wouldn’t issue anybody a ticket if they did not have an 
account with us, without the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now Ms Sooliman gave evidence 
10 
with regard to the role played by Travel Excellence in 
relation to the visas for Mr Koko and his two family 
members as well as the bookings at Travel Excellence 
made for Mr Koko and his two family members in regard to 
the flight from Indonesia to Dubai and from Dubai to 
Johannesburg and she said that Mr Koko’s cost came to 
R100 000 and that Mr – I think Mr Salim Essa called and 
said that he would send a driver to drop off the cash which 
she says, happened but Mr Koko has put a letter from Mr 
Essa’s attorneys and that letter says that, that amount of 
20 
R100 000 was in respect of Mr Essa’s own trip.  Now, with 
regard to your evidence saying you can’t always – or you 
can’t pin down payment to a particular person, what do you 
say about that? 
MS ALLANA:   Mr Chair, the likeliness of that R100 00 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 153 of 241 
 
being for Mr Koko is like 99% because the figures are 
exact.  The R100 000 and the invoice is R100 000 but in 
any case even through some 1% it is not for Mr Koko we 
still did receive the payment from Mr Essa for Mr Koko’s 
trip because if not that R100 000 we received a payment 
on the 11 t h of January for R119 000, so it could have been 
that and then you know, when issuing the receipt they put 
this for Koko and that so – and maybe Mr Essa just also 
emailed and said, this payment is for my own personal 
travel but being his own personal travel as in his account, 
10 
it’s going towards his account and all the people who are 
booked on his account, so it could have also meant that.  
Obviously, it’s too old, we can’t remember exactly but the 
fact of the matter is, the ticket was booked and we did 
receive money for it we would not give a free ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me ask this question, you say, even 
if that R100 000 or in the unlikely event as – because you 
say there might be 1% chance, in the unlikely event that 
that R100 000 was not for Mr Koko, Mr Koko’s travelling, 
you say nevertheless, Mr Koko’s bill was settled by Mr 
20 
Essa 
because 
I 
guess 
because 
Mr 
Koko 
never 
paid…[intervenes]. 
MS ALLANA:   I don’t know Mr Koko, I don’t know him and 
who gave the booking to me, it was Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 154 of 241 
 
MS ALLANA:   So, you, Mr Chair, would not come and pay 
for Mr Koko’s bill if you did not initiate the booking, 
obviously the person who initiated the booking paid for it.  
This booking was done on Mr Essa’s account, whether Mr 
Koko gave Mr Essa the money, I’m not sure but the booking 
was initiated by Mr Essa, the payment was put on Mr 
Essa’s account so be it he paid me on the 18 t h or be it he 
paid me on the 11 t h the booking was on his account and the 
payment would have come from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you say, the payment for Mr Koko’s 
10 
travelling, I guess, and the visas came from Mr Essa? 
MS ALLANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether it was that R100 000 or another 
payment, in the end it came from Mr Essa and he never 
said, you know, you have charged me for somebody that I 
had nothing to do with? 
MS ALLANA:   No, and Mr Koko did not pay so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko did not pay? 
MS ALLANA:   So bottom line then, who would have paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you say that the request for 
20 
Travel Excellence to make this booking had come from Mr 
Essa? 
MS ALLANA:   Mr Essa’s email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say he paid as well, okay, 
alright. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 155 of 241 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Have you ever had 
to deal – or have you ever had to receive requests for 
bookings from a Ms Suzanne Daniels? 
MS ALLANA:   Never, I don’t know who she is, I never 
heard of her, the only time I ever heard of her was now 
when this whole – she’s all over the news, I don’t know 
who she is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How was – or let me ask this question, 
do you still have interactions or do business with Mr Salim 
Essa? 
10 
MS ALLANA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you stop doing business with 
him? 
MS ALLANA:   When – I think it was last year, he used to 
speak to Samira as I said, it was Samira’s client, so it was 
last year when we were asked to give affidavits for the 
Hawks I think after that he had a fallout with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but was there a discussion about 
him stopping to give you business or he just stopped? 
MS ALLANA:  No, I think he – she would know better, but I 
20 
think he just stopped talking to her yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how was your relationship as the 
organisation 
with 
him 
throughout 
the 
time 
that 
you…[intervenes]. 
MS ALLANA:   Absolutely fabulous he was a very good 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 156 of 241 
 
client of ours and he gave us a lot of referrals as a new 
upcoming company he really boosted our sales in the 
sense that he gave us a lot of good business.  We had no 
problems, he had a very good relationship with Samira you 
know…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he paid well? 
MS ALLANA:   He paid very well, we never had to wait for 
money, and he was a man of his word.  If he told us, he 
would pay this money it would come he never stalled us for 
payments he was a very honourable client in that sense, 
10 
we never had to worry about money and if he stood 
guarantor for any other client we would actually not even 
hesitate.  If he said, you know what, this Mr – this client is 
good, it would not be a problem at all because he was very 
honourable in his payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have any reason, yourself, or 
Ms Sooliman, as far as you know, would you have any 
reason to falsely implicate him in having made these – 
asked you to make these bookings if, indeed, it was not – 
that was not the case? 
20 
MS 
ALLANA: 
 
 
No, 
never, 
we 
would 
not 
do 
that 
to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never had issues with him? 
MS ALLANA:   Never, we would not do that to him because 
he was really a good friend of Samira’s, he was always 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 157 of 241 
 
helpful, you know, and he gave us a lot of business.  It’s 
through him that Travel Excellence did prosper.  Mr Chair, 
we as a small agency as we are – serendipity which had 
420 travel agents in that consortium from 2013 till 2018 we 
won Top Agent Award every year and that was all through 
Salim Essa and his referrals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ALLANA:   We would have no reason at all to put him 
down in any way, just the sad fact is, whatever his circle 
was, it’s unfortunate. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would you or your agency have any 
reason to say that he asked you to make bookings for Mr 
Koko or Mr Zwane or Mr Singh, if he had not asked you to 
do that? 
MS ALLANA:   Mr Chair, there would be no reason to lie, I 
wouldn’t  lie for anybody, but you have the emails, it’s in 
black and white the proof is there.  I can’t say, you know, a 
spade is not a spade, he did initiate the bookings, the 
emails came from him…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was a good man? 
20 
MS ALLANA:   He was a good man.  Whether he did it 
through or for Sahara Computers of whether he did it on 
behalf of another friend or whether he did it just, you know 
at the wrong time in the wrong place with the wrong friend, 
you know, that I’m not sure but he is a good man. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 158 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, anything Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Nothing further Chair.

yourself 
to 
assist 
the 
Commission, 
we 
appreciate it very much. 
MS ALLANA:   Thank you very much Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  You probably may 
be asked or Ms Sooliman to come back here to give 
evidence relating to other people, I think Mr Mantwa.[?] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe one other person, I’m not 
sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But those arrangements will be made, 
thank you very much, you are now excused. 
MS ALLANA:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, we are going to adjourn the 
day session now, I’ll adjourn for about 15 minutes and then 
I will come back, we will then start the evening session, Mr 
Seleka, and your junior, can I see you in my chambers 
20 
after we adjourn, we adjourn.

affirmation of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Good afternoon Mr Freund. 
MS MBETE:  Muted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We cannot hear you from – we cannot hear 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 160 of 241 
 
you this side.  You probably need to unmute yourself. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well no I will repeat myself.  We were 
clear a moment ago.  Can you not hear me now Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now we – now I can hear you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright well if I might just repeat what I 
said.  Good afternoon Chair, good afternoon Ms Mbete. 
MS MBETE:  Good afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon.  Yes.  Okay Mr Freund will 
lead Ms Mbete’s evidence from outside the borders of the 
country because he – we could not hear your evidence while 
10 
he was here but that is in order and thank you to Mr Seleka 
and his junior who have been able to assist as well.  
Registrar please administer the oath or affirmation.  I do not 
know whether we – if we can hear you with your mask on Ms 
Mbete that would be fine but if we do not hear you there 
might be a problem but I think there is enough social 
distance.  Are you comfortable to take it off? 
MS MBETE:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  If you could take the 
oath or affirmation. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS MBETE:  My name is Baleka Mbete. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MS MBETE:  No objection. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 161 of 241 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth; is so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MS MBETE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated.   
MS MBETE:  Thanks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let me take this opportunity to thank 
you Ms Mbete for availing yourself to come and assist the 
commission with regard to issues relating to Parliamentary 
Oversight.  Thank you very much for availing yourself.  
Thank you.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness has be sworn in.  Yes you 
may. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Ms Mbete I hope that you have in front of 
you your own affidavit which commences in PO Bundle 5 at 
20 
page 980. Is that the commencement of your affidavit and do 
you have that with you? 
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Number from the top left (inaudible). 
MS MBETE:  Yes it is here. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 162 of 241 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then if you go place – please to 
page 996 is that your signature to this affidavit? 
MS MBETE:  900 and? 
ADV FREUND SC:  96. 
MS MBETE:  Yes Sir.  It is my signature. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And can you confirm that this is a – this 
is your affidavit and are comfortable with the correctness of 
the facts in this affidavit? 
MS MBETE:  Can you say that again. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Can you confirm that the facts in this 
10 
affidavit are correct? 
MS MBETE:  Correct Sir. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Now Ms Mbete is it correct 
that some week ago or so you prepared a – a written version 
of what you intended to be your introductory remarks and 
that we find those at pages 998 to 999? 
MS MBETE:  900 and? 
CHAIRPERSON:  998 and when he refers to page numbers 
always look for the black numbers on the top left hand 
corner. 
20 
MS MBETE:  Yes.  998 to 999 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And is it correct Ms Mbete that – that you 
have furnished to me there your revised version that 
(inaudible) not. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 163 of 241 
 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I will come to those shortly.  Ms Mbete if 
you go to page 1000 through to page 1004 can you confirm 
that that is a further document you prepared in relation to 
your testimony today headed Curtain of Matters related to 
the period of 2014 to 2019. 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair I will come shortly to deal with the 
revised introductory remarks but those are not yet paginated 
in accordance with the system of the – of the commission.  
10 
So in these circumstances I request leave that we admit as 
Annexure ZZ16 the affidavit starting at page 980 the further 
document to which I have just referred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we do that Mr Freund I note that on 
the version of Ms Mbete’s affidavit that I have although she 
has signed it the Commissioner of Oaths there is a stamp 
and there is some signature but I do not know whether that 
is the Commissioner of Oaths – the part where normally one 
finds the signature of the Commissioner of Oaths is without a 
signature but I see there is a stamp and some signature but I 
20 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
that 
is 
the 
signature 
of 
the 
Commissioner of Oaths.  Do you – and of course it is not 
initialled – not every page is initialled but the initialling might 
be one thing is – this is the signature of the Commissioner of 
Oaths is the more important aspect.  Unfortunately I cannot 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 164 of 241 
 
read there but it may be that it is Commissioner’s certificate 
– I certify that – but then it is not legible.  Do you know 
anything about that part? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair might I intervene? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Might I just intervene? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Just to indicate that the copy that I have 
which may or may not be a better copy than the copy that 
you have suggests to me that a certain Warrant Officer who 
10 
is a policeman well (inaudible) did sign and commission this 
– in this – in the version that is stamped but that is a matter 
that perhaps the witness could be in a position to confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it indicate that – that police officer is 
a Commissioner of Oaths – the signature – the stamp? 
ADV FREUND SC:  No in fact on the contrary Chair now that 
I have looked at more carefully it certifies that it is a true 
copy of the original.  So it is still on the stamp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  – Ja so of course the fact that she will 
confirm or she has confirmed that the contents of the 
20 
document are correct – true and correct will confirm only 
contents the same status as that of an affidavit.  So maybe 
we should not be concerned about it but maybe it could be 
replaced after today with an affidavit that is properly 
commissioned so that anybody who finds it does not think 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 165 of 241 
 
that it was an irregular affidavit.  What do you think Mr 
Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair that would certainly seem to be in 
order with me and since the witness is legally represented I 
imagine you could ask (inaudible) in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Semenya what do you say? 
ADV SEMENYA SC:  I would agree with a resolution of the 
problem that I need an affidavit subsequent to her testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  So – so Ms 
Mbete after today if you could have this affidavit – the 
10 
contents will be fine but maybe it can be printed again and 
be commissioned properly.  It is obviously not your fault but 
the – maybe the person who signed the police officer is a 
Commissioner of Oaths but the certificate does not seem to 
describe him or her as a Commissioner of Oaths.  So – but 
your legal team will assist in that regard.  Okay we can 
continue. 
MS MBETE:  Thanks Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can continue.  But you have confirmed 
that the contents of the document let us call it an affidavit is 
20 
– they are true and correct as far as you are concerned? 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Freund continue. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Mbete as we have 
already referred to you have now (inaudible) revised version 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 166 of 241 
 
– revised written version of your introductory remarks. Is that 
correct? 
MS MBETE:  Can you say it again Mr Freund I lost 
something in what you were saying. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Is it correct Ms Mbete that you have now 
prepared 
a 
revised 
written 
version 
of 
your 
intended 
introductory remarks. 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And Chair I have been informed that a 
copy of that revised written version should be on your desk, 
10 
is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have what I believe is the revised 
version separate from the bundle yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And Chair with your leave what I would 
suggest is that in due course we just add that to the end of 
this exhibit once it has been duly paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes or it could replace the one that is in 
the bundle because I am told there is one that is in the 
bundle. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then with regard to the admission of 
Ms Mbete’s affidavit shall we do that after we have one that 
has – that will have been properly commissioned or do you 
suggest this should be admitted 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair my suggestion is it should be 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 167 of 241 
 
admitted because the witness is going to be asked about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  In the – in the questioning today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then we can stop them at (inaudible) 
duly commissioned properly attested affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  You request that I admit it and 
mark it as Exhibit? 
ADV FREUND SC:  ZZ16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  16? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The affidavit Mr Ms Baleka Mbete 
that starts at page 980 will be admitted and marked as 
Exhibit ZZ16.  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mbete subject to 
the Chair’s directions my suggestion is that this might be the 
opportune time for you to make the introductory remarks that 
you wish to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I give you that opportunity Ms Mbete to 
make your introductory remarks. 
20 
MS MBETE:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MBETE:  Chairperson today I appear here willingly to 
talk about my past role in Parliament as Speaker in the 
National Assembly and to convey my commitment to the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 168 of 241 
 
purpose and envisaged outcome of the commission’s work. 
 
I thought by way of introduction I should first share 
with the commission a little bit of my background.   
 
Chairperson I left the country in 1076 and joined the 
ANC in Swaziland.  I returned to South Africa in June 1990 
and continued to work in different capacities towards the 
new South Africa’s constitutional dispensation. 
 
The key areas in which a lot of my life was 
contributed were for the advancement of women’s rights and 
I am also a devout cultural worker. 
10 
 
I was elected the first Secretary General of the ANC 
Woman’s League after the unbanning.  I was part of the ANC 
delegation to the South African Constitutional talks towards 
the interim constitution and later the final constitution. 
 
I became Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly in 
1996.  I had since spent many years being part of the 
leadership of the evolving legislative sector in the new 
democratic state. 
 
In my last term in Parliament, I saw the finalisation of 
the Rules Book the 9t h Edition in the National Assembly and 
20 
led the high level panel program at the Speaker’s Forum as 
its Chairperson. 
 
I was a founder member and National Convenor of 
the Progressive Woman’s Movement of South Africa in 2006.  
My first experience at leading a national non-partisan entity. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 169 of 241 
 
 
During the transition in 2008 I was appointed Deputy 
President of South Africa.  At the 2007 ANC National 
Conference 
I 
was 
elected 
the 
first 
woman 
National 
Chairperson of the organisation. 
 
In that role, I led the ANC’s national program of 
marking the centenary of the ANC until the Centenary 
Conference in December 2012.  My term as Chairperson 
ended in 2017. 
 
At an international level, I was a member of the 
Africa Peer Review Mechanism. I was also a founder member 
10 
of 
the 
Pan-African 
Parliament 
and 
its 
committee 
on 
international relations. 
 
I am currently a founder trustee of the National 
Liberation Heritage Institute of South Africa NaLHISA which 
seeks to pursue the unearthing better organisation and 
preservation of the history of our people’s proud legacy of 
freedom 
 
Having concluded the aspect about my background 
Chairperson my understanding is that this commission gives 
us the opportunity as a democracy in the making among 
20 
other things to be self-critical and to honestly address the 
wax we see in the mirror as the commission listens to what 
happened in the past. 
 
The need to enhance the capacity of Parliament is 
already part of the testimony before commission.  I wish to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 170 of 241 
 
build on what has already been said in the – in this regard 
Chairperson. 
 
The first Parliament after the 1994 elections had the 
task to discuss the constitution in its capacity as the 
constitutional assembly to finalise the constitution making 
process which had started at the World Trade Centre and 
produced the interim constitution. 
 
A schedule form of 34 constitutional principles was 
the basis on which the final constitution was to be judged by 
the Constitutional Court. 
10 
 
Constitutional Principle Number 6 made provision for 
the three separate arms of the state which are the 
legislature, the judiciary and the executive and I quote: 
“There shall be a separation of powers 
between 
the 
legislature, 
executive 
and 
judiciary 
with 
appropriate 
checks 
and 
balances 
to 
ensure 
accountability, 
responsiveness and openness.” 
 
The political culture has since evolved which has 
given the executive what in my view are unequal powers that 
20 
meditate against the principle of separation in relation to the 
other arms in as far as procurement of finances from the 
National Fiscus or work of each arm is concerned. 
 
The judiciary’s budget is through the Minister of 
Justice and Correctional Services and that of Parliament 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 171 of 241 
 
comes through the Minister of Finance.  This is not in 
keeping with the spirit of this original relevant constitutional 
principle – principle 6 if anything it is a practice which are 
unwittingly promotes the supremacy of the executive as 
opposed to the separation of powers. 
 
One of the most important negative results of this has 
been that our Presidents role has been confined to head of 
the executive as opposed to him acting as actual Head of 
State as well. 
 
As a Head of State the President’s pre-occupation 
10 
should be fairly spread covering all arms of the state as 
opposed to sometimes being so drawn into the nitty gritty of 
only one of the arms. 
 
The President must be above the dynamics of every 
day priorities but must be reasonably accessible to all three 
arms of state. 
 
The above are anomaly must change and the correct 
approach can be attained if a process which was left 
unfinished during the Fourth Term were to be finalised. 
 
This was when the then Heads of the three arms of 
20 
state engaged on the matter.  And in brackets I have 
(Speaker Sisulu and Chairperson Mahlango from Parliament, 
Chief Justice Ngcobo and President Zuma) who had correctly 
gone back to the constitutional principle 6.  The former DG in 
the Presidency Dr Lubisi Headed the technical team and he 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 172 of 241 
 
was the one to retire most recently about a year ago.  Had 
this process been completed we as a democracy would have 
learnt a lot from other countries that had been identified 
around the globe. 
 
That exposure would have helped us improve our own 
system and I believe it is not too late to correct ourselves. 
 
My view is that the committee’s section in particular 
needs a great boost in terms of resources for them to extend 
the Portfolio Committee members capacity to do a lot more 
by way of oversight.  They could be better enabled to do 
10 
oversight on more entities in their respective portfolios than 
they had been able to do so far. 
 
In addition every MP needs a lot more to spread 
themselves across the many other different roles they play 
including in the constituencies and communities whose 
needs they have to help look after. 
 
Correcting the imbalance which is referred to above 
would go a long way in improving Parliament’s Oversight 
work in general and broadly the capacity of every public 
representative.   
20 
 
The environment in which politics plays itself out 
daily is one in which our people remain very alert and 
sensitive to the often politically highly charged media 
reports. 
 
Sadly not all media reporting is always based on 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 173 of 241 
 
accurate 
factual 
and 
verified 
evidence. 
 
The 
Zondo 
Commission has heard testimony in this regard.  As a result 
South Africa was shocked by my decision of the 8 t h August 
2017 in relation to the secret ballot.  It was unexpected as it 
was not in keeping with what had been dished out in the 
public domain for a very long time which had been contrary 
to reality and fairness. 
 
Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Ms Mbete.  I must just say that 
when the commission started in 2018 I think you were still 
10 
the Speaker.  I must just record that you provided very good 
cooperation to the commission in terms of various documents 
and records that it wanted and you assisted the commission 
with reports of various Portfolio Committees. Thank you for 
that.  Thank you. Okay Mr Freund you may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now Ms Mbete 
perhaps we could start with paragraph 1 of your affidavit that 
is at page 980. Just for the record can you confirm that you 
are a former Speaker of the National Assembly – that you 
have served twice in that capacity; firstly in the period 2004 
20 
to 2008 and then secondly in the period 2014 to 2019. 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Ms Mbete I am then not going to deal 
with paragraphs 2 through to 9 in which you set out so legal 
background which the commission is familiar with.  If I could 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 174 of 241 
 
take you to paragraph 10 of your affidavit page 983. 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I just would like to give you a brief 
opportunity to – to make the points that you – that you make 
in paragraph 10.1 through to 10.9 where you are drawing 
attention and I do not think there is any controversy about 
this to some of the instruments which exist and which have 
been created by Parliament in order to discharge its 
constitutional oversight mandate.  Perhaps you would just 
like to put on record very briefly what you see as these main 
10 
instruments for oversight? 
MS MBETE:  Well there main instrument through which 
Parliament exercises oversight is the committee system.   
It is the fact that we divide the members of 
Parliament into Portfolio Committees relating to each of the 
portfolios in the executive in order that those committees 
can have you know direct line of sight of what is going on in 
that 
particular 
portfolio 
including 
interactions 
with 
the 
relevant people that will be working across in the executive 
that they would need information from and so on and so 
20 
forth.   
So committees are a very, very important part of the 
way through which Parliament exercises oversight because it 
is in those smaller collectives that members of Parliament 
are able to sit look into reports, look into issues, if they to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 175 of 241 
 
travel 
to 
various 
points 
of 
the 
country 
to 
familiarise 
themselves with the matters with which the being informed 
by way of documents and reports and so on and so forth.  
So committees are a major part but secondly we have 
various activities as the House through which questions for 
information for clarification or occasions are made possible 
for members of the executive to come and share information 
with members of Parliament.  
So questions are very, very important and throughout the 
calendar year there will be parts of the time that is allocated 
10 
for those particular activities that would make it possible for 
members of the executive but in addition to that, you have 
the Head of the Executive being the President as well as 
the Deputy President, also coming on certain calendar 
days, 
that 
would 
have 
been 
agreed 
through 
the 
Parliamentary Programme Committee that it is time for 
them to appear before Parliament, to come and answer 
specific questions that would relate to those matters that 
are under their own particular responsibility, as would have 
been shared between Parliament and the Executive. 
20 
 
So those are some of those activities and ways 
in which parliament does make use of certain mechanisms 
and tools that are there at their disposal to ensure that this 
oversight is exercised. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Before I can take you to paragraph 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 176 of 241 
 
10.1 where you refer to the fact that there are as many 
committees 
of 
Parliament 
as 
there 
are 
portfolios 
of 
government.  That is clearly correct.  But an aspect that 
has 
been 
debated 
with 
your 
successor 
as 
Speaker, 
Ms Modise, also with your successor as Chairperson of the 
party, Mr Mantashe is, whether there might be value in 
some type of committee or committees or structure that 
focuses specifically on the President and the presidency, 
whether there should be, as it were, a Portfolio Committee 
in relation to the presidency.  Do you have any views on 
10 
that question? 
MS MBETE:   That is a matter, actually, that has been, 
Chairperson, 
before 
Parliament 
for 
some 
time. 
The 
proposal has been made and we have been looking at it 
and turning it around and checking whether there really 
would be a reason why there would be a specific committee 
exercising oversight over a president who, in fact, has 
divided up the executive function in the various portfolios. 
 
And as we know, in our country, we have got 
about 30, mid-30’s number of portfolio of government and 
20 
in the way Parliament structures itself it ensure that there 
is a collective of people looking specifically at each of 
those portfolios. 
 
And really, the debate is still out there.  I must 
not say we are done with it but there have not been 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 177 of 241 
 
anything compelling, really, at this point.  It does not mean 
there is no way or there will never be a day when the, you 
know, those that do not yet feel convinced there is a 
necessity, they are not convinced.  Maybe a case can still 
be made. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, can I put to you for comment that 
actually a compelling case is illustrated by the history of 
the 
5 t h 
Parliament 
that 
there 
were 
ongoing 
serious 
allegations implicating the President, the presidency, the 
President’s family and there was no portfolio committee 
10 
that considered it within its rank – within its agreement to 
investigate and to deal with those and that might illustrate 
precisely why there might be merit in some type of 
committee with oversight over the President.   
MS MBETE:   Well, Chairperson, you will also agree that 
the issues that arose are around which there were many 
repulse and complaints and in fact a lot of noise in the fifth 
term.  We are scattered in different portfolios that are 
already allocated to departments and ministries and, 
therefore, the fact that part of the narrative would be 
20 
referring to the role or other of the President, does not for 
me, necessarily make the case for a portfolio committee 
over the President. 
 
It is the issues that must be looked at and as 
Parliament, actually in fact, provides for.  When there is no 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 178 of 241 
 
specific portfolio committee or maybe the matters are all 
over the place, we create an ad-hoc committee.  Those are 
the times we create ad-hoc committees and we take 
members that are sitting in different portfolio committees to 
the extent that they would be relevant and they are 
insights and they are exposure and knowledge, would be 
relevant.   
 
They would be brought together in an ad-hoc 
committee to deal with those matters and that was what 
was done whenever it was necessary during the fifth term.   
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, Ms Mbete, you would be aware 
that this Commission has heard quite a bit of evidence on 
this very topic and the evidence shows that a proposal 
debate on the floor of the National Assembly in September 
of 2016 for an ad-hoc committee to investigate allegations 
of state capture was rather(?) defeated by the African 
National Congress MP’s. 
 
Does that not indicate precisely the opposite of 
what you just said, namely, that Parliament did not use the 
ad-hoc committee structure which was available to them in 
20 
circumstances when there was a need to do so? 
MS MBETE:   Now the subject of ad-hoc committees was 
very often a reason to have disagreement in particular 
when some members of Parliament would be arguing for an 
ad-hoc committee and in our view, who – we who run 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 179 of 241 
 
Parliament and I am talking about not just the presiding 
officers but the management without whom we cannot, 
actually, play our role including the legal department and 
the administration of Parliament. 
 
In each House, there is a secretary who has 
other managers under them.  We would always examine the 
case that would be argued in particular or very often from 
the opposition benches, so, and ad-hoc committees as if 
you just create ad-hoc committees just for the sake of it. 
 
Every portfolio in government has a portfolio 
10 
committee that corresponds with it.  When in the rare 
occasion there is a necessity to bring people from different 
portfolio committees and create an ad-hoc committee even 
in the 5 t h Parliament, as the affidavit makes out, we 
created  ad-hoc committees but you do not just create an 
ad-hoc committee because somebody has thought of it and 
they think it is the best way.   
 
Why 
can 
we 
not 
use 
an 
existing 
portfolio 
committee?  It is the first question we would ask ourselves.  
And only when we are convinced that no one portfolio 
20 
committee is able to take on whatever it is that needs to be 
looked into, only then do we go of the ad-hoc committee 
and we take people from different portfolios because, 
Chairperson, 
taking 
people 
away 
from 
their 
portfolio 
committees adds to the volume of work that MP’s have. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 180 of 241 
 
 
And Chairperson, I want to tell South Africa.  
Members of Parliament work very hard.  Members of 
Parliament have a lot of to do.  There are 12-months in a 
year.  It is not an easy time.  It has got to be divided into 
bits and pieces because they have got to dash off to that 
corner of the country to do constituency work.   
 
They have got to go and do political work.  They 
have got to go and do oversight work.  Not all the time.  
Not all the year is oversight.  In fact, I think there is 
somewhere where I am pointing out that in the current term 
10 
only 11-weeks are set aside and once that programme – 
because remember the programme is not decided by one 
person.   
 
We are all in a committee that is, in fact, a 
committee of all parties, a multi-party committee.  It meets 
every Thursday to discuss the programme of Parliament.  
So where you must take time away from what already is in 
the programme is not an easy decision to make but now 
and again it becomes an easy ball in the political of cause 
which are always part and parcel of the environment that 
20 
Parliament has to conduct its business in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I take you back to the question 
Mr Freund asked ...[intervenes] 
MS MBETE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...about a portfolio committee that would 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 181 of 241 
 
be dedicated to performing oversight over the President or 
presidency?  Is part of your answer that when one has 
regard to the fact that the President would have divided his 
or her, because we are not talking about the party 
...[intervenes] 
MS MBETE:   Yes, you never know, hey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Ja.  His or her executive 
authority among various ministers’ portfolios. 
MS MBETE:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you take that into account, which 
10 
means that any issues that relates to those portfolios 
would go to the particular portfolio committees. 
MS MBETE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you take that into account plus the 
fact that Parliament has the power and opportunity of 
establishing an ad-hoc committee ...[intervenes] 
MS MBETE:   H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when an issue has arisen that does 
not fall under any of the portfolio committees or that 
cannot be dealt with by any one of the committees.  Is part 
20 
of your evidence that that should take care of any situation 
that might arise where there is a need for oversight or for 
certain issues to be looked into relating to a president? 
MS MBETE:   In fact, Chairperson, my evidence is so far.  
Having worked in that environment, I know that if anything 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 182 of 241 
 
arises for which we do not have a specific structure, we 
would form the necessary structure, make it an ad-hoc 
committee because it is a matter for which there is not a 
permanent structure but it – you give it and you use the 
necessary human resources that are around you.   
 
And you get it to – you agree the terms of 
reference and those terms of reference would be agreed to 
in a multi-party structure.  So the chances of blaming one 
party for being protective or something of the President.  
No, you agree a structure and you get it to have all the 
10 
resources that it needs and you get it to look at the 
specific issues that are the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MBETE:   And after that, you let the MP’s go back to 
their other jobs which are the various portfolio committees 
because every MP would belong to at least two portfolio 
committees.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS MBETE:   Now if you look at the volume of work in front 
of each portfolio committee.  For each MP to get on top of 
20 
the subject of the portfolio they are working in is a very 
difficult job.  And therefore, you know, you really want to 
give them the chance to master the portfolio in which they 
must be more, you know, have insight, more in that 
particular portfolio or two. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 183 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Of course, a challenge with regard 
to creating an ad-hoc committee or a committee – ja, an 
ad-hoc committee to look into certain issues that may have 
arisen at a particular time in relation to a particular 
president.  A particular challenge that might arise would be 
if the majority party does not even want that committee to 
be establish because that party – that committee can only 
be establish if the majority party goes along.  That you 
would accept? 
MS MBETE:   That is not a major problem in Parliament, 
10 
actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MBETE:   This issue of – you know, I hear a lot of 
noises being made here in this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MBETE:   Especially by honourable members for – in 
the opposite benches.  There is no issue that is not 
canvassed, 
that 
is 
not 
processed 
by 
the 
whips 
in 
Parliament and it is among the whips if you want to really 
process something to a level where there is what we used 
20 
to call sufficient consensus.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MBETE:   The whip is really the engine because it is a 
multi-party body.  If for some reason there is a convincing 
argument being made – in fact, the Chief Whip is going to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 184 of 241 
 
be able to think about it and discuss it and even bring it 
forward to other colleagues including in the majority party.   
 
So it is not impossible for things because they 
were not originating from the majority party to be agreed 
upon if, in fact, there is a good reason and they are 
argued, they are put on the table.  People look at the 
issues and they tend to agree to convince each other 
across the political parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say the difficulty, if there is any 
in that regard, is not as big as it might seem but – or you 
10 
say there is no difficulty at all? 
MS MBETE:   There is no difficulty.  You know – and you 
know, Chairperson, we each have our own little moments 
where is a pain you suffered and it never goes away and 
therefore wherever you go and you tell the story of your 
term or your time in Parliament, it is that particular pain.   
 
And yet, actually, it was not like it was bringing 
the whole country down.  Yes, proposals were made by 
MP’s 
to 
make 
ad-hoc 
committees, 
to 
create 
ad-hoc 
committees.  They were looked at.  Nothing was ever 
20 
dismissed just out of hand.  We would take those proposals 
and turn them around, as I say.  We would use, of course, 
the insights of the Committee Section, both the House 
Chairperson, the relevant house chairperson as well as the 
management, the senior management in that particular 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 185 of 241 
 
section, the Committee Section to look at the viability of a 
proposal of an ad-hoc committee.   
 
There is no magic in an ad-hoc committee.  An 
ad-hoc committee is – remember it is a group of MP’s 
brought together.  So you will take them away from 
somewhere else where they are doing work where they are 
actually focussed on and my point is.   
 
Only when it is absolutely unavoidable must you 
take people away from their jobs for which they hardly 
have enough time, enough energy, enough resources, you 
10 
know, because these are the challenges of being an MP.   
 
We go to other countries and we see how an MP 
is supported by ten different people, just one MP.  He has 
a lawyer to himself, there is a researcher, you know, an 
administrator and you say:  Wow!  Our MP’s work hard, 
Chairperson.  If I say nothing else to convince you, let me 
convince on that one thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MS MBETE:   Our members of Parliament work very hard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Mr Freund. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  Ms Mbete, there has been 
overwhelming evidence before this Commission that by no 
later of March 2016 and, in fact, one can make a 
compelling case for a lot earlier than that but by no later 
than March 2016, there was enormous public concern 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 186 of 241 
 
about allegations of corruption and state capture.  And not 
one portfolio committee saw fit to adhere to requests to 
investigate those allegations.  Does that not negate the 
evidence you have just given? 
MS MBETE:   What I am saying, Chairperson, is.  In 
March 2016, MP’s were very busy.  What exactly they were 
doing, each of them, I will not be able to say here but it 
cannot be argued that they were sitting around, they had 
all the time and the consciousness and awareness and the 
understanding about everything about what was going on 
10 
and they did not do anything about it. 
 
There 
came 
a 
time 
at 
a 
certain 
point, 
Chairperson, when, in fact, those issues, because you are 
right that in 2016 suddenly we were hearing noises and we 
were reading and seeing that they are disturbing reports 
about things that were happening, about which we were 
hearing 
rumours. 
 
No 
concrete 
information 
or 
understanding.   
 
And because at that time when individual public 
representatives are hearing these matters, they are not 
20 
just sitting around...  I am trying to just point that out.  So 
when you say they did not respond, they did not go and do 
oversight.  Maybe sitting in this point where we are with a 
lot of hindsight, we are stronger.   
 
We, in fact, are better off than where those MP’s 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 187 of 241 
 
were in that moment in that year.  So, at a certain point 
later, of course, things will come directly to them through 
reports to their specific portfolio committees, documents 
that they – that come to them and they have to pay 
attention to.   
 
And yes, some of those matters started receiving 
attention, portfolio committee by portfolio committee at few 
portfolios.  But what I am correcting, Chairperson, is a 
tone that seeks to suggests that when MP’s had all the 
knowledge and they had all the power given by legislation 
10 
and the Constitution, they did not do anything when they 
understood.  Probably, they did not understand as much as 
we do know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, probably, Mr Freund will have 
quite a few follow-up questions on that.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mbete, this is 
not a matter of the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.  We have got 
matters that the National Executive Committee of the 
African National Congress itself by March in 2016 regarded 
as of the utmost gravity.  And it appears that MP’s could 
20 
not be faltered for having the same insight, it does not 
bear scrutiny.   
 
And what also does not bear scrutiny, I want to 
put to you, is the failure of members of Parliament and in 
particular the portfolio committees – let us leave aside ad-
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 188 of 241 
 
hoc committees – to investigate these allegations which 
were widely publicised by no later than March of 2016.   
MS MBETE:   Chairperson, I know that testimony has been 
put before you, also, about certain information that came 
to the attention of the structure of the African National 
Congress 
and 
National 
Executive 
Committee 
that 
Mr Freund refers to.   
 
I am also aware that the Speaker herself, when 
she was here, did raise the concern that you do not just 
take something because someone has said it and you 
10 
plunge it into the space of the Parliament.   
 
And I want, Chairperson, an occasion when - at 
that time, I was – it was my first term as the Deputy 
Speaker and the Speaker was away, so I was the acting 
Speaker.  When a document was slipped under my door 
and as it turned out when I read it, it was about the arms 
deal.  The famous arms deal.  Yesterday, the case was 
again postponed and so on.   
 
That document had no signature, had no author 
but yes it was containing scary things that were being 
20 
claimed in this document.  I had to apply my mind for hours 
and I took a decision.  Parliament is very busy.  We never 
have enough time and I must now take this dramatic 
document, yes, and say Parliament must take this into this 
programme.  On what basis? Who is the author?  And I just 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 189 of 241 
 
did not act on it.   
 
And I am saying this and if another opportunity 
like that happens, I would still decide that.  I am not going 
to take this document, which in fact, is a lot of rumour, 
drama.  Very concerning but it must have an author.  Why 
is there no author?  The person who has slit it under my 
door must come out, must face me and tell me they are 
concerned about this and that is why they are bringing it to 
me.  Then I will act on it.   
 
So the fact that someone tells us something 
10 
does not put it in the kind of shape that, as a responsible 
person running this very complicated complex space, must 
take it and say in addition to every other havoc we have, 
here is something else.  Find a way.  Maybe create an ad-
hoc committee.   
 
So I am trying to, therefore, answer Mr Freund 
by saying the fact that the MEC was told something, in 
fact, just gave me to the status of a rumour.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not think that anybody 
suggests that anything that comes to the attention of 
20 
members of Parliament, irrespective of its status or quality, 
must be a ground for a member of Parliament or members 
of Parliament to start doing something.  I think nobody 
suggests that because otherwise Parliament will never do 
its work because there are so many of those things.   
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 190 of 241 
 
 
But at the same time, I think you would also 
agree that, probably, Parliament should not wait until there 
is the kind of evidence that may be would be expected in a 
court of law before it does something.  So, probably, as I 
see it, I think the differences of opinion may well be at 
what stage should Parliament... 
 
At what stage did Parliament have enough to be 
able to say:  Well, some investigation should be done.  We 
do not have something that is certain but what we have is 
enough to justify that we investigate.  I think that is where 
10 
most of the people...  They might differ about, in 2012, was 
there enough?  Maybe no.  In 2013, 2014?  Maybe yes, 
maybe no.   
 
But I think some of the MP’s have said in 2017 
when the Portfolio Committee to look into Eskom and so 
on, was established.  At that stage, they thought there was 
enough.  But there may be people who say there was 
enough much earlier.  So what do you say to that approach 
to say nobody says take everything that get slit under your 
door ...[intervenes] 
20 
MS MBETE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ..and run with it but also nobody says 
wait until you have the kind of evidence that will be 
accepted in a court of law before you investigate.  Because 
if you wait until then, probably there is no need to 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 191 of 241 
 
investigate.  Somewhere in between is – there should be a 
time when Parliament should say:  Well, there is enough to 
investigate.  What would you say to that? 
MS MBETE:   I say, Chairperson, you are correct and in 
fact, members of portfolio committees did take initiatives 
and started themselves, without being prompted, to look 
into what they had been picking up which were of concern 
to them.   
 
And yes, there were tensions because, you know, 
invariable – remember, when you are in Parliament you are 
10 
– you continue to be yourself, the individual MP who must 
use your integrity to think through things, interact with your 
colleagues within the parliamentary system.  Listen to 
differences 
from 
other 
parties, 
people 
coming 
from 
different parties, but also, there is always a political 
environment surrounding everybody and that goes not just 
for the people from the ruling party, it also goes for every 
other member of parliament from every political party.   
 
So yes there 
would be those moments - for 
instance, the portfolio committee on Public Enterprises 
20 
decided for themselves that they want to look into the 
issues of Eskom and worked very hard on that issue.  By 
the time the noise increases and in fact there is the Gupta 
Leaks and all of these things all over the place, indeed 
they 
were 
already 
on 
the 
way 
having 
decided 
for 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 192 of 241 
 
themselves that they are going to do this work because 
also, people have different strengths.  While others will be 
more easily frightened to think about if we do this, what 
happens to us.  Others are actually strengthened by the 
very fact that there is something that looks smelly here and 
I think we should pursue it. 
 
Most people, I want to say, that I was aware of, 
were the type that would not hesitate to pursue things just 
because, 
you 
know, 
of 
political 
considerations, 
for 
instance, but that is a factor because parliament is a 
10 
political environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  You said that some people 
might be frightened.  Can I ask you, frightened of what? 
MS MBETE:   Of whatever fears they might have for 
themselves, for political careers, you know, but that is 
always a consideration in a parliamentary setup because, 
remember, you are not elected by people, you are elected 
by the party.  You come there on that strength and that is 
not like the worst thing that can happen to you in the 
20 
world, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No, I am not suggesting it is but it is a 
great public privilege and onerous responsibility to be a 
member of parliament and of course you are quite correct 
that nobody goes to parliament, as things stand, without 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 193 of 241 
 
going there on a ticket of a political party. 
 
Ms Mbete, can I take you to paragraph 27 of your 
affidavit please? 
MS MBETE:   27.   
ADV FREUND SC:   You will see that that deals with what 
we refer to in this Commission as the Frolick letters of 
June 2017. 
MS MBETE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am sure you will recall that period. 
MS MBETE:   H’m. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I ask you what role you played 
personally in relation to the letters that were sent by Mr 
Frolick to the Chairs of four Portfolio Committees at that 
time? 
MS MBETE:   What role I personally played? 
ADV FREUND SC:   H’m. 
MS MBETE:   I actually will not lie to say to you I 
remember crisply but by the time this was happening, this 
is the time of the Gupta Leaks. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct. 
20 
MS MBETE:   So we would have been talking.  I mean, Mr 
Frolick himself, we would have been talking as Presiding 
Officers, we would have also talking in the political 
committee which is a structure that exists which we form 
each time after, you know, a parliament has been formed in 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 194 of 241 
 
order to enable those members in particular of the majority 
party that are in the leadership to be able to come together 
as quickly as possible to share information, clarify matters 
to themselves, as a collective, and therefore, enable each 
one of us go back to your office with better understanding 
having benefited from the collective wisdom. 
 
So we would have probably also gone through that, 
I imagine, probably in the political committee already and 
we would have probably called Mr Frolick to come in 
specifically even if he would not have been a member of 
10 
the political committee himself but for the specific reason 
of being able to collectively look at the issues that were 
facing the whole country, you know, we would have called 
him in to find out what information, what insights he, as the 
house chairperson concerned, he could share and shed 
light on so that we could then collectively reach a 
particular understanding to enable the Chief Whip to go 
back to his role as Chief Whip and having benefited from 
that collective wisdom and Frolick and I, because would 
have worked in my – under myself, we would then have a 
20 
further discussion talking more in detail about what he 
knew, what he understood.  But, as I say, I cannot claim to 
you that I remember crisply what exactly was the detail of 
what 
happened 
at 
that 
time 
but 
I 
remember 
these 
discussions and the mood of the time. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 195 of 241 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Is it fair to say that you believe that 
this decision to facilitate portfolio committees becoming 
more active in relation to these specific allegations of state 
capture and corruption, would it have been preceded by 
some discussion in the political committee? 
MS MBETE:   I suspect so because it is exactly this kind of 
moment that would have been a very difficult moment in 
the country generally that your leadership must be ready to 
come together quickly, share information and therefore 
empower themselves collectively to be able to get back to 
10 
their leadership roles in the different offices that they were 
playing a role in and therefore be able to lead with better 
understanding.   
For instance, if I may make an example of how it 
would be helpful, the questions of where else some of 
these matters were receiving attention, would have been 
an important issue because as we in parliament were 
thinking where must there be an inquiry that must be 
encouraged.  If it has not started we must actually ensure 
that it starts.  We would be interested to know whether in 
20 
the security cluster there are any investigations going on 
because we would always – especially we in parliament, 
resources are a big issue, big area of consideration, so we 
would think there is no point in asking us or people here to 
start 
some 
investigation 
when, 
in 
fact, 
there 
is 
an 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 196 of 241 
 
investigation 
happening 
somewhere 
else 
because 
remember, the national fiscus, we all draw from the same 
national fiscus, so there is no need in having to have, you 
know, number of investigations on the same thing, if you 
can avoid it. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I ask you please to explain to the 
Commission the different roles played by the ANC’s 
political committee by contrast to the strategy committee? 
MS MBETE:   The strategy committee was actually the 
Chief Whip’s space.  The Chief Whips, over the years, I 
10 
have always known, would always create this little space 
depending on what was on the agenda at the time.  For 
instance, what debates are happening at that time.  Maybe 
we are going through budget votes so all those that come 
from the ANC would be invited to come there just to get a 
sense of strategy and who is dealing with what and then 
you go and do what you are supposed to be talking or 
focusing on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I take you back to your answer 
immediately before this one where you were saying the 
20 
question of who else may have been investigating certain 
allegations would have been an important issue when 
parliament would have had to consider whether it itself 
investigates those allegations.  Now obviously one can see 
that there is – that is a legitimate issue to consider 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 197 of 241 
 
because of the limited resources that you are talking about 
because there would be – parliament would be alive to the 
need to avoid duplication of course and resources and so 
on but at the same time, if you take, for example, and 
investigation that is being done say by the Hawks or the 
police which they do for a particular purpose namely crime, 
it might take years.  So parliament might be needing to 
understand why certain things are happening and what 
should be done by parliament to try and arrest the situation 
and if they were to wait for the police to complete their 
10 
investigations it might take long.  So the question that I 
would like to ask is whether you would say the position is 
that parliament must just make a judgment call based on 
the situation at the time, it must make the decision whether 
to investigate, it cannot be a situation where they say all 
the time as long as the police are investigating, we will not 
investigate, it would always depend on the issues and all 
relevant factors.  There may be cases where even if the 
police 
are 
investigating, 
parliament 
because 
of 
its 
constitutional obligation and its desire to understand how 
20 
certain things are happening might decide nevertheless 
that it would investigate.  Would that be something you 
would go along with? 
MS MBETE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 198 of 241 
 
MS MBETE:   That is exactly the point, parliament would 
have to look at the kind of investigation that in fact can be 
done by parliament because parliament is not the police.  
You know, there are just things it would not be able to do 
because it is not designed that way, it is not about getting 
into that kind of detail of investigation like a forensic 
investigation.  In fact, we send things of that nature to 
relevant structures in the security cluster but where there 
is some work happening elsewhere that we are conscious 
of, we would look at it and see whether we really think we 
10 
should get into it or we should wait.  
 
There also came a time when – I think it was in 
2016 what we decided that it was time to look at this 
matter of this Commission and that discussion started 
before 2017 and we were convinced that we needed to 
have such a Commission that would also be able to be 
given the kinds of resources it needs to get to the bottom 
of what is it that has been going wrong all over the place 
and so I am elated that we are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Freund? 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  I just want to go back 
to the political committee and the strategy committee.  I 
understand – please just confirm, that you would have 
been a member of the political committee. 
MS MBETE:   I was member of the political committee 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 199 of 241 
 
because I was – I am a member of the MEC. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MS MBETE:   So the political committee would be formed 
out of the leadership that would be in parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  The strategy committee, the 
ANC’s strategy committee, you, as Speaker, would you 
have attended meetings of that committee? 
MS MBETE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No? 
MS MBETE:   I would attend maybe once when I am part of 
10 
a debate, you know? 
ADV FREUND SC: [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS MBETE:   And it is just – but it was not a place I went 
to – I mean, I did not go to caucus regularly, I went from 
time to time so strategic committee.   
ADV FREUND SC:   Meetings of the Chief Whip’s Forum 
would you typically attend those meetings? 
MS MBETE:   No. 
ADV FREUND SC:   No? 
MS MBETE:   No, not unless I was invited because there 
20 
was a particular matter the Chief Whip’s needed the 
Speaker to clarify and so on.  No, if the – so the late Jack 
Mthembu has furnished an affidavit but of course we have 
not had the opportunity regrettably to ask him some 
questions arising but in relation to this, what we call the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 200 of 241 
 
Frolick letters, if he says that this was …[intervenes] 
MS MBETE:   In relation to?  Sorry, I did not hear that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   To the letters …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Frolick letters. 
MS MBETE:   Okay, the Frolick letters. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I am in June of 2017.  And he says in 
relation to those letters that the proposal that the portfolio 
committees or that there should be investigation by 
portfolio committees was discussed at the ANC strategy 
community at a Chief Whip’s Forum meeting and he does 
10 
not refer to any discussions involving Mr Frolick but Mr 
Frolick’s evidence was as follows that on that particular 
day, the 15 June 2007, he was away – he was not at 
parliament for an understandable reason but on his return 
he was called to a meeting with yourself and with Mr 
Mthembu and there was a discussion which in due course 
resulted in him sending these letters.  So what I am trying 
to piece together is what happened here factually in sort of 
chronological sequence.  You have said that on the 
probabilities 
this 
would 
have 
been 
discussed 
in 
the 
20 
political committee, would it be reasonable to assume that 
the strategy committee would have taken direction from the 
political committee? 
MS MBETE:   The strategy committee’s leader would have 
been the Chief Whip.  The Chief Whip was a member of the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 201 of 241 
 
political committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MS MBETE:   Because he was a leader, so he was part of 
the leadership collective that gave political leadership 
whenever it was necessary.  As I say, what each person 
depending on the role they had been deployed to, a Chief 
Whip is a Chief Whip so he will sit with the other leaders, 
they have a discussion of what was obtaining, they would 
share perspectives and then they let go and they go and do 
their each job, each one do their own job.  So the Chief 
10 
Whip might have already shared his thinking with some of 
the whips under him but I do not know.  So I cannot quite 
say to you first there was a political committee of not, it 
might even have been the other way around, he might have 
come to the political committee, already having tested his 
thoughts or he – you know, these are human interactions.   
ADV FREUND SC:   I understand that. 
MS MBETE:   So we should see a parliament setting as a 
setting where here are human beings who have come from 
various corners of the country, they have come very 
20 
seriously to play a role to service the needs of our people.  
So he is the Chief Whip, this one is a Speaker, that one is 
the other thing, others are ministers.  There are many more 
of them who are together there in being ministers and as 
part of the executive.  So play leadership roles there in 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 202 of 241 
 
those corners separately, we do not have to be instructed 
on the detail of how do you execute your leadership 
function in your own corner, no.  We do not – I mean, we 
read that we are expected to be getting calls from Luthuli 
House.  No, there is nothing like that, nothing could be 
more ridiculous than that.  Who in Luthuli House has even 
an understanding of how parliament runs, you know? 
 
So you take advantage of the collective to come 
together 
as 
the 
political 
committee, 
share 
your 
understanding, get information.  Then you get to know, 
10 
okay, someone else is doing something else about this 
same matter we are busy grappling with here in this 
environment so how then do we take it forward?  So I hope 
I am answering you, I am clarifying your question, Mr 
Freund.  If not please say so, I will try again. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you.  The Chief Whip’s Forum is 
that a forum that involves whips other than ANC whips? 
MS MBETE:   Yes.  It is a multiparty forum. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Multiparty structure. 
MS MBETE:   Multiparty, h’m. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Whereas the strategy committee and 
the political committee are African National Congress 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
MS MBETE:   Yes, it will be the ANC people. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right, now I want to go back to the 15 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 203 of 241 
 
June 2017 because what Mr Frolick says and I just want to 
see whether you agree or disagree with what he says.  He 
says that when he returned he was called to a meeting with 
you and Mr Mthembu and there was some discussion 
between the three of you about the proposal that had been 
raised by opposition MPs but now was the time for an ad 
hoc committee to be established.  He says the three of you 
agreed that it was not time for that but it was indeed time 
to 
call 
upon 
the 
relevant 
portfolio 
committees 
to 
themselves investigate these allegations that are now very 
10 
widely circulated.  Do you agree with Mr Frolick’s evidence 
on that? 
MS MBETE:   That we put our heads together the three of 
us, that makes sense.  We probably had to do that quite 
often at certain periods that parliament would have been 
going through but that we said – I do not know the detail of 
we said it is not time for other committee and so on, I 
would not remember that kind of detail. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, these details are extremely 
important, that is why I am spending some time talking to 
20 
you about them and what he says is that you personally – 
Mr Mthembu and him agreed that it would be best for the 
portfolio committees to investigate and then to report back 
to the house and that you then asked Mr Frolick to then 
write to the portfolio committee chairs concerned to give 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 204 of 241 
 
effect to that.  Do you dispute that, do you have anything 
to …[intervenes] 
MS MBETE:   No, if you put it that way, Mr Freund – 
Chairperson, earlier on I said to you there are portfolio 
committees and what makes sense to anyone running 
parliament, as I was, is for things to go to the relevant 
space where they are every day having the people who are 
focused on them.  Why created an ad hoc committee that 
pulls people from elsewhere?  Let the portfolio committees 
concerned deal with the issues.  That would have made 
10 
sense to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position – or would it be fair to 
say you are saying you cannot remember there was such a 
meeting and that in that meeting there was a decision that 
creating an ad hoc committee was not the right thing to do 
but that the matter could go to the relevant committees is 
something that is consistent with your – what you would 
have wanted to do? 
MS MBETE:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
20 
MS MBETE:   It comes more naturally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let me make clear that I am not 
particularly concerned about whether such investigative 
process such inquiries should take place in a portfolio 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 205 of 241 
 
committee or in an ad hoc committee.  I am not focusing on 
that at all for now.  What I am much more interested in is 
the principle that you seem to be accepting and that is the 
principle that it is perfectly appropriate and to be expected 
that you, as Speaker, and the Chief Whip in consultation 
with the Chair of Chairs would take a decision to instruct 
that portfolio committees should now investigate these 
allegations.  Do you accept that? 
MS MBETE:   I am not quite sure I am understanding… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you might have to repeat your 
10 
question.  I think the first part …[intervenes] 
MS 
MBETE: 
 
 
Because 
the 
thing 
you 
have 
said 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first part was not so clear. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright …[intervenes] 
MS MBETE:   Because I understand, Mr Freund, the facts 
as you put them but I am just trying to figure out where is 
the problem area in what you are saying because we are 
talking about our job in parliament and we share this kind 
of information all the time on an ongoing basis. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let him repeat the question so we 
understand, ja.  Yes, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Let me cover the same question from a 
different direction.  There is to my knowledge nothing in 
the preceding five years remotely comparable to the four 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 206 of 241 
 
letters sent by Mr Frolick to the four chairs of portfolio 
committees, letters from the Chair of Chair ostensibly on 
behalf of the Speaker and with the authority of the Speaker 
directing that the particular portfolio committees should 
investigate particular allegations.  I want to check firstly 
that you agree that that is what happened, that you were 
party to a decision to issue such an instruction via Mr 
Frolick 
that 
there 
should 
now 
be 
these 
types 
of 
investigations. 
MS MBETE:   Chairperson, I am saying I have no specific 
10 
memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBETE:   But I am saying if it happened, in fact I have 
raised it and it makes a lot of sense to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
MS MBETE:   Because that moment was a moment of great 
concern and noise and a lot of agitation and scary news in 
the 
public 
domain 
and 
as 
individual 
leaders 
and 
collectively whenever we had an opportunity we would put 
our heads together to say what is going on? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your response is you do not have a 
specific recollection of the meeting. 
MS MBETE:   No, I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But bearing in mind what the atmosphere 
was around that time you would think it would be the right 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 207 of 241 
 
thing to do that the relevant committees be asked to do 
investigations.  Is that right/ 
MS MBETE:   Actually, Chairperson, Mr Frolick would not 
have needed to mention that he has a discussion with the 
Speaker, he would have been playing a role that made 
sense that he should do that, he should give that 
leadership because that was part of his portfolio as the 
house chairperson relevant in relation to the work of 
committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, Mr Freund? 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   It would be part of Mr Frolick’s duties, 
as you understand them, when there was scary noise in the 
public domain to request relevant portfolio committees to 
investigate the allegations. 
MS MBETE:   Yes, Mr Freund.  Yes, Mr Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now when referred a moment ago, I 
just want to check for the purposes of the record that you 
said at that time there was scary noise in the public 
domain.  Did you have in mind when you said that the 
allegations in and relating to the so-called Gupta Leaks 
20 
emails? 
MS MBETE:   That would have been part of it, h’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What else might – what else, in 
addition? 
MS MBETE:   I do not know, Mr Freund, I cannot – unless I 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 208 of 241 
 
read through somewhere where I read specific reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MBETE:   But the many wrongdoings that we unearthed 
in the Public Enterprises portfolio committee that came out 
as the Eskom inquiries were underway in parliament, the 
things that were happening at the SABC also which the 
Portfolio Committee concerned had gotten into even earlier 
than the others that were dealing with the Gupta leaks, so 
the amounts of monies that had been looted you know 
those are the things that I find scary even today. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, now the problem of course as you 
I believe understand is that those allegations were not 
made for the first time in June of 2017.   In fact, 
allegations were made, for example, by a Deputy Minister 
in March of 2016, that he had been offered a very 
substantial bribe if he would assume the office of Finance 
Minister, and then do the bidding of the Gupta’s from him, 
he says he received this offer.  
That is just one example of the scary noise in the 
public domain, not in June 2017 but in March of 2016.  Do 
20 
you agree that that was deeply disturbing and if you do 
agree, can you explain why you would not together with the 
Chief Whip, and Mr Frolick as early as March of 2016 have 
directed inquiries at the time that were only directed in 
June of 2017? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 209 of 241 
 
MS MBETE:   Because there is logic in how an institution 
like Parliament does – it is very complex job.  It would not 
just go class clutching at information that arrives, as I told 
you earlier on, even when I found a document under my 
door, I decided - and that was very early on in the first 
Parliament actually that I am not going to act on this, 
because it has no author, it has no face.  It can be the 
basis on which I just read this thing and bring it here.  But 
by the time you are referring to Mr Freund, Chairperson by 
that time, I think there was enough to make even a person 
10 
who was so fast asleep, to wake up and realise that no, 
there is something very, very wrong.  
But even as they - that was being attended to, it 
could not just be a question of I have heard this now, I am 
dashing to go and instruct.  There is a process, there is a 
program, there are structures, and therefore, although right 
now this very minute, I might not be able to answer you in 
terms of the detail of that specific question that you are 
asking.   
I know that it would be a matter that would have 
20 
been looked at not only by the opposition by all MP’s, in 
the relevant spaces where that information was affecting 
them. Whether they did act or not, is a matter of detail and 
I would have to go and find the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The time…[intervene] 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 210 of 241 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   But, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund, the time that you 
refer to I do not want to put words into your mouth but I 
think you said something along the lines that even 
somebody who was sleeping would have become aware by 
that time that something needed to be done because of 
what was in the public domain.  Is that in 2016, around the 
time when Mr Jonas made revelations about the Gupta 
offer? 
MS MBETE:   I remember the report of Mr Jonas, but by 
10 
that time, also, there would have been a lot of public 
mobilisation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MBETE:   So it was not only in Parliament or in the 
NEC of the ANC, by that time, I think people were 
mobilising in the streets, you know.  I was going through 
this talking to colleagues saying, you know, it was the first 
time I saw white people toyi-toying in the streets, you 
know.  So there was the unprecedented level of public 
mobilisation simply around the issue of discoveries of 
20 
wrongdoing including misuse of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so as I understand you, you are 
saying it is not just when Mr Jonas made the revelation 
even before that, as far as you are concerned, the stage 
has been reached where there was mobilisation in the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 211 of 241 
 
public domain, yes okay, Mr - of course, a few years 
earlier, that is earlier than the revelation of Mr Jonas, in 
2013, there had been the Waterkloof landing of the Gupta 
aeroplane, which also seems to have caught the attention 
of many people in the country. 
MS MBETE:   It got my attention but at that time, I was out 
of Parliament for that term. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, for that term, yes. 
MS MBETE:   For that term I was at Luthuli House and it 
hit me, even that time.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MBETE:   That particular incident.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Mr Freund.  
ADV FREUND SC:   So that time of great public protest, it 
is a matter of record, there is a lot of evidence on it.  But it 
commences 
long, 
long 
before 
June 
of 
201 
and 
the 
allegations that were being made very publicly, were really 
allegations of subversion of our entire Constitution, of 
improper influence over the highest levels of office, both at 
the level of the Presidency, at the level of the Cabinet, at 
20 
the level of Director Generals, at the level of Chairs of 
State of entities, at the level of Executive State owned 
entities.  
 
And Parliament, was under an obligation to hold the 
executive to account, to oversee the executive and hold 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 212 of 241 
 
the executive to account.  Can you explain why that simply 
did not happen through the Portfolio Committees, or 
through an ad hoc Committee at all in 2016? 
MS MBETE:   I would have to go back to my submission to 
read about this specific question you are asking me now of 
2016.  But all I am saying Chairperson, is that we did what 
is contained in this submission.  The record is here of that 
which was done, whether it was by way of questions to the 
President, questions to specific Ministers, that is a part 
from the Portfolio Committees.  That is a part from the 
10 
motions of no confidence. So it is simply untrue to say the 
fifth 
Parliament 
sat 
through 
a 
massive 
amounts 
of 
corruption and did totally nothing.   It is not true.  
What did happen is here might be inadequate and 
yes, I dare say actually it was inadequate, because the 
resources are not adequate.  The capabilities, even as the 
other testimonies have been put before the Chairperson, 
and we hope the Chairperson will highlight that matter, the 
capability, the resources need attention. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And now may say Ms Mbete that I for 
20 
one, take no issue with the facts that you set out in your 
affidavit as to things that did not happen.  But I am 
focusing particularly on Portfolio Committees as engines 
for ferreting out the truth and bringing about accountability, 
for the very same reason that you emphasise that right at 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 213 of 241 
 
the outset of your presentation this afternoon.  
When you said that is the engine of oversight.  I 
want to put to you for the last time because I think we have 
covered this material.  But it is at that level, that the 
failure really took place, the failure of investigation, inquiry 
and holding the executive to account in relation to 
allegations that had an ostensible credibility and were 
extremely serious. 
MS MBETE:   Chairperson, I do not deny that there were 
failures, that is not my point but I am saying a lot more 
10 
could have been done.  If, for instance, the fortunate place 
where we are now, where we have put a lot of research and 
investigative powers, we have put a lot of resources 
precisely as we had thought originally, it would work.  It is 
good that we now know what we know.  So that we know 
how to correct it.  That it went wrong, yes, it went wrong, it 
is true. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  So let us now from my side try 
to be more constructive.  I wanted to focus on some of the 
issues, which you highlight in your affidavit.  Firstly, if I 
20 
can take it to paragraph 20 of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say paragraph 20?  
ADV FREUND SC:   Paragraph 20, it is page 988.  I think 
this may have been the paragraph you had in mind Ms 
Mbete when you referred quite some time ago, to Portfolio 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 214 of 241 
 
Committee sitting for 11 weeks a year.  In fact, what you 
said here is ten and a half weeks a year.  
Now, I have no reason to dispute that what you say 
is correct, but it does strike me as a matter of concern.  If 
one of the core functions of Parliament is to hold the 
executive accountable?  If it is correct, that only ten and a 
half weeks of the year, the Portfolio Committees engaged 
in this type of activity.  Is that not a matter in itself, that 
should be of concern to us?  
MS MBETE:   We hope so that is why it is a good thing that 
10 
it is here, it is before the whole of South Africa so that we 
know what is going on in our institutions and we can 
therefore understand when cases are being made about 
what must change, and what needs to be put into creating 
better capacity for this institution to work better. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, the second factor that you have 
highlighted and it has been highlighted by other witnesses 
is the question of budget, the budget for Parliament and in 
particular budget for Portfolio Committees, but I am a little 
puzzled and you could assist to educate me.   
20 
When the Speaker of Parliament complains, that the 
resources available to Parliament for it to carry out its 
functions are dictated by the executive.  It had always 
been my impression that the executive needed to come to 
Parliament for its budget to be approved.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 215 of 241 
 
In other words, that the ultimate decision maker is 
Parliament and not the executive.  Do I misunderstand the 
situation? 
MS MBETE:   No, you do not Mr Freund, you do not but it 
is a complex relationship, it is a complex process working 
relationship, how the whole thing starts, who determines 
amounts.  But it is a matter that we are proposing., I am 
proposing needs attention.  In particular, in my introductory 
note, additional document, I am actually reminding us that 
in the fourth term, when I was out in the head of the ANC, 
10 
the President and the other heads of other institutions 
started to have this discussion about what was not right, 
but they did not complete it.  
And it is correct to say the budget of the executive 
even comes to Parliament, so that it goes to the relevant 
committees that receives the necessary detailed attention 
and then it comes to the house and it gets adopted and all 
of that.  
But the actual reality is at the beginning of the 
process of getting to decide how and the quantum of what 
20 
is procured by Parliament for itself, for its own workers as 
an arm and the other - the judiciary is not satisfactory.  But 
I am just introducing a matter that I think needs a lot more 
detailed attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is an important issue because 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 216 of 241 
 
Parliament's 
constitutional 
obligations 
in 
regard 
to 
oversight and holding the executive accountable is very 
important for the country, it is very important and yet, if it 
does not have resources, it cannot really do its work 
properly.  
Obviously, one, we all know that resources are 
limited and it is always difficult to reach a point where you 
say, I have got adequate resources.  But from what I have 
been hearing, it looks like there is a lot of improvement in 
terms of Parliament, in terms of resources.  Yes, Mr 
10 
Freund. 
MS MBETE:   Now, Ms Mbete I was being quite, quite 
straight with you when I asked you to help to educate me 
on this question of Parliamentary oversight in respect of 
the budget, because it seems to me the very little I have 
looked at this afternoon, which I have looked at only in 
response to what you just admitted to us 
But that the situation is far from simple and that I 
have just downloaded off the Parliamentary budget office 
website a document that explains how the budget operates 
20 
and the whole budgeting process and so forth.  But right at 
the end of it, it says this under the heading amended 
power: 
“The 
budget 
bills 
are 
money 
bills, 
ones 
with 
appropriate money where it imposes taxes, levies or 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 217 of 241 
 
duties.  Although the Constitution says an Act must 
be passed to allow Parliament, to allow to amend 
money bills, this has not yet been done.  At present, 
Parliament can only either accept the bill as it is or 
reject it entirely.” 
So my first question to you arising from that is, whether as 
far as you know, that is correct and remains the situation 
right now? 
MS MBETE:   I think that question should have gone to the 
Speaker, maybe I am not the right person, for me to 
10 
answer that question at this moment. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You are not sure.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you left in 2019, was that the 
position?  
MS MBETE:   Yes, it was.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it probably has not changed, but we 
can check.  Okay, alright, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And does that mean Ms Mbete, that 
although Parliament may take the view, that what is 
proposed by the Minister of Finance when he introduces a 
20 
budget, as being the allocation for Parliament, is in its 
view, insufficient.  And for present purposes, I am focusing 
specifically on insufficient to enable it to perform its 
oversight functions.  
MS MBETE:   It’s always…[intervene] 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 218 of 241 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   The situation as you understand it, 
that Parliament can do nothing about this, it can either 
accept the budget and reject the budget, but otherwise has 
no power to determine. 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is not that we cannot do anything, 
we could use the money bills in a space that exists but we 
make the choice for stability.  
ADV FREUND SC:   I see, so you are saying as I hear you 
that Parliament has acted consciously not to rock the boat 
and has accepted the consequences of that? 
10 
MS MBETE:   No we have raised the issues, we have had 
interactions in fact at a certain point, we took the issues 
up as the Speaker's forum.  In other words, the forum that 
includes the Speakers of all the legislatures from around 
the country, because they are even in a worse situation, 
because they relate to their MEC’s of Finance and 
invariably the relationships there are very tricky.  
And so we took the issues up with the then Minister 
of Finance Pravin Gordhan at the time to initiate this 
engagement to say, you know that this relationship does 
20 
not work okay.  In other words, we were looking at it from a 
political point of view saying let us first put the issues on 
the table just peacefully to explain to one another where 
we are each coming from. 
How this situation affects us adversely and in fact 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 219 of 241 
 
when he left, we continued with Minister Gigaba.  So the 
whole legislative sector were seized with the matter when I 
left.  We had started discussions even with the current 
President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that it may be that Parliament 
and the provincial legislatures, but it is more convenient to 
talk about Parliament.  Parliament may be has not - I want 
to say asserted its authority enough.  Maybe that is not the 
right wording but from what you say, it seems to me that it 
is a question of when Parliament wants to draw the line 
10 
and say, we have had enough peaceful discussions now 
they have not led us anywhere.  
So would you agree that it is a question of when 
Parliament would decide now the discussion, the peaceful 
discussions have not achieved anything, and we cannot 
allow this situation to go on forever, therefore, we will now 
take stronger action.  
MS MBETE:   Thank you, Chairperson for asking a 
question I cannot answer.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But well you might not be able to answer 
20 
now but during your term you had the same problem. 
MS MBETE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you not agree that what I am saying 
would have applied during your term? 
MS MBETE:   Yes, as I say, we have taken it up as a factor 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 220 of 241 
 
and even started to engage the Head of State at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can I change the subject, please, can 
I refer you to paragraph 22 of your affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   paragraph 22 is at page 989. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You refer there to the following you 
say: 
“It can be appreciated that the much harmonised 
and agile security environment would serve as an 
early warning sign regarding covert operations, 
10 
such as we have come to know about a subject like 
State Capture.” 
I would like to ask you a few questions arising from that. 
There is an Act of Parliament that creates the Joint 
Standing Committee on Intelligence and which requires 
that committee to report annually to Parliament in relation 
to its oversight functions over the intelligence agencies. I 
presume you are aware of that, is that correct? 
MS MBETE:   Correct Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:   I will refer to that committee as the 
20 
JSCI.  Is it correct that while you were Speaker for two or 
three years, it is not clear to me which it is, that committee 
failed to report at all to Parliament? 
MS MBETE:   I am aware of that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 221 of 241 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Can you tell us what you know about 
that? 
MS MBETE:   There is not much I can tell you Chairperson 
except that, indeed…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It happened.  
MS MBETE:   It happened, and you know that it is an area 
that tends to work behind the scenes really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In secrecy.  
MS MBETE:   And therefore we get deeply embedded in our 
hands to accept that you do not go out of your way to be 
10 
probing because it might even be misunderstood. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But, Ms Mbete you were the Speaker 
and if I understand you correctly, you were telling the 
Chair, that you were aware, the JSCI had failed in its legal 
duty which was a duty to Parliament which you led, is that 
correct? 
MS MBETE:   Chairperson, I do not claim to have a lot of 
recollection specifically about the JSCI I know that in the 
fifth term – there had started to be questions about the 
reports that were due to the JSCI, but were not coming. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were due from or by to Parliament? 
MS MBETE:   From - to the JSCI, which is a committee of 
Parliament.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MBETE:   So because this is an area that is generally 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 222 of 241 
 
removed in its nature, and which, in fact has arrangements 
that are such that we have never had to be probing into 
that particular corner of things.  So I was aware, at that 
time, very vaguely that there seems to be disquiet about 
something that had changed where the reports were 
supposed to be arriving from into Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, but Mr Freund was speaking about 
reports that were supposed to be given to Parliament by 
this particular committee.  
MS MBETE:   The JSCI. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are we talking about the same 
thing. 
MS MBETE:   I am talking about the same thing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS MBETE:   In order for the JSCI to do anything, it needs 
to receive reports…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   From somewhere else. 
MS MBETE:   From somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where you wanted…[intervene] 
MS MBETE:   That is where there seem to be issues. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, even if that were correct, it 
would not make the situation acceptable would it from the 
perspective of Parliament. 
MS MBETE:   Of course not, it cannot.  
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 223 of 241 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And now, the problem is even deeper 
because were you aware that for a period of two years, 
Parliament failed to discharge its legal obligation to 
appoint an Inspector General of Intelligence? 
MS MBETE:   I am aware Chairperson.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, could you explain to us how that 
could be permitted to happen? 
MS MBETE:   I think with a lot of these situations we are 
dealing with it is not a matter of things being allowed to 
happen.  They simply just do not happen, or they happen 
10 
the way they happen and what we have since now been 
faced with is the revelations that did come out at a certain 
point during the fifth term and today, piece by piece, we 
are trying to unravel exactly what is the true nature of 
those matters was.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Would you accept Ms Mbete, that as 
Speaker, you bore a personal responsibility to ensure that 
that Parliament addressed two issues.  
The first was the failure of the JSCI to report to 
Parliament and the second was the obligation of Parliament 
20 
to appoint an Inspector General of Intelligence. 
MS MBETE:   Chairperson, I did not hear what - I heard the 
last part, but I did not quite connect it to the first part of 
the sentence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   He said personal responsibility, I think 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 224 of 241 
 
he said, he said would you accept - or maybe repeat it Mr 
Freund.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, you are correct but what I am – 
we only focusing on here Ms Mbete because we have 
agreed already that this is an unacceptable situation and 
what I am really trying to establish from you is, whether 
you think that the person who was the Speaker at the time 
bore 
a 
personal 
responsibility 
to 
do 
whatever 
was 
necessary to address these two problems.  
The first was the failure of the JSCI to report to 
10 
Parliament and the second was the failure of Parliament to 
appoint an Inspector General of Intelligence. 
MS MBETE:   I am prepared to take responsibility if that is 
what I need to do Chairperson because I was Speaker, but 
that I could have done anything about it is a matter of 
detail that I do not sitting here I am not prepared to say I 
was consciously responsible for. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Are you inclined by that that although 
you now realise that those facts are correct at the time it 
did not even occur to you that that was the problem. 
20 
MS MBETE:   Not to the extent that I now know.  
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright.  In paragraph 23 of your 
affidavit you deal with something that has also been 
debated in quite some detail before the commission.  It is 
the problem of tracking resolutions.   
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 225 of 241 
 
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now the evidence of Mr Gordi if I recall 
correctly if you take SCOPA as an example but it would not 
be confined to SCOPA is that the Portfolio Committee 
prepares a report, submits the report to the House and then 
the ordinary course the House of Dots the reports of 
Portfolio Committees.  Are you with me so far? 
MS MBETE:  Pardon.  I am sorry Chairperson I .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he was just telling you what the 
evidence has revealed. 
10 
MS MBETE:  Of Mr Gordi 
CHAIRPERSON:  Revealed in terms of committees making 
resolutions and how they take them forward but the problem 
– one of the problems being to track whether they are 
implemented and so on by the executive.  Did I get that 
right Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair maybe it would be simpler if I 
repeat and (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And do it slowly. 
20 
MS MBETE:  Yes Mr Freund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Ms Mbete is it correct that it routinely 
happens that Portfolio Committees issue reports which are 
submitted to the National Assembly for consideration and 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 226 of 241 
 
adopted it is called appropriate.   
MS MBETE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And is it correct that that when those 
reports … 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was yes. 
MS MBETE:  Pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was yes. 
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your answer. Ja okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And is it correct that when those reports 
10 
contain proposals or recommendations or matters that need 
to be attended to the procedure is for the Speaker to convey 
that to the responsible Minister? 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now the allegation made by Mr Gordi 
butt similar allegations have been made elsewhere they are 
consistent for example with the evidence of the late Mr 
Makwetu the former Auditor General the allegation is that 
there was in place – there was no process in place to track 
and monitor to what extent if any Ministers responded to 
20 
such requirements or instructions or recommendations.  Is 
that factually accurate? 
MS MBETE:  It is true Chairperson.  Actually I believe the 
mechanism is still missing and in my brief interaction with Mr 
Frolick I did find that it is one of the areas in fact that I am 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 227 of 241 
 
also proposing must be strengthened, must receive attention. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And I think you address that if I can refer 
you to paragraph 25.1 of your affidavit, is that correct 
MS MBETE:  25? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Point 1 at page 992. 
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Where you say  
“I acknowledge that there may be areas with 
follow 
up 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
recommendations may be improved and I am 
10 
informed that there are steps being taken to 
address the situation.” 
MS MBETE:  Yes.  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV FREUND SC:  What is the understanding of the 
situation right now if any if you have any inside knowledge? 
MS MBETE:  Not in detail but I know it is receiving attention 
because it is the one place in the committee section that 
could do a lot to boost the capabilities of the committee 
section to help us with the oversight function of Parliament. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I want to change the subject again.  I do 
20 
not want belabour the point but I want to take you to 
paragraph 28.   
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You will see that this is the paragraph in 
which you deal with the issue of criticism of the lack of 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 228 of 241 
 
independence of the Speaker and I do not propose to get 
involved in the discussion about what you personal did or did 
not do when you were Speaker.  There was or was not any 
bias.  I do not think it would be constructive at all.   
But I would like to discuss with the principle and her 
in your case you served as Chairperson of the African 
National Congress.  You sat in on its meetings presumably of 
the NEC and you were a very active participating member of 
the ANC.   
Do you not think that the person who serves as 
10 
Speaker for the duration that he or she serves the Speaker 
should refrain from active involvement in the politics of the 
political party that appointed him or her? 
MS MBETE:  Chairperson it is not a point on which I can 
express you know violently strong views but I do not see that 
there is any problem with the current system we have.  We 
have had that system since Frene Ginwala our first Speaker 
we decided this is our system and it has worked very well.  
Because also Chairperson every MP from every party comes 
from a political party space that is why actually Parliament 
20 
itself makes specific arrangements for them to satisfy that 
particular role of the reality of them having come from 
competition between political parties and that competition in 
the elections results in the people that get – the number of 
people that get elected and they end up being the MP’s.   
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 229 of 241 
 
 
So that we must now pretend that this one person – I 
mean the very President themselves are President of their 
party.  Everybody comes there as a member of a political 
party but you get there and you learn how to play your role 
in a specific responsibility you get given in that space.   
 
So if you have to be the Chief Whip you are a Chief 
Whip from a party but you are also accepted and embraced 
as this person that coordinates the views of political parties 
represented by different Chief Whips. 
 
So sometimes suddenly somebody just pretends there 
10 
is a horrible thing happening.  A person who is a National 
Chairperson of a political party is also a Speaker if that – 
that way that is how it is everywhere in the world.  You come 
from a political party but you play a role and the question is 
are you playing your role according to the protocols of that 
role – of that office?  Are you playing your role according to 
the rules of the institution of that particular office?  And that 
is what guides a person who gets given the role of Speaker 
 
And I used to always say in Parliament do you know 
that if you were to put to me a President of the country 
20 
called F W De Klerk I would play my role as Speaker in 
relation to that President the very same way as I am playing 
for a President who comes from my political party because I 
understand the imperatives of the office I am in and the role 
I am playing when I am sitting in that chair. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 230 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a practical – okay.  At a practical level if 
there is an issue that your party has to deliberate on and 
take a position on and you are Speaker of the National 
Assembly and that issue is going to come before you and – 
and the deliberations you are part of the leadership of your 
party would you recuse yourself from those deliberations or 
would you be party to those deliberations and if you would 
be maybe irrespective of whether you would be part of the 
deliberations or not if you have to make a decision now 
wearing your hat as the Speaker but you know that your 
10 
party has taken a certain decision on the issue maybe you 
were part of the deliberations how does that work at a 
practical level?   
Is the position that there ought to be and maybe 
there is understanding that even if you are part of the 
deliberations when you are sitting there you are wearing a 
different cap and therefore you are free to decide as you see 
it and there should be no complaints from the party that you 
made that decision maybe which they might not like.  How 
would it – how does it work practically? 
20 
MS MBETE:  I do not know Chairperson whether you want us 
to go to the 8t h of August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want to. 
MS MBETE:  Because it is a specific event that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not touching anything. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 231 of 241 
 
MS MBETE:  You are not being specific I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not being specific. 
MS MBETE:  But I am saying your description sounds very 
much like it fits that occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am -… 
MS MBETE:  It is a difficult moment.  It is a very difficult 
moment but it is a moment for which if you have  been 
Speaker you have been playing every day because every day 
you have to apply the rules on members of Parliament.  Not 
political parties sitting in the House.   
10 
 
When you are presiding over the House you see 
individual members of Parliament who have rights are 
allowed 
opportunities 
by 
the 
rules 
and 
that 
is 
what 
determines how you see what is happening in that House at 
that moment. 
 
So that – because you have taken the oath remember 
so that oath is to your role as an impartial person not – in 
fact the first time I had to make a ruling over a MP who had 
done something and I had to do something drastic or chase 
them out of the House or something it was an ANC MP.  So 
20 
you cannot play the role of an impartial arbiter if you are 
seeing parties.  You must see ordinary individual members of 
Parliament who have rights in the House as people who have 
come to represent people out there. 
 
It has so happened Chairperson that in our lifetime it 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 232 of 241 
 
is one of those things that have happened in my own life, in 
my own role that I suddenly had to be in a space where there 
was this difficult choice of what position do I learned on as 
the Presiding Officer.  Not as a member of caucus.   
The fortunate thing is that as Speaker you hardly 
attend regular caucus meetings because the responsibilities 
you have on a regular basis are just so much that you will 
squeeze and make time and go all out to attend a particular 
caucus meeting of particular interest.   
Maybe there is one of the leaders whom maybe the 
10 
President is coming or the Deputy President or something 
like that but it is a difficult decision but you have to learn to 
play that role honestly to it – to the office.  No other 
consideration and that is what happens.   
And 
yes 
your 
neck 
can 
be 
chopped 
and 
that 
possibility is always there.  So as you take that position you 
know your neck. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am sure it cannot be an easy position.  
Thank you.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I know – I see that you – I think we 
have done more than two hours.  We could take a break or if 
we are close to finishing we could finish but we could take a 
break and then come back depending on how long. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I do not mind doing that I am in your 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 233 of 241 
 
hands.  I could finish quite quickly if you would like me try to 
do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as long as you do justice to … 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair I think five or ten minutes would 
probably – would probably do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that still be fine with you? 
MS MBETE:  It will be fine Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let us continue and finish 
then.  
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now Ms Mbete one of 
10 
the issues – one of the instruments of oversight to which you 
draw attention in paragraph 10.4 of your affidavit is 
questions and answers.   
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And you are clearly correct when you say 
that that is an oversight mechanism and you are clearly 
correct when you say it is a mechanism that is used and has 
been used.  But this commission has heard evidence of two 
types of problems in relation to questions and answers in the 
House.   
20 
There has been evidence of failure to submit answers 
within the time required or at all and that the evidence of 
questions that 
are 
simply 
evaded and 
never 
properly 
answered.  Could you comment on both those problems the 
delay issue and the evasion issue? 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 234 of 241 
 
MS MBETE:  Well with the delaying issue we would have to 
rely on our management to assist us in follow up.  We would 
also use the mechanism of the structure of three which 
involve 
the 
Deputy 
President 
who 
is 
the 
leader 
of 
government business, the Chief Whip and the Speaker.  We 
often put our heads together to deal with issues of that 
nature so that the Deputy President would take those issues 
to cabinet meetings and in fact apparently a lot of naming 
and shaming would obtain in that space through the leader of 
government business. 
10 
 
On the second one Mr Freund you were saying. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Evasion – the answers that are… 
MS MBETE:  The evasion yes. That one that you really 
created a lot of tension between me in the Chair and 
probable 
the 
members 
of 
the 
opposition 
have 
been 
complaining about that here.  
 
But the point is you cannot determine the words – the 
choice of words of a Minister or a member of the Executive.  
You cannot choose their answers for them.  And yes I 
probably agree with this MP who is complaining but they 
20 
would kind of want to force me into a corner of determining 
and choosing the words for someone whose answer – 
supposed to answer the question which my answer would be 
please ask a follow up question.  Find another mechanism of 
pursuing the matter but there is nothing I can do about the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 235 of 241 
 
fact that the Honourable member has answered and in an 
unsatisfactory way as far as you are concerned I accept that 
maybe but it is not a matter that is in my hands to determine. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well Ms Mbete I fully understand you. 
MS MBETE:  Pardon. 
ADV FREUND SC:  I fully understand you when you say that 
the person who puts the question cannot dictate to the 
answer of what – what form of words the person answering 
will use.  That is obviously correct.  But is there not a 
difference between the way in which it is answered and 
10 
whether it is answered in truth at all and does the Speaker 
not bear a responsibility to ensure that the question is in fact 
answered and I have the impression that you do not accept 
that. So could you clarify your views? 
MS MBETE:  Chairperson I think as I am sad to expect the 
Speaker to pre-empt an answer.  The Speaker receives the 
questions so that you – you apply your mind on them.  They 
are – whether they are questions that are said to the person 
to whom they are being posed or perhaps they ought to be 
directed elsewhere and those kinds of things.   
20 
 
So – but to try and get the Presiding Officer into a 
role that they are actually not involved in because I am not 
in the executive.  I simply am ensuring that they respond 
here to issues that are being raised in Parliament.  To then 
want the Speaker to go beyond that I think is unfair. 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 236 of 241 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me put it this way.  Are you saying 
that even where as the Speaker having listened to the 
question and having listened to the answer it is clear to you 
that the – say man or Minister has manifestly avoided the 
question and therefore has not answered the question the 
Speaker has no role to play or are you saying where it is 
manifestly clear that the question has not been answered the 
Minister has avoided to answer the questions the Speaker 
has a role to play to say Minister you have not answered the 
questions or – and but where there may be an argument 
10 
whether it is – he has answered – she has answered or she 
has not then the Speaker should rather not get involved. 
MS MBETE:  Actually Chairperson the Speaker must not be 
thrust into that space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Into – at all. 
MS MBETE:  It is an unfair – it is an unfair role to try to 
make a Presiding Officer to determine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS 
MBETE: 
 
Whether 
the 
question 
is 
answered 
satisfactorily.  It is not of them to determine that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MBETE:  They must ensure that they are presiding and 
the executive is there to answer the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MBETE:  But to say now you must figure out and I mean 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 237 of 241 
 
who determines what is fair and what is not fair.  And most of 
the time members of the executive want to give the 
information.  So they welcome the opportunity to come to the 
House 
and 
answer 
questions 
by 
way 
of 
putting 
that 
information 
before 
Parliament 
and 
before 
the 
public 
representatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying that the remedy of the 
member of Parliament who is not satisfied with the answer is 
to ask a follow up question? 
MS MBETE:  To ask a follow up question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and not ask the Speaker to… 
MS MBETE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To rule on whether the question – the 
answer is a proper answer or not.  Okay Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well I – I want to just explore that a little 
further because as I understand your own evidence the right 
to ask questions and the right – the right to ask questions is 
part of the oversight structures and the structures by which 
Parliament discharges its constitutional obligations to ensure 
that the executive is accountable to it.  Now if the Speaker 
20 
can see that the executive is not answering the questions 
does the Speaker not have a responsibility to hold the 
executive to account?  And when the Speaker can see that a 
question is not being answered surely a duty does rest on 
the Speaker to require a question to be answered.  Absent 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 238 of 241 
 
that there can be no accountability. 
MS MBETE:  Chairperson I am strongly not agreeing with the 
notion of saying the Speaker can tell.  Who says the Speaker 
can tell?  The Speaker is there – has made sure that the 
questions got to the executive.  The executive has come to 
the House is answering the questions why must you now put 
the Speaker into that space of determining what is right and 
the extent to which it is right?  I cannot know.  You cannot 
know and you must not put the Speaker in a position where 
the Speaker must determine because the Speaker’s interest 
10 
is the information coming.  That is what the Speaker is 
interested in.  If the member is not satisfied let them follow 
the matter up not drag the Presiding Officer into that space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Finally Ms Mbete – Chair unless you 
wanted to ask a question on that issue?  Finally I just want 
to take you very briefly to the events of the 8 t h of August 
2017.  I do not think that there is any factual controversy – I 
do not think there is anything which we really need much 
evidence but the situation as I understand is that you were 
20 
as a result of the judgment of the Constitutional Court made 
aware that you had a discretion to exercise as to whether the 
ballot would be secret or not.  You exercised that discretion 
by saying it would be secret on that particular occasion and 
if I am not mistaken I think you even went further but this I 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 239 of 241 
 
would like you to confirm to say that members should not 
suffer adverse consequences for voting in accordance with 
what they took to be their duties.  Am I right in everything I 
have put to you there? 
 MS MBETE:  I think so.  I think that was put into – I cannot 
now firmly say we – I determined that but I know that it was 
the condition we were interested to ensure that the MP’s felt 
free to exercise their own choice in the matter. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  Chair I have no further 
questions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can – I think it is likely that it is true 
that you – you went further as Mr Freund suggests because 
the Constitutional Court judgment which obviously would 
have studied and received advise on 
MS MBETE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was to that effect as far as I recall.   
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
That 
there 
should 
be 
no 
adverse 
consequences to members of Parliament who decide to vote 
in a certain way. 
20 
MS MBETE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MBETE:  It is true.  I remember now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You remember now.  Yes.  Ja.  Ja.  Okay 
Mr Freund has finished his questions.  I do not have any 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397 
 
Page 240 of 241 
 
further questions. 
MS MBETE:  Are you sure Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Ms Mbete do not tempt fate I have got 
(inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not tempt him. 
MS MBETE: Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I just want to confirm with your 
counsel that he has nothing – Mr Semenya? 
ADV SEMENYA SC:  I do not have any questions Chair thank 
you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you.  Thank you very 
much Ms Mbete. 
MS MBETE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We appreciate that you availed yourself 
even in the evening. 
MS MBETE:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To come and assist the commission.  
MS MBETE:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  I just want to once 
again thank everybody who has made it possible for the 
20 
commission to sit this evening – the staff, technicians, of 
course Ms Mbete and the legal team and the legal team and 
Mr Freund and everybody thank you to all of you.  We will 
now adjourn and tomorrow I will be hearing evidence relating 
to Eskom during the day.  That is just for the benefit of the 
18 MAY 2021 – DAY 397

public.   
We adjourn.
