PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 26 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Petersen, good morning everybody. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have had the opportunity of reading the 
replying affidavit.  Do you want to just deal with the replying affidavit a 
bit Mr Petersen? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes certainly Chair.  I do not know what you 
envisage for this hearing.  I anticipated that it might be important to – 
10 
since this is being broadcast and it is a public session that those 
listening to and observing this hearing should know a little bit more 
about what it entails.  So I am ready subject to your directions to go 
through the essence of the submissions that I want to make to deal with 
the opposing affidavit and to deal with the replying affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not mind if you want to take five minutes saying 
what you want to say and in the process address whatever you might 
wish to address on the replying affidavit.  Let me say this immediately 
so that also Mr Madonsela can know what is going on in my mind so 
that when he is – rises he knows what to address.  Subject to 
20 
something that I must just check in the replying affidavit and that is 
why I want you to just deal with the replying affidavit.  Subject to that 
and me finding that there is no problem in terms of what I am thinking I 
am inclined to grant some order.  The Notice of Motion that is – has 
been put up might not reflect what I have in mind but I am inclined to 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 3 of 191 
 
grant some order to allow this witness to give evidence without any risk 
of his cover being blown as he puts it.   Exactly what the terms would 
be we can look at that but in principle I am inclined to that.  Obviously 
that is subject to argument that may be addressed to me.  I remain 
open but when I was in practice I always found that it was very helpful 
if the judge indicates what he is thinking rather than you addressing all 
kinds of issues and you are addressing issues that the judge really has 
no interest in.  So – so I give you five minutes to address me on 
whatever you want to address me on and – but in the process deal with 
– tell me more about what you have to say about the replying affidavit.  
10 
You will remember that last time I did say that the Minister’s point in 
his opposing affidavit that this witness has given evidence in a 
disciplinary inquiry without doing so in camera was a point that needed 
a response.  It looks like the replying affidavit does deal with that but I 
read it once and I just need to have to a look but as you address me I 
will listen but that is the inclination.  Okay? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I other words I – I do not want us to take too long 
on this matter.  We have oral evidence – I have oral evidence to listen 
to so – but I will be fair to both parties. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair as you are aware I have prepared and put 
before you a draft order around which my submissions will be based 
and the terms of that differ in important particulars from the prayers 
sort in the Notice of Motion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know whether you are talking about a 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 4 of 191 
 
separate draft order because I have not seen a separate draft order. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It is in the bundle – it is in the bundle KK1.4 
and it is the first item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Notice of Application? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:    No this is the draft order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does it appear? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It appears in Exhibit KK1.4 that is the bundle 
marked 1.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And it is item 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And that was drafted with the hope of saving 
time and allowing me to focus my submissions without as you say going 
off in all directions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just looking at the terms of the draft order.  I had 
not seen it before.  I think on the face of it most of the – the order 
appears to present me with no problem subject to what Mr Madonsela 
might have to say and subject to hearing argument.   
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That being so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I propose then to concentrate if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  On the grounds of objection which have been 
raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 5 of 191 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And the response to those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And that may leave little or nothing necessary 
to say in reply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  At this stage however I do not know what the 
submissions will be that Mr Baloyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  May wish to make on behalf of General 
Mphego. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I guess you… 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And I may need to deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All you can do is address those points that he makes 
from the opposing affidavit. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I have – may I proceed?  Four grounds of 
opposition to an in camera hearing have been advanced by General 
Cele. 
1. The first in paragraphs 7 to13 of his affidavit – shall I give you 
20 
the bundle reference as I go? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you may give me the bundle references but if 
you – well if you give me the heading of the objection or the – in a very 
… 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 6 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Crisp point to say this is the one objection, this is the 
– another one, this is another one then you address them each. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will do even if you do not refer to the – to the 
bundles. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And I have prepared submissions on the basis 
that they should be concise as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And at the same time not leave any loose ends.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Again I will be guided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  By what you want to hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And the first objection is that Colonel Naidoo 
while under witness protection has previously testified and I quote “In 
the open” during a SAPS disciplinary hearing into the conduct of Major 
General Lazarus held from 2012 to 2013.   
20 
In response Colonel Naidoo has stated that in fact quote 
“those proceedings were not open to the public and were only attended 
by the participants in the proceedings and legal teams together with a 
number of persons from witness protection”. 
The risk of exposing his new identity and location under 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 7 of 191 
 
witness protection was in that context I submit minimal.  Quite different 
are the proceedings of this commission which is I would happily 
develop if there were more time. These proceedings are required to be 
held in public unless there is reason for the Chairperson in his 
discretion to order otherwise 
The risk of exposing Colonel Naidoo in this context is 
qualitative quite different and I submit has to be taken very seriously 
indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will tell what my understanding of the – of Colonel 
Naidoo’s concern is and you must just tell me if that is your 
10 
understanding too. 
 
My understanding and having regard to the opposing affidavit 
and the replying affidavit.  My understanding is that both Colonel 
Naidoo and the Minister – oh – let me put this way. I am inclined to 
think both Colonel Naidoo and the Minister know each other or at least 
have met.  But they might not have met.  Even if they might not have 
met it seems to me that the – the Ministers knows who Colonel Naidoo 
is.  That is the one point. 
 
But also it is quite clear from the opposing affidavit and the 
replying affidavit that many if not all the persons implicated by Colonel 
20 
Naidoo know who Colonel Naidoo is.  And Naidoo knows that they know 
him.   
 
Therefore from that point of view Colonel Naidoo cannot be 
asking for an order that would conceal his – who he is to the implicated 
persons.  But his concern it seems to me is that the public and other 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 8 of 191 
 
people other than those who are implicated who he knows know him the 
public and other people should not know who he is. 
 
That is my understanding of his concern.  So – so that is why 
he talks about – that is why he says he does not want his cover to be 
blown.  And if he has given evidence in a disciplinary inquiry when 
those implicated persons were there they know – they know who he is. 
 
But as I understand it his concern is I do not want the public to 
know – to connect the face to Colonel Naidoo.  That is what I do not 
want.  That is what I understand his case to be.  Because if that 
happens then – then the public or certain people who know where I live 
10 
will then connect the face that they know by a different name to Colonel 
Naidoo.  And say – oh this is Colonel Naidoo and he does not want 
because of what it will entail for him. 
 
But he also says if that happens namely his cover is blown 
implicated person it will not be difficult for the implicated persons to 
find out where he lives now and that would put his life in danger. 
 
So if I am correct in that analysis it seems to me that as far as 
implicated – the implicated persons are concerned he knows that they 
know him – they know who – they know the face of the Colonel Naidoo 
that we are talking about but he does not want them to know where he 
20 
lives because that might put him in danger.   
 
But as far as the public is concerned he says they do not know 
that Colonel Naidoo particularly where he now lives they do not know 
that Colonel Naidoo is the person that they know by another name and 
he does not want that to happen because if his face is shown or if 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 9 of 191 
 
newspaper is right and show his picture and so on then those people 
will then say oh this person referred to as Colonel Naidoo is actually 
the person we know by this other name and that would blow his cover. 
 
So is my analysis – does my analysis accord with your 
analysis? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair what you have said captures the 
essential object. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Of this application as I have evaluated it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And on the basis of which my submissions were 
prepared and the draft order was prepared in substance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I would not want to go so far as to say that all 
the and there are no fewer than 45 people to whom Rule 3.3 Notices 
were issued. I would not want to go so far as to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of them… 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That all of them have seen him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And therefore I cannot quantify in my 
20 
submissions to you what the risk may be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Of additional persons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Coming to see him. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 10 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And as far as the Minister of Police is 
concerned first I want to just emphasise that this application is not 
about the Minister of Police.  It is about the protection of the witness.  
And one has to take into account the number of implicated people.  By 
implicated people if I may just clarify? It means people who are or may 
be implicated by the evidence of the witness.   
 
I do not draw the conclusion from the papers that the Minister 
who was Commissioner of Police has ever set eyes on Colonel Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Mr…Yes. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Or visa versa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is possible.  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And he himself emphasises in his reply that 
nowhere does he say in his evidence that he saw the General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so he might not have met him. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is – that is possible.  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But to the extent that the – one is dealing here 
with an assessment of risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Of exposure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In connection with the witness protection 
program.  There would be very little additional risk if the Minister of 
Police were to see whether it is his face or a photograph so he is going 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 11 of 191 
 
– oh no I do not know him or yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But that is not essential to the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And I must emphasise that the – if one goes 
through there is not time but I would happily take you through the Rule 
3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In relation to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That there is no direct evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Where Colonel Naidoo says I saw or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I directly overheard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And that – that rather changes the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So – but to confirm that the – the essence of 
the problem is the one that you Chair have articulated. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But there is a dual purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In the – this application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 12 of 191 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And in the formulation of the proposed draft 
order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Which is to maintain and protect the public’s 
right to information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.; 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And the media’s role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In facilitating the constitutional guarantee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Of freedom of expression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Which includes freedom of information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And freedom of the media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So one is – one has to address the practical 
difficulties of conducting a hearing where the public have the access 
which they ought rightly to have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And where the implicated persons none of 
whom have as yet – they still may – none of whom have as yet taken 
steps in terms of Rule 3.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  To make a statement challenging the content of 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 13 of 191 
 
the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And applying to cross-examine.  That may 
happen. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But it is to the extent that one is thinking 
hypothetically of what may happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It is difficult to see how one would manage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  The combination of allowing the public to – to 
observe the proceedings and have the potentially the 45 implicated 
people in another room with Colonel Naidoo.  So I would therefore 
persist in order to achieve the appropriate balance between witness 
protection and the protection which not only does the policy of the 
constitution but I have no doubt the policy of the commission is 
determined to ensure that implicated persons have a fair opportunity to 
challenge evidence which is adverse to them 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is – that is fine.  You did say 
something that goes to a question now I was going to raise namely to 
20 
the extent that an implicated person might wish to see the face of 
Colonel Naidoo wherever he will be testifying from is there difficulty 
with that?  Well there – the – there should not be a difficulty with 
regard to those implicated persons that Colonel Naidoo also knows they 
know him I would imagine.  But I do not know with regard to those that 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 14 of 191 
 
might not know him. But are you able to say anything about that? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes.  Yes I would suggest that there are two 
aspects to this which it would be helpful to distinguish.  One is seeing 
his face for the purpose of recognising that this is the person.  The 
other would be observing him during his evidence where the argument 
is put forward that demeanour is fundamentally important to fairness.  I 
do want to make a short submission on that – that aspect or on both 
aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  On the first one I would imagine and one has to 
10 
use imagination here.  I would imagine that it could depend upon the 
implicated person concerned answering the question to you – has he or 
she set eyes on Colonel Naidoo before?  If the answer to that is yes 
then it seems to me there could be no serious security problem in 
allowing that image to be refreshed.  If the answer is not then the next 
question would be – why do you need it now?  And it occurs to me that 
you may if you are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – the one who – is the position that the one 
who does not know him might be the one who might have a stronger 
reason to want to see him.  Because he may say I see this person that I 
20 
do not know makes all kinds of allegations against me but I actually 
have no idea who this person is and I do not know who this Colonel 
Naidoo is.  But if I were to see to his face I might recognise him. -  Oh 
this is – this the person I did not know his name is Colonel Naidoo and 
then I am in a better position to answer the allegations because now I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 15 of 191 
 
can – I know the person – I can connect the person. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  My submission in response to that would be 
that that – that conceivably is a practical necessity that could arise and 
that is why I suggest and I have got another suggestion to attach to 
that.  Why I suggest that the question should be answered what is it 
that makes it necessary for you to see him now?  Because in preparing 
even if the response under Rule 3.4 has not yet been finalised and 
delivered in the course of preparing such a response that implicated 
person could surely be expected to articulate what it is in the content 
of the implicating evidence.  All of which has been provided in the Rule 
10 
3.3 Notices.  What is it about the content which I have difficulty 
responding to because I have not seen Colonel Naidoo?  And so it may 
be that you would be disposed if you are inclined to follow the draft 
order in most respects.  If you look at – at paragraph 2 of the draft 
order which allows for a variation but the circumstances that are 
mentioned there are perhaps too narrow.  They deal with if in your 
opinion Chair circumstances warrant a variation to ensure the 
protection of Naidoo or any other person in connection with Naidoo’s 
evidence.  But the circumstances which have just been hypothesized 
could provide another ground for a particular and ad-hoc variation 
20 
which could be catered for by rewording of two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the variation part should be formulated in such 
a way that it says I may vary the order - vary or amend the order in 
such way as I may consider necessary.  In such was as I may deem 
necessary and I am saying necessary in the context … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 16 of 191 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of necessary in balancing the various interests.  The 
interests for the protection of the witness and the interest of trying to 
limit any infringement of or interference with an implicated person’s 
right in one way or another to the absolute minimum.  So that - that 
kind of balance that is what I am having in mind … 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe that (intervenes). 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  May I suggest - may I suggest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Formulation might be - might be okay as well. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I would - I would propose that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  As much as possible of the detail of the 
wording … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Of two - paragraph two should be retained 
because there is the protection of Naidoo or any other person in 
connection with his evidence.  I - I am not sure what is going to come 
out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It may need some special order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is wide. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Or to ensure fairness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  To implicated - to any implicated persons. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 17 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  That - that is the kind of thing.  So - so 
what it would mean is that if I grant this order then at any stage - at 
any stage in the future while Colonel Naidoo is giving evidence or if he 
- if I grant leave to - for somebody to cross-examine him in the future I 
can mero motu or on application by an implicated person amend it 
where I consider that it is necessary to do so for purposes of fairness 
to all concerned. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That - that is my submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Now the - the other aspect was demeanour. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I must just say - tell you that I am on my 
23 r d year as a Judge and I cannot recall one time when I decided any 
case on the basis of demeanour.  That is - that is what I can tell you.  I 
cannot remember - maybe there is one or two but I have no recollection 
in all these 23 years - 22 and a half years - of having decided a case 
with any - with - on the basis of placing a high - higher regard on 
demeanour. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chairperson may I just add one point to that.  
With all due respect and with no similar experience so whatever I am 
less confident that demeanour is never a factor. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well I have - I have no doubt that in - I have no 
doubt that there are - there are maybe some Presiding Officers maybe - 
I do not know whether I should say maybe more in the lower courts than 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 18 of 191 
 
the High Courts but maybe everywhere but I know also of a number of 
Judges who - who would speak in the same way. 
Is to say demeanour you know is such a - a difficult thing 
particularly in our multicultural - multiracial society you know.  It is - it 
is not a … 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot of us or some of us do not find it easy to rely on 
that - on that.  Usually there is more than enough in terms of 
probabilities to decide a case. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  To be fair to the Minister … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  He was dealing with a notice of application… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Which asked for the witness’ voice to be 
distorted as well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  As his face to be concealed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In the draft order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  You would have seen that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I am not persisting with that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Indeed. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 19 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I - I think that that is unnecessary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  To the extent that it would be wrong … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And - and secondly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That Colonel Naidoo himself said in his 
supporting affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That he does not mind … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  If his voice is heard … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And protection … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  His protectors are satisfied … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  With the arrangements that are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  They have been met. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Envisaged in the draft order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Something that has not been easy to achieve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  The practicalities … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 20 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But - but my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It seems to me it is quite important if I just add 
this on (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That - that the Minister has invoked findings in 
the disciplinary proceedings that took place some years ago which were 
presided over by Mr Pretorius SC and - and that he made certain 
adverse or cautionary findings in relation to the evidence of 
10 
Colonel Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has the matter - for interest did Mr Pretorius rely on 
demeanour? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  There - there - I can find - I can - that is 
exactly my point.  I can find nothing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  In his findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That suggest that they relied in anyway … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  On demeanour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair is there any other aspect …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Unless you have - unless you … 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Is there any other aspect which you would like 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 21 of 191 
 
me to address now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I think I am - I am keen to hear 
Mr Madonsela now.  Thank you. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Madonsela you - you have the benefit of knowing 
what is going on in my mind. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  A substantial part of the interaction 
which Chairperson has had with my learned friend has taken out of my 
10 
argument set in steel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That I was coming to this Chairperson 
- to this Commission with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In principle we have no objection to 
the augmented or amended draft order save in relation to two aspects 
which have been raised during the interaction with my learned friend … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And - and those conditions are mainly 
20 
in relation to whatever the order should be - whatever the order should 
be in relation to the in camera proceedings.  We submit for the reasons 
which I will advance in a moment that it should accommodate or permit 
the implicated persons as well as the legal representatives to see him 
because they have already done so in the past and secondly that 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 22 of 191 
 
whatever the - the embargo or the - the in camera order should contain 
it should sanction as well that any response given by the implicated 
persons to the allegations made against them should similarly be 
embargoed to the extent that it may blow cover to those individuals who 
are referred to in the statements of Colonel Naidoo.  Those are the two 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that - that is similar - that is very important I 
think. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Those are the two - those the two 
connections which we would like to place to any amended order. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just go back to the first one.  Let me just hear 
the first one. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  The first one is that an amended order 
should permit the implicated persons and the legal representatives 
representing them to be able to see … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Colonel Naidoo … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  When he testifies.  At some point when 
he … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some point. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  At some point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not necessarily to be there throughout … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The testimony but at least to see his face and then - 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 23 of 191 
 
so that they - they know the - the face. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That this is the person who is 
testifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  As you said for the position of the 
Minister … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  He meets so many Naidoo’s in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Chairperson you know that …. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  There are so many Naidoo’s in Durban 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And he was a National Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are also a lot of Zondo’s and Madonsela’s. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And Madonsela’s; and he was the 
Head of the National … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Police Services.  There could be so 
20 
many Naidoo’s (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  He wants … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  He wants to just be certain in his 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 24 of 191 
 
response … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  But I am actually talking about the 
very man … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That is testifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  At the very least. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must say that when I have read his affidavit that - 
the Minister’s affidavit or opposing affidavit it gave me the impression 
10 
that - that he was talking about somebody that he knew but somewhere 
else in the affidavit he seemed to suggest - to give the impression that 
he did not know him. 
So - so - but it may be that it is - it is the way he was talking 
about Colonel Naidoo’s testimony at the disciplinary hearing.  It was as 
if it was somebody that he knows but I - I accept that he does not know 
him you know but I am - I am just linking that to what I said earlier on 
you know.  It had given me that impression but I - I accept that he says 
he does not know him. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Well no the position of the Minister is 
20 
that he may know him.  He may not know him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  He just wants to ascertain this very 
fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Which - which - and he just wants to see the face 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 25 of 191 
 
and be able to say oh it is somebody I know or it is not somebody that I 
do not know? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  So that is - that is the first point and 
the second one you - just articulate the second - second one. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  The - the second one is that if any 
embargo or in camera order is to be granted it should also or similarly 
apply to the responses given by the implicated persons.  Certainly the 
Minister insofar as it may blow the cover … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Of those … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Who are connected with the responses 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That he is giving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA: 
 
Because 
it 
would 
be 
unfair 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To allow Naidoo to publically indulge 
in the slander of implicated persons under the curtain of secrecy.  They 
want it to be built around him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  The fairness must dictate that if he 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 26 of 191 
 
wants to do that if he wants secrecy to be given to some - to him as a 
cooperative as a member of the Intelligence at the time.  Similar 
protection should be given to those who are involved in the entire 
activities of the Intelligence Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I am not sure if I follow the second point and I 
want to make sure I do.  I thought what you were saying earlier on was 
that an amended order should also say something to the effect that in 
whatever the Minister or his legal representative may say maybe by - if 
- if he is granted leave to cross-examine - maybe I am not sure. 
They must be careful not to say anything that might blow the 
10 
witness’ cover.  I - I thought that - that is what you were saying.  Was I 
right? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  You are right.  That and also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  The cover of those people who were 
connected with the activities in relation to which Naidoo testifies about 
in his Rule 3.3 Notices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  It may be that what you are talking about 
is what we did last week in regard to Colonel Roelofse.  When 
Colonel Roelofse was testifying and a lot of people he was testifying 
20 
about were in the Crime Intelligence Department or unit of the SAPS.  
He was implicated a number of people. 
Some of whom could be agents and I think at that stage there 
was no certainty who was an agent, who is not an agent.  Rule 3.3 
Notices had been sent to them and it was decided that in his evidence 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 27 of 191 
 
and in his statement he would not refer to them by their names.  He 
would - he would give each one of them a number. 
I think there was for example F1, F8, F6, F whatever.  So - 
but the names were provided to me in a sealed envelope where at some 
stage I could have a look and see who is F1, who is F8, who and so on 
but that was on the basis that an approach has been made to the 
relevant authorities by the Commission’s legal team to say of these 
names tell us who should really be protected you know but until we 
know who is - should not be protected we will protect everybody but - 
so I - is that the kind of thing you have in mind? 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That is the kind of thing we have in 
mind Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  We - we base that on - on the 
contention which I - I wanted to make later that there is an inevitability 
in the evidence of Naidoo … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That in response … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA: 
 A 
cover 
of 
certain 
Intelligence 
20 
Services operatives will have to be blown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Yes, but … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Is that protection that we want to say 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are - are you now - is what you are saying going 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 28 of 191 
 
as far as saying when those implicated persons come to give evidence 
they should also be afforded the same kind of arrangements in terms of 
in camera here? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Of course … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what we should do - let us not decide that now 
because that is not before me … 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if and when a person who is implicated wants to 
give evidence and they want the same arrangement then they can bring 
a similar application and then it can be considered.  Ja, but I think we 
note what you have said and I think it is important but I think it is - they 
would have to bring an application the right time and - and then it must 
be considered. 
Other people must get a chance to oppose if they want to 
oppose and then a decision can be taken. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes.  I wil - I will say very little about 
20 
demeanour because - because much of what has been said is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Applies to you as well? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Well Chairperson I thin - I suspect the 
reason why demeanour has not featured very prominently in your 
judicial life is probably because of the nature of the proceedings in 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 29 of 191 
 
which you presided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  There - there may be adversarial 
proceedings.  These are inquisitorial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  They somehow depend on the truth or 
the truthfulness of the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Demeanour might chip in.  This is 
precisely the position here because of the cagey responses that Naidoo 
10 
has given in the affidavits which are currently before you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In relation to - you remember in the 
founding affidavit he said Cele arrived and I was there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  What was - that was meant to allow 
you the Chairperson to draw an inference that they may have seen each 
other. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Now in - in reply he says no well I am 
actually not - I must clarify myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  I did not see Cele. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 30 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  So all that he is talking about is pure 
hearsay from people who saw Cele on some other occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To the extent that this Chairperson 
could have drawn - could have drawn on the evidence that he has given 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In the 3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  It could easily have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That an inference could be drawn 
against Cele … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  On the allegations he has made 
because of the impression that was created in those - in those 
affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I - I understand that but I understand you to 
be saying you do not want also to rely much on demeanour.  Am I right? 
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because - well you do not have to - you do not have 
to waive any - any right to rely on it but I am - I am just saying I mean 
demeanour is about how - it is about saying when this witness was 
asked this question I saw how he was shaken or he looked down or that 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 31 of 191 
 
kind of thing. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Well demeanour is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You know so … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but I - I think - I think in order to save time 
because I think what you have done is you have made clear that you 
are not opposed to the granting of the amended order.  You have raised 
two points which you - you - I think the - the second one relates to 
other people really and I have said when they want similar 
arrangements they will apply and then we will consider it. 
10 
So it seems to me that it goes back to saying you - it is - it is 
one point you - you really are concerned about.  Otherwise you do not 
have any quarrel with the amended order and the point is about an 
opportunity for the Minister and it may be that - it maybe that one 
would not make it blanket to everybody …. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As such because maybe for some people it might be 
appropriate to grant it.  Maybe for others I am not sure but your - your 
concern is that at some stage or another the Minister - you would ask 
that the order should be such as to allow the Minister to see his face? 
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So I think let me hear what Mr Petersen has to 
say about that.  If there is nothing further that you want - you would 
like to say. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  I just wanted to - to qualify the issue 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 32 of 191 
 
about demeanour to say that we are not really pitching our - our case 
on demeanour per se. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  We pitching our case on credibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Precisely because this very witness - 
this very Colonel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Has been found to be an incredible 
witness in proceedings before … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And more importantly by the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA: 
 
Evidence 
leader 
of 
this 
very 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say incredible? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Credibility yes.  Credibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  He was found … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was disbelieved.  He was (intervenes). 
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  He was found dishonest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA: 
 
No 
not 
incredible. 
 
Excitingly 
incredible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 33 of 191 
 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That is dishonest.  That is - that is the 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To the extent that in the future we 
intend … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And we will cross that river when we 
come to it.  To cross-examine witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA: 
 
To 
- 
to 
cross-examine 
Naidoo 
10 
depending on whether we are given an opportunity to do that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  But his evidence might very well turn 
on his credibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Which we would like to attack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Given what has happened before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  May - maybe what we would - maybe what we 
will do is - I will hear what Mr Petersen has to say about the issue of 
20 
the order being amended in such a way that either implicated persons 
can see him just to see his face as opposed to observing him 
throughout his giving of evidence as I understand it. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  See his face or whether we should simply work on the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 34 of 191 
 
basis that to the extent that any implicated person might wish to be 
allowed to see his face at any particular time.  Let that request be 
made at the right time and it be considered then and we - we take it 
from there. 
In other words we do not exclude the possibility of granting 
that but we say let it be dealt with on - each one let - let each one be 
dealt with on its merits. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Petersen. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair I do not know if you wish to hear 
10 
Mr Baloyi first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh has he got some submissions.  I am sorry.  I 
forgot about him.  Mr Baloyi. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Thank - thank you very much Chair.  Chair, 
I - my submissions are going to be very brief.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Chair, I - I represent General Mphego. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  He is one of the implicated persons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Chair our submissions and my client’s main 
worries are that it is essential for him to be able to put a face of 
General Naidoo to his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  It is quite crucial … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 35 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  And - and as you are aware Chair it - it 
might help to unravel whatever that can be unravelled … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  For - for him to be able to apply for cross-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  So Judge we do not have a problem with 
the proposed draft order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  For as long as our client will be permitted 
to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  To put a face to this evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and … 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Judge that is the main - that is main crux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in that event you do not mind whether it is a 
question of your client being allowed to see him in person or being 
given his picture or do you mind - in other words if you are given a 
picture to say this is him.  Would that be okay? 
20 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Judge I - I think it will be important for your 
client to see Mr Naidoo in person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  It - it will be very crucial … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 36 of 191 
 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  For us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think I am - I am inclined to - to say let - let 
the order be such that you are able - any person - any implicated 
person is able to make an application at the right time to see him and I 
would then decide it - decide each application or request on its merits.  
I am inclined that we do it that way because there may be some who 
make out a good case and there may be others who might not make out 
a good case. 
So - so I think that should accommodate you because it gives 
you time - an opportunity later on to then bring such an application. 
10 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Judge I - I agree.  It may well be so.  As 
long as that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  That our client’s rights are reserved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  To be able to - to see the face of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Of Mr Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  That - that will be in order Judge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV KGAUGELO BALOYI:  Pleases the court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Petersen.  Oh Mr Madonsela you want 
to … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA: 
 
Before 
the 
- 
before 
the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 37 of 191 
 
Mr Rob Petersen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Replies.  There is a matter which has 
been raised by my junior Mr Mlaba here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Which may be of some importance if - 
if it is - it carries some weight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Attention has been drawn to the 
provisions of Section 15(1) … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Of the Witness Protection Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Which I would like to read into the 
record.  It says: 
“In any civil proceedings in which a protected 
person is a party or a witness may subject to sub 
section two be proceeded with in terms of the law 
regulating such proceedings.” 
Aand sub section two says: 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  “If it appears to a Judge …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  “…of a High Court in an ex 
parte application made to him or her in chambers by 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 38 of 191 
 
a Director.  That safety …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  By …? 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  By a Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  “That safety of any protected 
person might be endangered by the institution or 
prosecution of any civil proceedings in which the 
protected person is a party as a witness and 
proceedings …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  “…is defined in the Act to 
include also …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  “…Commissions of Inquiry 
…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  “…appointed in terms of an 
act of Parliament.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  What - what my learned junior … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Has drawn to my attention is that in 
these proceedings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  The application for a protected person 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 39 of 191 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To be placed in camera … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Has not been brought at the instance 
of a Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In fact the Director does make mention 
of the fact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  That he has no problems with the - 
safeguarding the safety of the witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh, huh-uh. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And it might very well be that that 
consideration is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Fundamental … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To the - to the outcome of the 
application because at paragraph 34 … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Of the founding affidavit Naidoo does 
in fact make it clear that he - his safety been assured by those who are 
taking care of him in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 40 of 191 
 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In this protection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  So it may very well be that this 
application ought to have properly being brought … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  At the instance of a Director who is 
defined … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In the Act itself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  And to the extent that it has been 
brought at the instance of Naidoo himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Whose credibility is at stake … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In these proceedings.  It might very 
well undermine the very instance of the truth of what - of which 
underpins this application.  I thought we should bring that to the 
attention of the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  So that it might feature (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think - I think that is important.  It may well 
be - I have no doubt that the - that the Director is - is aware or I think 
he should - he would be aware of the application and I have no doubt 
that he would support it because it maybe that if there is nothing 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 41 of 191 
 
indicating that he - what his position is - it maybe that a document may 
be obtained from him that says something like I am in full support … 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the application, ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  It may be critical to 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  To legal purity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I agree.  I agree.  Thank you very 
10 
much. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Petersen. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I would like to begin with the last point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am trying to look where my look … 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To find where the Act is. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  KK1.4 item 3 is the Witness Protection Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are too many of these files.  I think there 
should be - all of these things should be put in one big lever arch file 
20 
with dividers if possible.  Yes.  I have - I have got the Act.  So we go to 
paragraph - Section 15? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:   Yes, but just before I go there Chair, the 
definition of proceedings, that’s on paginated page 15 in the red 
numbering means, any criminal proceedings, proceedings before a 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 42 of 191 
 
Commission etcetera, so clearly it is correct as my learned friend said 
that these are proceedings but if we go to Section 18 before we come 
to Section 15 
CHAIRPERSON:  Section 18? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes that’s on paginated page 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Notwithstanding any other law the presiding 
officer at any proceedings or at civil proceedings.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So it appears that civil proceedings could be 
10 
specially referred to.  Civil proceedings don’t embrace all proceedings.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:   So then if we go to Section 15 that’s paginated 
page 26, Section 15 is especially dedicated to civil proceedings.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And my submission is that it doesn’t apply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it looks like your submission is that the 
circumstances where an application for – in criminal proceedings 
should be brought by the Director are circumstances where we are 
talking about civil proceedings. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Exactly formal civil proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I see the heading is, Civil Proceedings in which 
[indistinct] person is a party or witness. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:   Yes and then in sub one in his civil 
proceedings.  So my submission is that, that’s not a – it’s not relevant.  
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 43 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not the only proceedings and the definition of 
proceedings includes proceeding…[intervenes]. 
ADV 
ROB 
PETERSEN: 
 
Proceedings 
in 
general 
includes 
the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then 18 refers to any proceedings – at any 
proceedings as well as [indistinct] civil proceedings. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes so the legislature appears to have had a 
distinction in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that 18 suggests that in some places the statute 
talks about what applies to civil proceedings only and in others it talks 
10 
about what applies to both civil proceedings and other proceedings. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Doing my best that’s the interpretation I would 
also give to it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that seems to be the case ja.  Okay so what do 
you say about Mr Madonsela’s only point, because the other one, we 
agreed. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  My submission is that it is – it would be 
adequately catered for by the variation of paragraph two of the draft 
order and to which it has been suggested that some words be added 
but even before the adding of those words, if I could just read to you a 
20 
paragraph which I prepared on this question. 
 
“It may occur at a future date that the Commission receives 
 
and he Chairperson grants an application to cross-examine 
 
Colonel Naidoo but one could add that or give evidence by an 
 
implicated person whose own identity needs to be protected 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 44 of 191 
 
 
from public disclosure.  For example, by virtue of the secret 
 
work that the implicated person is engaged in on behalf of 
 
Crime Intelligence or another Law Enforcement Agency.  In 
 
such a case…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think that has been – I think that is the one that 
we agreed should be dealt with if and when an implicated person 
applies for similar arrangements. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  If that’s agreed then we can stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we don’t have to put that in this order, the point 
that – the only point that Mr Madonsela raises is that he would like his 
10 
client to have the opportunity – the order should allow his client to at 
least at some point see the face of Colonel Naidoo and I’ve indicated, 
and I don’t think he has a problem, I indicated to Mr Baloyi but that 
would apply to him as well, that maybe the best was to deal with that is 
to ensure that there is nothing in the order that prevents any implicated 
person in due course to apply for an order that they be allowed to see 
his face and I would consider each application on it’s merits and decide 
it, I don’t think Mr Madonsela has a problem with that, he doesn’t have 
a problem with that. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  May we do that by way of a further refinement 
20 
of paragraph two? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – maybe it might be appropriate to simply include 
an order in the order a paragraph that says something along the lines 
that,  nothing in this order precludes and implicated person to – is it to 
bring or from bringing – nothing in this order prevents an implicated 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 45 of 191 
 
person from bringing an application for an order that would allow him or 
her to have sight of Colonel Naidoo so that they can bring that 
application. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That would make it clear Chairperson but it is 
covered by two but it might be advisable just, for the avoidance of any 
doubt to elaborate it accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And in regard to the bringing of an application, 
fine but I wonder Chair if it wouldn’t be wise to provide that you may 
also do that mero motu?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe we should be able to do that because I 
might decide to do that mero motu, ja so I think…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  There’s one remaining thing, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I am concerned about the suggestion that it 
should necessarily involve, if you allow it, that it should necessarily 
involve meeting Colonel Naidoo face-to-face rather than seeing a 
photograph because he is at a location which we don’t know, under 
witness protection.  The logistical and security difficulties of bringing 
him to a place away from that location, each time an implicated person 
20 
wants to persuade Chair that it’s necessary to see him, could create an 
untenable problem.  So that if it’s possible to achieve the object when 
you are so minded to order it, by the showing of a photograph that 
should be the preference and if I’ve understood correctly what has been 
said that, that too would have to be motivated.   
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 46 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think what the addition to the order should make 
reference to both having sight of Colonel Naidoo or being shown a 
picture of him.  So that when an application is made, one of the issues 
that a person – an implicated person would have to address is, why 
should I see him in person why is it not enough if I’m shown a picture 
and depending on what Colonel Naidoo, himself or the Commission or 
the Director may put up in terms of logistical challenges of bringing him 
out to – each time and implicated person wants to see his face, that 
can be gauged against showing a picture to say what’s the problem with 
that? 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you include that in the order it will remind all of 
us as I deal with that application to say, there is the option of seeing a 
picture, 
what’s 
wrong 
with 
that, 
okay? 
 
Alright 
so 
I 
think 
therefore…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair, sorry one more thing, I just wouldn’t like 
to be misunderstood by silence as agreeing that an implicated person, 
it happens to be today, Mr Baloyi’s client can satisfy you by simply 
saying it is essential that my client must be able to meet him face-to-
face. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s true, because we – I’m not deciding that 
and I’ve said an application would have to be brought to one he doesn’t 
have to deal with that he would have – his client would have to bring an 
application, a proper application which would be considered properly. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It would usually involve addressing, to some 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 47 of 191 
 
extent, the context, the content of the Naidoo evidence but why seeing 
him in that context is necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that’s find. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Those are my submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what I want to do is – because I’m taking that 
there’s nothing further that anybody wants to say, I think Mr Madonsela 
has one more thing. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  There’s a [indistinct] that I want to 
make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  In relation to the photograph of 
submission.  The premise of our concessions was that the witness be 
brought here and placed in a separate room and be seen by yourself, 
that is the draft order that is before you.  It is no – it is not a quantum 
lib to ask in those circumstances that a witness or implicated person 
should go into that room and seen in company rather than a 
photograph.  I’m just less confident about photographs because of their 
ability to be easily manipulated.  I’ve seen my photos being 
manipulated on social media and many other important people in this 
country have manipulated photographs, I don’t like – I feel very 
20 
uncomfortable with a photograph, provided maybe, as a [indistinct] that 
photograph will be shown to you to deflect the same person that you 
have seen because if that person, as it is proposed in the draft order, 
that he will be here kept in a separate room and testifying from that 
room, then it should be easy to identify who he is. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 48 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I understand what you are saying but exactly 
where he will be whether it’s in the same building or in an adjacent 
building or many blocks away is something that I’m not certain of now 
but when I was reading the draft order there was a  place where – when 
I came to it I don’t know whether this suggests that it would be in the 
same building, but my understanding is that it need not be in the same 
building as long as measures would be taken to make sure that his 
voice – his evidence would be heard here but I think that with regard to 
the question of whether an implicated person should be allowed to see 
his face or see a picture we must leave that for later because I’m not 
10 
going to decide any application today for that.  If and when an 
application is brought then the implicated person can address the 
question of why it’s more important that he should see the face rather 
than the picture more pertinently and to the extent that Colonel Naidoo 
might oppose, he can deal with that as well or the Commission at that 
stage and if there will be logistical challenges in getting him seen by 
people, those will be put up and the implicated person can deal with 
them. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  I wanted just to say one – or the 
photograph I wanted to say about it, it is to be sanctioned by you 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  It should be sanctioned on the basis 
that, that photograph should be a photograph that must be approved by 
yourself because you would have seen him. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 49 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  So that you avoid any…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Challenges ja, no that’s fine thank you.  Okay Mr 
Petersen I change…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chairperson sorry, I’ve just been asked to make 
it clear so that there is no public misunderstanding that in fact, the 
draft order doesn’t specify the location of the separate room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that’s fine.  I think maybe it might have been 
the reference to a separate room that might have given the impression 
that it’s a separate room separate from this room which might have 
10 
given me the impression it’s a room somewhere here as opposed to 
anywhere but it’s wide enough but let’s finish now so that I can start 
with the oral evidence.  So I don’t propose to make the order now 
because I would like you to amend it as we have discussed but in 
substance I am prepared to grant it subject to being satisfied about 
that, so I would like you to amend it in accordance with the discussion 
and bring it later during the day and then I can read it out.  So – but to 
the extent that counsel, Mr Madonsela or Mr Baloyi may need to be 
excused so that they don’t have to wait for that time, I’m quite happy to 
excuse them but they can make arrangements to obtain the order if 
20 
they wish to. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  I assume Chairperson that the witness 
who’s testifying is not the one who was Naidoo himself who was 
scheduled to testify today? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no he is not testifying today.  Ja he is not 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 50 of 191 
 
testifying today it’s a witness that we started with yesterday or maybe 
let me say this, he was originally, I think, meant to start testifying 
today, that’s one but two we must still finish another witness.  Now with 
us only finishing this application at this time, I doubt that this other 
witness will finish while there is time to start with Colonel Naidoo.  I 
will hear what Mr Petersen or whoever from the legal team might have 
to say but it doesn’t look like, to me that he could start today but let me 
hear what they have to say so that you have clarity. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:   Yes we just want to know at what 
stage should we make ourselves available for his testimony so that we 
10 
can…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I understand, oh because you want to be here 
when the evidence is given by him.  No that’s fine who’s going to deal 
with…[intervenes]. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  As I sit down, might I just say that if 
the Chairperson does have time to look at Section 18, you’ll see that at 
the end of Section 18 there’s again reference to the Director, unless 
the Director says something.  So it’s not really that the Director is 
irrelevant but he’s always relevant in all proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, Miss Wentzel? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I am involved in leading the evidence of 
Mr Naidoo and Mr Khuba and I agree with your assessment because of 
the time that the application has taken it’s very unlikely that there will 
be time to start Colonel Naidoo’s evidence today and I think that it’s 
safe to say that evidence will be heard tomorrow. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 51 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that’s fine, that brings you certainty.  Now in 
terms of – sometimes we decide as we finish at 4 o’ clock or 5 o’ clock 
what time we’ll start the following day, normally we start at ten but 
sometimes we start at nine or half past nine.  I think we must work on 
the basis that we will start at ten but should I decide later on that it will 
be earlier then the legal team, Miss Wentzel will make sure that they let 
you know okay. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  It means we sleep over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you sleep over, okay alright. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair just for my own protection I do wish to 
10 
make it clear that I was asked to come in just to deal with this 
application, I have no other involvement in relation to the Law 
Enforcement witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that’s fine. 
ADV GRIFFITHS MADONSELA:  Might I also mention Chairperson it 
might not be me who is present here it might be my junior [indistinct] to 
that extent if I am not here it’s not because I’m disrespectful to 
Chairperson it’s because of some other reasons but let’s [indistinct] to 
be made because of today and Chairperson as I sit down, might I also 
thank you for extending the courtesy to us yesterday to make sure that 
20 
the matter is starting at eleven, that information was conveyed to us in 
time, it really did help us arrange our affairs, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, okay so I will make the order later in the 
day, maybe we should aim for 2 o’clock Mr Petersen by then when we 
come back from lunch if it’s ready at that time then I could make it at 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 52 of 191 
 
that time. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Skipping lunch that’s quite possible, I have no 
difficulty with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I’m going to take a short break now to allow Miss 
Wentzel to organise before we start with the – we continue with Mr 
Khuba’s evidence, we’ll adjourn and we’ll resume at twenty past twelve 
it is five past twelve now. We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Ms Wentzel? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I am ready thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Khuba you continue to testify on the basis of 
the oath you took yesterday.  Is that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba we were dealing with page 10 of 
your statement paragraph 33 yesterday regarding who you told the 
Chair was a – who you believed to be a key witness Colonel Madilonga, 
20 
is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja that is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you tell the Chair about the 
circumstances under which the statements that he gave you was leaked 
to the media? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 53 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was on Sunday when I saw the 
front page of the Sunday newspaper talking about the content of the 
statements.  So that worried me so much because I felt that it is a 
witness he was vulnerable number 1.  And also that it was going to 
compromise the investigation. So what I did I then phoned Advocate 
Mosing I was very concerned and when I told him it seems as he had 
already read the newspaper – he was also concerned about the safety 
of the witness.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then what did – what did you do? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just do not want to forget this so please do not 
forget your question – your next question to the witness.  I was looking 
at the Werksmans Report just now.  When Mr McBride gave evidence in 
April or whatever month it was and when Mr Sesoko gave evidence 
yesterday and the day before they were not asked to deal with the 
reasons given by Werksmans in their report for the findings that they 
made against them. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should have been done.  And it should be done 
20 
with Mr Khuba as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please make arrangements to ask both Mr McBride 
and Mr Sesoko to provide affidavits in which they engage with that 
report head on in terms of the findings that were made against them 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 54 of 191 
 
and the reasons and analysis on which those findings seemed to be 
based and deal with them.  And indicated what they admit is true.  What 
they do not admit is true and say what they have to say about the 
reasoning and the analysis in regard to each finding. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously it may be necessary that a member of the 
legal team interviewed them and prepares that affidavit for them.  But if 
they – if they offer to prepare the first draft and give it to the legal 
team to have a look at and then settle it or finalise it then that is fine 
but we should in regard to these three witnesses have a full and proper 
10 
engagement by each one of them with the findings and the reasons 
given by Werksmans for the findings against them. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I will ensure that that is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then – and then once those affidavits are 
there we – we can see whether it is necessary to call them or not but 
that will be helpful for when Mr July or somebody from Werksmans 
comes here to give evidence about that report and their investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I will ensure that that is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair now that we have digressed I – I just 
20 
want to inform you of something.  You asked me yesterday if there had 
been a response by Mr – Ms Mbeki and I said no there had not.  And 
there had not but last night at ten o’clock the commission did get a 
response and in that response she says she would like to put her side 
of the story and she would like to come to the commission and make a 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 55 of 191 
 
statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes No that is… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will make sure that arrangements are made 
for that to happen as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is – that is fine – that is important.  I was 
asking because I thought it would be important to – for her to give 
evidence to hear from her.  I think that you people must be in touch 
with her to see whether she would prepare that she be interviewed by a 
member of the legal team or the investigators to prepare her statement 
or affidavit or whether she has her own lawyers that she would use to 
10 
prepare because the – the best way to do that is for her to look at the 
statements and if necessary the evidence given by these three 
witnesses but they all seem to say the same thing about her role and 
maybe seeing what they say in the statement is enough because I do 
not think that in their oral evidence they add anything that is not in the 
statement.  She can look at those statements and then prepare an 
affidavit that responds to those allegations and explains her side of the 
story.  Once we have got that that affidavit then arrangements can be 
made for her to – to come and give evidence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay Mr Khuba you say that the statement 
was leaked and you said the content of the statement was leaked.  
Could you just explain what you meant by that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What was clear on the article 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 56 of 191 
 
was the part which Colonel Madilonga indicated that he saw the 
vehicles which seemed to be the vehicle of diplomats and then he 
approached them and they indicated that they were going to arrest 
some people in the country and they would want to see General 
Dramat.  That part came out very, very clear and the statement of 
Colonel Madilonga was not only about that.  He kind of really lay a 
broader explanation in terms of assisting Captain Maluleke in getting 
those people across to where the Zimbabwean police were.  But that 
part was not really covered.  It was mainly on the issue of the role of 
General Dramat.   
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  And after you had expressed your 
concerns to Advocate Mosing what did you do? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I then approached the Acting 
Executive Director Ms Koekie Mbeki.  Firstly I had to explain to her the 
challenges I had and then I wrote a letter requesting that each and 
every team member of the task team be polygraphed so that we could 
see who compromised the investigation of the case.  She was at the 
first when I was talking to her supportive that is why she requested me 
to put it in writing of which I did.  But after that nothing came out of it.  
I also discussed with Advocate Mosing who was guiding the 
20 
investigation and he shared the same sentiment and said to me he will 
also voluntarily submit for the polygraph test. And because it was not 
arranged from our side or the plan could not materialise it was finally 
not done. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the – the letter that you addressed to Ms 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 57 of 191 
 
Mbeki is that the letter that appears at page 49 of the bundle dated the 
31 s t October 2013? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second again Ms Wentzel.  I realise that it seems 
that I have got two sets now of the pages that I did not have at some 
stage yesterday.  It looks like those pages may have been located in a 
wrong place in the statement.  So I now have two sets.  May I return? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The ones that were lent to me? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So if you can hand them over to them. They 
probably need them.  Unless they have already made other copies. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you also discuss your concerns about the 
safety of the witness to Colonel Moukangwe after the statement had 
been released or published in the media? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes I did and I still remember 
very well that when he saw that I was really worried about the safety 
and the leaking of the information in the docket he said to me that why 
20 
are you worried because your superiors are not worried.  The Minister 
will not ask you about that and your – your superior will not ask you 
about that.  Which I understood him to refer to Ms Mbeki.  Of course it 
happened that way because I never received any – I was never called 
and that part it was me who was more concerned about it rather than 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 58 of 191 
 
Ms Mbeki. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what impression did you form from this 
lack of concern? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I – for me I understood they 
were okay with it.  That is how I took it if then – because for me it 
constituted a compromise of investigation.  I just thought probably they 
were okay with it.  They never had a problem with it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba in paragraph 37 of your statement 
onwards you deal with your dealings with General Ntlemeza with regard 
to this matter.  Could you please explain that to the Chair? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  At the time General Ntlemeza 
was the Deputy Provincial Commissioner for Limpopo.  I was the 
Provincial Head.  So from the operational point of view we had a lot of 
contacts where I requested assistance even before I dealt with the 
Rendition case.  Now one time around 2013 it was after I obtained the 
statement of Colonel Madilonga that he requested to see me at Wimpy.  
It was not really far away from where he was staying.  Then I obliged to 
the request and when I arrived there I found him with few gentlemen 
and one of them was introduced as an officer from Eastern Cape. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you just – if you can just address the 
20 
Chair so that he can just see you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay that is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Nicely when you testify. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  So he said he was with an officer 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 59 of 191 
 
from the Eastern Cape.  Do you know the name of that officer? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember because the 
name I took it – I was writing on a note – note sticker on the phone.  I 
will use my finger to write but unfortunately the phone that I used long 
time ago but I could not really take all the details. But what he said to 
me – he said he was attending a course or training in Cape Town with 
Captain Maluleke.  When Captain Malluleke confined to him about what 
happened in the arrest of Moyo.  Moyo was a wanted person for various 
cases and according to the information they told me they said he had 
slipped out of the country, went back to Zimbabwe.  Now this officer 
10 
said Captain Maluleke told him that he went to Zimbabwe and he posed 
as a doctor after they took the – after the Zimbabwean police arrested 
Moyo, shot him in the leg – on the leg and then went to the authorities 
there and introduced Captain Maluleke as a doctor who would want to 
treat Moyo in South Africa.  Now these stories… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was very strange.  Somebody is shot in 
Zimbabwe you say you are a doctor you are in Zimbabwe but you are 
the one who says no I want to treat this patient in South Africa. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is how I got… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there not doctors in Zimbabwe? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm that is the story.  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So what I did – for me I did not 
take it lightly.  I shared the information with the prosecutor and how I 
perceived it I thought apart from the allegation of him being shot or the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 60 of 191 
 
Captain Maluleke posing as the doctor I thought probably it might have 
been an issue that when he assisted the Zimbabwean National he was 
really returning the favour.  That is why I took a bit of interest on the 
story.  I then … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba before you proceed I just want to 
clarify something.   
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You said that it was told to you by this man 
that Captain Maluleke had been party or was present when the – Mr 
Moyo was shot. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then he posed as a doctor saying he 
wants to bring him to South Africa for treatment.  But what happened 
after that to him? What happened to Mr Moyo once he – once they got 
him into South Africa? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They said when he came into the 
country then he was arrested.  And then he was made to face those 
other charges.  I did an investigation around that because when I 
shared with Advocate Mosing he also took some interest and he told me 
that he knows that a prosecutor who dealt with Moyo’s case.  And he 
20 
did his own investigation and he managed to get some of the 
statements relating to the cases involving Moyo and then he gave me 
the copies of those statements and then he requested me to go to 
Musina and check whether he was ever admitted there or treated there 
and also requested that I need to meet with Moyo and take his 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 61 of 191 
 
statement.  Just to find out whether there is corroboration.  Now I sent 
my investigators to Musina.  We could not find any record.  Now I 
requested somebody from the department to interview Moyo which was 
done and a statement was obtained.  There were somehow similarities 
in the story that he was shot by Zimbabwean police but he never made 
any indication that Captain Maluleke was there or he posed as a doctor 
and said it is his doctor.  No he did not make mention of that.  Now wha 
really happened was that I had to do the cell phone records to check – 
given the statements which I was handed by Advocate to check whether 
Captain Maluleke ever crossed at around the time when this Moyo was 
10 
arrested.  And what I found was that he was around the border but 
there is no indication that his cell phone ever lost network when he was 
on the other side.  So somewhere somehow he was at the border.   But 
I could not prove that he crossed the border and went to Zim.  And the 
statement of Moyo never gave any indication that he was seen that 
side. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So just to clarity and then we will deal with 
the – your various reports in some detail in time.  Did you include this 
reference to Moyo in the first report that you submitted to the National 
Prosecuting Authority? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did.  I did include it.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And after – was this before or after you 
received the cell phone records? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot really remember 
whether it was after or before but I remember in the first or January 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 62 of 191 
 
report it was included. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And in the later report was it included? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was not part of that report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why was it not a part of the second 
report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now when we did the 
evaluation… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Or an amended report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Of that docket we realised that 
we could not really find the Nexus the link between the arrest of Moyo 
10 
and the deportation of those Zimbabwean Nationals.  So we felt that it 
cannot really be part of that.  And I looked at it and says I think I agree 
because there was no evidential value of that information because the 
link could not be – be made.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you also said in your statement here at 
paragraph 42 that after hearing this version from the gentleman from 
the Eastern Cape you also analysed Colonel Maluleke’s laptop.  What 
was the result of that analysis? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The analysis was done for the 
entire laptop which means we recovered both personal and evidential 
20 
material.  Now some of the things that we recovered or managed to 
mirror image was the story of Moyo.  And I was in constant discussion 
with the person who was doing that.  And I said print out everything 
regarding Moyo.  And then she was able to do that.  But it never gave 
an indication that information it just talk about Moyo with – wanted.  It 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 63 of 191 
 
did not give a lead to say that he was required to go there and take him 
or he spoke with the Zimbabwean National – I could not find something 
of such a – they were – it was mentioned in those documents that Moyo 
was wanted.   
CHAIRPERSON:  For the sake of completeness what was Mr Moyo’s 
name? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I need to – to have the 
statement to get the full names.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I only know him as Moyo and I 
10 
refer him as Moyo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh because I may – I did not pick up the name on the 
– on your affidavit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just – it is better to mention his name as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that one knows – there are many Moyo’s just as 
there are many Zondo’s. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes we will … 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   No I think we can be able to get 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To get the name. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The name.  I think the reason 
why I used the name Moyo it is how we referred to him in our 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 64 of 191 
 
discussions and how he was referred to by Werksmans. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no it is just that it is important to know 
whether it was Albert Moyo, John Moyo, Jabulani Moyo, Sipho Moyo or 
whoever – whatever the name was. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba at paragraph 45 on page 13 of your 
statement you refer to a further meeting you had with General Ntlemeza 
could you please tell the Chair about that meeting? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I had a meeting with him where 
10 
we discussed about Madilonga and I think he is the one who started 
that discussion.  And I then had to confine to him that I was really, 
really uneasy about his safety.  Because that was after the…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Madilonga’s safety? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because that was after the – the 
article on Sunday Times.  And then he told me that he had transferred 
Colonel Madilonga to Burgersfort.  And he even indicated that Colonel 
Madilonga was his man I must not worry about that.  And I still 
20 
remember I could not take his word for it because after that I – I think it 
was some few weeks then I drove straight to Burgersfort myself and I 
met with him just to find out how he was doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Madilonga? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 65 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I even spoke with him 
because I had a discussion with Mosing about Advocate Mosing about 
the issue of witness protection.  But when I spoke with him he said no 
it is fine, it is a big cop he knows what he is doing.  Then I left and I 
came back and that is what I discussed when I spoke to – to – to 
General Ntlemeza.  But at that particular time there was an issue that 
because the position in the department in IPID was vacant. The 
position of an Executive Director.  And he had made mention earlier 
that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it vacant because somebody had been – was 
suspension, is that what you mean or was it vacant because somebody 
had resigned or had been dismissed and it had not – the position had 
not been filled? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No it was – I think the person 
who was appointed for the position had resigned and it was – it is 
Francois Beukman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that is why Ms Koekie Mbeki 
was acting.  But what happened is that there was a time when she was 
20 
not coming to the office and I heard that she had taken an office 
somewhere but she continued performing the work of IPID.  Now he 
too… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry let me just interrupt you.  Just something 
that I wanted to ask about Ms Mbeki.  Prior to her acting as Executive 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 66 of 191 
 
Director where was she?  Was she part of IPID? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  She was part of IPID and she 
was Head of Legal Services which is one program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  She was a Program Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But responsible … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For legal matters. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja for legal matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no that is fine.  And after she had stopped 
acting as Executive Director did she continue as Head of Legal 
Services or did she leave the – did she leave IPID? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now when she - she stopped 
Acting she was no longer in the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was a time when she was 
not in the office.  I think if it was not one month.  It might be two 
months. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Where we were told that she 
does not deal with anything because she is working somewhere … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But she only signed financial 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 67 of 191 
 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Okay.  I am sorry.  I interrupted while 
you were continuing.  You may or may not have forgotten what you were 
dealing with in which case Ms Wentzel … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remind you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I did not forget.  I was talking 
about my discussions I had with General Ntlemeza.  At that time he had 
told me that he was going to be appointed as an Executive Director of 
IPID and I was very happy because I thought I will be able to work with 
10 
somebody whom I know because I was working with him at a provincial 
level. 
Then on that particular day he said he wanted to tell me that 
the political principal have changed their mind.  He is no longer to join 
IPID.  He will be joining the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now let us try and get the timeframes or rather the 
time.  A sense of when this was.  It appears from what you are saying 
that the time when he told you that he was going to be appointed as 
Executive Director of IPID was separate from the time when he told you 
that he was going to be appointed as the Head of the Hawks or 
20 
something like that.  Those are two different occasions.  Is that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
Those 
were 
two 
different 
occasions because the first one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Was about IPID. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 68 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Around when was that in terms of the year? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Everything took … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe a month. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Everything took place in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You cannot remember more or less where 
about in the year? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I cannot remember in terms of 
- I have month. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In - in terms of my meetings with 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  With him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Somewhere it was September. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Sometimes it was October 
around (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  That was when he told you that he was 
going to be appointed as Executive Director of IPID? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 69 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when he told you that he was going to be 
appointed as the Head of the Hawks around when was that or is it 
around the same time - same month? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was - there was not really 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A long time? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  A big lapse of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was no big lapse of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it may have been a matter of different weeks? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It may be different weeks or ja 
different … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Different months? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Weeks probably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja, probably ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Now with regard to the first one you - 
you have put it very clearly that he said he was going to be appointed 
as the Executive Director of IPID.  Now I just want you to be sure that 
that is how he put it and that he did not say he was going to be 
20 
applying for that position.  Did he put it like … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to be appointed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
He 
never 
put 
the 
word 
application. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 70 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
He 
talked 
about 
political 
principals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That they wanted him to head 
IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He did not talk about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The issue of … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of making an application? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We did not even talk about the 
advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The closing, the opening what 
does it say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We never spoke about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That was in regard to the IPID position? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
That 
was 
regard 
to 
IPID 
20 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when he talked to you on the other occasion 
about him coming to the Hawks or being appointed to the Hawks how 
did he put it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He - he said he wanted - it - it 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 71 of 191 
 
was when we were discussing the issue of the report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because he indicated how far 
are you with the investigation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The rendition investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The rendition investigation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then I would - I would tell 
him that I am left with a few statements but I would not really go into 
detail in terms of individual statements were not police officers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Mainly when the person whom I 
wanted to obtain a statement was a police officer.  I would confine to 
him because I knew that he was going to assist me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So that is when he indicated to 
me that your report is - the one that is holding me from being appointed 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is what he told me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and what did you say when you heard this?  Was 
there a further discussion around this issue of your investigation 
holding him back from being appointed to the Hawks? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Not - not really because I found 
it very, very strange but for me it never shook me out of him to say I do 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 72 of 191 
 
not want to talk to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I just felt - it is like a good 
friend who spoke something weird. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You are still attached to the 
person. I just said - I just kind or really said ignore but it stayed in my 
mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Aye. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When he said that I told him that 
I am left with what - I need to get hold of these people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not focus on what he was saying? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No.  I did not focus on what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you noted it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I noted it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So - so yes continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba from your statement it appears that 
there were at least three different conversations and now from your 
20 
evidence it is sounding like things were happening in two separate 
conversations.  So can - if we can just go back to your statement and if 
you can just clarify as to which is the correct - I do not (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well may - maybe the way to put it Ms Wentzel is not 
to put it like you, you giving him leading questions like that. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 73 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any other occasions when you had 
interactions with General Ntlemeza in regard to your investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tell me about them. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In October 2013 I was in my 
house watching television.  That was after I had already given 
General Ntlemeza my wife’s number upon his request because he 
indicated that he does not want to call me directly because he thought 
probably there were - people were listening to my telephone 
10 
conversation.  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is still in 2013 towards the end of 2013? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  It was 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So on a certain occasion he asked you to give - 
on a certain occasion you gave him your wife’s number? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At his request? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  At his request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he wanted to call you on your wife’s 
number? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Well maybe finalise that.  Did he - you 
said he thought he did not want to phone you on your cell - cell - on 
your phone because …? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because he said to me there 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 74 of 191 
 
might be people who are listening to us.  He does not want to 
compromise our discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I still remember he showed 
me a - a small cellphone.  You know the old type ones that do not have 
the internet and you can just receive or make call and he says he 
advised me to - to get one and he even told me that if I go to a 
particular store it is only 150. 
Now the reason why I could not take the advice.  I am not 
good in - in juggling.  I do not want to carry two phones. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So that is why I - I said it - it 
would be very difficult for me.  That is when he said to me if he could 
use my wife’s number.  I gave him my wife’s number.  I also informed 
my wife.  So on that particular day in October 2013 that is when he - 
my wife called - told me that (African language) is at the gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when you say on that particular day you are not 
meaning the day on which you gave him your wife’s number.  You mean 
another day now? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  She … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On another day your - your wife said to you (African 
language) is at the gate? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 75 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, take it from there. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And she gave me the phone to 
speak with him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he said to me I must instruct 
the security to open for him because he had something to tell me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the reason why your wife was saying (African 
language) is at the gate was because well one who was (African 
language)? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I referred him as (African 
10 
language) … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And my wife knew him as 
(African language) on the basis that even we are doing shopping and 
we will meet him we would - I would not say general. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I would say (African language) 
and then we will give each other hugs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And after that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And my wife knew him as 
(African language) ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And (African language) is a term for showing respect 
for - for respect (African language).  It is like gentleman or …? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 76 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is - it is like gentleman but it 
is a Xhosa word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like sir? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is like sir.  For me I took it as 
sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As sir? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It - it shows respect. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Respect, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that is how you called him … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that is how he called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your wife also then called him that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So on this occasion he had phoned that 
is (African language) had phoned on your wife’s phone and said I am at 
the gate and you wife conveyed that message to you and gave you her 
phone to talk to him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and what did he say to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said he had something to tell 
me.  I should instruct the security guards to allow him in because it is 
an estate.  I then told the security guards.  Then he came in.  When he 
was in then he told me about the meeting he had.  That he was at the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 77 of 191 
 
airport and he met General Mdluli … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he told me that he was sent 
by General Mdluli to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The General Mdluli that he was referring to was it 
General Richard Mdluli or did you now know who he was referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was he referring to?  Which Mdluli was he 
referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Richard Mdluli. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  What did he say about him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said he met him at the airport 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I still remember something 
that I even omitted to put in my statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because he said that man is 
going to be your next President.  That is what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talking about General Mdluli? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I - I just smiled and laughed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Just - just laugh about it. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 78 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And General Mdluli was somebody that you knew? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Not personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not personally.  You just knew his name? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Never met physically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You knew the name and the face or just the 
name/ 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The name and the face. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes.  So he said that man will be … 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The next President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The next President? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then after that he told me that 
he is the one who sent him to me and he - it is appreciating the work 
that I am doing and he said if I am anyhow seeing a suspicious vehicle 
following me while driving to Pretoria or in Pretoria or coming back to 
Limpopo or anywhere I must active General Ntlemeza.  He has been put 
there to - to assist me … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And when he indicated that I - I 
just said okay and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not too excited about this - all this? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I was not excited.  In fact I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 79 of 191 
 
was troubled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were troubled ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was - I was troubled … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I just felt because I never 
considered my own safety to be in trouble.  I worked in KZN.  That is 
when I felt that my life was in - in - really under threat … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But when I was investigating 
rendition I never and - and more so because I knew the people I was 
10 
investigating.  I knew General Sibiya.  I knew General Dramat.  I knew 
Captain Maluleke.  I never thought they were anyhow capable … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So now I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You thought they were not capable of putting your life 
in danger or anything? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  I never thought they were 
capable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is why I just felt that it 
20 
seems as they were implying that my life was in danger or I need 
and/or without them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I will really suffer harm … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 80 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the truth of the matter is that 
I never really … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not feel threatened in anyway? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I never felt threatened, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Huh-uh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Never felt threatened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so in response to what he had to say your 
response was like what?  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I just - I just said okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Most - most of the time and I 
think that is my tendency.  When we are having a very relaxed 
discussion I use okay as a dismissive rather than … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  As agreeing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Rather than as agree … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then after that he - he asked 
me about the case again to say what is it that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - I am sorry.  When he said that General Mdluli 
had said to - had asked him to tell you that should you notice a 
20 
suspicious car following you should activate General Ntlemeza.  What 
did he mean?  Did he mean you must phone General Ntlemeza?  What 
did he mean? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I took as if he meant that 
General Ntlemeza will be the one who is taking care of my safety. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 81 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Who would protect you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Yes.  So the - just continue with the 
conversation then between yourself and General Ntlemeza? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  Then he started to ask 
about a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The case? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  The investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The investigation and that is 
10 
when I indicated that I - I still have to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was asking how far you - you were? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  What - what is that is 
delaying the finalisation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I said I still have - I am 
battling to get hold of General Lebeya because he had signed one of 
the success report.  There was his - his signature and some comments 
there and I also informed him that I had requested a warning statement 
from General Dramat.  Now at that time I did not have General Lebeya’s 
20 
number.  He is the one who got it for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He gave it to you there and then? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There and there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And - no I do not think he … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 82 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Just produced the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He might have made some calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some - okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But what I remember vividly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Is that he looked for the number 
and he gave it to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
And 
then 
I 
had 
to 
call 
General Lebeya … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNCENT KHUBA:  And I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  While - while General Ntlemeza was there? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I put him on an open 
20 
speaker … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that is when I indicated to 
him that aye General I have been looking for you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 83 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then he said to me I can 
come to Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I will be able to have a meeting 
with him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then it - it was fine.  It was 
concluded that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
After 
that 
I 
served 
10 
General Ntlemeza with refreshment and he left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think that is the right time to take the lunch 
adjournment.  We are at nine minutes past one.  We are going to 
adjourn and resume at 10 past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to dispose of the the earlier motion 
matter before we continue with the evidence of Mr Khuba.   Mr Petersen 
do you want to direct my attention to where the relevant amendment is. 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:   Yes Chair, in paragraph two the words have 
been added,  
 
“Ought to ensure fairness to any implicated person”. 
 
That’s the first change. That was addressed during the 
proceedings this morning and then at paragraph three has been 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 84 of 191 
 
inserted making the old paragraph three now paragraph four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay two is – is it a completely new order or is it an 
amended version of an old order? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Paragraph two has been amended by adding 
the words at the end, after Naidoo’s evidence the words, 
 
“Ought to ensure fairness to any implicated persons”. 
 
That is the only change up to that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right and then you…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Then we’ve inserted a paragraph three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that’s a completely new three? 
10 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That follows the guidance given this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but is it a completely new three? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes it’s a completely new paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And then paragraph four is the old paragraph 
three without any change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that please about four, just repeat what 
you have just said about four? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It’s exactly the same as the previous three, it’s 
just now numbered four. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, the introductory part of paragraph one is it 
accurate to say when he gives evidence at any hearing of the 
Commission in the circumstances in which he will be giving evidence? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Before I respond I need to be quite sure that 
I’m understanding you. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 85 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the part that I’m concerned about is at any 
hearing of the Commission, namely could it be said that he will be 
giving evidence at hearing of the Commission when he’s giving 
evidence away from this venue? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Would it be satisfactory to say when he attends 
to give evidence to the Commission or when he gives evidence to the 
Commission? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I was thinking more about when he gives evidence 
to the Commission. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  But when he gives to the Commission. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and I’m crossing out the first words in the first 
line, namely, “the following measures shall be taken”, I just start with to 
ensure that and then delete the comma after the bracket where it says 
the Act and then delete, “attends to” so it should read, 
 
“To ensure that when blah blah gives evidence to the 
 
Commission”, 
 
So we take out hearing to the Commission. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Would it be okay to keep the comma after the 
bracketed, the Act because that’s a separate phrase, who is a protected 
person. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I overlooked the comma before who, earlier to 
ensure when…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So if you contend to have two commas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think you’re right we keep the comma that I said 
we must take out, yes we keep that comma. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 86 of 191 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  So I think that is clear if I can just read it back 
to you to make sure that I have your changes, 
 
“To ensure that when Lieutenant Colonel Naidoo, Naidoo who 
 
is a protected person as defined in the witness protection Act 
 
112 of 1998 the Act, gives evidence to the Commission”, 
 
And then it’s not changed after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes then it’s not changed after that.  Then when I 
read, earlier on the paragraphs I think everything was fine.  Where is 
the part that talks about the room, remember when I said I gained the 
impression as if the order necessarily contemplated that the room from 
10 
which you’d give evidence would be in the same building. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I think it’s 1.2 that you may have had in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should we say, a separate location, how does that 
sound? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And then keep – could we keep (protected 
witness room) because that runs then right through the order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well shouldn’t we say, protected witness location, if 
we say location then what I’m having in mind is I would read it but you 
can still have it reprinted on the typed version, how does that sound.  
In other words, we would say, protected location throughout? 
20 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I’m just checking Chair, I think that will be 
alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Just checking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I take it location would include room. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 87 of 191 
 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be fine? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That would be fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so then – and I want to look at two, I think 
where we say, may be varied do we say varied or amended or added to 
even though varied covers everything…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Mr varies was very…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
know 
some 
of 
these 
things 
you 
want 
10 
to…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Well it’s your order Chair, obviously… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think just…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  It seems to me that varied covers everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it does but I think I would prefer to have added to 
– amended can maybe go out but…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  How about varied or added to or supplemented? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe amended or supplemented. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Maybe amended or supplemented? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that’s – I like that maybe amended or 
20 
supplemented ja and then I must just look at three.  I think let us say if 
common his opinion that is necessary to ensure and in three we say 
nothing in this order precludes the granting by the Chairperson of an 
order mero motu or on application by a person who is or may be 
implicated by the evidence of Naidoo allowing that person to have sight 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 88 of 191 
 
of having to have been shown a photograph of him which has been 
approved by the Chairperson for the purpose provided that in the case 
of an application by another person [Inaudible- Chairperson reading to 
himself].  I’m inclined to stop at purpose and delete the provided part. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  You want to leave that out? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja on the basis that when they apply, obviously they 
know that they need to motivate and if they have to choose between 
picture and have sight of, they would know why that particular one.  
What do you think? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  I’m concerned it does seem to me that there 
10 
may be a response to this order of many applications which are not 
soundly motivated that you would then have to deal with and the 
proviso is intended to just make it clear that it’s really those that have 
difficulty in preparing their answer who are being accommodated here 
and that they need to explain what their difficulty is in connection with 
the content of the evidence.  So that’s the purpose of the draft proviso I 
would be concerned that there may be temptation to apply without 
motivation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the idea about that person being a person 
who has applied for is in the process of applying for, in terms of Rule 
20 
34 of making a statement is a good idea but I’m not sure whether one 
should include it in the order.  I’ll tell you what we should do – I’ll tell 
you what let’s stop at purpose we will deal with them as they come, if 
necessary I can issue a direction in regard to one or all of them to say, 
if you apply for this, this is what you must comply with but for now I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 89 of 191 
 
think let’s just stop at purpose. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Chair the very idea of an application is it 
implies that it must be properly motivated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and if it’s not properly motivated we’ll – once we 
are aware of it I could issue a directive to say, deal with A, B, C, D. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes and if you get an unsatisfactory application 
then you could make those obligations when you deal with it.  I say 
when you receive an unsatisfactory application then you could make 
those observations when deciding how to handle it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then wherever the – in the second line 
10 
paragraph one where it says it defines Colonel Naidoo as Naidoo I’d 
like to stay with maybe just Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Colonel Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Colonel Naidoo and throughout the order. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it doesn’t just say Naidoo. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright I’ll now read it out as amended and then and 
where it says Naidoo I will say Colonel Naidoo and then it can be 
printed and then it can be signed and made available.  The order that I 
20 
make in regard to the application that I heard this morning brought by 
Colonel Naidoo reads as follows, 
 
“It is hereby ordered that, 
 
 1) To ensure that when Lieutenant Colonel Dhanajaya  
 
Dhanaloo[?] Naidoo (Colonel Naidoo) who is a protected 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 90 of 191 
 
 
person as defined in the witness protection Act 112 of 1998 
 
(the Act) gives evidence to the Commission, the location to 
 
which he has been  
relocated in terms of the Act and the 
new  
identity  which he has been given or which he has assumed 
 
for his protection pursuant to the Act are not disclosed. 
1.1 He will not be present at the hearing room at any time. 
1.2 A separate location (the protected witness location) will 
be provided. 
1.3 He will give his evidence from the protected witness 
location. 
10 
1.4 No camera will be permitted in the protected witness 
location. 
1.5 An audio link from the protected witness location will be 
provided so that his evidence can be heard in the 
hearing room when he gives it. 
1.6 Except 
as 
stated 
in 
paragraph 
1.7 
below, 
the 
Chairperson, the relevant evidence leaders and all other 
participants in the proceedings will be located in the 
hearing room when Colonel Naidoo gives evidence”. 
I’m stopping there Mr Petersen it looks like we don’t 
20 
really need 1.6 because somewhere you have an order about who – 
about nobody allowed to go to the protected witness location, isn’t it? 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Are you saying Chair, that if 16 is deleted it will 
be applied in any event? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because where else can they be if they can’t be 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 91 of 191 
 
where the witness will be. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  That seems to me to be correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
ROB 
PETERSEN: 
 
So 
then 
there’s 
a 
renumbering 
of 
the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so we delete 1.6 and then 1.7 becomes 1.6 and 
then – so…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  With consequential renumbering? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Consequential renumbering so they new 1.6 then 
reads, 
10 
 
“1.6 No persons other than the Chairperson (if and when he 
 
considers it appropriate) the relevant evidence leaders and 
 
those necessary to protect Colonel Naidoo when he attends  to 
give evidence…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Excuse me for interrupting, we then again 
remove attends to give evidence, when he gives evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Well I’m not sure now when he attends to give 
evidence we just need to be sure that, that is maintaining the 
uncertainty of location. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay when he gives evidence, we just say when 
he gives evidence. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  When he gives evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I read paragraph 1.6 again, 
 
“1.6 No persons other than the Chairperson (if and when he 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 92 of 191 
 
 
 
considers it appropriate), the relevant evidence leaders 
 
 
and those necessary to assist or protect Colonel Naidoo 
 
 
when he gives evidence will be permitted to enter the  
 
 
protected witness location. 
1.7 The Commission’s safety and Security Advisor who is the 
head of the security for the Commission or in his 
absence another person specifically designated by the 
Chairperson will have the responsibility of controlling 
access to the protected witness location in terms of this 
order and of ensuring that only Colonel Naidoo and other 
10 
persons permitted in terms of paragraph 1.6 above enter 
it.  So it says 1.7 but now it will be 1.6 and then, 
1.8 Subject to usual rules applicable to the conduct of the 
Commission’s proceedings a) members of the public, 
including the media may be present in the hearing room.  
b) sound reaching the hearing room via the audio link 
from the protected witness location may be broadcast 
and the proceedings in the hearing room may be filed 
and broadcast. 
1.9 No video or other image of Colonel Naidoo whatsoever 
20 
may be taken or may be broadcast. 
1.10 No person may photograph or publish any photograph or 
any image of any other person engaged in or responsible 
for the protection of Colonel Naidoo when he gives 
evidence. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 93 of 191 
 
1.11 No document or other evidence revealing the location to 
which Colonel Naidoo has been relocated in terms of the 
Act or his new identity shall be tendered or otherwise 
placed on record”. 
Is it clear from this order that, should anyone become aware of 
where the protected witness location is, they may not publish that 
– they may not publish that information or should we add 
something? 
ADV 
ROB 
PETERSEN: 
 
I 
think 
something 
could 
be 
added 
but…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you think it’s adequately…[intervenes]. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Four which reminds people of the order that 
you gave on the 17 t h of September would have the same effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have the same effect ja. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  And if sufficient care is taken over the 
protected witness location as is intended then it would seem to be 
unnecessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay: 
“2. This order may be amended or supplemented by the 
 
Chairperson at any time if, in his opinion, that is 
20 
 
necessary to ensure the protection of Colonel Naidoo or 
 
any other person in connection with Colonel Naidoo’s 
 
evidence or to ensure fairness to any implicated person. 
3. Nothing in this order precludes the granting by the 
 
Chairperson of an order, mero motu or on application by a 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 94 of 191 
 
 
person who is or may be implicated by the evidence of 
 
Colonel Naidoo, allowing that person to have sight of 
 
Colonel Naidoo or being shown a photograph of him which 
 
has been approved by the Chairperson for the purpose. 
4. This order does not derogate from the order made on 17 
 
September 2019 as required by Section 18 of the Act 
 
prohibiting publication of any information including any 
 
drawing, 
picture, 
illustration, 
painting, 
photograph 
 
whether produced through or by means of computer 
 
software on a screen 
or 
a 
computer 
printout 
as 
10 
 
contemplated in the Films and Publications Act 1996 at 65 
 
of 1996 or no pamphlet, poster or other printed matter 
 
which may may disclose: 
4.1 The place of safety or location where Colonel 
Naidoo is or has been under protection or where he 
has been relocated in terms of the Act. 
4.2 The circumstances relating to his protection. 
4.3 The identity of any other protected person and the 
place of safety or location where such person is being 
protected. 
20 
4.4 Colonel Naidoo’s relocation or change of identity. 
That is the order that I make in this – in that matter and once the order 
has been printed it should be disseminated to all media houses and 
made available to the public. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  Yes thank you Chair. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 95 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay thank you. 
ADV ROB PETERSEN:  May I be excused? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused.  Thank you.  We can then resume 
the evidence relating to the evidence of Mr Khuba.  Ms Wentzel are you 
ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I am thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba before the lunch adjournment we 
were dealing with the meeting that you had with General Ntlemeza at 
your home during October 2013 which is dealt with from pages 14 and 
10 
15 of your statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he said he gave him some drinks and after that 
General Ntlemeza left his house, is that right?  Is that right?  Left your 
house – he left your house after a – after you had given drinks and so 
on? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  I think there is 
a part that I did not clearly cover there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because when he mentioned 
about General Mdluli for me was a surprise because when I worked with 
20 
Colonel Moukangwe he never made mention of General Mdluli.  I 
worked him for – I worked with him for a very long time but he never 
made – even an indication of anything relating to Mdluli.  Now that 
gave me a consent but I wanted to indicate is that he said to me that 
my report was the one which was holding back his move to the Hawks.  
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 96 of 191 
 
And as I indicated I could not really take him serious because I just 
listened to him but I did not really take him serious.  But I put it in my 
mind.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you think he was kind of exaggerating the 
situation namely – you – did you think that well if there was to be a 
vacancy in the Hawks it would be – the position would be advertised 
and different people would apply.  This thing of him saying your report 
– the delay in your report was holding him back was just some 
exaggeration on his part of the position. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I did not really take it as an 
10 
exaggeration but I think from the background that he told me that he 
was going to move to IPID and later came and say the political 
principles are no longer wanting him to go to IPID – IPID by the Hawks.  
So it made me not to – I just felt that I should not really entertain what 
he was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. But was that because you had a feeling that if 
things were to happen the way he was saying it would not be – they 
would not be happening the right way or… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it because you did not believe that – you did not 
20 
believe him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I just felt also that the 
process that it will take to get rid of Dramat would not really be an easy 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would not be an easy one? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 97 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Easy one yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  When he said that his principle – 
political principles no longer wanted him to go to the Hawk – to IPID 
but wanted him to go to the Hawks who did you understand him to refer 
to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To tell you the honest fact I had 
a challenge I could not really put an individual there because he never 
said a political principle he said principles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought you said he said political principle. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he did not put it that way? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh what did he say? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He talked about political 
principles that they would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought that was what I said.  Ms Wentzel did 
you hear the same thing? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I think that what he is saying is that the 
one is singular and the other is plural. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that the distinction you are making? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes that is the distinction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no, no, no I am sorry.  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he said political – his political principle. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 98 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One – singular? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No, no 
CHAIRPERSON:  Plural? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja he was referring… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought I was using plural. Okay ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but who – what was your understanding of who he 
was referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  My – I could not place – I could 
10 
not place the face Chairperson but I just thought probably if we talk 
about policing it will be the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm.  Okay alright.  Continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In paragraph 51 of your statement you said 
that you were battling to get hold of General Lebeya and that General 
Ntlemeza assisted you in doing that.  You said you wanted to get hold 
of him because he was one of the people who had signed the success 
reports.  What is a success report?  What were you referring to there? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  A success report in this situation 
20 
it was just – it is a one pager report where the writer indicated that he 
arrested specific individual on this particular day and what happened to 
the people 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was that concerning? 
MR HUMBULANI 
INNOCENT 
KHUBA:  
It 
was concerning 
the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 99 of 191 
 
Zimbabwean Nationals. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the – so the arrest of the Zimbabwean 
Nationals? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was there any success report by Dramat? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now after you had given General Ntlemeza 
some refreshments and he left your house how did you feel? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was – I was – I was afraid.  
That is why I went to my wife and indicated that I do not know what I 
10 
got myself into.  Because at the time I knew General Mdluli to be on 
suspension and it worried me that he took interest on matters when he 
– it is outside.  So – and also his involvement in a lot of cases like the 
politically charged issues.  For example there were – there was an 
issue about the recordings.  By that time it was on the media that there 
was recording of the President or something but it related to him that 
he gave the President something.  So I had a little bit of information of 
what was happening with Richard Mdluli. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I – I am sorry Ms Wentzel. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Earlier on I had wanted to ask you something and I 
forgot.  When you said that – you said that somebody – you mentioned 
somebody’s name and you said when you worked with him he never 
mentioned General Mdluli.  You remember I – when you said that? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 100 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what was the name again of the person you talking 
about? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is Colonel Moukangwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja who was he in the context of what General 
Ntlemeza has said because I think you were saying that because 
General Ntlemeza said General Mdluli said if you see a suspicious car 
following you you should activate General Ntlemeza. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Colonel Moukangwe I knew him 
to be member of CI Crime Intelligence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Crime Intelligence ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was under General Mdluli at the time? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Where it was under General 
Mdluli.  By that time he was on suspension I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now also given the fact that I 
worked on the Rendition case with Colonel Moukangwe I would have 
expected that he would talk about General Mdluli but he never 
mentioned him.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to understand why your thought of him is 
relevant. 
 MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The thought of him it is relevant 
in this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 101 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I would have expected 
that General Mdluli will be more closer to CI individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Rather than General Ntlemeza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that CI person… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Was doing investigation with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So – so in other words you would have expected 
that – you said it is Moukangwe? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja Colonel Moukangwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Moukangwe. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May be would have been told by General Mdluli to tell 
you that if you see a suspicious car following you you must activate him 
or at least you would have expected that at some stage or another he 
would have mentioned General Mdluli but he never? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were wondering why General Mdluli was 
giving a message to General Ntlemeza about your protection in 
20 
circumstances where General Ntlemeza was not even at Crime 
Intelligence. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what is in your mind. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 102 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So when you said you started to feel afraid 
what did you do? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I then approached the then 
Acting Executive Director Ms Koekie Mbeki and I requested that I be 
removed from the team.  But when I had discussion with her I never 
spoke about the meeting that I had with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Ntlemeza. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  General Ntlemeza. I only 
highlighted the issue of leaks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That I was not happy and – but 
the real core was the meeting that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With General Ntlemeza. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  The issue of the 
– the leaks was also part of that but the main issue there was when I 
heard about General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you not consider it appropriate to tell Ms 
Mbeki about the main issue? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The problem was – it was very, 
20 
very difficult to read Ms Mbeki.  It was very, very difficult.  To such an 
extent that I could not really understand whether she support the 
investigation whether she is against the investigation.  Because if then 
she was really, really, really in support of me going after these people 
like General Dramat and others why did she query my presence in head 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 103 of 191 
 
office when and she said I will cancel your accommodation what are 
you doing here?  So for – for Ms Mbeki even today I cannot really tell 
where she stood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where she stood on this issue of the Rendition? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you – you chose to be circumspect about 
what you told her. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now after this meeting in October 2013 did 
10 
you have any further meetings with General Ntlemeza? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure that he has finished telling us 
about the discussion between himself and Ms Mbeki. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he has not. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No he has not – you are correct.  Thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Just con – just finalise your – complete your 
conversation with Ms Mbeki? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja when I told her that I want to 
20 
be removed from the team she refused and said there is no-one who 
can be able to do this and the Minister will not be happy about this 
decision for you to leave this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you met the Minister personally?  Did you know 
each other quite well?  Why would he particularly not be happy if you 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 104 of 191 
 
were moved away from the – this investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I interpreted that from the fact 
that the Minister referred this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Not necessarily that I knew the 
Minister.  I never had any interaction with the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So your interpretation – interpretation of what 
Ms Mbeki was saying was not that the Minister would not want you as a 
10 
person to be moved out of the investigation but that he might not like 
the idea that now somebody else must take over. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words did you think the concern – do you 
think that as far as Ms Mbeki was concerned she thought that the 
Minister would not be happy with the changing of investigator – of lead 
investigators not necessarily that he wanted you to be the person doing 
the investigation as such? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That one Chairperson it is very 
difficult to say on the basis that by that time I had already probably 
20 
sent numerous reports – progress reports.  What I thought was 
probably because of the good work I was doing.  Probably he was 
happy with what I was doing.  But also the second point that you 
indicated which means the change of investigator because any change 
in the investigation team destabilises the case itself.   
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 105 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  After this did you have cause to meet General 
Ntlemeza again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe to finish.  Did you then accept that you just 
had to continue with the investigation when you were told that there is 
nobody else who can take over and the Minister would not be happy? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja I accepted that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  More especially if the name of a 
political principle is mentioned you feel more obligation to help the 
10 
country and I felt that I need to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  After this meeting in 
December or October 2013 did you have a further meeting with General 
Ntlemeza? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I had a last meeting with him but 
that was December 2014 it was on the 6 t h. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and why did you have that meeting and 
where did you have it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He had called me and he said I 
20 
should meet with him at Wimpy.  He had something to talk to me about.  
I went to the restaurant and when I arrived he was already seated 
inside.  When I sat down he said he wanted to tell me the good news.  
And he said there was going to be a hit on Dramat I must watch 
television in the coming weeks.  I took the information as I always did 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 106 of 191 
 
just to listen to him and then after some – I do not know how many 
weeks had already passed but what he told me came to pass.  When I 
saw on television that General Dramat had been suspended and then 
he was appointed to act in his position.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when he met – when you met with him at Wimpy 
– at the Wimpy is it what Cycad Centre? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you met him there how long after you had sent 
your first report was it?  How much time had lapsed since you – since 
your sending the first report? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It will be almost ten to eleven 
months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And probably I need to add and 
say after I sent the first report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The contact just died down.  He 
never contacted me as regularly as he used to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that when you met him at the 
Wimpy Centre you had sent your first report to the NPA about ten or 
20 
eleven months before? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The first report it was ten to 
eleven but the second report because was – sent in March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  This meeting was after even the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 107 of 191 
 
second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this meeting was after even the second report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  How soon after or how long after this – the 
second report if you are able to remember more or less? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I am not be able to calculate out 
of my head but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It took place – the second report 
was in March. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And the meeting was in 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 2014? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so the first report you would have sent in 2013, is 
that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The first report was in January 
2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and then the second report in March? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it took quite some months before he – he had 
good news to tell you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 108 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. Chair the first report… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – So I am sorry. So when he said – so the good 
news that he was telling you about was it that there was a hit – there 
was going to be a hit on Dramat or – or he said he has moved to the 
Hawks had arrived – or is that what he said?  Or how did he put it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That part of him moving to the 
Hawks I already knew and he never labour on that in discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I knew exactly when he said 
there was going to be a hit and he said it is good news because he told 
10 
me that my report is the one that is withholding his move to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Hm.  But how did you know that – before that 
meeting how did you know that his move to the Hawks had arrived?  I 
am taking this from your statement in paragraph 54 where you say: 
“I found General Ntlemeza seated inside.  He said 
that his time to move – or he said his time – his time 
to move to the Hawks had arrived.” 
But you say that even before that you – you knew about his move to the 
Hawks.  Are you referring simply to the statement he had made to you 
earlier to the effect that your report was what was delaying his move to 
20 
the Hawks?  Is that what you are basing that on or did you hear 
something else about his move to the Hawks? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  The earlier 
meeting we had that is when he said he needed to move to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 109 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is the meeting that was 
held I think around October that is 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now in 2014 that is when he told 
me about the hit as the good news. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Even though he talked about the 
– the issue of his move he was nor really … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excited about that. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja the main issue was the hit on 
10 
Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh what he was excited about was the hit. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  But you understood that the hit would 
open the door… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The door. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The door to him to go to the Hawks. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he said you must watch the news on TV in the 
coming weeks? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And just so that we continue with the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 110 of 191 
 
statement you said you did watch the news and you say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you see the hit?  You watched the news and did 
you see the hit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Um – ja.  I do not know whether 
I can use his term whether it was a hit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well but at least did you see something that you 
interpreted to be the hit that he was referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you saw something you did not know if it was the 
hit that he was referring to but later on you heard from him that it was 
10 
the hit or … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I saw something happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I thought it is the hit that he 
spoke about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tell me about what you saw? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was an issue about the 
suspension of General Dramat and that he was appointed to act in that 
position.  So it happened exactly as he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay – yes okay, okay.  So – so it – the TV – the 
20 
news show – now revealed that the – General Dramat was suspended 
and that General Ntlemeza was going to act in his position? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Was the announcement on like simultaneous of 
the two or you do not really know – cannot remember? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 111 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been close to each other? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It had been close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What did you think after this? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  After that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he phone you – I am sorry – I am sorry.  Do not 
forget what you want to say.  Did he maybe phone you after the hit 
happened on the news to say did you see the hit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No he gave me a call once while 
he was working that we need to meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the meeting never 
materialised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now – was that when he was already acting in 
General Dramat’s position? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I am sorry I interrupted you while you 
were responding to a question that Ms Wentzel put to you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  After this and you then see the television and 
it has happened exactly as he had said what did you think? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 112 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I started – you know it started to 
confirm the challenges that I had with the statement of Madilonga and 
the entire issue of Rendition.  It really, really troubled me but it was 
something that I could not do anything about it.  The statement of 
Madilonga I had a number of issues with that statement.  The first I had 
already indicated yesterday that he had a statement that he has signed 
which was not commissioned and that is where he indicated that 
nothing went wrong.  Those people were just deported correctly.  Now 
that was the first challenge and the second statement where he change 
his version and also indicated that he forced to make that statement, 
10 
the first one.  Now the other issue was the issue that – I also had the 
documents 
relating 
to 
Zimbabwean 
authority 
thanking 
Crime 
Intelligence for the good work done when they assisted them in getting 
hold of their Nationals.  That document made no mention of Dramat.  In 
fact it is directed to Crime Intelligence.  And I felt if then Dramat was 
the pioneer of this thing they were supposed to have written to him 
directly.  So his name was not mentioned.  That letter it was an official 
letter on the basis that it ended up in the hands of the Provincial 
Commissioner of Gauteng, Commissioner Petrus and he wrote an 
attachment back to Crime Intelligence thanking them for the good work 
20 
done.  So there were also issues of the analysis of statement that I did 
which indicated that he was not truthful with the information and the 
issue is that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Madilonga? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 113 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was also an issue of the 
call which was made at Beit Bridge because in his statement it was put 
in such a way that as if it indicated that he – he – Dramat is the one 
who opened way for the deportation.  But the truth of the matter is that 
that call was made on the 4 t h and the actual Rendition of these 
Zimbabwean Nationals took place on the 8 t h.  And the other issue was 
the level of interference that I had in the investigation itself.  It really 
strengthened my doubt whether this thing was done in good faith.  I am 
not saying that that Rendition never took place I am just saying was it 
10 
done then – I mean the whole investigation, the setup and when it 
started was it done in good faith?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you raising that question because of the fact that 
the Zimbabwean authorities directed their letter of appreciation to 
Crime Intelligence and yet people who were being investigated in 
relation to the Rendition issue were people who were in the Hawks and 
you – are you asking the question why would the letter be directed to 
Crime Intelligence if the people were really the masterminds were in 
the Hawks why was it not directed to the Hawks? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba could you please turn to page 52 it 
is Annexure 5 in the bundle in front of you.  Is that the letter that you 
are referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I beg your pardon page? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 114 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 52.   
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Page 52 on? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 52 it is a letter with the heading or letterhead 
Zimbabwe Republic Police. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just look at the page numbers on the top right 
hand side. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember 50… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.  Let me check? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember when I said when she mentions the page 
she will not mention 0 before 52. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes that is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well Ms Wentzel you might wish to read into 
the record some relevant parts of it or the whole of it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I intend to do so.  If you have a look at 
the letter it is dated the 14 t h March 2001 to the Commander… 
CHAIRPERSON:  2011. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  11 I beg your pardon.  And addressed to 
Commander Criminal Investigations Unit South Africa Police Service 
Pretoria and it is marked for the attention of Colonel Ntenteni, is that 
right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 115 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The heading of the letter is “Letter of 
appreciation of good work performed by your intelligence officers.”  And 
then the officers are named.  It says: 
“I wish to express my profound gratitude in the 
exemplary professionalism, brevity and dedication to 
duty that was exhibited by your abovementioned 
operatives.  Our criminal investigation department 
Bulawayo was investigating a case of murder 
involving a senior police officer of the Zimbabwean 
Republic Police the late Chief Superindent Chatikobo 
10 
who was killed in Bulawayo on the 18 t h September 
2010 by the accused Gordon Dube, Johannes Nyone 
and three others.  Soon after committing the offence 
the two mentioned accused persons fled Zimbabwe 
and sought refuge in Diepsloot Squatter Camp 
Johannesburg in the Republic of South Africa.  We 
passed 
on 
information 
to 
the 
abovementioned 
officers regarding the two accused persons who 
reacted swiftly, managed to arrest the two fugitives 
and recovered a CZ pistol that was taken from the 
20 
deceased police officer in Zimbabwe.  During the 
period 21 s t February to 1 s t March 2011 the same 
team assisted me and my team when I was 
conducting some investigations in the Republic of 
South Africa.  I really enjoyed the manner and 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 116 of 191 
 
fashion 
the 
abovementioned 
officers 
aligned 
themselves to police work despite being junior 
officers.  May your respective…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Ms Wentzel.  Okay we adjourn for five 
minutes for the technicians to attend to their problem. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us proceed.  I think - I do not know if you 
took note of where you were when the problem started. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Your microphone. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We got up to page 53 of the bundle towards 
the end of the letter.  It says: 
“May your respected office convey my appreciation 
to all of them?  I also wish to thank you and 
20 
Captain Busang for the support rendered to me and 
my team during the visit.  Best regards, E Makodza 
Assistant Commissioner CID Co-ordinator Bulawayo 
Matabeleland North and South Provinces.” 
Is that the letter you were referring to? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 117 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  (No audible reply). 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba.  Is that the letter that you were 
referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have a look at what is called 
Annexures B, C, D onwards from pages 54 through to 58 with the first 
letter addressed to the Provincial Commissioner SA Police Service 
Gauteng on 24 March 2011.  Recommendation for good work performed 
by Members of Crime Intelligence.  Then it says: 
“Attached herewith a minute dated 14 March 2011 
10 
from 
CID 
Provincial 
Head 
Quarters 
Bulawayo 
Zimbabwe.  For your information.  The members 
involved are stationed at Pretoria Central Crime 
Intelligence Station.  It would be appreciated if the 
members 
can 
be 
called 
to 
your 
office 
to 
congratulate them for the good work that was 
done.” 
And following that you will see that letters of appreciation 
were then sent to these members under a heading Letter of 
Appreciation employees of Pretoria Central CIG and it says: 
20 
“Apprehending wanted criminals who fled from 
Zimbabwe 
after 
murdering 
Zimbabwean 
Police 
Chief.” 
Is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 118 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if we can go back to the misgivings you 
said you started to have about Colonel Madilonga’s statement which 
you deal with on pages 16 and 17 of your statement.  You said earlier 
that - you referred again to the two statements that he had given.  
Could you just clarify one thing? 
In the first statement which you testified to yesterday was not 
commissioned did that refer in any way to General Dramat? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
And 
the 
second 
statement 
that 
was 
commissioned did that one refer to General Dramat? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what were you told by Colonel Madilonga 
was the reason for the discrepancy?  Did you interrogate him on this? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I asked him about the statement 
and he said he was forced to make the first one which means he 
implied that the first one was in correct.  The correct one was the 
second one. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what did you think about that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For me it did not make sense 
because if he was really forced to implicate - not to implicate Dramat in 
20 
the first one.  They would have had it commissioned so that he could 
not have an opportunity to deviate from that version.  However when I 
drew that statement and when I also showed him the copy of that 
statement it was not commissioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say who forced him to do the first one? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 119 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He did not indicate the name but 
he said he received a call and was told what to say. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In the first statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the whole statement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In terms of the statement.  Ja, in 
terms of the whole statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Which according to him is not 
what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words he was saying the whole first 
10 
statement was wrong? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You also said that your investigation of the 
telephone records indicated that the telephone call to Dramat was on 
the 4 t h.  Whereas the - the rendition took place on the 8 t h.  Could you 
just - do you remember which month that was? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was November 2010.  The call 
was made on 4 November 2010.  Whereas the actual rendition took 
place on 8 November 2010. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what conclusions did you draw from that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  My challenge with that was that 
these are two different dates.  It took almost four days before those 
people could be taken across.  It would have made sense if that call 
was made at a time when these people were being renditioned.  It 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 120 of 191 
 
would … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What do you mean by renditioned? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To be deported illegally to be 
handed over to the Zimbabwean National.  If he had said on the 8 t h 
when Maluleke came - Captain Maluleke whom I am referring as 
Captain but in my statement mostly it is - it is Colonel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Why is that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is simply because when the 
act was committed he was Captain and when I obtained statements - 
obtained statement which reflect that it is Captain but during the time 
10 
of investigation he was promoted.  He became - before investigation he 
was - he became a Colonel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay.  So just explain this discrepancy 
between 4 November 2010 and 8 November 2010.  Sorry.  I interrupted 
you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For me it would have made 
sense if that call was made when Captain Maluleke was at the border 
with this Zimbabwean National and then General Dramat called 
Colonel Madilonga and say please my people want to take those people 
across. 
20 
It would have made - but I could not make the connection 
because I did not know what they talk about and the deportation of the 
rendition day was different from the day of the call. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you could just remind the Chair what 
did Colonel Madilonga say happened with regarding this call on 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 121 of 191 
 
4 November 2010 involving General Dramat? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said he was - he saw the 
black (indistinct) vehicle - Mitsubishi and then he approached the 
people and they told him that they want to - to see General Dramat.  He 
said he contacted his superiors starting with the first one.  I think that 
was almost the junior and then the immediate Commander told him that 
you need to contact Brigadier Mashuku who was the superior to her and 
when he did that he said Brigadier Mashuku said I was never contacted 
by General Dramat. 
That there are people who are coming in the country.  So you 
10 
have to phone General Dramat yourself and that is consent in their 
statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you have cause to analyse cellphone 
records as to confirm this or not? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.  I - I did check the 
cellphone records but what I did I could not get - because he said he 
used a landline but I analysed the - General Dramat’s cellphone record 
and I could confirm that there was a call that was made on the 4 t h but it 
lasted very short.  I cannot remember the minutes now. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You can just address your answers to the 
20 
Chair.  Try and remember. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I - I cannot remember the 
exact duration of that call but there was a call. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And having regard to these issues that you 
say concerned you what did you think may - may have happened?  
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 122 of 191 
 
What conclusions did you draw? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You know after everything I 
could see that it seems as the whole investigation was aimed at getting 
rid of - of General Dramat.  When I put the pieces of the puzzle in 
terms of the wrong things that took place in terms of the statement of 
Colonel Madilonga in terms of the pressure he was put under I just 
realised that it seems as the ultimate goal was to get rid of 
General Dramat. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You say in paragraph 59 of your statement 
that you decided to send Colonel Madilonga’s statement for analysis.  
10 
You mentioned this yesterday.  Could you just deal with that again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about in the statement are you now? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Paragraph 59 page 19 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
R HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.  I did send the statement of 
Colonel Madilonga for analysis and it is the only statement in the 
docket that I - that I had challenges with and she did not take time - the 
expert.  She came back to me and she sent an email together with an 
attachment of how she analysed the statement and then she indicated 
that the statement of Madilonga was not a truthful reflection of what 
20 
happened. 
It - it for some reason confirmed my suspicion and I still 
remember because I slightly bounced it with advocate just in passing 
and he kind of really (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Advocate Mosing? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 123 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he said to me what is 
statement analysis.  The discussion took very, very short.  He - he just 
said if the - the witness is not really telling the truth he can be 
subjected to cross-examination.  You know and - and I probably I just 
got the sentence that he was not really getting the sense of what I was 
talking about. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  This statement analysis if you have a regard 
to your supplementary affidavit it is at - there is an annexure at page 
10 
380.  It will be right at the end of the bundle.  If you can have a look at 
that please. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is this the email that you are referring to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is the email. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it says: 
“Attached is the statement of Madilonga.  I did a 
statement analysis scan on it and this statement is 
not a truthful reflection of what happened.  We can 
discuss it later today when I phone you.” 
20 
If you could then have regard to page 60. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I am there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is this the statement and the analysis? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you will see in the statement that he says 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 124 of 191 
 
on page 60 halfway down.  He says: 
“Before 
I 
was 
transferred 
I was 
working at 
Beitbridge Police Station as a Commander.  My 
duties included crime prevention, liaison with 
immigration officials and other police officials from 
other stations.” 
Was he stationed at the border in Zimbabwe? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was stationed at the border - 
South African side. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The South African side? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is he saying that it is there that he saw 
the Zimbabwean Officials who wanted to talk to Dramat? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That statement is not signed or is it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That statement is not signed is it at page 60?  Is that 
the one you are dealing with Ms Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It is.  Chair my understanding is that 
what has happened is that the - the statement has been analysed.  So 
20 
it has been copied word for word and then the use of words is then 
analysed and you will see with footnotes the - the expert’s analysis as 
to what each aspect of the - the statement indicated to her to ultimately 
form a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but am I right to say it is not signed? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 125 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  This statement is not signed but I do not 
believe that is this actual statement itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was there a - is there a signed one? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There is a signed one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is exactly the same except for the shading? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So what when I sent the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  She made it clear that I should 
not send - I need to send the soft copy or she type the statement 
because she does the things in the system.  So I told her that I took - 
the statement was typed by me before he could sign.  So I sent her the 
soft copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Can we start now to deal 
with …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the legal status of that analysis? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I do not believe that there … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There is a legal status of that analysis.  I 
imagine it is very much the same as lie detectors tests and voice stress 
tests. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 126 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  They are just I imagine tools used by 
investigators to get a sense do I trust this person or not and - but we 
can address that to this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I - I do not think we need to go into details … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it has got no legal status … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But to the extent that it may have influenced - the 
10 
analysis may have influenced Mr Khuba in any way he can indicate 
what it is that influenced him.  You understand that Mr Khuba? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying that this - the analysis of the statement 
the - the legal status of the analysis I am not sure about it and 
Ms Wentzel is not sure about it and what that means is whether legally 
one can rely on that but to the extent that it may have - the analysis 
may have influenced your thinking then you may just indicate one, two, 
three or whatever features that influenced you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The analysis I was not really 
20 
aware of its legal status … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But what it helped me was to 
check what I was dealing with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 127 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And also to approach certain 
issues with caution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now in terms of the first report 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  This - this report was somehow 
not part of the - the docket.  I did not file it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This analysis? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  this - the analysis.  It was - it 
10 
was not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not in the docket? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the first report.  So it did not influence the 
first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay and did it at any stage - you know get into 
the docket even after the first report? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  When I filed 
other evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I included it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay and would it have influenced the second 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 128 of 191 
 
report as far as you are concerned because I know there were three 
people signed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Not - not necessarily.  It was 
mentioned … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But it did not have such an 
impact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was - it did not have a significant impact? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It did not have the significant 
impact. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in your own mind it could not be - you did not 
disregard it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did not disregard it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You took note of it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Before I go onto a new 
topic the Chair asked did you remember the first name of Mr Moyo who 
20 
you referred to.  Have you remembered since? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what do you remember his first name to 
be? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it is Bongani Moyo. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 129 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bongani Moyo? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Chair if I can have an indication 
of how late you want to sit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Let us talk about that.  I think you may have 
indicated to me before that you think Colonel Naidoo might take two 
days.  Is that right? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now he was supposed to have started today and 
10 
therefore tomorrow would have been a second day. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If - if he starts tomorrow is he going to go into 
Monday? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the plan or … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there another witness scheduled for Monday? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What I understand is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think next week was the week where certain 
20 
implicated persons were supposed to be scheduled for or to give 
evidence but I understand that there may have been certain challenges 
but I am - I am going to briefed later about it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I also understand that there are some 
challenges and there may be space next week.  I - I also understand 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 130 of 191 
 
from Ms Norman that there are two witnesses who you would like her to 
lead next week.  She had some challenges with the one witness who 
would only be available on the Tuesday but not the Wednesday but 
subject to the - the other issues around the calendar which I am not 
entirely sure of being settled. 
She said she would not have a problem if Colonel Naidoo 
testified on the Friday and the Monday.  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think that still is an issue that needs to be 
resolved with the legal team. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay well.  We will finalise the issue of Monday 
tomorrow but I think if it suits everybody I am prepared to stay - to sit 
longer.  Certainly up to five but maybe up to six. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your side how does the situation look? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I think I - I will need a bit longer 
because I also need to canvas this Werksmans Report in - in some 
detail and having regard to your indication earlier this morning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And - and … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are saying you are available to - to continue 
until five … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if need be until six? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I could.  What I might ask for Chair is 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 131 of 191 
 
just some time overnight … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  To be able to go through this Werksmans 
Report more carefully with the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So that I can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe tomorrow morning. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Lead him properly on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we could start with him tomorrow morning just 
to finalise those aspects … 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we start with Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Khuba how is your situation?  If we sit until 
five or maybe even until six would that be convenient to you or would 
that be a problem? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is fine with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine with you.  Okay.  For now let us say let us 
sit - let us to up to five and then at 5 o’ clock we will review the 
situation.  Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I now want to deal Mr Khuba in some detail 
with what is called your first report, your amended first report and then 
your second report. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 132 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Ms Wentzel.  Alright.  Yes continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  So I am dealing now from 
paragraph 61 of your statement page 19 of the bundle.  Just so that you 
have an idea.  We know that your first - the first report is dated 
22 January 2014 and we will go there in a minute but could you please 
tell the Chair under what circumstances that so called first report was 
prepared? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you.  While I was 
investigating the case I was preparing a report in a form of typing the 
statements.  Now some of these statements that I obtained where I got 
10 
an opportunity to type them while interviewing the witness.  Instead of 
just evaluating and taking a certain part of that statement I would copy 
it the way it is into the - the report. 
I will indicate the name of the witness and the category in 
which it is filed in the docket and then I will leave the information 
there.  So the report becomes so voluminous because of that but there, 
there will be things that I change.  For example because the witness 
will say I.  Then I - because it is in a report I will say he or she but put 
exactly the same thing that the person said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you just change it and put in the third person? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 133 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because it was a requirement 
that you summarise the statement in terms of our policy which now has 
changed.  So I would put that because I did not want to go into you 
know a lot of work at the end of the investigation and at some times 
when I look at the docket it had almost 90 something statements. 
So it was not an easy thing to do at once.  So I am just doing 
it gradually.  Now that report I would update it but I started to share it 
with the person who was guiding the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The investigation? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Investigation - Advocate Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just before you proceed.  Just now what you 
were saying about statements was that - was that in relation to 
statements going to the docket or was that what you - was going to a 
report or different reports? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No.  It was the statement going 
into the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I will - if that statement is 
typed … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then commissioned … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What would happen is that the 
information that I have … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 134 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In the computer I will copy the 
entire statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Into the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh to prepare the report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To prepare the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  So your report would consist to a very 
large extent to - of the same material that is - of the contents of the 
various statements? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I started to share the 
statement or the - the report rather with my partner Colonel Moukangwe 
and the advocate who was guiding the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   Just something basic when you conduct an 
investigation such as this and you talk about a docket in the context of 
IPID would you have, would the docket have come from IPID and when 
you submit the docket to the NPA you actually submit the IPID docket 
as it were to the NPA, or would the NPA have their own docket and you 
20 
just submit the contents of your docket to them, to their docket and you 
remain with your docket? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It will be the same docket, when 
we uplift the docket from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The NPA? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 135 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The NPA, no, no from the SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because the investigation would 
have started by SAPS, they registered the case, then they open a 
docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When we go to uplift the docket 
we will take that docket the way it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As it is yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then we would either 
10 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Add statements to it. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Add statement to it or put it 
inside IPID docket, but that time I do not know whether we had IPID 
docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because we had a challenge 
where when the DPP decide on the case, and it had to be returned back 
they will look at the station and say a station and we end up not getting 
that docket. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So we came to the decision to 
say if then it is a docket, SAPS docket we will take the cover of that 
docket and then put it in our docket, it will always remain our docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes, so that they know they must refer – 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 136 of 191 
 
they must send it back to you and you are the ones who will send it to 
the station? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, so but before that system you worked 
with an SAPS docket, you would work with an SAPS docket that came 
from the SAPS, if this – the matter started with the SAPS? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct, in fact in this 
case I took, because the docket was voluminous, I had to take the 
actual docket cover, cut it nicely, put it on the pocket of an 
...[indistinct] so they were having on the outside. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But it was not IPID docket it was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just lever arch files. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  And when you submitted the docket to the 
NPA you were effectively submitting either a lever arch file or more 
than lever arch files but with the docket cover on the outside? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Mr Khuba what was the purpose of compiling 
a report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  A report was a requirement of 
the department to say you need to simplify so that whenever a person 
before he reads the docket he may have to just browse through to say 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 137 of 191 
 
where do I find this statement in the docket 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now we were also required to 
make recommendation, they would say you may not be legally qualified 
but use your opinion and express your opinion in that recommendation 
report, and they would not want you to say I would want you to – I 
recommend that you take a decision, they will say evaluate yourself, 
they are not bound by that recommendation but ...[indistinct] to express 
that because of one, two, three I recommend that this person be 
charged criminally.  Now that has currently changed, after we were 
10 
charged, we no longer summarise the statement, we no longer 
recommend in terms of specifics, for us just to say these are the 
statements in the docket, it is A1, A2, A3 and we mention the name of 
these people, and then at the bottom there we recommend that you take 
decision in this matter, whether the docket may be almost ten or fifteen 
or twenty arc files the report may remain two pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is because of the experience when the three of 
you were charged because of those two reports. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so in a way charging you had a negative effect in 
20 
the sense that the NPA now no longer has the benefit of your own 
analysis and views of what you think even if they were not going to be 
bound by that. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You now just throw everything to them and say 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 138 of 191 
 
effectively you study the docket and make a decision? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if we have regard to this first report of the 
22 n d of January 2014 and if you have a look at Annexure 8 page 68 all 
the way through to page 102. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 68? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to what page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  102. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Is that your first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now before we have a look at your 
recommendations in that report did you submit this report to the NPA? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And who did you submit it to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Advocate Mosing. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you discuss this report, or received 
input on the report from Advocate Mosing as to the content of the 
20 
report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Could you just give some detail in that 
regard please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just before that we have been referring to this 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 139 of 191 
 
report as the first report, but was it your first report or were there other 
reports before it, it is just that it is one, it is the first of two reports that 
are in issue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There were a number of reports 
that I sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before this one? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Before this one, because I would 
take the report to him and sometimes when I instead of him having to 
read the statement I will just take the entire statement into that report 
and he will read the report, we will sit down with also Colonel 
10 
Moukangwe and discuss and they would advise me in terms of what are 
the important issues that I need to highlight and during that discussion 
I noted that.  It is just that I could not get some copies of the report 
where I think on some of them he would write with his pen to say this is 
where I want you to highlight certain issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm.  Is there anything that makes this so-called 
first report different from any of the earlier reports? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The earlier reports were slightly 
different because of the amount of evidence that was going in, but it 
was just a build-up, it was a build-up that is what I can say the 
20 
difference were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were the other earlier reports marked interim reports 
in any way or was any term used to suggest that they were work in 
progress or they were not final reports, was – is there anything that 
either was written on them to suggest that or was it – would it have 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 140 of 191 
 
been clear from anybody reading them that they were not final reports? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No there was nothing that I 
could say that I put – unless if it was on the recommendation, I cannot 
remember, but I think what was different from this one is that this one I 
signed it and the others I will just produce them the way they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the other ones were not signed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They were not signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but are you able to say whether or not there was 
an understanding between yourself and Advocate Mosing with regard to 
the earlier reports that they could not be final? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was an understanding and 
I think I need to say this Chairperson that what made me to be more 
comfortable and relaxed was the issue that I thought he was the one 
who was going to decide on the case.   For me it was just an issue of 
working together and my ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean you thought he was the one who was going 
to make a decision whether to prosecute or not to prosecute? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I trusted him because when 
20 
you have an investigation guided by a prosecutor you start to 
understand that the eye of looking at it it is prosecution driven, so – 
and quite often I had been doing investigation for a long time, where 
sometimes I learn in a hard way, where you would try to push to say I 
have this evidence, this evidence, this evidence, and the prosecutor 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 141 of 191 
 
says wow I am the one that is going to stand there.  What you are 
saying I cannot be able to prove, so I have learnt to just consume 
humble pie when it comes to certain opinions about the value of 
specific evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say between the two of you, you were 
satisfied that he knew or would have known that those were not final 
reports, the earlier ones. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, and with regard to this one is there 
anything that would have told him whether this one was final or not 
10 
final, when he by looking at it or reading it leaving out whatever the two 
of you may have discussed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The issue is that the previous 
report I am not sure of the one shortly before this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before this one yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But we worked on this report and 
we had been working on it as a draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean the two of you, Advocate Mosing – oh no, 
yourself and your partner. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
I 
was 
also 
with 
Colonel 
20 
Moukangwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes ja, your partner in the investigation or a 
member of your team. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 The 
one was 
from Crime 
Intelligence whom I say ...[intervenes]  
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 142 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay oh okay ja, is that the one you are not 
supposed to ...[intervenes]  
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one you are supposed to keep secret. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes.  So the two of you had been working on it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The three of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, who is the third? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is Advocate Mosing and it is 
Colonel Moukangwe and one time I think Advocate Billinowitz[?] was 
10 
also part of that because he would, he was not regular in our meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he from the NPA too? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so are you saying therefore that this first report 
was the product of the four of you working together but one of you that 
you have just mentioned was not regular, but the three of you were 
regular? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Was it usual for you to prepare an IPID 
20 
report together with the NPA? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It wasn’t because at the time 
when I started to open up fully to Mr Sesoko and also spoke to McBride 
I still remember McBride saying to me IPID makes recommendation to 
NPA and not with NPA.  So I found that it was a valid point, it was a 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 143 of 191 
 
valid point, but I think sometimes it becomes so – you become 
comfortable that the lines are blurred you cannot really see, you talk, 
you laugh, you share lunch there, it does not become like something 
that protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You end u like you are a team? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And could you tell the Chair how senior an 
advocate was Advocate Mosing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I was introduced to him I 
10 
was told that he is the head of Special Operation.  Now that part told 
me that I was not dealing with a just ordinary prosecutor.  I was dealing 
with somebody very, very, very senior, to such an extent that even an 
opportunity to throw an opinion I will have internal assessment of that 
to say I do not want to make myself as stupid as ... will it be right to 
ask these questions, because I was not dealing with a junior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And in the course of your discussions about 
your report and being told amend this, add this, change you said in 
20 
manuscript, 
was 
it 
made 
clear 
to 
you 
what 
your 
ultimate 
recommendation should be? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was because it was not only to 
deal with the body of the report, it went down to the recommendation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And what were you told when you were 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 144 of 191 
 
dealing with that, what was discussed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The evidence that we were 
discussing was the issue of General Dramat on a number of aspects 
that I have already alluded to, which include the statement of 
Madilonga, the CI member statements, as well as the progress or 
success reports.   Now when it came to the issue of General Sibiya it 
was basically the issue of witness statements and there was also an 
issue that because I did a 205, when we checked we found that one of 
the persons who was doing operation contacted, I think there were a 
number of calls but they were not quite frequent as such, but there 
10 
were a number of contacts between General Sibiya with that Colonel 
and when he during our discussion it was indicated that it means that 
he was reporting progress of how they were arresting the Zimbabwean 
National. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So if you go to the end of your report at page 
101 of the bundle you will see that the recommendation there from you 
is 
based 
on 
the 
available 
evidence, 
the 
Independent 
Police 
Investigative Directorate recommends that Lt General Dramat, Major 
General Sibiya, Lt Colonel Maleleka, Constable Radebe, Captain Nkosi 
and Warrant Officer McCauw be charged criminally for: 
20 
1. Kidnapping, and  
2. Defeating the ends of justice, and 
3. Assault and theft, only applicable to Captain Maleleka, Warrant 
Officer McCauw and Constable Radebe and Captain Nkosi. 
Was that your recommendation? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 145 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And is that your signature on that report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And could you explain to the Chair why did 
you sign this report? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry why did you? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I asked why did he sign this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  During December it was the time 
when I was subjected to a lot of pressure that he wanted the report, 
10 
and he wanted the docket. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Sorry who is he? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Advocate Mosing. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I kept on giving excuses to 
say but they were not – they were valid excuses because I was 
preoccupied in the office.  Number one it was an issue of saying I was 
busy with an unrested ...[indistinct] and I had to help my office to meet 
the strategic objectives.    
 
Now the biggest challenge was that one time I felt I need to 
20 
give this person what he wanted, even though the things were not really 
complete, because I thought he just wanted probably what is there is 
enough for him to take a decision, and then I indicated to him that I 
have a problem with the report because I was not really signing these 
reports and I said it needs to be signed by the head of the Department, 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 146 of 191 
 
so at that time Ms Koekie Mbeki was no longer coming to the office, as 
I have already alluded earlier she sent a message through her PA that 
she was only able to sign financial related documents.   
 
Now I had a problem to say what do I now.  I asked him and he 
said no you can sign the report and send it.  Then I signed the report 
and sent to him, but that part I could not have a full recollection of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The signing part? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The signing of the report.  On 
the reason that there were a lot of reports that I sent to – that 
exchanged hands between me and him and also when I was queried 
10 
about the report by Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride it was not about whether 
I sent the report to NP, that was clear that I sent the report, but it was 
whether I signed the report and that was in 2015 when they were asking 
those questions whether there was a report. 
 
Now the issue there was that when I went to collect the docket 
from Advocate van Zyl we perused that docket together, there was no 
report, but if the report was there it could have – in fact they wouldn’t 
have asked the question, because they would have found it when we 
were doing the review of that evidence and also preparing the final 
report. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So you say that when you fetched the docket 
and we are going to deal with the sequence later, we found that this 
what we are calling the first report was not in the docket. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   What was in the docket by way of a report? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 147 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, is that now – are you at a stage where you 
are dealing with the second report now? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is still this report? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What was in the docket, when 
we perused the docket we found ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now before compiling the first report or when 
10 
the first report was ready?  What was the stage where ...[intervenes]  
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think let me put it in 
perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I will start from where it started 
first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to keep my eye on the times and the 
timeframes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Let me start where things 
started first.  Now after the submission of the docket and the report 
20 
then I started getting evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you say and report you mean and the first 
report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The first report and the report, I 
said and the report, I mean the first report. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 148 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now what happened was that in 
fact when I sent that report I was constantly calling the expert who was 
analysing the cell phone records of General Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he told me that he was 
doing a business of water, setting plants for water, Botswana and a 
number of countries.  Then he told me that he was busy in the project, 
he could not have time to finish but now he is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He has got, he has done the 
plotting, and unfortunately he had that news for me, and he said 
General Sibiya was not at Fourways as alleged by witnesses, and he 
was not at Diepsloot as alleged by witnesses.   
 
Now when I got that information the report had already gone 
but I just felt let me send something to Mr Sesoko because I used to 
send a report for him to take it Secretariat for update.   Now I did 
another report and I sent an email on the 23 r d, the report for Advocate 
Mosing was despatched on the 22 n d.  On the 23 r d, the following day, I 
did a report that had a change in recommendation, it says I still 
20 
recommended General Dramat, but when I came to General Sibiya 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you still recommended that action – that General 
Dramat be charged? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 149 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But with General Sibiya I said I 
do not recommend any criminal charges against General Sibiya 
because the cell phone records has shown that he was not at the 
scene.   That is how I put it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now that report I just sent it, I 
left like that, now there was a time I got now the response of General 
Sibiya, he sent his warning statement, he sent the warning statement 
through the PA, I got it, there was a change of hand between the – Mr 
10 
Sesoko and the PA on that report and it ended up coming to me, then 
when I got that report I then sent it to Advocate Mosing to show I have 
the new evidence and that time I had already known about the cell 
phone records.   Now when I sent that report – those responses he 
responded to me on an email dated 28 t h February 2014, and it was just 
shortly after a month, after I sent the first report, to say that I have 
acquired this evidence and he said the docket is not with him, it is in 
Gauteng, but I got an indication that it was with Advocate van Zyl in 
Gauteng.  Then I took that email as it saying to me I need to go and 
collect this docket, so that I can attach the evidence. 
20 
 
McBride according to my understanding then started working 
on the 3 r d, somewhere there, on the 3 r d of March and then I was called 
I think it was on the 5 t h to brief him on high profile cases, so in the 
Department we had two main high profile cases, it was the rendition 
case, as well as the Cato Manor case which I investigated earlier but it 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 150 of 191 
 
was then handed over to a director from Mpumalanga, Glen Angus. 
 
So when we briefed him we were together.  On the 5 t h he was 
the one who started.  He briefed him about Cato Manor.  It took some 
time but I was just listening.  Then my opportunity came.  Then I 
briefed him about the rendition investigation but because I was the 
second in terms of briefing I could not finish and he said we will meet 
the following day. 
That was on the 6 t h.  Now during the briefing I remember 
Mr Sesoko was there.  The issue of not involving him I indicated that.  
The issue of collaboration with the CI Official Colonel Moukangwe.  I 
10 
indicated that.  Now I still remember vividly when it come to the issue 
of excluding Mr Sesoko that Mr McBride says if in this department I 
give you this instruction please refuse and I did not say anything. 
I just looked at him on the basis that when you are a 
subordination sometimes there it is grey line because you look at what I 
am being told to do.  Does it constitute misconduct or contravention or 
any policy of the department?  There are things that you look at and 
say this is not - it is not right.  There is something not right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean when you get giving an instruction 
sometimes you - you listen to or look at the instruction and say this 
20 
instruction is not right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it is - it is unlawful.  It is illegal or it might be 
contrary to the policies of the organisation and if I were to do it I may 
be committing misconduct.  Is that what you are talking about? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 151 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I am saying is that there is 
some instructions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That may not be right … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But not necessarily unlawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like - like ethically? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I just looked at him to 
say if then you tell me not to report there and you are the Head of the 
Department your instruction may not sound right - may - but may not be 
necessarily unlawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So when he said if I give you that instruction 
you must refuse.  What instruction was he talking about? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To exclude or to side-line the 
National Head of Investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Was that - did he say that in - in reaction to you 
20 
telling him that Ms Mbeki had asked you to exclude Mr Sesoko from the 
investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Before you proceed let us go back to the 
first report.  Now when you sent it to the NPA would you have sent it 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 152 of 191 
 
together with the docket as it were - whatever files that you would call 
the docket with all the statements that you have collected from various 
witnesses and other evidence? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In fact it - it is a policy 
requirement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That you cannot send a docket - 
a report without docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That report must accompany the 
10 
docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm and that is what you did? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - okay and you may have said something about 
this earlier or even yesterday.  A report such as the types of reports 
that IPID personnel or investigators would send to the NPA which had 
recommendations always went with the statements or maybe sometimes 
the statements would already be with the NPA and the report would just 
be - to be added to the docket. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What is required is that you take 
20 
both together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Which means it is the copies of 
the docket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 153 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Or the actual docket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Together with the - the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
It 
is 
in 
the 
- 
in 
the 
recommendation to SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That you will make copies of the 
docket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then put a report on top … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then send it to SAPS for 
them to initiate disciplinary steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and whoever has to make a decision at the NPA 
about whether to prosecute or not to prosecute on what would - would 
they need to base their decision? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They need to base their decision 
on a docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In fact I have spoken with a 
number of prosecutors saying that we do not even read sometimes the 
report that you send. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Some of them indicated that I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 154 of 191 
 
may - it may help me only to check or this statement where is it filed in 
the docket.  Then they will be able to navigate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is why Chairperson when I 
am seated here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Really my heart goes out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That something which was not 
supposed to be anything to be concerned about … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Became a big deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That interfered with my career. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That landed me in the cell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So it is something that I have 
not yet got even a concrete answer about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well that is - that is why I ask these questions 
20 
and I have been asking them.  I asked them with Mr Sesoko.  I asked 
them with Mr McBride because I am trying to understand what it is 
really that was a problem but also I am trying to understand whether 
there is something that I do not understand in what you, Mr Sesoko and 
Mr McBride have been telling me that may make me thing that the NPA 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 155 of 191 
 
and Werksmans and maybe the Minister were abusing their powers 
when maybe there was something. 
Maybe I just do not see it.  So that is why I keep on asking 
these questions because I am trying to understand whether really we 
could be dealing here with a situation where certain people were just 
abusing their powers.  You people had absolutely nothing wrong or 
whether maybe there was something wrong.  I just do not see it.  That - 
that is why I keep on asking these questions. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now the - Chairperson the - the 
challenge with this case is that both reports were in the hands of NPA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I still remember the 
charges.  They said I deleted the January report which is the first 
report.  I deleted it.  There is something that was deleted in the report.  
That report if they give you a copy there was nothing deleted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The fact is that it was not similar 
in everything with the second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were certain things which you could find in the 
first report … 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you would not find in the second report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it did not mean they were deleted from the first 
report? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 156 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These were two separate reports? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now the report constituted - did the reports that 
you prepared as IPID personnel or investigators including the ones that 
we are dealing with here.  Did they constitute the investigators 
summary or the investigators understanding of what the evidence is 
that is to be found in the statements and to the extent that the 
investigator made a recommendation that was just his opinion as he 
sees the evidence? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  The report itself 
it is after summarising … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Or taking synopsis from each 
and every statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You go down there and express 
your view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  If probably because you may 
20 
find that some investigator did not do law.  They just have extensive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, experience? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You get sometimes … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 157 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And investigator … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Analysing in such a way that the 
defence will not even argue - will laugh at you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because it does not make sense 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But we allow that because it was 
10 
a policy requirement to say we do this report just (indistinct) there you 
- it - it was like a game for us to say how we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We analyse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It had no bearing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the decision of SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it have …? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the - on the decision of DPP. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now maybe just to get it.  You yourself you - you are 
not a lawyer.  You do not have a legal background or you do have some 
legal background? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did law  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 158 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Courses and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I cannot really be compared 
with a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Practicing lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but for your position you do not necessarily 
require to - to have a Law Degree? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or at that time what - the position that you had at the 
time. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They required either - it - it 
depends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is not a requirement is that 
you have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must have a Degree. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You need to have knowledge of 
20 
the Criminal Law. You may have a - a Degree in Investigation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And Honours … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But what happens is that you 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 159 of 191 
 
apply law on - on your level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On - ja, on your level. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On your level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For example at the Provincial 
Level … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Most of reports they come to me 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then I will take these 
reports … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And check them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And - and during those days 
because we used to analyse … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I will tell the investigator oh 
here … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is superficial analysis? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja, this is one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will you do more work. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We will talk and laugh about it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 160 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he said no I feel that we 
need to put it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then because I am the Head of 
the Office I will end up telling him what to - to put there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To put in, ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the requirement that you should put in the reports 
where did that requirement come from?  Was it an IPID requirement?  
Was it an NPA requirement?  Was it a requirement based - that came 
10 
from a policy document?  Was it - did it come from a regulation?  Did it 
come from an Act of Parliament?  Where did that come from? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was it just a practice? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Fortunately Chairperson I was 
involved in the process of the formation of IPID Act itself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I did a number of public … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Engagements? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Engagements … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Engagements. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the - on the bill. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the bill itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 161 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
Now 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
recommendation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was already a practice that we 
send … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  A docket together with a report 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
And 
then 
you 
make 
10 
recommendation.  Now in terms of the Act … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Act talks about two types of 
recommendation.  The recommendation to SAPS for disciplinary steps.  
The recommendation to NPA for them to take the decision on that 
docket but on SAPS it is where there is some level of obligation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the side of SAP because it 
indicates that upon receipt of IPID … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Recommendation they need to 
initiate departmental process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there - there is some kind of expectation that they 
must give effect or implement the recommendation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct but that … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 162 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the SAPS? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But that obligation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Is not there in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the N - NPA? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hence there is an issue now that 
10 
when we send our recommendation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We recommend that - we 
recommend that you take decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is still recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words what you are telling me is as far as 
the NPA is concerned they were not obliged to even look at your 
recommendation or even look at your - at - at the reports.  Is that right?  
They could look at it if they wanted to.  They could disregard it and just 
20 
look at the statements in the docket and make their decision and if they 
did not look at it you would have no cost to complain because it - it - 
they were not bound by your opinions. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson what you are saying 
now it is what was said in the statement … 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 163 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Of a person whom I collected 
this rendition from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To say I am not bound by this 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yet when I collected … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was not yet charged. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Despite this statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that now Advocate Mosing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Advocate Van Zyl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Van Zyl.  He - he being from the NPA as well? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but - but basically we are going back to saying 
these reports really had no legal status.  You might or might not be 
20 
able to answer that but they had no legal status with the NPA.  They - 
they could not make it a - a decision and say it is because the IPID 
investigator said so. 
They - they would have to base their decisions on the 
statements in the docket. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 164 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct Chairperson.  I 
can say that they do not have legal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Status. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  However what we use … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We use only statistical … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Information to say … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  How many recommendation - 
because recommendation referred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It means docket referred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  So - so now you see it raises this 
question again of why was such a big fight - why did such a big fight 
get initiated because you gave them an opinion of what you thought in 
the first report and later gave - gave them an opinion that was different 
from the first opinion.  Why did it matter for purposes of their decision? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson I think this was an 
issue of being hit by whatever object is available for a person who 
wants to deal with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  If there was something else I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 165 of 191 
 
think they would have used that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
But 
it 
was 
an 
object 
of 
convenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That they use this report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To put us in the cell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They used this report to make 
10 
sure that I am dismissed and stayed for almost two years with a job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Just because you gave an opinion. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In one way - one way and then you gave another 
opinion in a different and you had - you had your reasons for the 
different opinions and - and they were not bound by your opinions.  
They - they could have said he - he is made and then just make their 
own decision. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Do you want to continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us - at 5 o’ clock we will - we will decide- 
we will decide.  Just continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  I want to unpack what you have 
been saying because we can show it through the documentation the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 166 of 191 
 
sequence of events and how your views changed from your first report, 
your amended report and then what is called the second report.  Now it 
is - it is important also that the criticism - and you must tell me if I am 
right - was between the difference between the first report and the 
second report. 
There was no criticism of the - or comparison between your 
amended fist report because you amended the first report because you 
said 
after 
you 
got 
the 
cellphone 
records 
you 
changed 
the 
recommendation that General Sibiya be charged because it proved that 
what the witnesses were saying was not true but the two reports that 
10 
you were charged about was the first and the second. 
The amended report was not referred to.  Am I correct in that 
regard? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  When you refer to the amended 
report are you referring to the report to which I understood you to refer 
earlier where you said after you had submitted what we call the first 
report there was another report that you submitted.  I do not know if 
you said it was one page but you submitted another report before what 
20 
we call the second report.  Is my understanding correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  It was where I 
made an amendment but that amendment was not made in a full report 
but only on the recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was it one page? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 167 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not - it was …? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was a complete report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a complete and that is the one where you say 
you recommended that General Sibiya should not be charged … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you stayed with the recommendation that 
General Dramat be charged? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words you - you filed a number of reports 
10 
earlier where you made no recommendations? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I made one between the first and 
what is called the second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I am talking about before the first 
report. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made - you made a number of - of - you 
submitted a number of reports? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in those reports there was no recommendation? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
There 
was 
- 
there 
was 
recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Relating to the two - General Sibiya and 
General Dramat? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 168 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what were the recommendations in regard to 
that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was the recommendation that 
they - I was recommending that they should be charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Was that in a number of reports or only 
one of the earlier reports that you talked about or you cannot 
remember? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Depending on the issue that 
when we say number or reports … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is how many times have given 
to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
Advocate Mosing 
or 
Colonel Moukangwe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But however most of the time 
when I would give him the recommendation will sometimes remain like 
that but I put statement in (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that is fine.  So - but then we come to 
20 
the report that we have called the first report.  In that first report your 
recommendation is both General Sibiya and General Dramat should be 
charged? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you say soon after you had submitted that 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 169 of 191 
 
first report there was another report that you submitted and that report 
changed - was different in terms of recommendations to the first one? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was different in this respect that in regard to 
General Sibiya you now said he should not be charged but with regard 
to General Dramat you remained with the recommendation that he 
should be charged? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there was what we call the second report 
but maybe we should be calling it the third report … 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not want to confuse the record.  What we call 
the - the second report and in the second report you then changed your 
mind about General Dramat as well in terms of your recommendation 
and then in the second report you took the view that even 
General Dramat should not be charged? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
when 
you 
were 
being 
confronted 
with 
discrepancies between the first report and the second report - and I 
think that is the question that Ms Wentzel was putting - nobody was 
20 
talking about the - the amended report.  The one that was between the 
two reports? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where already you had changed your mind about - 
with regard to the recommendation relating to General Sibiya.  You had 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 170 of 191 
 
changed your mind about that one … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the amended one but you had not changed your 
mind in regard to the recommendation relating to General Dramat? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when it came to the second report you had 
changed your mind about both of them? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Let us - how much - how much 
time do you estimate we will need to finish his evidence? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think probably about two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About two hours? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  So if we were to go for another hour we 
would then at least reduce his time on the stand tomorrow to at least an 
hour if your estimate is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  If my estimate is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I need to have a meeting about among other 
things the program for next week and I need - that - that meeting 
should be very short and I am tempted to say because both of you said 
20 
we could go up to six.  I am tempted to say I should adjourn for about 
15 or so minutes. 
Deal with that issue and then come back and we continue for 
about an hour up to 6 o’ clock or just after six and so that if we - so 
that we then - remain with maybe one hour with him for tomorrow. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 171 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  That is convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khuba that would still be fine with you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is okay chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  We are - we are going to adjourn 
then for a very short time up to quarter past five and then we resume.  
We adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s continue, we have a job to do yes, thank 
you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I beg your pardon before we leave the issue 
of the first report you said that…[intervenes].   
CHAIRPERSON:    I think you might be too far from your mic. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You said that your investigation wasn’t 
complete at the stage you submitted the first report, could you tell the 
Chair what was outstanding? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There were a number of things 
that were outstanding, it was a warning statement of General Sibiya 
20 
and General Dramat.  The analysis of the cell phone record for General 
Sibiya. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And did you tell Advocate Mosing that these 
things were still outstanding? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes I did. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 172 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was his attitude? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said despite the outstanding 
information I needed to submit a docket with the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That is still in relation to the first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and he knew that you – or rather let me ask 
this question, as at that time when you submitted your first report, did 
you intend to make efforts to get those statements? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct I continued with 
the investigation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did he know that, Advocate Mosing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And obviously if he knew that you were going to 
continue with the investigation he would know that whatever you got 
from the investigation would have to be factored into – would have to 
be put into the docket? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he know exactly what else you were going to be 
looking into as part the investigation other than trying to obtain the 
statement from – did you say General Sibiya and General Dramat? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct, he knew that the 
cell phone analysis, because he was the one who gave me instruction 
to get an expert who would analyse the location of the two Generals 
when they received and made calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But at the stage at which you submitted the first 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 173 of 191 
 
report, were there any cell phone records relating to the two Generals 
that were there in the docket and that had been analysed already? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They were no yet analysed 
because they used something that we call coordinates, these are 
numbers, you may find there’s four or five numbers and they will 
indicate the name of the tower but the name of the tower will not 
exactly tell you where because it may be named -  probably a name of a 
person, you may not know that it wasn’t – but  he, when we discussed, 
we had an agreement to say let’s get these coordinates to be plotted on 
a Google map so that we can know exactly where was this person 
10 
standing when he received or made a call. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So there were cell phone records in the docket at 
the time you submitted the first report but those cell phone records had 
not yet been analysed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And that can make a big difference? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you, now you’ve testified that after you 
received these cell phone records they showed that General Sibiya was 
20 
– could not have been at the place where the witnesses had placed him 
and so it disproved what the witnesses had said? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry is it the analysis of the cell phone records 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 174 of 191 
 
that revealed that, in other words not just the records but the analysis 
or the records themselves also disproved without the analysis? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  If the record clearly disapproved 
that, there would not have been a need to analyse them. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay so from the records which were in the 
docket – from the cell phone records that were in the docket, those 
records did not disprove what the witnesses had said? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And that gave rise to the need for the records to be 
analysed so as to establish exactly where the two persons were? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I may wish to add there 
because there was a time when we went through the record together 
and we got some funny names in terms of towers and I still remember 
Advocate was saying this one seems to be where – but it was all about 
guesswork and that’s where he said, Mr Khuba get the thing analysed 
by the expert. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So apart from the fact that you, yourself may have 
been intending that there should be an analysis of the cell phone 
20 
records, he himself told you to please get the records analysed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was his idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It was his idea? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 175 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So now, once you received this information, 
you changed your recommendation that General Sibiya should be 
charged and you produced, what I’ve referred to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you need to be careful about the terminology, 
you know when you say, he changed his recommendation, it could mean 
he changed his view about the recommendation but it also could mean 
he physically changed a recommendation that had been made. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    I appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair and that is an important distinction.  
10 
What I meant is that you, in essence changed your mind or changed 
your view, you didn’t take the report and amend the first report 
physically, you produced a new report that had a different conclusion? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    So if you have a look at page 104 of the 
bundle you’ll see that that this is an email from you dated the 23 r d of 
January 2014 to Mr Sesoko and it says, 
 
“Diepsloot [indistinct] case report”. 
 
So did you send this report to Mr Sesoko?  
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why did you send it to him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I wanted him to deliver 
it to the Secretary of Police as he used to do for me. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    So if we have a look at…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Which one is this report, is it the first report, is it 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 176 of 191 
 
the amended report, is it the second report? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is this the amended report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is the amended between 
the first and the second. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay let’s -  think let’s call it the amended report 
because if we change and say it’s the second report as it should have 
been said, should have been labelled, it will cause confusion.  So we 
have the first report, the amended report and the second report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair and the reason that the 
terminology was used is because in the subsequent charges and 
10 
disciplinary proceedings it was the distinction between what was called 
a first report and a second report, so it was in that context that, that 
terminology was used. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if we have a look at page 129 of the 
bundle it says, recommendation and then at page 130 now reads, 
 
“Based on the available evidence the Independent Police 
 
Investigative Directorate recommends that General Dramat, 
 
Lieutenant Colonel Malaleka, Constable Radebe, Captain S C 
 
Nkosi and Warrant Officer Makoe be criminally – charged  
20 
 
criminally of, again kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice, 
 
assault and theft only applicable to Captain Malaleka, 
 
Warrant Office Makoe, Constable Radebe and Captain Nkosi, 
 
then in brackets it says (the Independent  Police Investigative 
 
Directorate cannot recommend any criminal  charge against 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 177 of 191 
 
 
Major General Sibiya because the witnesses versions are not 
 
corroborated by other evidence that he was at the crime 
 
scene e.g. cell phone records)”. 
 
Is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I had a look at some stage, either last night or this 
morning at the Werksmans report and I made the mistake but I think 
somewhere it may have – it may be saying something to the effect that 
it is not true that there were no cell phone – there was no cell phone 
analysis at the time of making – submitting the first report because it 
10 
was there but it may be that it doesn’t say that maybe it says you said 
to them, that is Werksmans, you changed your view because earlier on 
when you submitted the first report there were no cell phone records.  
The investigation had to continue because you wanted to obtain cell 
phone records.  Now you may have a better recollection than I have of 
what they say but based on what you are saying, to the extent that they 
may be saying part of the reason why the investigation was continuing 
was that you wanted to obtain cell phone records, then they must have 
misunderstood because your evidence is, the cell phone records were 
there, what was not there was the analysis and the further investigation 
20 
was going to include obtaining an analysis of cell phone records that 
were already there. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think they misunderstood me 
because cell phone records were there, the problem we had was to 
understand where these Generals were in terms of exact location and I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 178 of 191 
 
still remember when I spoke to the expert I even requested to say, just 
show me even the picture to say this person was standing here and he 
did that and indicated that if there is any variance from what he 
indicated and where the person was standing it would be only ten 
metres.  Now if they say that there was no cell phone record why would 
I then – I don’t think even Advocate Mosing would have asserted that 
without cell phone records.  The issue that we could not analyse. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But your own understanding of what they say in this 
context is it more or less along my own understanding as well  or how 
is your understanding because I think somewhere they seem to say 
10 
they don’t believe you with regard to something relating to the records, 
I just can’t remember whether they say you said part of the reason why 
the investigation still had to continue was because you had to obtain 
cell phone records and then they say but the cell phone records were 
already there or whether they say, you said you were going to get 
analysis and they say, no but the analysis was there.  I can’t remember 
those – that distinction.  Do you have any particular recollection of 
what they say in criticising your evidence? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson I think I need to put 
the report of Werksmans in perspective because they interviewed me 
20 
three times and the first day I still remember because we had already 
discussed with Mr Sesoko to say, when we arrived there we need to ask 
whether these things are going to be used for departmental or for 
criminal.  So unfortunately I did not record but I indicated to them and 
they gave me the same assurance they gave to Mr Sesoko.  Now when I 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 179 of 191 
 
was telling them exactly what happened what they used to do, any 
information that will show that I was towing the line in terms of this 
investigation, they would not really allow that.  I still remember I even 
said, I have an email that shows that I requested this docket, this is not 
necessary and that is when I realised that this thing is one sided 
because this three interviews was not basically that we were starting 
very late and that they could not finish.  Sometimes they would start in 
the morning and they say we are done with you then I left. Probably 
they sat down and said, no we can’t really hook this guy, how do we 
change the questions and I went back again.  When I went back I found 
10 
that the – they were asking similar questions but trying to trick me 
there and there, there was one time I was so tired and I wanted to 
know, what is it that you really need because I could show – even this 
report, they were not interested, they were not interested in things that 
– they wanted a situation, what they were pressurising me is that, did 
McBride force you to change the report.  Then I said to them, I did 
statement analysis McBride was not yet appointed, I then did the – 
there were cell phone analysis which was done and I sent the email 
requesting the docket, McBride was not yet employed because they 
were pushing me to a point to say, you need to say you were forced by 
20 
McBride and it was not true.  If really I was forced, I would say the 
same way and say, I was forced. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay I asked you about the Werksmans report, we’ll 
get there later or tomorrow but I asked because of some connection 
that I was seeing, please continue. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 180 of 191 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes thank you Chair.  So, now after you had 
submitted the first report, what is now referred to as the amended 
report you say in your statement in paragraph 72 on page 22 that on 
the 26 t h of February 2014 General Sibiya responded to the questions 
which you had sent to him.  Was this his warning statement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And it was sent to Mr Sesoko on the 27 t h of 
February 2014, is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then what did you do with this 
10 
information? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I forwarded it to Advocate 
Mosing. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if we have a look at page – in fact it’s 
probably best to look at page 134 of the bundle and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    134 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you’ll see at the bottom half of the page 
is an email from you dated the 28 t h of February 2014 to Anthony Mosing 
20 
and subject forward email response to questions posed by IPID Major 
General Shadrack Sibiya.  Is that the email in which you forwarded the 
responses to Advocate Mosing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And he then responded to you on the same 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 181 of 191 
 
day and said, 
 
“Dear Mr Khuba, in light of the fact that the matter has been 
 
referred to the DPP of South Gauteng, Gauteng for decision 
 
you are requested to file this evidence in the docket which is 
 
presently with the DPPSG and in future forward any 
 
additional evidence or other matters directly with him, kind 
 
Regards”, 
 
So what did you understand from this? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I understood that I could access 
or get the docket from the person who was having the docket. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you understand you would then 
update that docket with this evidence? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Now could you explain to the Chair how it 
came about that what is now called the second report that was signed 
by, I think Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride came about? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  After I did a briefing with Mr 
McBride as well as Mr Sesoko then I indicated the email which was sent 
by Advocate Mosing and then he permitted me to go and collect the 
docket because I had to attach the evidence and then – that time I still 
20 
remember indicated that this time you need to involve Mr Sesoko.  So I 
managed to get the docket and I’ve already indicated what was in the 
docket. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So let’s just stop there for a minute, who went 
with you to get the docket? 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 182 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was Glen Innes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And who did you get the docket from? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Advocate Van Zyl. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why did Advocate Van Zyl now have the 
docket as opposed to Advocate Mosing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Seemingly it was transferred to 
Advocate Van Zyl but all along I was under impression that Advocate 
Mosing was going to prosecute the case. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    So if you have regard to page 136, what is 
that – sorry are you there, no? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  136. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  136? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Sorry I thought you said 126, 
okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What is this document? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  136 – oh this document it’s a 
letter, it was sent to Advocate Chauke by Advocate Mosing.  So this 
letter was part of the docket.  When I went to collect the docket 
20 
Advocate Van Zyl took the copy of this letter and he scribbled it so that 
I could sign acknowledging the docket.  So the docket was in terms of 
the Act 5 as I indicated earlier.  So he indicated that there were six 
arch lever files, one thin file, it was handed to Mr Khuba from IPID and 
it indicated that I was accompanied by Glen Innes, he even wrote the 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 183 of 191 
 
cell phone number there and I signed for it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Now when you had the docket and perused 
the contents you indicated earlier that your first report wasn’t in the 
docket, is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what report was in the docket? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was Advocate Mosing’s report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And was there a recommendation from 
Advocate Mosing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
And 
do 
you 
remember 
what 
that 
recommendation was? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The recommendation was to the 
effect that he was recommending that General Dramat be charged but 
he could not recommend that General Sibiya be charged, he only 
recommended General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So at that stage when you took the docket as 
reflected in the document at page 136, this was after you had subtitled 
the first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was it also after you had submitted the amended 
report or was I before you submitted the amended report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The amended report was already 
submitted but not to NPA it was submitted to Mr Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 184 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But what I – I may not remember 
what really happened but knowing that I was updating Advocate Mosing 
in everything I think I told him that I spoke with the expert and he says, 
this person was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh so his decision to recommend – or his 
recommendation that General Sibiya should not be charged, the fact 
that, that is in line with your amended report might be because you told 
him even before he got the amended report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Yes because when I gave him 
the – when I got the information, I got it telephonically from the expert, 
10 
what I am suspecting is that I think I had spoken with him but I cannot 
really precisely remember, I’m drawing that conclusion on the basis that 
I would tell him of everything that was taking with the investigation and 
with this type of discovery for me it was serious that warranted me to 
phone him. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, so it would be unlikely that you delayed telling 
him once you knew it, okay.  So the 14 t h of February 2014 as reflected 
in the document at page 136 by that time had General Dramat’s 
statement and General Sibiya’s statement been sent to Advocate 
Mosing? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I had already received those 
documents if I remember well ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had you sent them to Advocate Mosing or not, or 
are you not able to remember? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I remember is when I sent 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 185 of 191 
 
the statement of General Sibiya but I cannot remember in terms of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The dates? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I sent it on the 27 t h in terms 
of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  27 February? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I went there I had already 
sent, when I went to collect the docket I had already sent him the copy 
10 
of the warning statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This letter, I’m sorry I think I may have misunderstood 
something, the memorandum at page 136 is dated 14 February 2014, 
but that is not the date when you saw it.  You saw it much later. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
Yes, 
I 
saw 
it 
on 
the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  There is 18 June there and 27 June, 18/6, 27/6 and 
then there is 7 March 2014 at the bottom just under the central number 
of Mr Glen Angus, that is 13 June somewhere on the side. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I can be able to talk about these 
20 
dates, some of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For example the 7 t h March 2014 
was when I collected the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 186 of 191 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is why there are signatures 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And also next to my signature 
there is the same date, which is 2014/03/07. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that your signature? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is my signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Next to, just below 7 March 2014, that is under the 
10 
cell number of Ms Jangus, the signature at the extreme right bottom of 
the page? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Mmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose signature is that one? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is Glen Angus who was 
accompanying me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is your signature, I am trying to see your 
one? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is the one that Khuba with fine 
print, small one.  The one just under 7 March 2014. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you know it looks like somebody had written 
something and crossed it out.   (Laughing)   Okay so on – so it was the 
7 t h of March 2014, the first time that you saw this document? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Was it on that day that you also saw or found 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 187 of 191 
 
out that Advocate Mosing had made the recommendation that General 
Dramat should be charged? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but in terms of sending the General Dramat and 
General Sibiya’s statements to Advocate Mosing you said you think you 
sent them on the 27 t h, but you did not say which month. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  27 February? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the – do you remember in case it is not 
10 
here but if it is here Ms Wentzel will tell me the document which 
contained Ms Demorsingh’s recommendation that General Dramat be 
charged do you remember what date it was dated? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember, okay alright.  Is it here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No, it is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because an important aspect is whether the decision 
that he should be charged was taken after his statement has been 
received and studied or  not. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair we will try and see if we can locate 
20 
that, but Chair if we do have regard to page 134 again we can see that 
the response to the questions posed by General Sibiya were forwarded 
by Mr Khuba to Advocate Mosing on the 28 t h of February 2014.   He 
said now it is the 27 t h but it was in fact the 28 t h and then if you have 
regard to the document at page 136. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 188 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry at 134 what were you drawing to my 
attention? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So if you look at the second half of the 
document you will see the first email dated the 28 t h of February 2014, 
and you see the subject says forward emailing response to questions 
posed by IPID Major General Shadrack Mitzibiya so that is when 
Advocate Mosing gets this and then tells him you need to file this 
evidence in a docket, and I do not have the docket any more so you 
need to go to the DPP of South Gauteng for the 7 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Then if we have a look at HIK136 you will 
remember that the testimony was from Mr Khuba that Advocate van Zyl 
had the docket and he made them sign for all the files, so you will see 
there it says 16 large files and one thin file and hand it to Khuba from 
IPID, is phone number, accompanied by Glen Angus, his cell phone 
number, the date and he made them both sign, so that is certainly the 
date that that docket was collected which is after the email was sent, 
but what is important is that if you look at the date on page 136 when 
the docket was forwarded that was the 14 t h of February 2014, so at that 
stage he would not have had the warning statement from Sibiya. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say he forwarded the docket to the DPP on 
the 14 t h of February and one would expect that that is when – one 
would expect that the document containing his recommendation would 
have been contained in the docket as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 189 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was way before the statement from General 
Sibiya and General Dramat, or General Sibiya? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair and so that – if that is correct then 
it means that his ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He made the decision before he could see the 
statements of General Sibiya. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So it must mean that he could not have made 
it on the basis of what General Sibiya said but it probably was as a 
result of the cell phone records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay.   Are you saying it was on the basis of 
10 
the cell phone records as opposed to the analysis of cell phone 
records? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I mean the analysis of the cell phone 
records I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, and this is a situation where he knew 
based on what Mr Khuba has testified he knew that Mr Khuba was still 
trying to get statements from General Sibiya and General Dramat, so he 
makes a decision that General Dramat must be prosecuted before 
hearing what he has to say in his statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It would appear that because it does not look 
20 
like General Dramat’s final warning statement was forwarded to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair is it a convenient time to adjourn or 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I did not realise we are already at two minutes to 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 190 of 191 
 
six, no I think we need to adjourn now, I think I am probably not the 
only one who is getting tired.  I don’t know if we made as much 
progress as we hoped to make after the final break, I guess it does not 
matter much if I say let us go another ten minutes to make it an hour.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I am in Chair’s hands.    
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think that is fine, let’s adjourn, it does look like – 
so maybe tomorrow we should start at half past nine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then maybe we could go up to half past ten.  I see 
that with regard to Colonel Naidoo in the program for next week there is 
10 
much space for him, there is space I think for about three days, except 
that on Tuesday Reverend Chikane is also put in there but I don’t want 
Colonel Naidoo’s evidence to be interrupted by another witness’s 
evidence, we would need to finish with him, so it may be that there is – 
not much need to start too early then half past nine tomorrow. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair sorry, I just want to make sure I am 
understanding you, are you proposing that Colonel Naidoo would start 
tomorrow and continue on Monday or he would only continue on 
Wednesday, he would only start on Wednesday? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no what I am saying is remember that earlier on 
20 
you said that you thought that on Monday you would be – his day when 
he could continue if we do not finish tomorrow, which you did not think 
would  happen, but I said I was still going to look at the program, so I 
am simply saying once we are finished with Mr Khuba tomorrow we can 
start with Colonel Naidoo and then we will continue on Monday, we can 
26 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 171 
 
Page 191 of 191 
 
continue on Monday with him and if we do do not finish on Monday with 
him we can continue on Tuesday also and let Reverend Chikane only 
start is evidence after we have finished with him, with Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I am saying.  I have asked that Reverent 
Chikane be alerted to the fact that if by Monday afternoon we have not 
finished with Colonel Naidoo then on Tuesday morning we would 
continue with him and only start his evidence after we have finished 
with Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes that would – that seems a solution. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Mr Khuba tomorrow you would be fine with 
starting at half past nine? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, so we are going to adjourn at this stage and 
then tomorrow we will continue at half past nine.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 27 SEPTEMBER 2019
