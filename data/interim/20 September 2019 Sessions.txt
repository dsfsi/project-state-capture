PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 20 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry we are starting later than I said we would 
start but let us start – let us start. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelof – Mr Roelofse we are on 
page 61 of your affidavit in bundle KK2.1.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And yesterday we concluded your 
evidence in relation to the email that you sent to Brigadier Moodley 
which accounted what transpired at the meeting that you had with 
General Ntlemeza on the 15 t h July 2015. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Following your account sent on that 
date what happened thereafter? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I testified yesterday 
General Ntlemeza transferred Brigadier Moodley to the regular South 
African Police Service.  And from there the investigation did not 
continue during the time that General Ntlemeza was the head of the 
DPCI.  I – I had and still have custody of all the relevant documentation 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 3 of 61 
 
that I – that was seized in the beginning in 2011. Apart from the 
documents that I gave to Brigadier Moodley for the declassification.  I 
never – I was never asked by anyone to supply any documentation or 
for any investigation to continue and that includes disciplinary 
investigations.  Therefore in my opinion General Mtlemeza has 
effectively stopped any continuation or progress in respect of not only 
this investigation but all other investigations regarding the alleged of 
CI – the abuse of CI funds. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And before you turn the page are 
you aware of any additional meetings that were called for by Advocate 
10 
Shaun Abrahams in relation to the declassification of documents?  And 
I am specifically referring to paragraph 208. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair on the 16 July 2015 I 
was informed through an email by Advocate Rossouw who was the 
prosecutor in the matter that Advocate Abrahams would – would like to 
have a briefing regarding the declassification of the documentation on 
the 22 July 2015.  Advocate Abrahams requested then the – my 
presence.  I however never received any communication from General 
Mtlemeza’s office regarding the briefing and therefore did not attend.  
The briefing was sent directly to me – a copy to me by Advocate 
20 
Rossouw. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And you were requested in your 
capacity as investigating officer? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes I was requested to attend and 
in my capacity as the investigating officer, yes Chair. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 4 of 61 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this was notwithstanding the 
instruction by General Ntlemeza three days earlier which caused you to 
stop the – calling you to stop the investigation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Or rather no longer be involved in 
the investigation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I do not know whether 
Advocate Abrahams knew that I was – that I was instructed to stop the 
investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In relation to media queries have 
10 
you received any media queries or rather since that date which you 
were required to attend to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair on the 17 July I was – I 
was requested to attend to a media enquiry from Mr Barry Bateman.  
And I – let me rephrase that.  On the 17 July 2015 Barry Bateman sent 
a media enquiry to the South African police.  On the 20 July I was 
asked to comment on that enquiry of inquiry.  It was sent to the office 
of General Mnonopi for a response by 14:00 on the same day.  I 
responded on the same day and I copy – a copy of the email which 
includes my response is attached as KDR48.  I do not know whether the 
20 
media enquiry was published but – and why I was asked to respond.  I 
also do not know whether my response is to the media enquiry were 
ever released to Bateman. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page 436 
please.   
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 5 of 61 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   436. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it is Annexure 48 for the record.  
Is this the email communication authored by yourself? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this was in response to the 
media query? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It – for the record it is an email 
10 
communication dated the 20 July 2015 at 10:07 from Kobus – Colonel 
Kobus Roelofse to Western Cape DPCI Secretary – subject title Media 
Query Mdluli and the classified documents.  It appears to be quite a 
comprehensive response but for purposes of highlighting any key point 
can I ask you to go to the second paragraph after the – sorry – after 
the … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The fifth paragraph sorry.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I think we are on the … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is page 436. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes sorry I was on the wrong 
page.  Sorry Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to please read the 
paragraph which begins with “I understand” which is about a third down 
in the communication. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 6 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry Chair.  Chair this – this is a 
– this is the question from Mr Barry Bateman. 
“I understand that police management allege that the 
documents cannot be declassified because they were 
stolen from Crime Intelligence.  I understand that 
there is an issue of whether the documents in the 
IO’s possession are the originals or copies of the 
supposedly stolen documents.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For purposes of the record IO 
stands for: 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Investigating Officer Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what comment do you have to 
this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   My comment is just:  
“I cannot answer on behalf of police management as 
to the allegation that the classified documents were 
stolen.  Whoever made the allegation should answer 
same.  I can state categorically that the classified 
documents were not stolen and were obtained 
legally.” 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we can then go back to page 62 of 
your affidavit please.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back to the 13 July did you ever get any 
report as to whether the meeting that General Ntlemeza said he would 
attend alone with Advocate Shaun Abrahams which you were supposed 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 7 of 61 
 
to have attended whether it took place and if so how it went? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I was – I was informed the 
meeting did in fact take place.  I was informed that by the prosecutor 
Advocate Rossouw.  He attended the meeting.  He did not in detail told 
me what happened at the meeting suffice to say that it was not a very 
pleasant meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not a pleasant meeting? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was not a pleasant meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   According to him General 
10 
Ntlemeza regarded them as not – not in authority to – to can tell him 
what he can do or cannot do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a plan to call Mr Rossouw? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     I am not aware of it but if I could 
just check quickly please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is important to get somebody who was present 
at that meeting to come and tell me what happened at that meeting. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair we will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And has a statement been obtained from 
Brigadier Moodley also it would be important to get a statement from 
20 
him about a number of things but in particular about the meeting that 
Mr Roelofse has testified about that the two of them attended or had 
with General Ntlemeza where General Ntlemeza stopped Colonel 
Roelofse continuing to investigate. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  We will note that.  
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 8 of 61 
 
If we could then go back to page 62 of your affidavit.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may I just want to inform 
– inform the commission that I did compare the identity number of Ms 
Ranjeni Munusamy.  The one in my possession with the one that was 
given to the commission it is the same identity number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the same ID number? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At page 62 of your affidavit is it 
correct that General Ntlemeza was dismissed on or about the 15 
10 
September 2017? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this was following the judgment 
in the Supreme Court of Appeal which found that the decision of Mr 
Nhleko who was the Minister of Police at the time was irrational and 
unlawful when appointing General Ntlemeza to the head of DPCI? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair a copy of that judgment is 
included in the Regulatory bundle which is at Exhibit 2.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it a judgment or was it just an order dismissing an 
20 
Application for Leave to Appeal? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It was a judgment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the SCA? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 9 of 61 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For your reference it is the last tab 
which starts at page 368. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What happened on the 14 June 2017 
Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair on the 14 June 2017 
Advocate Rossouw emailed me requesting an urgent meeting.  His 
email attach – attach various letters which confirm – which informed me 
that Advocate Abrahams the NDPP requested the assistance of the new 
acting National Commission of SAPS Lieutenant General JK Khomotso 
10 
Phahlane which he was appointed on the 15 October 2015 in getting 
documents needed in evidence in the CI criminal investigation 
declassified. General Phahlane agreed in writing to assist – agreed in 
writing to assist Advocate Abrahams and agreed to the setting up of a 
process to declassify the documentation.  Advocate Abrahams informed 
General Phahlane that he will inform the prosecutor of the decision to 
set up a process to declassify the documents. And a copy of these of 
letters as – is attached to my affidavit and I forwarded this to General 
Mathakatha thereafter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I then ask you to turn to page 
20 
4… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry one second.  You have at 213 a reference 
to events of 14 June 2017 and below that discussion involving General 
Phahlane but then at 214 says on 1 June 2017 General Phahlane was 
relieved of his duties as acting National Commissioner.  Is there no mix 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 10 of 61 
 
up of dates there? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think it should read the 1 
July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In 214? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In fact we will certainly correct that 
because we have received an affidavit from General Phahlane which 
informed that he was relieved of his duties from the 1 June 2017.  So 
that date is in fact correct.  It just appears to be out of sequence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know but then it must be that the 
sequence of events is not proper then because you first you talk about 
what happened on the 14 June 2017 and then later you talk about what 
happened on the 1 June. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may – I – maybe I can 
explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I received the email from 
Advocate Rossouw on the 14 June 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The trailing or the attached 
documentation to the email dealt with issues or dealt with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Previously. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Events that happened before he 
was … 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 11 of 61 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Before he was dismissed or 
relieved of his duties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that date? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Before the date that he was 
relieved of his duties.  Yes Chair.  I did not receive these 
documentations during the – as it happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And were you – I think do try and ensure 
that we have got the dates correct because – or whether it is just a 
question of – of 214 – maybe 214 needing to have been 213.  Obviously 
10 
what happened first it what happened on the 1 June.  What happened 
on the 14 June namely the receipt of the email happened later than 
what happened on the 1 June. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is understood through you Chair 
that the date on which he was relieved from his duties is to be 
considered in the context of his knowledge of the declassification of 
documents and so the communication which is dated the 14 June 2017 
while I accept is out of time sequence is the pertinent part of this 
witness’ evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I am – I understand that all I am simply 
20 
saying it causes confusion. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you first discuss what happened on the 14 June 
and then later go back to what happened on the 1 June.  If he dates are 
fine then it means it is just the rearranging of the affidavit that – or the 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 12 of 61 
 
arrangements in the affidavit of the paragraphs that was not what it 
should be.  But if the dates are fine I can live with it – we can go on.  It 
is not a problem.  It just seems awkward. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To tell a story go up to 14 June and then go back to 1 
June. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we could then turn to page 43 – 
440 which is Annexure KDR49.   
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This document appears to be an 
email correspondence trail and the first email at the top of it is from 
Arno Rossouw AJ of the NPA’s office sent on the 14 June 2017 16:26 to 
Colonel Roelofse being yourself cc Paul J Louw – subject title which is 
a four word State versus Mdluli and others and there appears to be one 
attachment.  Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then what we – what also 
appears from the document is the introduction which reads: 
20 
“Dear Colonel Roelofse kindly take note of the 
attached correspondence.  We need to meet as a 
matter of urgency to discuss the matter and set up 
the meeting as directed by the acting commissioner.” 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 13 of 61 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And you have already given 
evidence that the acting commissioner at that time was Mr Nhleko. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair it was General… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I mean – sorry.  Lieutenant General 
Phahlane. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Sorry – so sorry.  If I could then ask 
you to turn to page 445 please.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think those that exchange of emails and letters I am 
not sure that there is much purpose in going to each and every one of 
10 
them.  Just reflect of this.  It maybe that what is important is to say 
there was – there were letters and emails that were exchanged between 
so and so and so and so or these people between that time and that 
time but the – the ultimate outcome is that General Phahlane had at a 
certain 
stage 
indicated 
a 
willingness 
to 
have 
the 
documents 
declassified and then see what happened after that.  So it might not be 
necessary to go through each and every email if it does not take that 
point any further.  There were discussions but in the end the documents 
remained not declassified but Phalhlane seemed to be willing – this is 
the email he sent and this is what happened pursuant to that. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair.  Is it – there is 
then Mr – Colonel Roelofse an internal memorandum which attaches 
three documents which essentially calls upon Lieutenant General 
Phahlane to assist and he agrees to do so at least from the 19 January 
2017? 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 14 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and it is 
follow up – he followed that up with the written response on the 17 May 
2017. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Where he agrees to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand his email the email itself was not 
necessarily agreeing to declassify but he was agreeing to the setting 
up of a process which could lead to declassification, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  As I 
testified earlier. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   There is a process that needs to 
be set up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   To get it declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So at least he was not opposed in principle to 
declassification it just depended on the process that was to be put in 
place. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and that is 
what I would expect from a National Commissioner. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair there is a version of sorts that 
we have received with by your leave I would just like to put through to 
the witness.  It is an affidavit that we have received from General 
Phahlane. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 15 of 61 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You can put it to him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And with your leave if I may do so? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Save to confirm in the affidavit itself 
that General Phahlane informs that he was appointed to the position of 
acting National Commissioner of Police following the suspension of 
General Riah Phiyega on the 14 October 2015.  He has since the 1 
June 2017 been at home on full remuneration pending the processes of 
investigations against him.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well does it dispute any of the things that Mr 
Roelofse has talked about that relate to him? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Colonel Roelofse he informs that he 
takes no issue with the allegations that you make but he however 
wishes to point out that he was not contacted by any person to assist in 
the declassification of the documents after he received the response 
from Advocate Abrahams regarding his request.  Do you have any 
comment or knowledge to that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I cannot comment on – on 
what General Phiyega – General Phahlane has seen or not but I do 
20 
have a letter from Advocate Abraham’s office that was addressed to 
General Phahlane on the 24 May 2017 wherein Advocate Abrahams in 
paragraph 2 states the following: 
“The Prosecutor in the matter will be informed of 
your decision and requested to liaise with the 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 16 of 61 
 
relevant officials as suggested.” 
So there was a referral back to the office of the National Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then to ask you your comment 
to the following statement and I read:  He says: 
“I am a amazed at Mr Roelofse as a senior police 
official did not register any criminal case against me 
at the time it is alleged I frustrated and hampered 
the investigation and by doing so obstructed the 
course of justice and defeated the ends of justice.”   
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you have any comment to that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes I do.  I have never alleged 
that 
General 
Phahlane 
frustrated 
the 
process. 
 
I 
have 
the 
documentation here and as far as I am concerned he was the one that 
assisted me.  I cannot remember the life alleged that he is – that he is 
frustrating the process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is to be understood that in the 
context of your affidavit your allegations were to – were addressed to 
senior police officials. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Are you changing your position now? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No I am not – no I am not 
changing my position in terms of that.  I am just saying that when the 
written responses I have would indicate that General Phahlane is 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 17 of 61 
 
assisting me.  I do not – he – I think what I am trying to – what I am 
referring to when I am talking about that.  The first letter was sent in 
January 2017 and his response was only in May.  So in that essence – 
in that sense it would seem that there was no urgency and he was – he 
was not going to respond within the – within a specific timeframe.  I 
also do not know how long before this Advocate Abrahams has spoken 
to him in that process.  So he did not – he did not do anything about 
this until there was a letter to ask him to do it.  So based on that he did 
not do anything up until that point when he was in – questioned in 
writing or asked in writing to assist. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so in that context your evidence 
is to be considered.  When you say that there were attempts made to 
frustrate and hamper investigations by senior officials within SAPS is 
General Phahlane considered to be one of them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In that essence it will fall into 
that context yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Or in that sense.  It will fall into 
that context. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Were there any requests made by 
20 
IPID 
the 
Independent 
Police 
Investigative 
Directorate 
for 
the 
declassification of documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair there were requests 
made by them.  In August 2017 I was asked to go and assist IPID by 
General Mathakatha from the DPCI and – and part of that situation was 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 18 of 61 
 
that as part of the joint task team that IPID will also from their 
perspective try to get the documents needed for this investigation 
declassified.  If we can – if I can put this into context?  At the time 
before I – before I got there IPID was doing investigations also 
regarding to the actions of Crime Intelligence and certain allegations or 
alleged criminality.  And I think that is the reason why I was asked to 
go – to go and assist them as well because they sat with exactly the 
same problem getting the documents declassified for court purposes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page 453 
which forms part of Annexure 50 please?   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say 456? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   453 Chair.  
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  45? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3.  Yes continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This is a correspondence – a letter 
rather addressed to Lieutenant General Mothiba who was the acting 
National Commissioner at the time and it is signed on page 460 by Mr R 
J McBride dated the 18 August 2017. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is titled “A request for 
declassification of classified documents and the particularity of the 
CAS number and the like follows.” 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 19 of 61 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This is a comprehensive or it 
appears at least to be quite a comprehensive document on what 
information or documents were required for classi – declassification? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could turn to page 4-6-0.  Is it 
correct that this letter concludes that? 
“It would be appreciated …” 
Not is it correct but the - the letter rather concludes that: 
“It would be appreciated if the above documents 
can be urgently declassified and handed over to 
10 
IPID for investigation in terms of Section 29(2)(c) 
and 24(3) in terms of the IPID Act.” 
So the - there was an urgency to this request? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is this the same request that then 
escalated to yourself for attention and response? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Roelofse the - the battle to get these 
documents declassified was quite a long one? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And it is still a battle Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is still a long one? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Starting in 2012 you said? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2012.  You wrote - you prepared comprehensive 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 20 of 61 
 
documents explaining everything that you could to try and get the 
police and Crime Intelligence to accept that the - you needed these 
documents for legitimate purposes.  The NPA also I think we saw 
yesterday if I am not mistaken. 
Yes Mr Nxasana’s very comprehensive document.  I think 
Ms September said it was eight pages if I am not mistaken but 
comprehensive letter or memorandum that was sent motivating and 
dealing with lots of issues and saying please declassify these 
documents.  Nothing happens. 
IPID here sends Mr McBride a comprehensive document 
10 
dealing with all these issues asking please let us declassify these 
documents and nothing happens. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That describes what has been happening? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is true Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Mr Roelofse 
the 
letter 
from 
Mr McBride was sent to General Mothiba and it is correct that it was 
sent to him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms September.  Just to complete what I 
was saying Mr Roelofse and throughout these years and throughout 
20 
these correspondence as I understand your evidence and as I 
understand the correspondence exchanged there does not appear that - 
it does not appear that anybody ever said here is a reason why we are 
saying no to the declassification of these documents or sometimes they 
were - maybe they were not even saying no but the fact is they were 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 21 of 61 
 
not saying yes.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  We have 
not had that - we have not had that engagement.  I have not received 
any reasons as to why it should not be declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is a question of - it is a question 
of being ignored. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have quoted to them the provision that says 
classification must not be used to hide maladministration and 
corruption and nobody has come back to you and said no, no, no.  Here 
10 
is a legitimate reason why we say no to the declassification.  It is just 
not happening? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it - it did not happen and as 
far as I - I also do not know what was - what was the - the motivation 
for not declassifying a certain document that was requested by the 
Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To be declassified that was also 
not declassified.  I do not know if there was a reason advanced for 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Roelofse the IPID request was 
sent 
to 
General Mothiba 
in 
his 
position 
as 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 22 of 61 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it - is it correct that he was 
appointed to that position on or about 2 June 2017? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But certainly based on the - the letter 
that we have - that I have directed your attention to he was aware at 
least of the request through IPID approximately July 20 - sorry - 
August 2017 or ought to have been aware of it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There was however a General Jacobs 
who was supportive of the process.  Is that right? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I …? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 4-4-9 
please?  At the bottom of the page appears as part of this email trail is 
an email from Major-General Jacobs dated 21 August 2017 at 09:08 am.  
Sent to the Divisional Commissioner of Legal and Policy Services and 
others with the subject - including copying other recipients as well with 
the subject title re “Request for Declassification of Classified 
Documents”. 
20 
Once again the CAS number details.  If you turn the page to 
page 4-5-0 it reads: 
“I am in favour of declassification of the documents 
and so far back in General Dramat’s time - 
(coughing) so sorry - and so far - and so far back in 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 23 of 61 
 
General Dramat’s time the issue had been cleared 
with the Office of the IG.  I propose that we follow 
up with NPA on existing process and ask person in 
possession of docket - of docket to produce original 
documents for declassification.  The matter has 
been drawn out too long and needs to come to 
finality.  I direct this to NPA’s Office as well so that 
we can move with speed on this matter.  Kind 
regards, Phillip Jacobs.” 
Who was General Jacobs? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  General Jacobs at the time was - 
Chair I must just make - he was - he was - he formed part of the legal 
service - national - National Office of Legal Services within the South 
African Police Service.  He - the context of this email and his response 
was 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
request 
sent 
by 
Mr McBride 
for 
the 
declassification of the documentation. 
They were asked - Legal Services in - in Head Office were 
asked to - to provide the - General Mothiba with a legal opinion and I 
am informed that he was provided with a legal opinion with the advice 
to declassify the documentation.  Not once but twice and no reaction 
20 
came from General Mothiba in respect of this advice that was given to 
him by his own legal services. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so is it to be understood that no 
progress arose following the email from General Jacobs? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is true - that is so 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 24 of 61 
 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
progress 
insofar 
as 
the 
declassification of documents … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is concerned? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
On 
22 November 2017 
a 
new 
National Commissioner was appointed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who - who is the individual? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
It 
was 
General Sithole 
- 
Khehla Sithole. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
was 
the 
request 
for 
declassification brought to the attention of Lieutenant-General Sithole? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  It was brought to his 
attention.  It was also - I think a copy - I do not have the - the 
document here but I think it was a - a similar document or maybe even 
the same document addressed to General Mothiba was also addressed 
to General Sithole. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And at paragraph 2-1-9 on page 63 of 
20 
your affidavit.  You talk about this - this issue of declassification being 
raised in Parliament.  Can you please elaborate on that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair IPID was asked to appear 
before SCOPA.  It is either late 2017 or early 2018.  I attended with - 
with the IPID the SCOPA hearing.  I think it was two or three and in one 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 25 of 61 
 
of those hearings and I suspect it was the first one this whole question 
regarding the declassification of documentation was raised but not only 
the ones that I needed but also the ones that they were struggling to 
get declassified in terms of their own investigations. 
During those hearings I got the impression that the members 
of SCOPA was really interested to assist and there were comments 
made to the effect that - and General Sithole made certain comments to 
the effect that he will - he will apply his mind and he will assist and 
they - and I think the hearing gave him about two weeks. 
About two or three hearings after that I got the - I have got 
10 
the sense that there was a change within SCOPA because they said it - 
it did not fall strictly within their mandate.  It falls within the mandate of 
the Intelligence Committee and that is - that is where it ended.  So that 
also did not assist in getting the documentation declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Roelofse I will hear what some of the people 
who were supposed to apply their mind to this request have to say but 
the fact that you are part of the law enforcement agencies in the 
country and you are investigating what appears to be a legitimate issue 
concerning allegations of corruption and fraud within the police and you 
are not assisted to obtain documents that you need for that 
20 
investigation for over eight years is just astonishing. 
It is just astonishing.  Somebody gave evidence before me 
here some months back and made statements that may have seemed 
shocking about what happens within the police in terms of wrongdoing 
and I cannot remember who it was but I think it was somebody from 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 26 of 61 
 
within and this battle that you have been on for so many years one 
would have thought that the police would be very sensitive when there 
are investigations against some of their own and would want to be seen 
to be more transparent and would not want to do anything that might 
look like they want to protect one another or that may be seen to be 
covering up corruption. 
I will hear what they have to say but it is very, very 
concerning to me because over such a long period anything could 
happen.  Witness could die.  Then you could have a situation where 
there is never prosecution or there is no successful prosecution 
10 
because witnesses have disappeared or died that would have been 
important for the proper prosecution of those cases and just think also 
that it must be a most demoralising thing to any person within the law 
enforcement agencies who is trying to do his or her job properly but 
meeting with the kind of frustration that it looks like you met with but 
we will - we will hear and hear what everybody has to say. 
Maybe they will throw light from different - give us 
perspectives that we do not see at the moment but it is really very, very 
concerning but I also wanted to ask I seem to have read sometime back 
about a court application to challenge the failure to declassify 
20 
documents by the police in regard to some matter.  Was it not this 
matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it - it relates to this matter 
but it was more - it - it is an application brought by IPID - by IPID 
Mr McBride and it related to Crime Intelligence but more - but more 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 27 of 61 
 
recent abuse of the fund … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And in terms of that Crime 
Intelligence did not want to release those documents.  So that - that 
has been taken - that specific matter has been taken to court to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To force or to make it - for there to 
be a decision in terms of how to deal with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So it does not include everything that you were 
talking about.  It relates to more recent events? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It - it relates to more recent 
events.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but how far is that?  Do you know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I am - I am not sure at the 
moment.  I know that they - affidavits - further affidavits were filed 
about a month ago but I am not - I am not up to speed as to exactly 
how far they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you know - do you have any information 
about that?  Ms September? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We will certain - we will certain … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We do not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you …? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We do not have any information at 
this stage. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 28 of 61 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please obtain … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We will certainly look into it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Affidavits filed in that matter.  Look at those 
affidavits.  Let me know.  I want to see them as well. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may proceed.  So it is correct to 
understand that in the context of everything we now turn to page 64 of 
your affidavit where you deal with General Ntlemeza.  Is it correct that 
on the 23 r d …? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to finalise the point relating to General Sithole.  
So the thrust of your evidence in relation to him is that after he had 
been appointed National Commissioner this issue of the request for 
declassification was brought to his attention.  He became aware of it 
from what you understand. 
He seemed to have undertaken to apply his mind to it but the 
fact of the matter is up to now there has been no declassification? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is so Chair.  In paragraph 
220 of my affidavit I also refer to Brigadier Van Graan who prepared yet 
again another memorandum which was then given to General Sithole. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So he was aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I - I wonder whether when the National 
Commissioner of Police or different National Commissioners of Police 
fail to assist or when you are unhappy with the fact that the National 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 29 of 61 
 
Commissioner of Police is not assisting in a particular matter whether 
you should not - there should not have been an approach to the 
Minister or different Ministers. 
Is that something that was not thought or is that something 
that this kind of thing would not go to the Minister? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I have not thought of that.  I 
thought that I would be able to - to deal with it within the structures of 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  South African Police Service … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  As - or - or for that matter within 
IPID … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Or in Parliament but I did not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I did not see the point.  So - but I 
did not even think of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it might - it might be - it might be one of 
the avenues open but the Commission will be applying its mind as well 
20 
because there have been different National Commissioners or Acting 
National Commissioners and it would be different if they say we will not 
declassify.  Here are the reasons and then you apply your mind to the 
reasons and you agree or disagree.  So - okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Roelofse is it correct that on 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 30 of 61 
 
23 December 2014 General Dramat was relieved of his duties by 
Minister Nhleko and General Ntlemeza was then appointed to act in his 
place on or about that same date? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was one of the first things that 
General Ntlemeza did as far as you are aware and in your experience? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, he - he visited two 
provinces - KwaZulu-Natal as well as the Western Cape Province.  I 
cannot remember which one he visited first.  Cannot remember exactly 
that sequence and I know it was either very late in 2014 or very early in 
10 
2015 and he called a meeting.  He did not see the provincial - the 
Provincial Commander as far as I know.  He called the meeting 
specifically with the - with the ACTT.  The Anti-Corruption Task Team 
and he met with us on that specific day. 
During the meeting General Ntlemeza addressed us and what 
was concerting to me during the - during that meeting is that he 
informed the meeting - and that includes now junior officers as well - he 
in - he informed them that he would - that he at the meeting - the effect 
that if he wanted to challenge anyone if they want to challenge his 
decisions he would suspend them and they would - and they wanted - 
20 
and if they wanted to take him on and that is now to court he would get 
his SC to fight their SC. 
In other words that officials until that person runs out of 
funds.  He went further to say that even if that person was successful 
in challenging his decision he would in any event transfer the person 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 31 of 61 
 
out of the DPCI.  Now to me that was - I - I was taken aback by that - 
by that comment.  I mean that is the first time that - that he as the 
Acting Head of the DPCI came to speak to anyone and especially in the 
Western Cape and that is what he said. 
I did not know why he wanted to say that.  I did not know 
what prompted it but what he did is it created that climate - climate 
within the DPCI that you will do what I say or you are going to get - you 
will be transferred or - or I will suspend you and the question about the 
SC his counsel.  He was referring to state funds.  He will appoint 
counsel on state funds to fight you with your pension with your money. 
10 
It was - I just did not - it did not go down well and I do not 
know if he understands the seriousness of what he had said at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  So basically he was threatening that if I 
make any decision and you try and challenge it you must know that it is 
going to be a serious battle and effectively I will be using state funds to 
fight you and you will be using your own funds and you have no 
chance? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  He is 
basically saying I will - financially I will ruin you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may proceed.  Chair, may I 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  (No audible reply). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Colonel - Mr Roelofse did you know 
General Ntlemeza from any past experience? 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 32 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Chair 
I 
do. 
 
I 
have 
met 
General Ntlemeza in 2011 for the first time.  I did know who he was 
before that and the meeting I - the meeting I had or during the time I 
met him it related to a report that was handed up during the bail 
application of General Mdluli to the - in the Boksburg High Court. 
This report speak - in this report he - he was appointed by 
General Mdluli to investigate the so called plot against him and then 
that report was thus provided at - at the bail hearing. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before we deal with this - the report 
in particular.  I ought to have been more specific in my question.  
10 
Before you had this first meeting with General Ntlemeza where he 
attended Cape Town and made clear how he intended to deal with the 
department did you meet him before that time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes.  As I said in 2011 during - I 
had - I interviewed him regarding a report that was handed up in the 
bail application of General Mdluli which he - which he authored on 
General Mdluli’s behalf after requesting - after being requested to do 
so. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if we can then go to page 65 you 
talk specifically to the report that was prepared by General Ntlemeza.  
20 
Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
How 
did 
it 
come 
about 
that 
General Ntlemeza was called upon to prepare this report? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair at the time - I just want to 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 33 of 61 
 
get to that point.  General - there was a - there was a newspaper 
article published.  I think it was in The Sowetan if I am not mistaken in 
which General Mdluli has been linked to a - an event in 1999. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is that the Vosloorus matter that you 
have already given evidence about? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is the Vosloorus matter that I 
gave evidence about.  That article resulted in the information that - that 
was sent to General Lalla for further attention.  General Lalla informed 
General Dramat and then it was given to General Lebeya for him to 
investigate based on the - on the media report. 
10 
During that period General Dramat - ag General Lebeya 
spoke to the Mgwebi family and during the preliminary - preliminary 
investigation General Lebeya be - became aware of a parallel 
investigation that is been done by General Ntlemeza.  He informed 
General Dramat - General Lebeya informed him that General Ntlemeza 
would be continuing with the investigation as he thought that 
General Ntlemeza was also investigating the murder of Ramogibe. 
He did not know the - the terms of reference of the 
investigation that - that General Ntlemeza had to do.  General Lebeya 
gave the details of - of a witness from the Ramogibe family to 
20 
General Ntlemeza under the impression that General Ntlemeza would 
continue the murder investigation.  As I said under - under - at that 
time he did not know that General Ntlemeza was actually investigating 
someone else. 
General Mdluli instructed General Ntlemeza in - on the 1 s t - 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 34 of 61 
 
21 July 2009 through his Provincial Commission to investigate in 
regular conduct by members of SAPS stationed at CI for investigating 
the murder of Ramogibe - Mr Ramogibe and General Mdluli’s alleged 
involvement. 
From my investigation General Mdluli suspected that CI 
members who were investigating - investigating him of - of trying to 
oust him as the Divisional Commissioner of CI and then on 
11 August 2009 
General Ntlemeza 
received 
a 
briefing 
from 
General Mdluli regarding the terms of reference of his investigation.  
General Ntlemeza finalised his report on 14 January 2010. 
10 
General Lebeya later obtained a copy of the Ntlemeza report 
from General - from General Mdluli. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Chair a copy of that report appears 
as Annexure 51 and it starts on page 462. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   To just summarise the very key 
points of General Ntlemeza’s report which you found of key importance 
I’d like to take you to the bottom of page 65 at paragraph 225.3.4 can 
you please read the first one into the record? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “It was clear from his investigation 
20 
 
that is now, General Ntlemeza,  that a plot existed to prevent 
 
General Mdluli from being appointed as the CI Divisional 
 
Commissioner and General Ntlemeza also accused  Provincial 
 
Commissioner S Khumalo who is now deceased of  being 
 
behind the plot.  General Ntlemeza identified two police 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 35 of 61 
 
 
officials, Warrant Officer Mogabe and Warrant Officer Reketsu 
 
assisting General Khumalo in this plot”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct that – or rather is this 
the conspiracy plot that General Mdluli had alluded to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I’ve lost track of all the 
conspiracy plots but this is one of them yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is this then the same conspiracy plot 
that the Ministerial task team was appointed which was headed up by 
the Chief State Law Advisor Mr Enver Daniels to investigate? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I do not think so because 
10 
the so-called people behind this plot wasn’t the people that were 
investigating in the – in Mr Daniels’ investigation or by his task team. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So this is a different plot? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  This is a different plot Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we can go to the second point 
please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   “General Ntlemeza in his report 
 
said that he spoke to the sister of the deceased Mrs Lima 
 
Ramogibe 
and 
that 
according 
to 
her 
the 
matter 
was 
 
investigated and no member of the South African Police was 
20 
 
connected to the murder.  General Ntlemeza continued to state 
 
that the sister of the deceased had said that, according to the 
 
family the matter was already put to rest”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Do you have any comment to this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this is just absolutely – the 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 36 of 61 
 
opposite is true, I know the sister of the deceased we’ve spoken many 
times, she also informed me about this conversation, she never said 
what General Ntlemeza alleged to say.  They were trying to get the 
matter on the Court roll for a long – the matter to be investigated not 
even on the Court roll for a long time, for 10 years.  So she would 
never had said that, it just doesn’t make sense. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At point three? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   “In General Ntlemeza’s view there 
 
was a plot to stop the appointment of Commissioner Mdluli but 
 
the people i.e. the family of the said suspect deceased could 
10 
 
not cooperate with inspector Mogabe in respect[indistinct] 
 
hence the solution was to take it to the newspapers”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Do you have any comment to this 
point? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I – to me I just don’t 
understand this I do not know from what he’s trying to say whether the 
deceased – I mean the family of the deceased or whether Mogabe and 
Lekotso went to the newspapers, I do not know, I don’t have any 
comment because I – this is what he said ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No comment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I had a brief look at that document which you call 
report by General Ntlemeza I may have missed something but I don’t 
remember seeing any factual basis advanced for the view that certain 
people had conspired to prevent General Mdluli from being appointed to 
the – to be appointed to head Crime Intelligence.  Were you able to find 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 37 of 61 
 
any factual basis that General Ntlemeza advanced for that view of is? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   To the contrary Chair there were 
two affidavits attached and one of them was of Warrant Officer Lekotso, 
he denied that he was involved in this, it’s under oath, he in fact stated 
that General Mdluli appointed him in his position, he would never 
investigate General Mdluli which in effect also shocked me because 
that’s not what you’re supposed to do if someone has committed an 
offence you need to investigate it but the fact of the matter is it’s not 
concluded based on fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next point four? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   “General Ntlemeza obtained an 
 
affidavit from Colonel Marthinus  [indistinct] Botha, he is also 
 
deceased, who stated allegations relating to the murder of the 
 
deceased 
and 
the 
involvement 
of 
General 
Mdluli 
who 
 
investigated and he, Botha, could not find any witnesses to 
 
give evidence or statements to prove these allegations”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you have any comment to this 
based on your independent investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in terms of my 
20 
investigations of the Mdluli matter the Vosloorus matter, I approached 
Colonel Botha, he was still alive at the time, he said to me that he was 
under the impression that it was just an affidavit -  a short affidavit that 
he had to prepare for General Ntlemeza, he didn’t have context.  In 
fact, he was not the investigating officer so I do not know the reason 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 38 of 61 
 
why he would have given the affidavit in the first place, he was not the 
investigating officer, the witness were still available and there were 
witness statements taken from them.  The investigation was just 
stopped in 2000 and it didn’t continue.  So his assertion that – and 
Colonel Botha gave me an affidavit to that effect which was filed in the 
docket. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then lastly point five? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   “General Ntlemeza concluded first 
 
that Warrant Office Mogabe and Warrant Officer Lekotso were 
 
to be transferred from Crime Intelligence to Uniform Branch to 
10 
 
avoid further embarrassment pending the outcome of the final 
 
inquiry and secondly that both Warrant Officer Mogabe and 
 
Warrant Officer Lekotso to be charged [indistinct] for misusing 
 
State owned vehicles”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you have any comment to that 
point?  
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair, as far as I know they 
were never charged for any departmental case against them, not as far 
as I know. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct then that the outcomes 
20 
of your investigation which relate to the discussions that you had with 
Miss Lena Ramogibe and Colonel Botha was placed before the Court 
that considered the bail application of Richard Mdluli to which you 
opposed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 39 of 61 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What was the purpose then of the 
report of General Ntlemeza in your view? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair maybe I can just clarify 
there, I didn’t know about this report until the bail application, this was 
handed up by Mr Mdluli as part of his bail application.  So based on 
that I followed up on this report and I spoke to Miss Ramogibe and I 
spoke to Colonel Botha.  So then I think I supplied a further affidavit in 
respect of the bail application. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So in your view what was – what do 
you consider to be – have been the purpose of the report of General 
10 
Ntlemeza? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the only purpose of this 
report is to show that General Ntlemeza is innocent of the murder but 
that was not investigated and if you look at the terms of reference of 
the report itself he was supposed to investigate this plot, not the 
murder but this was used to clear him of the murder charges and I 
subsequently was informed that this was also presented to senior 
management as well as to General Dramat as evidence that he wasn’t 
involved in any murder plot. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I then ask you to turn to Exhibit 
20 
KK2.4 please, the other bundle, it’s called the regulatory and 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry what page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s the Exhibit KK2.4, the regulatory 
and case law bundle at page 288. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 40 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   288, this is the judgement of the 
High Court and at paragraph 28 somewhat in the middle of the first 
paragraph to paragraph 28, and for the purposes of contexting or 
placing things into time context the Court records that, 
 
“In the letter dated 3 November 2011 addressed to President 
 
Zuma, the Minister of Police and the acting Commissioner, 
 
Mduli alleged that Commissioner Bheki Cele and other senior 
 
officers, General Petros, Lebeya and Dramat were working 
 
together against him.  In the letter he tactlessly stated and it’s 
10 
 
quoted, in the event that I come back to work I will assist the 
 
President to succeed next year.  He did not explain how he 
 
would assist the President but it is reasonable to assume that 
 
he had in mind the confidence of the governing party in 2012 
 
at which President Zuma was re-elected as party leader for a 
 
second five-year term.  His entreaty to the President implies 
 
that Mdluli believed he had it in his gift to use his influence 
 
and the means at his disposal to the advantage of the 
 
President”, 
 
Are you aware of this letter dated 3 November 2011 Mr 
20 
Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think – I’m not aware of 
this letter, I’ve got a similar letter which was attached during the bail 
application, also from General Mdluli addressed to the President. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so could I take you then to page 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 41 of 61 
 
467 please?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you asking us to go back to the other one? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Oh so sorry Exhibit 2.1 it’s the main 
bundle it’s Exhibit 52 which starts on page 467. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   467, this appears to be a letter 
which is dated the 11 t h of November 2010…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one sec, did you say 467? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   467, yes Chair, it’s the last 
Annexure to the bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This appears to be a letter dated the 
11 t h of November, are you there at the page?  This appears to be a 
letter dated the 11 t h of November 2010 and it’s a letter that’s addressed 
to a) The President of the Republic of South Africa, b) The Minister of 
Police, c) The Minister of State Security, d) The National Commissioner 
and e) The Inspector General of Intelligence, it is titled victimisation 
and abuse of state resources against the Divisional Commissioner 
Crime Intelligence.  At page 471 it appears to have been signed by 
Lieutenant General R N Mdluli. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I’m familiar with the 
signature, it looks like his signature. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What is the relevance or 
significance of this letter to your investigation and the evidence that 
you’ve given? 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 42 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in respect of this letter what 
the relevance was, I think during the bail application was to indicate to 
the President of South Africa that he was involved in a love triangle 
and she then reported entitled, alleged irregularities, members of 
SAPS, Crime Intelligence which is attached as Annexure A.  Now he’s 
referring to the – to General Ntlemeza’s report that he attaches to this 
letter and then he deals with the information that he received and then 
he deals with him asking General Ntlemeza to assist in the 
investigation and then at point seven, what is for me, of importance is, 
I must categorically point out that this is now in terms of the Vosloorus 
10 
matter that, 
 
“I was never involved in this love triangle when Major General 
 
Sibiya from the Hawks was appointed, Chantelle went to him 
 
with the same allegations, this was then handed over to the 
 
Divisional Commissioner Lebeya, however, by this time I’ve 
 
already provided Divisional Commissioner Lebeya with the 
 
report by Major General Ntlemeza”.   
Then he continues and he states further there, and this is for me in 
terms of this Commission that is very important, 
 
“These are the very same members, and he’s now referring to 
20 
 
Crime Intelligence, these are the very same members that 
 
were involved in the negative campaigning at the ANC 
 
conference in Polokwane during 2007.  They were in the camp 
 
of the former President and are not trying to take control of the 
 
Intelligence environment within the police for devious tactics.  
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 43 of 61 
 
 
This is exacerbated by the fact that on 2010/11/10 Warrant 
 
Officer Dlomo was approached by three whites, one of them 
 
requested Warrant Officer Dlomo to reconsider his statement 
 
that he made in 1999.   
 
This change would positively incriminate Colonel Kimba and 
 
me.  They have subsequently made a further appointment with 
 
Warrant Officer Dlomo on 2010/11/16, they however wanted to 
 
know if he’s – Dlomo’s relationship with Colonel Kimba and 
 
asked why he was called killer.  My relationship with Colonel 
 
Kimba is on a professional level, both politically and work 
10 
 
related, there’s no friend relationship a suggested and then he 
 
goes further he says, Colonel Kimba is an active member of 
 
the ANC and during the struggle was a leader of one of the 
 
self defence units under the NKBA.  He was also a body guard 
 
for Mrs Winnie Mandela and former Minister Steve Tshwete.  I 
 
worked closely with them during the apartheid era especially 
 
during the riots, Colonel Kimba also played an important role 
 
in the Polokwane conference and also during the President’s 
 
trying times within engagements with the NPA.  He was 
 
appointed in the police during the time of the former National 
20 
 
Commissioner Jackie Selebi.   
 
It is worrying that after dealing with the Mpegu issues, we still 
 
have to deal with supposedly our own people are senior 
 
officers in the Intelligence environment, they are still fighting 
 
personal agendas that should be personal.  The question now 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 44 of 61 
 
 
arises what and how do they want to use the Intelligence 
 
environment to effect the 2012 build-up to the ANC conference.  
 
With this in mind I have, for the past few months, tightened on 
 
expenditure especially remuneration for sources with the view 
 
of ensuring funds are not abused for ulterior purposes relating 
 
to the 2012 build-up to the ANC conference.  Do they want to 
 
follow the Mpegu style and try and derail the ANC, I have 
 
requested an independent body to investigate these individuals 
 
with the view of uncovering their plots?  These senior loyal 
 
members were also active with the interceptions of Mr 
10 
 
Tshwete’s wife.  
 
 It is important to note that the member of the erstwhile 
 
Scorpions are also involved in these activities.  I will be failing 
 
in my responsibilities if I do not mention that both the joint 
 
standing committee in Intelligence and the Inspector General 
 
of Intelligence have commended me on my performance and 
 
have stated that a marked difference has been noticed from 
 
the time of my appointment.  I find it very disturbing and 
 
embarrassed to find that I have been investigated for no 
 
apparent reason, especially when initiated by persons who 
20 
 
have proven themselves to be disloyal.  I must also at this 
 
stage state that although I might not have gone outside and 
 
actively involved in the struggle I was active in many other 
 
areas.  I was and still am a loyal ANC member.   
 
Given the above and my frustrations I humbly request that the 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 45 of 61 
 
 
decision be take to resolve this issue and if needs be to 
 
appoint an independent person to address these so-called 
 
loyalists and their associates.  It would be appreciated if 
 
attention can be given to the fact that my calls are being 
 
monitored”.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you know if there was any action 
taken pursuant to this letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I do not know Chair, but what I do 
know from where I sit it confirms the fact that Crime Intelligence are 
involved in party politics and are involved in the ANC conferences 
10 
which they are not supposed to do it’s not part of their mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I was going to raise the question that, that letter 
– in that letter it seems to be talking to the politicians about factional 
battles within the ANC and it seems to suggest that within Crime 
Intelligence or within the police there are people who may have been 
on a certain camp in the Polokwane conference and others on other 
camps. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, that is 
exactly what I read into this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I could then in summary of the 
evidence you’ve given, ask you to turn to Exhibit 2.3 which is the 
diagrams bundle and ask you to please turn to page or diagram three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter which you said you have when Miss 
September asked you or referred you to Judge Murphy’s judgment 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 46 of 61 
 
where he quotes one sentence from a certain letter that General Mdluli 
appears to have addressed to the former President, were you talking 
about the letter that you have just read or another? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I presume it’s another letter 
because that specific quote is not in this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – no what I’m asking is whether, when you said 
you do have another letter but I think you were saying it might not be 
the same letter from which the Judge quoted. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but what I’m asking is whether the letter you’re 
10 
saying you do have is not the one that you have just read? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is the one that I have just 
read. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s the one you’re referring to, okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair this diagram which is entitled 
timeline, is – has been prepared with the use of two pages because it 
was simply illegible when on one page so the timeline then starts on 
page three and it concludes on page four. If we could start on page 
three, Mr Roelofse, is it correct that this timeline which you have 
confirmed is in fact a conservative representation of the delays 
20 
encountered by different individuals within the South African Police 
Service and the NPA? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we look then to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t think it will be necessary to go through each, 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 47 of 61 
 
I think it’s sufficient if he says he is aware of it and it’s a correct 
representations of the delays that have happened or its contents are 
correct because I think it’s quite clear, unless there’s some other point 
you wanted to raise. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair, there is just one 
question I want to ask him on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you have any comments to the 
accuracy of time as it’s recorded in the delays which are represented in 
days at the bottom strip of pages three and four? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I’ve got one comment, this 
is a very – as I said a very conservative the table or the timeline that’s 
been drawn up in terms of documentation that we know was sent but I 
know discussions took place earlier and I’m specifically speaking about 
General Ngcobo where I already spoke to him in 2012 but this only 
reflects from 2013 and then I think what is important is that they had 
gone by in terms of non-cooperation or non-assistance and if possible I 
just want to read those days out or read them into the record.  General 
Ngcobo from the period 7 March 2013 to October 17, 2013, that is 244 
days of doing nothing.  General Zulu 433 days, in that period it was 696 
20 
days from the beginning of 2013 to 2015 and General Phiyega is very 
conservative, it’s 109 days, General Ntlemeza is 944 days, General 
Madiba 127 days, General Sithole 968 days and that’s a period of 
seven years. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we can then – unless you have 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 48 of 61 
 
any queries we can move on, if we can then turn to diagram six of that 
same 
bundle 
which 
is 
the 
last 
diagram. 
 
This 
diagram 
was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say six? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct that this diagram was 
prepared off the affidavit that you had provided to the Commission and 
that at the time it was confirmed to be correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On the left-hand side you have a 
column which is titled, SSA, Secret Services Account and you have 
procurement and/or benefits – sorry and/or appointments and /or 
benefits. Is it correct that procurement relates to the procurement of 
various assets? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Appointments relates to either 
involvement in the appointment of individuals into Crime Intelligence as 
part of the 250 process in 2010? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And benefits could be of any kind? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In the middle we have a column 
titled, both, which is understood to straddle between the column on the 
left and the column on the right, is that correct? 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 49 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so the column on the right is 
tilted, obstructing investigations which is understood to be either 
through action or inaction? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The colour coding key is at the 
bottom of this diagram, yellow is civilian, blue is the South African 
Police Service, red is the National Prosecuting Authority, green is 
Crime Intelligence, black is Cabinet and Grey is the JSCI, Joint 
Standing Committee of Intelligence? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this diagram was then populated 
through the identification of individuals who were then either involved 
in the procurement and/or appointments and/or who received benefits in 
relation to the Secret Services Account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And on the other hand your 
experience insofar as action or inaction by individuals either within the 
NPA, SAPS or even the Joint Standing Committee of Intelligence in 
relation to your investigations? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so these particular individuals 
whose action or inaction effectively obstructed the progress of the 
investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, the column 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 50 of 61 
 
on the right. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   However, through your evidence this 
table has slightly moved in that you have given clarity on certain 
aspects which requires you to address some of these particular 
individuals.  If we could first start with the column on the left-hand 
side, General Bheki Cele. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair General Bheki Cele is 
mentioned in terms of the – in terms of my affidavit.  Regarding the 
benefits I do not – that is one of the issues that I could not corroborate 
and I am talking about the financial benefit that was alleged to have 
10 
been received.  So in terms of that it was information I am not in a 
position and I presume I would have been in a position to either prove 
or disprove that had the investigation continued. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let me just understand this diagram.  The first 
column you have SSA Procurement and or appointments and or 
benefits.  Then you have got peoples’ names.  Then the next column 
also has got names of people.  All the columns have got name of 
people.  What is the connection between the first column and the 
second column?  For example where it says Leo Hayes BMW Minister 
20 
Nathi. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   What is the connection with the? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the connection ja between the two?  What 
does the diagram say about the two for example? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Are we talking about now Minister 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 51 of 61 
 
Nathi Mthethwa? 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, yes and Leo Hayes a BMW? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there is no connection 
between the two it is about the – it is about a benefit that Mr Nathi 
Mthethwa received. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is understood that there is no 
particular relevance to the order of how these columns have been 
populated with names. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   There is also no linkages between 
the names as they aligned below or above or alongside each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It was really as I understand it 
anyway a grouping of individuals off the evidence of – off the affidavit 
of this witness as to which individuals had been involved in the 
procurement of assets and or appointments of individuals and or the 
receipt of benefits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does that both mean on – at the top of the third 
20 
column? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair sorry I thought… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The column you see at the top it says both. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is both what? 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 52 of 61 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is both – these individuals will 
fall within both those columns.  They are applicable to both columns.  
In other words they benefitted and they also obstructed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it both benefits and appointments? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair.  In terms of the first 
column on your left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The heading says “Procurement, 
appointments and benefits.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And it is also relevant to 
obstructing investigations action and inaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So these individuals will fall into 
both of these categories. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The individuals who are under the third column? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Under the – under the third – the 
second column.  They under both.  So the individuals under both… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Would – the individuals under 
20 
both would qualify to fall under both – under the first and the third 
column. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja probably could have been made much more 
simpler.  It seems confusing.  But the idea was you wanted to make a 
list of persons who are implicated in one way or another in regard to 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 53 of 61 
 
procurement and appointments and benefits as well as the obstruction 
of the investigation either by action or inaction. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  I am not sure maybe I do not understand.  
I am not sure that it conveys things as clearly as it could but one could 
– can always go back to your statement which says who did what, who 
did not do what. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But in all fairness to this – to the 
10 
evidence – to the testimony that you have presented to this commission 
there are certain individuals that you need to address so that it is – 
accords with the testimony. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That was done – that you have 
given. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so where reference is made to 
African Dream Church which should be African Family Dream Church is 
it correct that you were only referencing certain Pastors of that church.

MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair.  Yes Chair.  I am not 
referencing the church that is just by – by way of name but we are 
talking about the individuals within the church. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then in relation to LLVS Trading 
Services and Colonel V Malaza LLV Services being 5 t h – the yellow 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 54 of 61 
 
block 5 t h on the left hand side and Malaza being the 1 s t green block on 
the left hand side in the same column,  Is it correct that that related to 
the investigations of Mr Roos as you gave? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then if one looks to the column 
on the right hand side Lieutenant General Phahlane’s name is included.  
Do you have any clarity in relation to that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think I have explained my 
– my – how I viewed – how I view what happened there.  It is in terms 
of the inaction for a period of time and that is why he is in that column.  
10 
Although he did act after quite some time he did act.  After being 
informed in writing to assist. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then if one were to look at the 
bottom block – we still talking to the right hand column.  You have 
Advocate N Jiba.  It was your evidence that you cannot speculate 
regarding Advocate Jiba because you do not know if she saw the 
documents or not.  Should her name thus remain in – under a column 
which informs that through either action or inaction she obstructed your 
investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I stated earlier and I 
20 
have testified to this at Mokgoro Commission as well.  I cannot – I 
cannot for a fact state that she knew.  It would be just for me very 
highly unlikely that the office of the NDPP when it is – with regards to a 
serious matter like and they – important matter like this that she would 
not have been informed and would not have had sight of those letters.  
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 55 of 61 
 
So I based my – what I am saying on the assumption that she did but I 
do not know that for a fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do now know whether it might not be a good 
idea to revisit this diagram and if – and see where you stand in regard 
to each of the people so that in the end you are able to say in regard to 
the following my position is clear it is this.  In regard to these maybe I 
am not sure but these ones are the ones that I am quite clear about.  
So – so I – I just mentioned that it is something that might – might – it 
may be necessary to do a supplementary statement or a supplementary 
diagram that can be delivered later at some stage.  But as I understand 
10 
the position the diagram was meant to give to make things clearer but I 
do not think it makes things as clearer as may have been intended.  But 
the fact of the matter is that there is the statement which says who did 
what and who did not do what.  So one can always go back there. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The only last point for clarity in 
relation to this diagram which I believe this witness needs to clarify is 
Brigadier G Steyn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you have any comments to 
Brigadier G Steyn who was included in your diagram? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he was – he was included in 
terms of the statement that is attached to my affidavit of Colonel Roos.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then do you have any 
concluding remarks Mr Roelofse having reached the end of your 
statement? 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 56 of 61 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this habit of evidence leaders of asking 
witnesses for concluding remarks.  Mr Roelofse I think that that is a 
way of Ms September saying that she has no further questions for you.  
If you – there is anything that you think you have left out that is 
important or some aspect that you might not have put in proper 
perspective feel free to deal with it but otherwise since she has invited 
you – if you do have any final remarks you may – you may make them. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there is very – there is a lot 
of final remarks but I would rather – I will refrain from making them.  
Just to say I would like to thank the commission for the – for the 
10 
opportunity to be here and to give hopefully insight into what is 
happening in the South African Police Service and also just to clarify 
that this but a microcosm of what is currently happening with other 
detectives and other investigations.  So this is not the only one there 
are others especially when it comes to corruption cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was I right to say that was your way of saying you 
have no further questions? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Fairly correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much Colonel Roelofse for 
having come forward to share with the commission your experiences 
20 
and your evidence about what has been happening and the challenges 
you faced when you were pursuing certain investigations.  As I have 
said it is – I am quite concerned about what appears to have happened 
and the – it is clear to me that the documents that you have been trying 
to get declassified are documents that at least I am sure some of them 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 57 of 61 
 
that the commission would be interested in because they relate to 
matters that fall within the terms of reference of the commission.  The 
legal team will be – remain in touch with you – please remain in touch 
with them and certainly attempts will be made by the commission to 
obtain documents that may throw light on some of the issues that you 
have dealt with and you will – you will be kept informed.  But thank you 
very much for coming forward to share what you know with the 
commission.  I hope that other people within law enforcement who may 
have gone through similar challenges as you did will come forward also 
and share with the commission what has been happening.  Because the 
10 
commission cannot make recommendations as to how things must be 
fixed in certain sectors if it does not have people who come forward 
and say there is something wrong going on there.  This is what is going 
wrong.  And if certain sectors in the country have things going wrong 
particularly with law enforcement and the commission is not told then 
the country does not know then the country cannot attend to those 
things to make sure things change.  So I am grateful that you – you 
came to share your evidence with the commission.  You may be asked 
to come back and I have no doubt you will come back if asked but thank 
you very much for coming forward.  For now I see Ms September does 
20 
not want me to release you.  Ms September what do you want? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Might I be permitted to just hand up 
a more legible copy of KDR22 which you requested? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine.  You are excused.  Thank you 
very much.

MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We are going to take the tea 
adjournment.  I am supposed to hear evidence relating to Estina after 
this but the legal team will talk to me I am sure during the tea break 
and then we will take it from there.  I will see what is going to happen.  
We will adjourn for tea and it is now twenty three minutes past eleven; 
we will resume at twenty to twelve.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Gcabashe.  Good morning 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We are supposed to have the evidence of 
Ms Rockman … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct DC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to Vrede? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and she is represented by legal representatives? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who would like to - they too would like to 
place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us do that. 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 59 of 61 
 
UNKNOWN PERSON:  Thank you DCJ.  I appear on behalf of 
Ms Rockman having been instructed to do so by Mr Brett Murison of 
Boqwana Burns.  DCJ thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  DCJ just to indicate that she is here and - 
and able to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Rockman is here and ready. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Just for the benefit of the public 
everybody is here and they are ready to proceed but we are not going 
10 
to proceed with the hearing of evidence today.  We were going to 
continue even tomorrow in an attempt to try and finalise but I am not 
too well and earlier I thought maybe I would be able to continue but I 
think it is best that I go and try and rest and if necessary see a doctor, 
so that hopefully by next week I will be fine.  So I am sorry that we 
cannot proceed and I know that people have made arrangements to be 
here but of course one does not plan for this kind of thing.  So we are 
not going to proceed.  I have spoken to the legal teams on both sides 
who understand. 
We are going to adjourn the hearing of Ms Rockman’s 
20 
evidence provisionally to the 14 t h and 15 October.  It is provisional 
because certain things need to - the Commission need - needs to check 
certain things with regard to a witness who was going to be here during 
that week who might not be here because of certain circumstances. 
So confirmation will be provided in due course.  At this stage 
20 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 168 
 
Page 60 of 61 
 
it looks like those dates are fine for all sides.  That is what is going to 
happen.  I do not know whether you have anything to say or add 
Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no nothing at all DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Other than to ask you to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To rest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And to actually see a doctor.  Thank you 
10 
DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Counsel for Ms Rockman anything you want to 
add or say? 
UNKNOWN PERSON:  Save to echo the sentiment of our leader DCJ.  
We do not have anything to add.  We confirm that the dates are 
suitable to ourselves and to - and to Ms Rockman provisionally as they 
are and we will hear from our leader in - in due course as to whether 
those dates become final or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Thank - thank you very much.  In that 
event then we are going to adjourn proceedings for the day.  On 
20 
Monday we are meant to commence at 2 o’ clock not in the morning as 
usual.  There is an application that I will be hearing and there may or 
may not be oral evidence after that hearing.  I - I am not sure but we 
are not starting in the morning as usual.  So I thought I would also just 
indicate that for purposes of the media and the public.  We adjourn.
