PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 04 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Are we ready? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson we are ready to have the 
hearing and today Chairperson is the evidence of Mr 
Vincent Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Chairperson recall this – Mr 
10 
Vincent Smith features in the stream of BOSASA and his 
evidence is as a result of the evidence of Mr Agrizzi 
wherein he said that there were – said they met Mr – Mr 
Smith and then there were some agreements between Mr 
Smith and Mr Gavin Watson and there were payments 
made to Mr Smith.   
And then there were also repairs that were made at 
the house of Mr Smith.  Mr Smith after filed an affidavit in 
response to the evidence and the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi 
and he – Mr Agrizzi likewise although very late filed an 
20 
affidavit.   
Mr Agrizzi’s affidavit was filed – unsigned was filed 
last night and then the signed one I am instructed has just 
been filed.  As a result, it is not in the file before you but it 
is going to be given to me and then handed up and then we 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 4 of 231 
 
place it accordingly.   
 
What we have today Chairperson in front of us is 
BOSASA Bundle 2 and this continues – BOSASA Bundle 2 
contains some affidavit – some exhibits.  It contains T20 
and the one which we dealt with yesterday and it does not 
feature in these proceedings. And then it will contain once 
you have admitted the affidavit the evidence of Mr Smith 
but we will deal with it when – when I will apply for the 
submission.  But so in the bundle the file before you is 
Bundle – BOSASA Bundle 02.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I saw that it also contains 
correspondence that I would think is really not relevant for 
the purposes of the hearing so you might wish to reflect on 
that and for future matters members of the legal team must 
make sure that every document that is – that is placed 
before the commission is relevant. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chairperson the only problem 
some of you will see – most of the correspondence is 
annexures to Mr Vincent Smith’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay well… 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So they go in as annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it is a – if it is annexures then you 
might not – you might not have – be able – you might not 
be able to do anything with that except that – except that… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair for instance you will see – you 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 5 of 231 
 
will see from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one at page 0 or 102 comes before 
Mr Smith’s affidavit so it cannot be an annexure.  It is a 
covering letter I think saying here is his affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we do not have to go through 
everyone just as long as you get a chance to apply your 
mind to the question whether everything that is here is 
relevant. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there have been times when 
bundles are put up; you look at the bundle it is full but 
ultimately only half of the documents. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That are being now referred to so the 
question is why are the other documents here? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No I get your point.  And then it – it can 
get also confusing when the report has to be written. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now when one has to recall whether a 
20 
certain issue was referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then does it form part as – is it part of 
the record or if – by now I have - I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So no that is fine.  Yes, I think Mr 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 6 of 231 
 
Agrizzi’s evidence with regard to Mr Smith it was Mr 
Agrizzi’s evidence together with that of Mr Le Roux. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Related to three matters.  Well one it is 
that the thrust of Mr Agrizzi’s evidence was that for a 
certain period of time they were trying to get Mr Smith to 
cooperate with BOSASA I use my own word when I say 
cooperate so that he could assist BOSASA with regard to 
certain matters and he was giving them any attention and 
they had to speak to Mr Cedric Frolick to get Mr Frolick to 
10 
talk to him and this he said after Mr Frolick had talked to 
him and I think after some meeting or meetings then Mr 
Smith according to Mr Agrizzi had a changed attitude 
towards them and cooperated.  And he said that BOSASA 
gave Mr Smith money I think he said every month and then 
he said they gave him money for his daughter ’s studies.  
And then he said they also installed some security features 
at his house.  I think those are the matters that he – they 
covered and I think Mr Le Roux says he is the person who 
went to Mr Smith’s house to install certain security 
20 
features.  So that is – I think that the sum total of it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And if I may add there Chair on the 
papers the real issue is – the real issue is whether there 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 7 of 231 
 
were monthly payments because the amounts paid – two 
amounts 
paid 
for 
the 
daughter ’s 
university 
fees 
are 
admitted and the only issue there is whether it was a loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Or it was merely monies given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  A bribe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then – yes it is a bride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or reward. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, yes or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Or a present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the – then insofar as equipment is 
concerned also there is no dispute there.  The only dispute 
is about the amount of – the value of the equipment that 
was fitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So as – I agree with the Chair that it is 
almost – the enquiry is almost – the evidence is almost on 
limited issues. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Okay alright.  You said you were 
ready but I understand that there may be a request for 
some time before we – some adjournment before we start? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 8 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  We – the reason why there was an 
indication of a short adjournment and time is because the 
affidavits of Mr Agrizzi and Le Roux were received late and 
apparently there has not been sufficient time to consult 
with the client.  But the legal representatives of Mr Smith 
are here and can they address you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And see what they want. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they can place themselves on record. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no let him go to the podium.  That 
must be sanitised first.   
ADV PHALANE:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV PHALANE:  Chair my name is Moraka Phalane junior 
counsel for Mr Smith.  My leader is Malindi SC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHALANE:  Who for reasons of being on duty as an 
acting Judge is unable to – to be present today?  The – Mr 
Smith is very eager to proceed today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHALANE:  Although there were documents that have 
material bearing on todays’ proceedings that we only 
received last night and I personally only saw them this 
morning.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 9 of 231 
 
He 
has 
however 
still 
given 
us 
a 
preliminary 
indication that he is still eager to – to proceed with the 
proviso that in the event that any of the documents that 
were delivered late are to be relied upon we would request 
a brief recess to apply ourselves to those.   
I do not think it will exceed thirty minutes to 
consider those.  But all in all, he is still eager to proceed 
with todays’ proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I can – I think it might be better 
that I give you time or give him time to look at the 
10 
documents before we start so that when we start it is 
smooth. We also avoid if we can an arrangement in terms 
of which he might have to come back and all of that.   
We do sometimes just to avoid a witness coming 
back say we will send written questions and an affidavit 
can be prepared.  But it is not ideal you know but 
sometimes it can be done.  Looking at how narrow the 
issues are I have no doubt that there is enough time for us 
to finish with his evidence today.   
So – because as I understand the position with 
20 
regard to the payment for the daughter ’s studies, he does 
not deny that that payment was made.  The only question 
is whether it was a loan or simply a bribe or reward for 
what may be seen by – may have been seen by BOSASA as 
cooperation and him assisting them.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 10 of 231 
 
With regard to the security features in his house in 
his affidavit he seems to accept that that was done 
although I came across something I think a statement that 
may have been issued by the ANC on his behalf which 
suggested that the security features at home were not 
installed by BOSASA.   
But that statement was admitting the money that 
was paid in regard to the studies of the daughter but 
saying it was a loan.  But it was saying that as far as 
security features at home that had nothing to do with 
10 
BOSASA.  But obviously if I understood that statement 
correctly Mr Smith will deal with it.  So the issues are quite 
narrow.  So – so I think maybe I should give – give you 
some time.   
We are at quarter past ten.  I can give you up to 
eleven.  That gives you forty-five minutes and I guess that 
should be enough. 
ADV PHALANE:  More than enough Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And then we – we can start at eleven 
then we will not have a tea break which we normally have 
20 
at quarter past.  We will then just go on. 
ADV PHALANE:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine? 
ADV PHALANE:  That is – that is in order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 11 of 231 
 
ADV PHALANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright then we – we are going to adjourn 
and we will resume at eleven o’clock.   
ADV PHALANE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready to start? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair we are ready to roll.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath or 
10 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR SMITH:  Vincent George Smith. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR SMITH:  I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Was that I have? 
MR SMITH:  I do not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you do not. 
MR SMITH:  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SMITH:  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 12 of 231 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR SMITH:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR SMITH:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  If you do not have any 
problem removing the mask that may help Mr Smith.  Ja 
10 
okay thank you.  Thank you.  Yes Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Smith there is in front of you a file 
and I believe you have gone through it with your legal 
representatives and the file is BOSASA Bundle 02.  You 
have it in front of you? 
MR SMITH:  I do Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And what you should do is just go to 
what is written there is T20.  You are on there? 
MR SMITH:  I do have it yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Smith I think just keep it – or keep 
20 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may keep in on ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Keep it on it is going to – now Mr Smith 
can we take you – what we are going to use when we refer 
to numbers, we are referring to the black numbers. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 13 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It has got nothing to do with race but it 
is just the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are the ones on the top left corner 
of each page. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well actually that is not true because not 
every document in this bundle has got black numbers I 
realise now.  Those at the beginning do not seem to have 
10 
but they have nothing to do with Mr Smith.  I think all – 
probably all those that relate to Mr Smith have got the 
black numbers.  But you will just have to make sure Mr 
Notshe that if you are going to have other documents in 
this bundle then there must be consistency then they must 
also have black numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise these are the documents which 
they do not seem to relate to Mr Smith might have to go to 
another bundle.  If they were introduced at a time where 
20 
there was the black numbers were not used. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Which documents are those Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  They relate to Ms Mokonyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No those – those documents Chair 
remember this – they are not - they do not form part of 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 14 of 231 
 
T30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am saying you have in this bundle a 
set of documents that have black numbers and red 
numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you have a set of documents 
that only have red numbers and not black numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is the ones relating to Mr Smith? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And I am saying that… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Which ones are those Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have a file that is different from 
the one I have? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No I do not.  I do not believe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you should know if we have the 
same file because the first page relates to NP Mokonyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On T30 is the first – is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the file that is – that is here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Is that BOSASA Bundle 2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair we are not dealing with Ms 
20 
Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I have taken the witness to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why I am surprised but I expected 
you to know because my file must be the same as your file 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 15 of 231 
 
and the witness’ file. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes it is the same.  If the – the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you do not have that that means 
our files are not the same. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  They are the same Chair but the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how can they be the same if you do 
not have at the beginning of the file Ms Mokonyane’s 
documents and I do have. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I have that.  But you remember I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought you said you do not have? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No I did not say that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  All I said is that I have referred the 
witness to – when I – before we adjourned, I referred the 
Chair to Bundle – BOSASA Bundle 2 then I said to the 
Chair in it we have – we have T20.1 which we dealt with 
yesterday.  And today we are going to deal with T30 when 
it is admitted.  So today we are not dealing with T20.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think you are listening to me. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I am listening to you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no let me repeat.  I know that in 
this bundle you have documents relating to Mr Smith. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am saying you also have documents 
relating to Ms Mokonyane in the same bundle. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 16 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And you said that with regard to 
Mr Smith he must know that when you refer to pages – 
page numbers you will be referring to the black numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I then said I realise that not all 
documents that are in this bundle have got black numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are those that do not have black 
numbers at the beginning. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you asked which documents and I 
said they relate to Ms Mokonyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I was saying if they are going to be 
kept in this bundle. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where there are some documents with 
red and black numbers then there must be consistency.  
They must also have black and red numbers.  But if that is 
20 
not going to happen then they should go to another file 
which will have only the red numbers.  That is what I was 
saying. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought you were saying you do not 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 17 of 231 
 
have the Mokonyane ones. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No I have Mokonyane.  All I am saying 
is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do yours also only have red ones – 
Mokonyane’s ones? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So that be dealt with later.  I am just 
saying if it is in the same file it is going to be confusing if 
some pages – some documents have got black numbers 
and red numbers and others only have red numbers.  But 
10 
that can be sorted out later. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Smith can you – in your file 
there is a dividing written T30. 
MR SMITH:  I do have it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And now on that on the black numbers 
can you then look at page 103; 103? 
MR SMITH:  I do have that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now there is the affidavit Vincent 
20 
George Smith you saw – you see that? 
MR SMITH:  I do Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then can I ask you then to turn to 
page 135? 
MR SMITH:  Yes I am there. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 18 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There is a signature above the words – 
oh sorry above the name Vincent George Smith.   
MR SMITH:  Yes I see it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now whose signature is that? 
MR SMITH:  That is my signature Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then go and in the end look at – 
and is it correct let me put it that way that that document 
has got annexures and those annexures go to – they go to 
page 209? 
MR SMITH:  Yes I am there Chair. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Smith is it correct that from 
103 – page 103 to 209 that is your affidavit? 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you confirm the contents thereof 
this – that as – as your affidavit? 
MR SMITH:  I do. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair can I apply for leave that this 
affidavit of Mr Smith be admitted as Exhibit T30 together 
with annexures? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Vincent George Smith 
20 
appearing from page 103 is admitted and together with its 
annexures and will be marked as Exhibit T30. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Smith this 
affidavit – your affidavit and your appearance today before 
this commission was as a result of the affidavit and the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 19 of 231 
 
evidence of Mr Agrizzi, is that correct? 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then you also had access and you 
responded to the affidavit of Mr Richard Le Roux? 
MR SMITH:  I did Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you start with your affidavit 
referring to some issues that there were before between 
your attorneys and the commission but on page 117 – page 
117. 
MR SMITH:  Yes Sir. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On section C of your affidavit you deal 
with what you call financial assistance by business to Civil 
Servants and Activists.  Can you in your own words tell the 
Chairperson what you – what you are saying there? 
MR SMITH:  Indeed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Mr Smith you are free to look and 
read from your affidavit if you so wish. 
MR SMITH:  No I will attempt to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is… 
MR SMITH:  To talk to it Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is much better if you talk. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And only refer to the affidavit to refresh 
your memory. 
MR 
SMITH: 
 
Chair 
I 
was 
– 
I 
was 
attempting 
to 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 20 of 231 
 
contextualise not only my affidavit but the situation in the 
country post the unbanning of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
MR SMITH:  And I state there Chair that because many of 
our comrades came from outside and were unable to 
survive including those inside the country that were on the 
run. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  It became clear that business or in fact 
business adopted what we call the social – corporate 
10 
social investments programme.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  I suppose to assist people.  And I think the 
intentions at the time were very noble that they assisted 
those that came from outside and those that were inside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  And many of them Chair and I hate using 
political parlance but we – we refer to them as the patriotic 
bourgeoisie in other words businesses that were – were 
favourable to us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  And they assisted us in many ways in getting 
us to school, getting us education, getting us houses and 
so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 21 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:  And I believe that unintentionally could have 
been the beginning of this conflictual relationship between 
business and activists through politicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  So what I am saying Chair that is not unique 
to post 1994.  It was in fact as a result of the situation that 
we found ourselves in after the unbanning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  So that is the context in which I was trying to 
lay it Chairperson. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  If we come to the case at hand 
involving BOSASA when did you – you say in your affidavit 
you met Mr Gavin Watson around about 1990. Was it part 
of what you have just testified about? 
MR SMITH:  Indeed, it was part of that Chair.  And I raise 
it to illustrate that my relationship with the late Gavin 
Watson preceded my election to Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  At the time of the unbanning the ANC had a 
program where we had to rebuild the structures in the 
20 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  And also, to develop communities.  And the 
way we did that was to approach friendly business people 
if I could put it that way.  And one of those friendly 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 22 of 231 
 
business people that we approach was the late Gavin 
Watson because he was a comrade.  And he assisted us in 
many, many ways.  So my relationship with Mr Watson – 
the late Mr Watson precedes my election as a Public 
Representative in 1994.  And I wanted to put that in 
context and I will continue referring to that Chair so that 
people understand that it was not a Public Representative 
relationship.  Thanks Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now at that time was Mr Watson having 
a relationship with BOSASA?  Did you know anything about 
10 
that?  What his relationship with BOSASA? 
MR SMITH:  No I did not have the intricate details of what 
his relationship was at BOSASA but I did know that Mr 
Watson was a business man.  I did know Mr Watson was a 
comrade and I did know that every time we sought 
assistance, he never hesitated to assist us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now when you were elected as a 
Member of Parliament what Portfolio Committee did you 
occupy – were you part of? 
20 
MR SMITH:  I – I was elected as a Member of Parliament in 
1999 and I served in the Portfolio or the Standing 
Committee of Public Accounts.  And I think I served in the 
Portfolio Committee of Public Enterprises Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 23 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then – did you any stage serve in 
the Public – in the Portfolio Committee of Correctional 
Services? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I did in the third parliament.  In other 
words, from 2009 to 2014, I was the Chairperson for the 
Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if I understand the work of the 
Portfolio Committee is, the work of the parliament sort of 
supervising, overseeing the work of the executive.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now on a day-to-day basis of those 
committees, what do they do? 
MR SMITH:   We did many things, Chair.  But in essence, I 
was asked to, as in say, do oversight over the Portfolio 
Committee.  Over the department.  I beg your pardon, 
Chairperson.   
 
So we would ask questions of the department.  We would 
engage with them.  We would also engage with stakeholders 
so that we, as the members of parliament, were clued up 
20 
with the subject matter when it was Correctional Services or 
Justice or whatever the case was.   
 
But that in essence was our work.  And also, of course, 
passing laws and passing the budget. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if I understand the work and 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 24 of 231 
 
through part of your affidavit, the Portfolio Committees had 
the power to call the officials of the department to appear 
before you? 
MR SMITH:   Indeed we had that power.  That was our core 
business to interact with the departments that we were 
responsible for.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And in that process, you would pose 
questions and investigate any that concern you regarding the 
rank of the department. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, we were able to do that.  We had the 
10 
power to do that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you would also question the issues 
of the award of tenders and if there is any sense of 
irregularities, you would raise that with the departments.  Am 
I  correct? 
MR SMITH:   Well, we would raise it with the department not 
because it came through us Chairperson.  The way it worked 
is, that the Auditor General in his annual reports, if he 
picked up any irregularities, would be in the annual report.   
 
And on the basis of the information of the annual report, 
20 
we were at liberty to say but the Auditor General says that 
there was this and that, an irregularity, but it was not the 
core business of the Portfolio Committee.   
 
That was a function of the Auditor General but there was 
nothing stopping us from saying that the Auditor General has 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 25 of 231 
 
indicated:  Please, explain Mr DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Notshe is asking you on an 
issue that might be important in the context of your evidence 
but it is also important for other parts of the job of the 
Commission.  And I want to take this opportunity to look at 
that before he goes into the meat of the today’s evidence.   
 
Now you have just said that was not part of our function, 
but we had the power to ask, this is what the Auditor General 
says but I did not understand what it is that you say was not 
part of your function. 
10 
MR SMITH:   Chair, what was not part of our function was to 
interrogate or to do the initial investigations of irregular 
unauthorised, that type of thing.  That was the speciality of 
the Auditor General in his audits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SMITH:   And on an annual basis, the department was 
obliged to publish annual report and that annual report was 
the Auditor General’s report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   So when we called the department, we were at 
20 
liberty to look at any matters in the annual report which 
included the Auditor General’s report.  And if there were any 
red flags that the Auditor General has raised, we would ask 
the department to explain that to us.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  And in terms of what you 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 26 of 231 
 
could do – and again I am just going to something that is 
important for different reasons for the Commission – in terms 
of what you could do as the Portfolio Committee, if you found 
that 
you 
did 
not 
get 
satisfactory 
answers 
from 
the 
department or from the relevant minister or the DG or if you 
are from the view that things were getting out of hand, what 
is that, as the Portfolio Committee, you could do about this 
situation? 
 
In other words, did your powers end with just talking or 
would there be some concrete action that would follow if 
10 
either the relevant minister or the DG and his or her officials 
were effectively refusing to do the right something about 
sorting out certain things in the department? 
MR SMITH:   The reality of the time Chair was that 
parliament only had powers of recommendation.  We could 
not instruct the executive what to do or what not to do 
because of the doctrine of separation of powers as you are 
aware.   
 
But I can now Chair say to you that in my other life, post 
2019, I chaired the Committee on the Auditor General and 
20 
the past... in 2013 or 2012, the Public Audit Act which gives 
the Auditor General significant powers to do the things you 
are 
talking 
about, 
including 
referring 
mattes 
to 
law 
enforcement agencies which was not prior to the Public Audit 
Act being amended Chair.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 27 of 231 
 
 
So at the time, ours was just to raise the red flag but it 
was up to the department and the political authority to fix it 
up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You may or you may not be able to 
express a view on this but I am going to put it.  It seems to 
me that constitutionally one of the things that parliament can 
do in a situation where a Portfolio Committee are really 
unhappy how certain things are handled in a particular 
department, say Correctional Services, and they have called 
the Director General and then there is this fight with the 
10 
answers, they have called the minister, they are not satisfied 
but they can see that there are real problems. 
 
It seems to me that the committee probably can report to 
parliament, to National Assemble and the National Assemble 
can, you know, deal with the minister in terms of him 
accounting in the National Assemble. 
 
But ultimately, the parliament could say:  We are going 
to pass a vote of no-confidence in the president if the 
president does not get this minister to fix this or will... we 
will pass a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet because it 
20 
looks like you can... parliament can pass a vote of no-
confidence in the president or in the cabinet. 
 
If it passes a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet, that 
means they do not have issues with the president.  They just 
have issues with his cabinet.  And then he must reconstitute 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 28 of 231 
 
his cabinet. 
 
But parliament can also pass a vote of no-confidence in 
the president and his cabinet.  Obviously, that is quite 
drastic, but it seems to me that if there are really things that 
are going wrong in the government department and the 
Portfolio Committee or parliament have called the officials, 
the DG and the minister and have given them enough time to 
fix things and they are not fixing them, and they have asked 
the president to make sure that these things goes by the 
minister and nothing is happening, that is an option that 
10 
parliament always has.  Is that something you have a view 
on? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chairperson I do.  I agree with you.  More 
than that Chairperson, we also and when I say we, I mean 
parliament, also on an annual basis approves the budget.  
So parliament, theoretically, could not approve that budget.   
 
The difficulty with that Chair, is that, you will then be 
punishing South Africans who are the beneficiaries of 
whatever that service is at the expense of an official or two 
or even a cabinet minister who might not be doing his job.   
20 
 
So yes, you could deny him that budget but in reality, 
the real casualties will be the South Africans.  So it is a very 
difficult decision to make but theoretically it is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It can be done.  I guess, that if you have 
before you as parliament a real case of a stubborn 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 29 of 231 
 
department, a stubborn minister, a stubborn DG...   
 
Let us say there is rampant corruption and really nothing 
of any significance is being done, even after the relevant 
Portfolio Committee has been saying:  Sort this out.  Sort 
this out.  And nothing is being done and they have run out of 
patience. 
 
They could say:  Well, as long as you are the minister of 
this department, we are not going to approve this because 
we have no confidence in you.  We are not prepared to 
listen.  You cannot manage.   
10 
 
But if the president wants this to be passed, then he will 
have to change and get another minister because you have 
described that you are not prepared to listen.  You are 
incompetent.  So does that sound like something that would 
be an option? 
MR SMITH:   It does sound like that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, you, as parliament, the 
idea would not be that you do not want to pass the budget 
completely but you want to exercise your power in the 
interest of the people.   
20 
 
Because you are saying, it is not in the interest of the 
people of South Africa that this minister continues in this 
portfolio because of A, B, C, D.   
 
And you have clear evidence.  And you say:  We have 
even spoken to the president and nothing is being done.  So 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 30 of 231 
 
actually, allowing passing the budget so that this minister 
continuous with its... actually, going to... it cannot be in the 
interest of the people. 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, there is a Public Finance 
Management Act that is very clear on how public funds must 
be spend and the consequences thereof.  Admittedly, that 
was not implemented to the full.  Had it been implemented to 
the full, we would have had less... half of the problems.   
 
But secondly, Chair, as I have indicated.  We have the 
concern that parliament has given the Auditor General 
10 
extensive powers post 2013 where even the Auditor General 
has the ability to raise these matters with the relevant law 
enforcement agencies.   
 
So I think that will be their deterrent and no minister will 
in future him not found not be wanting, to be referred to the 
SIU or whatever it may be.   
 
So I believe it is this, stepping in the right direction and 
once that kicks in, it is a year old when we passed the glass 
with my last year there.   
 
But I think we will be able to see the fruits of that new 
20 
Public Audit Act and the powers of the Auditor General, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  I will allow Mr Notshe to 
continue.  But I just say, I have no doubt that the increase of 
the powers of the Auditor General in this context is really a 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 31 of 231 
 
step in the right direction. 
 
But my concern is that it would appear that a lot of 
people in the country do not really care who has what 
powers when it comes to wrongdoing.   
 
I mean, if you think about the fact that this Commission 
has been sitting since 2018, hearing evidence of wrongdoing 
and corruption and so on and so on, you would not think that 
the kind of corruption that we are told about in regard to PPE 
would be happening.   
 
But it is like you say, nothing will happen.  So we can 
10 
just continue as normal, you know.  Nothing will happen and 
that may well be because they look around and say:  What 
has happened to who?  We would do things and nothing ever 
happens.  So we will do them.  Nothing will happen.   
 
So I agree that it is a step in the right direction but it is 
quite concerning.  I mean, if what one reads in the media 
about PPE corruption, it is frightening and it happens at a 
time when there is a Commission looking at corruption.   
 
So it is like they say:  Nothing will happen.  I mean, it 
happens at a time when we have a lot of law enforcement 
20 
agencies who were supposed to be specialising and dealing 
in corruption.  But people just do not care.   
 
But anyway.  But thank you for your views in regard to 
this aspect that I wanted to explore with you.  Thank you, Mr 
Notshe.  You may continue. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 32 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just to be specific.  Just complete what 
the Chair asked you to do, just to give a sort of an overview.  
What is the role of the Portfolio Committee insofar as the 
approval of the appropriation bills?  The appropriation of the 
budget of the department, what is the role of the Portfolio 
Committees? 
MR SMITH:   Well, initially, the department would present its 
annual strategic plan and its proposed budget to the 
Portfolio Committee in the first instance.   
 
It is there where the real work gets done, where the 
10 
Portfolio Committee will interrogate the department, trying to 
understand what it is that these parties were going to buy or 
do.   
 
If the Portfolio Committee thereafter writes a report to 
parliament, in other words, 11 of the Portfolio Committees 
would write a report to the 400, saying:  We have 
interrogated Department X and in our view, we think that this 
budget is appropriate.   
 
Parliament then has a second bite as a body when the 
Minister of Finance presents his budget to then approve the 
20 
overall budget plus the various departmental budgets.   
 
So there are two bites of the cherry.  One at the 
Portfolio Committee level and one at the National Assemble 
level, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you say at that level, at the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 33 of 231 
 
Portfolio level, the Portfolio Committee can then report to 
parliament that this department has respond to Item X and 
therefore Item X should either be reduced or either not be 
approved? 
MR SMITH:   Indeed, we do that, Chair.  The way it works in 
reality is that the minister would... there would be a debate 
on the budget.  The minister would present the budget and 
what it is what he or she hopes to achieve.   
 
And members of the Portfolio Committee in response to 
the minister’s input would then be able to raise the issues 
10 
that we have raised.   
 
You asking for X Mr Minister or Ms Minister but this is 
what is happening at the department.  So all members of the 
committee being able to respond to the proposals that the 
minister is putting and that is how the process works in 
parliament. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.   Now Mr Smith, let us deal with 
the matter at hand.  And you say in your evidence and in 
your affidavit and Mr Agrizzi also confirms this, that is the 
first you met him was when he came to the parliament 
20 
offices, and who brought him to the offices? 
MR SMITH:   In terms of who brought him to my offices, 
specifically was... in fact, he never came to my offices in... 
but parliament was facilitated by the Chairs of Chair, Mr 
Frolick who then indicated that there was a delegation that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 34 of 231 
 
wanted to see me.  And at that point, I went to see them at a 
venue that Mr Frolick had arranged with the delegation. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you just tell the Commission what is 
this Chairs of Chair?  What does that mean?  What is that 
title? 
MR SMITH:   Portfolio Committees have chairpersons, 
various chairpersons but there is an individual who is 
responsible for all Portfolio Committees.  So he is the 
chairperson of those who pass the chairpersons.  So he was 
overall in charge of the work of Portfolio Committees if I can 
10 
put it that way.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   From ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Does that mean that there is a forum 
which 
consists 
of 
chairpersons 
of 
various 
Portfolio 
Committees and he is, therefore, the chair of that forum or 
there is not a formal forum? 
MR SMITH:   There is what we used to call the meeting of 
the Chair of Chairs.  Once the... but I do not know what the 
irregularity was and the Chair of Chairs decided over that 
meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Where all chairpersons of committees were all 
in attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you remember the year when... it is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 35 of 231 
 
not clear on the affidavit, the year when this delegation was 
brought to you? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I remember.  The year was 2009.  I was a 
little chairperson in 2009 and we really started our work 
towards the end of 2009.   
 
And these... or this delegation was probably one of the 
first two or three stakeholders who had requested to have a 
meeting with me in order to introduce themselves to the new 
chairperson.  So that was in 2009.  In 2009, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You referred to the Chair of Chairs.  Was 
10 
that Mr Frolick at that stage or was that somebody else? 
MR SMITH:   I am not sure.  In 2009, I am not sure but I do 
know that towards the end Mr Frolick was the chair.  But you 
know I am not sure who was the chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am referring to the person that you said 
that brought them, Mr Agrizzi and whoever to you or who 
said to you that there is this delegation.  I thought you said it 
was the Chair of Chairs and I am asking whether that was Mr 
Frolick or that was somebody else? 
MR SMITH:   The point I am making Chairperson, it was Mr 
20 
Frolick in terms of the human being. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   But was he the Chair of Chairs at that point or 
was he not the chair, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 36 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, you met this delegation and it was 
Mr Agrizzi and Mr Njenje.  Is that right?  And it became clear, 
they introduced themselves as from BOSASA.  Is that right? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now did the name BOSASA ring a bell to 
you at that stage? 
MR SMITH:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did the name of BOSASA as a company 
rang a bell to you at that stage? 
MR SMITH:   It rang a bell to me to the extent that I knew 
10 
that Mr Watson was involved because BOSASA had a 
relationship with him but I was primarily in the Portfolio 
Committee and I really did not, at that point, get to grips with 
what it is with what they were providing or not providing to 
the department.  So, yes, I knew the name BOSASA by virtue 
of my relationship with the late Gavin Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Notshe.  Going back to Mr 
Frolick.  His role in introducing, if that is what he did, the 
BOSASA delegation or mentioning to you that there is this 
20 
delegation to wants to see you.   
 
Are you able to say whether there was a role he had in 
parliament that might have made it understandable that he is 
the one who brought them to you.   
 
For example, if he was Chair of Chairs, maybe it was 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 37 of 231 
 
because you were the chairperson of this committee.  So you 
were a member of the Chair of Chairs Forum, if you know 
what I mean?   
 
But if he was simple a member of parliament and no 
special role, do you know whether his bringing them to you, 
might simple be because he bumped into them in the 
passage and they said:  We are looking for Mr Smith’s office.  
And he said:  Okay, I will take you there.  Or it might be 
because of some special role that he had at that time in 
parliament. 
10 
MR SMITH:   I do not have the answer to that.  I do not know 
that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you do not know. 
MR SMITH:   Ja, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your impression at that time, was it like, 
he bumped into them or you cannot remember? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, if he was the Chair of Chairs at the time 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   ...I could understand that he wants to make the 
20 
committees or parliament work better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   Ja, if he was the Chair of Chairs at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   As I say, I am not sure what portfolio he held at 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 38 of 231 
 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   But other than that, I am afraid I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay that is fine.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now can you remember what part or the 
month in 2009 when they were brought to you? 
MR SMITH:   I beg your pardon, sir? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you remember what month of 2009 
was this delegation introduced to you? 
MR SMITH:   No, I do not know.  What month? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   No, I do not. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I understand it, that time in 2009, 
you were the Chairperson of a Portfolio Committee of 
Correctional Services? 
MR SMITH:   I was the Chair of the Portfolio Committee of 
Correctional Services.  That is correct.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  The reason why I am referring, 
asking you about the month is this.  If you just turn to page 
241?   
20 
MR SMITH:   241? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   241, ja.  The one with the black 
numbers. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, sir.  I am there, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you.  Now these are the minutes 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 39 of 231 
 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
meeting 
of 
the 
14t h of October 2009.  Do you see that? 
MR SMITH:   I do, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if you turn... if you will be so kind 
as to turn the page to this items that starts 243?  Item 3.3. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Well, it deals with nutritional services.  
MR SMITH:   I see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if you go over the page to 244.  It 
reads... I just want to read the minutes.  It says: 
10 
“Mr Selfie noted that the latest BOSASA contract 
which was essentially a continuation of the earlier 
one costed the DCS... 
 
I suppose that is the 
Department 
of 
Correctional 
Services... 
“...R 838.3 million.  This award had resulted in the 
transfer of then National Commissioner of Sports 
and Recreation Department. 
BOSASA has been awarded the contract despite 
being 
under 
investigation 
by 
the 
Special 
20 
Investigation Unit. 
According to the IS report, that still had to be 
presented to the committee, the SIU has uncovered 
evidence 
of 
corruption 
and/of 
the 
supply 
and 
demand tender specification. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 40 of 231 
 
The SIU recommended significant recoveries and 
seizures of assets and has referred to the matter to 
the National Prosecuting Authority, NPA, to sought 
clarity on how, despite the company having being 
under investigation by a state institution, the DCS 
did a contract with them again...” 
 
So what I am trying to say is, we know from this minute, 
but in October the issues of corruption by BOSASA had risen 
and had been voiced in the Portfolio Committee. 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So when you met these people from 
BOSASA, had you already seen this report? 
MR SMITH:   Again, Chair I am not sure when we met them 
but chances are that we met them before we saw this report.  
This is the activity of the Portfolio Committee.  My 
recollection is that most stakeholders wanted to meet or to 
introduce themselves to the chairs as soon as possible after. 
 
And I think we... well, I was elected as a chairperson 
roundabout July.  So if these minutes are in October, it would 
probably be after the initial attempt to meet with me. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now I am referring you to this minute 
because the evidence of Mr Agrizzi is that BOSASA was 
having a problem regarding allegations of corruption.  So the 
suggestion was that an issue... they had to talk to you so 
that the noise can come down.  And here it is clear that there 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 41 of 231 
 
was an issue about the corruption of BOSASA.  Do you see 
that? 
MR SMITH:   I do see that, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So when you make ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry.  Just ask? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So when you met them, did you know 
that these are the people who are accused of corruption? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, I did not meet them.  Let me clarify that 
point.  Mr Frolick brought me to the room where they were 
sitting and because I was very uncomfortable with meeting 
10 
them, I thought it was an ambush to use my own words.   
 
I had no exchange with them.  So, no I did not meet with 
them in terms of whatever.  I think that at the end of the day, 
they just dropped a brochure with me.  And that meeting 
lasted one minute, it was a long time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because they did not make any 
appointment? 
MR 
SMITH: 
 
 
Yes, 
Chair 
they 
have 
not 
made 
any 
appointment.  And even if they had made an appointment, at 
the time, I would have refused it because I was not up to 
20 
speed with the workings and I had refused all other 
stakeholders until I got to grips with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   So had they made an appointment, they would 
not have the opportunity to see me. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 42 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Because in principle, I was not aware... I was 
not up to speed with the workings of the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And in the documents, we have with the 
Commission, starting... going further to page 251. 
MR SMITH:   251? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   251, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Notshe.  Are these minutes 
standalone documents or are they annexures to some 
10 
affidavits? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, no, no.  They are standalone 
documents, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they will have to be admitted as 
exhibits in their own right if they are standalone. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Understand, Chair.  They are standing 
alone.  And Chair, you...  Chair, can I... can we then... well, 
let me deal with them and them and of the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then I will ask for the admission and 
20 
then I will ask for an appropriate number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If it suits you.  If I can just deal with 
them now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 43 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, what I will do is, I do not want 
to waste time on these minutes but starting from... remember 
the first page I referred you was page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what of course Mr Smith can do 
because I see it would appear, he signed them, is to confirm 
that 
they 
are 
minutes 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
of 
Correctional 
Services 
relating 
to 
the 
meeting 
of 
that 
committee of the 14t h of October 2009, if he is able to 
confirm that.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   On page 250... 
10 
MR SMITH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It seems as if this is the confirmation 
of the minutes of the meeting of the 14 October, is that 
correct? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is your signature above your 
name. 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I think that is the appropriate 
time, Mr Notshe, to tell me what I must admit it as or if you 
20 
are not ready then you can remember later on. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I will remember late on, I just need to 
discuss it with the records people but I will make a note of 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 44 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair because my impression is that 
this can be admitted as T31 but that I just want to confirm 
it, let me confirm with… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I do what, Chair, you suggested 
with the other hearing that I sit with these records people, 
we give the numbers to these and then one morning, before 
any hearing, I then come before you and then put on 
record what numbers were placed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought that that was not an ideal 
10 
arrangement but we were forced into it.  If we can, I was 
hoping that by the time at least at some stage we can – 
you can say what exhibit it should be.  There is no reason 
why you would need to talk to the record people because – 
or, I think, as long as you know, which one is the first 
exhibit and which one is the next and we can deal – we can 
give them whatever exhibit numbers as long as the exhibit 
numbers 
will 
not 
cause 
confusion 
in 
terms 
of 
two 
documents sharing an exhibit number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe during the lunch break you 
can apply your mind. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, no I will.  I will, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, then let us continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then just …[intervenes] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 45 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   These minutes then you will hopefully 
after lunch you can have them admitted. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith and then turn to page 251. 
MR SMITH:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And this is a meeting – this is the 
minutes of the meeting of the Portfolio Committee, again 
Correctional Services, and it is dated – the minutes are 
dated 17 November 2009. 
10 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you were the Chairperson of that 
committee meeting. 
MR SMITH:   I was, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now this meeting again on page – if 
you look at page 151. 
MR SMITH:   151? 
CHAIRPERSON:   251 or 151? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I am so sorry, sorry, 254, I beg your 
pardon. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   254. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   254, I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is a different meeting from the 
meeting of the minutes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is a different meeting. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 46 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is a different meeting from the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we have a date of the meeting in the 
document somewhere? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is at 251, Chair, at the top is the 
meeting of the 17 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   251 or 254? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, 251 is where the minutes begin. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Oh, this is 17 November? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other one was October. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So you said now we must 
go to …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Actually, Chair, you will see, sorry, you 
will see that just the previous page at 250.  250, I think at 
the beginning of the meeting which starts at 251, it 
confirmed the minutes of the previous meeting.  If you look 
at 250, 250 is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   250… 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Where Mr Smith signs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that says 17 November but that is 
not the date of the actual meeting, the date was [inaudible 
– speaking simultaneously] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is the date of the confirmation. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 47 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 14 October. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  All I am referring you, Chair, is 
that the minutes …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the date when he signed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   When he confirmed the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he signed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   When he confirmed it as the minutes, 
the meetings always say they confirm the minutes of 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the next meeting, yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Of the previous meeting at the next 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine, but …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The next meeting was on the 17 t h of 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   251 does reflect 17 November. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  You said we must go to 254, is 
that right? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   254, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is it correct, Mr Smith, if you look at 
254 item 3.3.  Again, the issue of the investigation of 
BOSASA by SIU is raised. 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 48 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if you look at 258, page 258, in 
February 2003, you then confirmed the minutes, these 
minutes as the correct minutes of that meeting. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So we know now that in 2009 already 
the issue of the corruption in BOSASA had been raised and 
it had been raised in the Portfolio Committee and we know 
now that these people were brought to you, a delegation 
from BOSASA, when there was this cloud hanging over 
BOSASA. 
10 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:    Can you just tell the Chair do you 
know whether Mr Frolick would have been privy, would 
have known these minutes and the discussion of Portfolio 
Committee regarding the allegations against BOSASA? 
MR SMITH:   No, I am not sure that Mr Frolick could have 
known about it, Chair, because there was no obligation of 
Portfolio Committees to submit their minutes to anybody 
else, it was our minutes.  So it is possible that Mr Frolick  
never had sight. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And there is also in 259, page 
259. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before 259, I am sorry, Mr Notshe and 
Mr Vincent Smith, I see that at 254, 3.3 where it says: 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 49 of 231 
 
“Similarities 
between 
2004 
and 
2008 
nutrition 
contracts Mr Selfe…” 
It says: 
“Mr Selfe thanked the SIU for its work and agreed 
that the presentation was one of the most shocking 
he has had since becoming a member.  The 
revelations 
came 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a 
long 
saga 
spanning at least five years and he was pleased 
that there was some progress.  He said that 
everyone knew who the companies at the centre of 
10 
the investigation were and that therefore there was 
“no point in speaking”. 
I just thought that might be important to say what is the 
picture that the committee got out of the presentation of 
the SIU at least in regard to one member of the committee.  
I seem that the picture that was presented by the SIU to 
the committee was one that was shocking to him. 
MR SMITH:   Indeed it was, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Just to put it into context. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   The beginning of the investigation happened 
probably around about 2004/2005 before the current term 
of the Portfolio Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 50 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Mr Selfe had been a member of the previous 
Portfolio Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   So he had institutional memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   Thus he says it is the most shocking one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   But regardless he had institutional memory, 
even the report itself when it came to us was a very 
worrisome report, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And all of us in the Portfolio Committee 
unambiguously agreed with that position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now to move on, Mr Smith, to page 
259 and here is the minutes of the meeting of the same 
Portfolio Committee on the 13 October 2010 and if one 
looks at the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what page did you say we 
must go to? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   259, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look at page 259, you look at the 
members of the committee, it seems as if …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, this is now, just to identify 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 51 of 231 
 
the document, this is now a meeting of the Portfolio 
Committee o Correctional Services on the 13 October 
2010, is that right? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And, Chair and Mr Smith, it seems as 
if you were still the Chairperson of that committee. 
MR SMITH:   Indeed, I was a Chairperson, Chair.  My 
Chairpersonship ran from 2009 to 2014, it is a five year 
term. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And again – but let us just look 
at page 270.  There is - the minutes are not signed but you 
have had a look at the minutes, do you confirm is there 
anything which you will say this would not be minutes of 
the meeting? 
MR SMITH:   I am not sure why they were not signed, 
Chair, but having looked at them and giving them a cursory 
glance it was in fact a true reflection of the minutes.  The 
committee secretary at the time was very efficient, so I 
have no reason to believe that it would have been a 
20 
misrepresentation. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And also again in this – in 2010, the 
issue of BOSASA is raised and on page 261 there is Mr 
Selfe who refers to Royal Sechaba Holdings claim but then: 
“At 
the 
discussion 
Ms 
Ngwenya 
thought 
it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 52 of 231 
 
necessary….” 
I am reading the minutes. 
“Ms Ngwenya thought it necessary for BOSASA the 
company in favour of whom Royal Sechaba had 
allegedly been disqualified to also appear before 
the BOSASA.” 
So the committee - and then, over the page: 
“BOSASA has over the past years received billions 
from its contracts with DCS.  The committee 
approved the DCS budget each year yet knew 
10 
nothing of this company which is such a major 
recipient of that allocation.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Notshe, I missed – did not 
hear what page you are reading at. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I am on page 262, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   262? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Am I right? 
20 
MR SMITH:   Yes, no, I was looking at the red one, it is 
right, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So this issue of BOSASA is raised 
again.  And this is – what is important for me is the fact 
that Ms Ngwenya, she says look, we have need, we do not 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 53 of 231 
 
know about this company yet billions of rands have been 
awarded to this company and on a budget that we have 
approved.  Do you see that? 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if we go over the page – I have 
taken you to where it is not signed but you confirmed – you 
do confirm the minutes. 
MR SMITH:   I did. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But let us go to page 271.  Now these 
are the minutes of the Portfolio Committee of 18 October 
10 
2011 and you were still the Chair at that time. 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then again if we look at the 
minutes, the issue of BOSASA is again raised in the 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At what page are you? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   On page 272 and at paragraph 3.2: 
“DCS reported 
that the nutrition contract with 
BOSASA company which will expire – will expire at 
the end of 2012.  DCS should provide the committee 
20 
with measures in place to ensure that food services 
to inmates to the affected centres will not be 
compromised from March 2012.” 
Now this was in October, Mr Smith, and by now you must 
have known about BOSASA, you have been – there had 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 54 of 231 
 
been reports at the Portfolio Committee, is it correct? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And yet we know that you met them at 
Sandton Hotel during that year. 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now when you met them at Sandton 
Hotel, there were already these negative reports about 
them.  What were you meeting them – why did you meet 
them at the hotel? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, as I indicated, that ordinarily 
10 
when a new Chairperson is elected, stakeholders want to 
introduce themselves and that was the essence of the first 
meeting that was reported in 2009.   
So in 2011 Mr Gavin Watson called me to do exactly 
what they wanted to do in 2009 and at that point I was 
more than comfortable to have a discussion because I 
understood what was happening in the department.   
Let me hasten to say that it was not only BOSASA 
that I had met, most of the stakeholders.  At that time, I 
had then agreed to meet with them and I list them in my 
20 
affidavit somewhere else.   
So it was really for me an opportune time to 
understand what is it that stakeholders are doing and what 
is it that they can offer and my stock reply, Chair, was once 
they have briefed me, we advise them to either reduce it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 55 of 231 
 
into writing or to come to what we used to call a 
stakeholder meeting, formal stakeholder meeting where 
they were then presented to the Portfolio Committee. 
So 
it 
was 
really 
an 
introductory, 
preparatory 
meeting that I was invited. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, I do not expect you perhaps 
to have this, but we have a record where you reported now 
to your Portfolio Committee that I met the much maligned 
BOSASA, met them at an hotel in Sandton and this is what 
I discussed with them.  Did you report that? 
10 
MR SMITH:   No, I do not recall the detail, Chair, I have 
not seen it, but what would have normally happened is 
that, as I indicated earlier on, any stakeholder that I met I 
would either ask them to reduce it into writing or ask them 
to formerly come to a stakeholder meeting so it was not my 
decision, it would be a committee decision.   
So, yes, I would not find it strange that after the 
meeting I would have gone back to report to the Portfolio 
Committee because ultimately, that is where decisions are 
taken.  No decisions are taken in one-to-one meetings with 
20 
the Chairperson.  So if indeed I went to report back to the 
Portfolio Committee it would par for the course. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But were you not uncomfortable to 
meet in an hotel a company that had been reported to be 
involved in corruption?   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 56 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, when I was phoned by Mr 
Watson a day or two before the meeting, at that point I did 
indicate to Mr Watson that I was uncomfortable meeting 
him on my own because, by the way, it was not a Portfolio 
Committee meeting and Mr Watson was aware that I would 
come to Johannesburg weekends when I was in Cape 
Town. 
 
So it was a simple request, can we meet when you 
are back in Johannesburg?  I indicated to him that I would 
be uncomfortable going on my own and I would be better if 
10 
I went with somebody else from the Portfolio Committee so 
that when we report back it is not an individual view.   
So I do not think that because – and by the way, 
Chair, if you look at the minutes, much prior to this 
meeting, I and the department – I and the Portfolio 
Committee had agreed that the SIU investigation must 
continue 
and 
once 
the 
SIU 
investigation 
has 
been 
concluded then it must come back to us and report to us in 
terms of what they were doing.  So it was an ongoing 
investigation and I did not find anything untoward meeting 
20 
with a stakeholder as long as I was not on my own, as long 
as there were no decisions taken at that meeting and as 
long as I went to report back to the portfolio committee.  
That we met at a hotel, Chairperson, we could have met at 
a restaurant, we could have met anywhere else, I think it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 57 of 231 
 
was 
the 
most 
convenient 
place 
and 
I 
was 
not 
uncomfortable with that, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I understand – you will excuse 
me, 
I 
have 
never 
been 
a 
member 
of 
parliament, 
I 
understand the Portfolio Committee has offices in Cape 
Town, am I right? 
MR SMITH:   No, the Portfolio Committee does not have 
offices, individual members of parliament have offices in 
Cape Town. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You have a chamber where you meet? 
10 
MR SMITH:   Yes, there is chambers in parliament, what we 
call committee rooms that is shared by all committees.  
There are those in parliament, yes, sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Why did you not ask Mr Gavin Watson 
to meet you in Cape Town in your office? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, I did allude to it earlier on that 
my relationship with Gavin Watson precedes me being a 
member of parliament and on occasion, when I was in 
Johannesburg, we would meet and discuss politics of the 
day, discuss my constituency responsibilities.   
20 
And, by the way, it is me and they were a 
delegation of three or four.  Logistically I was coming to 
Johannesburg, they are based in Johannesburg and he 
asked that a day or two before and I agreed to that, when I 
am in Johannesburg, let us make time to meet and I could 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 58 of 231 
 
well have called them to Cape Town but that would have 
had to happen during the week, I was – I live in 
Johannesburg, I come to Johannesburg weekends and I 
agreed with Mr Watson who I had been meeting anyway on 
other matters that okay, we find time and we meet. 
So we could have met in Cape Town but it made 
perfect sense to meet in Johannesburg over the weekend 
when I was in Jo’burg. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, at that time, 2011, you knew 
Mr Watson, you knew that he was the “owner” of BOSASA 
10 
and you knew that there were allegations of corruption 
against BOSASA.  Did you ever discuss that issue with Mr 
Watson to say comrades, there are these allegations 
against your company?  Did you do that?  
MR SMITH:   I never discussed those with Mr Watson in 
the meetings that I met with Mr Watson but I have no 
doubt, Chairperson, that they were would have known that 
there 
these 
discussions 
because 
Portfolio 
Committee 
meetings are public.  They were widely reported in the 
media at the time anyway, but did I discuss them with Mr 
20 
Watson?  I did not discuss them with Mr Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Are you able to tell the Commission 
why you did not discuss them with him?  You said you have 
known him since 1990 as a comrade and a person who was 
assisting with a number of things.  Here there are reports 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 59 of 231 
 
that his company is corrupt, why did you not discuss this 
with him? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, we – and I am not sure which 
minutes they are but we alluded to them where I made an 
undertaking to the Portfolio Committee as Chair that there 
is nothing that we must do as member of parliament, I think 
it was with the IC – with the… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   SIU. 
MR SMITH:   SIU, that there is nothing that we must do as 
members that would sabotage the work of the investigation.  
10 
So for me to go outside of that and to meet with – would be 
to go against a decision that I took in a meeting and that is 
why I was very clear to separate politics from my work as 
an MP at the time, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you know, Mr Smith, that influence 
and perception is almost everything.  Now if anyone were 
to say well, I met a member of parliament, a Chairperson of 
the Portfolio Committee at an hotel, that person would be 
seeming to go around with a big cloud to say I have the 
member of parliament in my pocket, I met him in an hotel.  
20 
Did you not think about that? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, I am indicating or I indicated earlier on 
that I have and did meet Mr Watson from 1990 or the early 
‘90’s onwards on matters that related to my constituency 
and normal ANC work.  I also did indicate that I met many 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 60 of 231 
 
stakeholders in various locations, Chairperson. 
 
And the third point that I would like to make, 
Chairperson, is that whether Mr Watson had me in his 
pocket or not, as a perception, the separation of powers 
just did not allow a member of parliament to get involved in 
the day-to-day working of any department.  So I could not 
have influenced the department just by virtue of the 
separation of powers, even if I wanted to. 
 
So, yes, there could have been a perception 
created and I must accept that there must be but then 
10 
there could be with any other stakeholder that I met and I 
met many stakeholders over the time.  This one might be 
because it was under investigation.   
In retrospect maybe there could have been that 
perception but there was never ever anything untoward, it 
was a normal meeting with stakeholders and thus I said 
that I am not comfortable, seeing them on my own, I would 
rather see with others, that Portfolio Committee, I had no 
fear of any influence unduly put on – or pressure put on 
me, Chair. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, the problem is this.  Now we 
have Mr Agrizzi telling the Commission that they had a 
problem with investigation by SIU and as a result of that 
they were advised to see you and he tells the Commission 
and he confirmed that you met them at a hotel. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 61 of 231 
 
 
Now we know by the time you met at the hotel there 
is an investigation by SIU and this has already been 
reported to parliament and to the portfolio committee 
chaired by you and here now is the Chairperson of the 
Portfolio Committee with some members meeting in an 
hotel with a company that is being investigated.  Does this 
not make Mr Agrizzi’s testimony credible? 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair, it does not and I am glad that we 
are dealing with the minutes.  These minutes span from 
2009 to 2013.  According to Mr Agrizzi’s testimony to you, 
10 
the 2011 meeting was intended to, to use my words, soften 
my attitude. 
 
The facts of the minutes negates that argument, 
Chair, I was anti-outsourcing, I was never anti-BOSASA, I 
was anti-outsourcing in 2009, I remained anti-outsourcing 
up to 2013 and BOSASA was one of those that were 
outsourced.   
 
So this narrative that the 2011 meeting had the sole 
purpose of softening me up is not borne out by the minutes 
that we have.  Every minute that is here indicates not only 
20 
mine but the committee’s strongest dissatisfaction with 
outsourcing generally, Chairperson, and BOSASA was one 
of those outsourcing but there was outsourcing even of 
private business, we objected to it.   
There was outsourcing of day-to-day maintenance, 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 62 of 231 
 
there was outsourcing of BOSASA – on nutrition, not 
BOSASA, of nutrition, from 2009 until the time I left, my 
attitude and the attitude of the department did not change.  
So the notion that I was called to a meeting, I was given 
R45 000 to soften my attitude to BOSASA is not borne out 
in the minutes and these minutes span pre and post 2011. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You know, when I looked at your 
affidavit and read that part of the affidavit, I went to the 
minutes and then I found – I read them with bated breath 
that I am going to find a place where you were coming out 
10 
strongly, 
you 
were 
coming 
out 
strongly 
against 
the 
continued award of tenders to BOSASA.  Can you take me 
–perhaps I had missed the part, take to those minutes 
wherein 
you 
come 
out 
strongly 
and 
criticising 
the 
outsourcing and criticising – sorry, are you looking for 
something? 
MR SMITH:   I was looking for something and I anticipated 
that question but… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you want to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you looking for something that help 
20 
you …[intervenes] 
MR SMITH:   I want to answer that question by way of the 
minutes, Chair, and yesterday, when I was preparing… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SMITH:   I actually wrote it down that I want to refer 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 63 of 231 
 
the evidence leader to, to answer exactly this question.  I 
am not sure what happened to my …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just look for it, take time. 
MR SMITH:   It will me a few seconds to find it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think your attorney might have it. 
MR SMITH:   I think he will have it, yes, but I had 
Speaker ’s notes that – or not Speaker ’s notes but I had – 
in anticipation to these kind of questions …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you able to tell your attorney where 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MR SMITH:   I will put it here, Chair, that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What you can do – Chair, if I may, if I 
may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We can proceed with other stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With – ja, and then during the lunch 
break he could have a look. 
MR SMITH:   I am sure it will here now, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You know, instead of Mr Smith looking 
at them, rushing, let us deal with the other stuff. 
MR SMITH:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then …[intervenes] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 64 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   During the lunch break you can have a 
look at your notes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, can you quickly do this for me, 
they are the minutes of the 12 t h of – no, 22 February, they 
appear in A274. 
MR SMITH:   274. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I just want you to confirm the minutes 
so that – and then they are confirmed on the 15 March at 
284.  Look at 274 and then 284. 
10 
MR SMITH:   Yes, sir.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you confirm those are the minutes 
of that and they were adopted? 
MR SMITH:   I do, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then at 285 they are the minutes 
of 6 March and then they are signed – they are unsigned 
on the 24 April   
MR SMITH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You have looked at these, do you 
confirm that these are also the minutes? 
20 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair, I do confirm that these are the 
minutes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay.  What we will do, Mr Smith, we 
will leave the minutes for now and then look at that and 
then we will deal with them after you have found whatever 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 65 of 231 
 
you are looking for.  Is that alright? 
MR SMITH:   We can do that, Chair, we can do that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now the – I have got the minutes and 
then we know what the position is from BOSASA.  Now you 
then – there is an amount of money which you have 
admitted was paid to your company by BOSASA. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And the first amount is in 2015 and it 
is an amount of R267 667.90. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Notshe, I 
10 
think, Mr Smith really wishes to have these documents. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, okay. 
MR SMITH:   If you can give me two seconds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will take two minutes adjournment. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Two minutes, I think, ja, [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am taking two minutes so that he 
comfortable.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Answer these questions, yes. 
MR SMITH:   Please.  Please, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
MR SMITH:   Oh, I beg your pardon, they are here, they 
were on the floor.  They were on the floor. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You know what, it happens to us 
…[intervenes] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 66 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   No, they were on the floor. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He will tell you it happens to us all the 
time. 
MR SMITH:   So you can go back to the minutes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, okay.  It happens to us all the 
time.  You are in court, you know you have made minutes – 
you have got notes… 
CHAIRPERSON:   You found the documents Mr Smith? 
MR SMITH:  Thanks for your indulgence Chair, I found it 
and I would like to respond to that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And Chair fortunately that has got 
nothing to do with me, the losing of documents. 
MR SMITH:   They were on the floor. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We found them on the floor and it had 
nothing to do with me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.   
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chairperson the questions that was 
raised was there would have been an expectation for me to 
come out unequivocally.  I would like to refer you Chair to 
20 
page 276, 2.1.  The Chairpersons comments, 2.1 on page 
276 Chair.  The portfolio committee on the correctional 
services has always made it very clear that it was not in 
favour of the outsourcing of the nutritional services that is 
my comment. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 67 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.      
MR SMITH:   I do not think that that there was any doubt 
what it was meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   Over the page Chairperson on 231, 2.3.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry over the page?  
MR SMITH:   Page 278.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh 278.  
MR SMITH:   Yes and bullet not bullet point but paragraph 
2.3.1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SMITH:   It says members were unconvinced by the 
National Commissioners assurance that the DCS would be 
ready to deliver.  Now that is a decision of the committee, 
the committee that I chaired.  So it was part of my 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
MR SMITH:   I then want to refer you to 2.3.4 Chair I think 
it is on the same page.  The last paragraph on that 2.3.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay there is a 2.8 here.  
20 
MR SMITH:   2.3.4 Chair on page 280. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes.  
MR SMITH:   It reads the committee had on numerous 
occasions voiced its dissatisfaction with DCS outsourcing 
of services that it should be doing on its own.  Again, their 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 68 of 231 
 
Chair and I can take you – and those are the minutes in 
2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   Post the 2011 meeting that Agrizzi talks 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   And if you so wish I could take you to similar 
things in 2013 if the Chair wants that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us do that, ja.  
MR SMITH:   Okay.  Let us go then – there are minutes 
10 
dated the 6 t h of March I will just find the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are at page 285.   
MR SMITH:   Yes it is the next yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SMITH:   And then if we go to 371 Chair which would 
be, I beg your pardon 317. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now the paragraph now. 
MR SMITH:   That is on page 293. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   On bullet point 3.1.7. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   These are recordings of a meeting that took 
place in March 2013.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   Two years after the so-called meeting.  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 69 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   It reads the Chairperson felt strongly that 
should the debate around the constitution of core functions 
be resolved – in other words Chairperson we were arguing 
that we must debate whether the core functions because 
we felt strongly that it should not be outsourced and those 
are my comments.  And in his closing remarks - we raised 
it in 3.1.8 Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   We talk to that same matter again and this is 
10 
in 2013 after I was supposedly soften up.  So to answer 
your question Chair I have no doubt that my stance and the 
stance of the committee throughout my tenor was not anti-
BOSASA but it was anti-outsourcing and BOSASA had a 
major role to play in that.   
          So it was not an attack on a company but it was an 
attack on the management style for want of a better word.  
So there were no wholly cows, BOSASA was not a wholly 
cow and I do not understand Chair that if I was getting R45 
000,00 to do a job in other words to be soft on them.   
20 
          Three years later I am still as harsh as I am and 
they continue to give me that money it does not make 
sense to me.  So I want to debunk that notion that this was 
what was discussed in the meeting of 2011.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Smith now when I took you to 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 70 of 231 
 
the minutes of 2009 with the report about BOSASA, 2011 
report about BOSASA, right.  Now you met BOSASA people 
in 2011 and the allegation is to soften you.  Now are you 
able to do what you have done now take the Commission 
where you come strongly and say there is a corrupt 
company and DCS keeps on awarding tenders to this 
company.  Are you able to do that?  
MR SMITH:   No Chair I am not able to do that in the 
minutes because I do not think when we dealt with 
minutes, we dealt with individuals per say in terms of 
10 
stakeholders we would deal with the principle.  I did 
indicate earlier on that the Auditor General was the final 
abattoir for want of a better word in terms of whether there 
was irregular expenditure or not.  Secondly the SIU had 
embarked on an investigation which we encouraged and we 
asked them to do which was specifically on BOSASA.   
          But if the Commission is asking me to show a line 
here where I said this company is – it is not there, it is not 
their Chair.  But throughout the minutes it is very clear that 
we supported the action that has been taken on that matter 
20 
specifically with the SIU.  So no there is no line item where 
I said so.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Smith look in your favour and in 
fairness to you let us look at page 278  
MR SMITH:   Page? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 71 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   278.  
MR SMITH:   278, I am there Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, these are the minutes of the 
meeting between the 2 n d of February 2012 and now in the 
middle on paragraph 2.3.1 the second paragraph of that 
paragraph it says long standing members of the committee 
express surprise that the same reasons are advanced for 
2008 extension of the BOSASA contract were provided as 
reasons for the 2012 extension.  In the absence of a 
credible reason for the extension the committee was left 
10 
with no alternative but to believe that the contract was 
extended because somebody in DCS’s ranks had a vested 
interest in it being extended.  It claim that the accounting 
officer only became aware of the true state of affairs in 
2011 was met with incredulity resulting in some members 
calling for an enquiry into the most recent extension.  So 
there in 2012 an issue is raised by the members of the 
committee unhappy about the extension of BOSASA.  Do 
you see that?      
MR SMITH:   I do see that Chair and…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think the point that Mr Notshe is 
making to you is that he wants to be fair to you he says 
here is a part where even if there is no special mention to 
you but it is reflected that the members of the committee 
that this was their attitude when you were part of that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 72 of 231 
 
committee.  And that is the point that he wants to make in 
fairness to you.    
MR SMITH:   Thank you very much Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But then let us take the minutes of the 
6 t h of March 2013 on page 285.  
MR SMITH:   285, yes sir I am there.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if we turn to page 291 at 
paragraph 2.1 there is again a discussion about BOSASA 
where it says while the report – I am reading the 3.1.1, 
while the report makes a mention of contracts awarded to 
10 
BOSASA company it made no mention of the large 
contracts awarded to the company’s Sondolo and Phezulu.  
Let me just stop there did you know at this time that 
Sondolo and Phezulu were also related to the BOSASA 
company?   
MR SMITH:   I did Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Alright let us proceed.  The contracts 
awarded 
to 
the 
three 
companies 
far 
exceeded 
the 
R15million mentioned in relation to BOSASA and clarity 
was – can you see that? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As I am referring you to this for two 
purposes 1, I do not read the Chairpersons unhappiness 
about BOSASA because you can see there is a company 
which has been here 2009 and 2013.  I do not read the 
Chairperson express unhappiness about this, do you notice 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 73 of 231 
 
that?   
MR SMITH:   Chair I thought I had answered that question 
maybe I should try again.  I am a member of the portfolio 
committee.  I referred the Commission to at least five 
areas where as a collective we were totally unhappy and 
also supported the SIU.  Now if the Commission is asking 
is there a line that says Vincent Smith did it, you are not 
going to find that Chair.  But I am convinced that if it is a 
committee decision that I was part of the adopting I would 
imagine that I am party to that decision.  So I am not sure 
10 
how further to add it but I did express my dissatisfaction 
not with BOSASA but with the outsourcing processes of 
which BOSASA was part of it Chairperson.  So in 
retrospect maybe I should have put that item in my name 
but I do not think it was necessary Chair.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I do understand.  Now I have taken 
you to a number of minutes of meetings where BOSASA is 
mentioned.  Now in 2015 it is not in the minutes, in 2015 
you then go and borrow money according to you.  You go 
and borrow money from the same company that had been 
20 
part of a discussion in the portfolio committee, a company 
that you knew have been referred to SIU for corruption.  
Why did you do that? 
MR SMITH:   Chair I am not sure that I heard the question 
correctly but if I did…[intervene] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 74 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No let me repeat it before you answer 
or the simple question is why would you go and borrow 
money from a company that had been – that is clearly, not 
clearly that has been reported to have been involved in 
corruption and even referred to a law enforcement agency.   
MR SMITH:   Thanks Chair I thought that is what I heard.  
Just to clarify Chair I did not borrow any money from any 
company.  The loan agreement was between me and 
Angelo Agrizzi and there are, there is correspondence to 
that effect by way of an SMS.  My loan agreement was with 
10 
Angelo Agrizzi and the reason why I have this agreement 
with Angelo Agrizzi in 2015.  A few months I do not know 
the timeframe prior to that Angelo had come to me too ask 
for instance to help him with an unemployed son.  I do this 
all the time in my constituency and he came to me and I 
indeed was able to do that.   
          I in turn also went to him when my own son 
developed behavioural problems and he referred me to a 
service provider who could help him with that.  So the point 
I am raising Chair is that there was some sort of a cordial 
20 
agreement with me and Angelo and my loan - and it is born 
out in the correspondence was with Angelo.   
          The final point that I want to make on that one Chair 
is that nowhere in the records of the deposit for a want of 
a better word is there any reference to BOSASA it was not 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 75 of 231 
 
BOSASA.  I had gone to Angelo Agrizzi on the basis of the 
relationship that we have created and made a personal 
loan with Angelo Agrizzi.   
          The money was put into my account, I paid for the 
school fees, it was never ever a BOSASA agreement it was 
an Angelo Agrizzi agreement so I just wanted to correct 
that and that I never made a loan with a company it was 
with an individual.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith you must have thought about 
this answer and this is your answer, you must have thought 
10 
about it clearly and you are serious about it.   
MR SMITH:   I am serious about it.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you knew Agrizzi…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Notshe maybe just before 
we proceed what were the terms of this loan between you 
and Mr Agrizzi? 
MR SMITH:   Chair it was a very simple loan Chair.  I 
through the companies that I presented to Mr Agrizzi Euro 
Blitz hold shares in, a minority share not a BEE shares as 
Mr Agrizzi says it is a black owned company, I own shares 
20 
and those shares were to mature in 2023.  So it was a 
matter of cash flow.   
         I went to Mr Agrizzi and I said I need to pay school 
fees, I want to pay it in one lump sum so that there is no 
variation with the whatever please advance me the money 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 76 of 231 
 
and when my shares mature for want of a better word I 
would repay it.  To the extent that I presented the – what 
do you call it the shareholder agreement between me and 
the company as comfort that this is really what is 
happening and also it is in my annexures also a projection 
of what my cut of the shareholding was.   
          So it was a very simple – I need to pay school fees 
immediately please give me X amount I will give you that 
back to you and it was with Mr Agrizzi.  The last point that 
I want to make on that one Chair is that the fact that I gave 
10 
Mr Agrizzi my company bank account was because for me it 
was a legitimate agreement.  In fact, my audited financial 
statements will show that those transactions are raised as 
a loan in the company, in the audited financial statements.  
If it was for any other reason Chair, chances are I would 
have gone to Mr Agrizzi or to anybody and say look you 
guys give me a R100 000,00 according to you per month let 
me use that R100 000,00 and do it.   
         I knew that there was an EFG I gave them my 
company account, I have that company account audited 
20 
and the audited financial statements indicate it is a loan. I 
have shares that I own which were going to mature, it was 
a legitimate loan Chairperson that I was intending or I am 
intending to repay and that is why it was not undercover or 
camouflaged or anything else.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 77 of 231 
 
          It is there and it has been audited and reported.  So 
the terms to answer your question I am sorry Chair.  The 
terms were I have a cash flow problem or it is prudent for 
me to pay overseas in one lump sum and Mr Agrizzi we 
have this relationship is it possible for you to afford it to 
me, he did and I was going to pay him back.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the amount that you asked 
for?        
MR SMITH:   I did not ask for an amount Chair I had 
received from the university the fee structure. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR SMITH:   And I gave that to him and said this is what – 
in fact I had paid the initial deposit which was about I think 
2 000 pounds for the registration having paid that myself.  
The account came from the university that says these are 
the fees and your child has been accepted so go on and 
pay the fees.  So I gave that whole document to him as 
proof that it was for a legitimate purpose.   
          So I gave him the account statement that I had 
received from the university and in year one because of 
20 
the rand valuation, in year one I think it was R200 000 and 
in year two it was three hundred and odd thousand but the 
figures are there Chair and in both instances I gave him 
proof of what it was intended to be and I raised it 
accordingly in my books.       
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 78 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the amount that he ultimately gave 
you was it in accordance with the amount that you were 
going to have to pay to the university in terms of the 
documents that you gave him?  
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   In his reply affidavits that I received 
yesterday I think there is even a handwritten note where I 
think translates and I am not saying, I am saying he but I 
do not know who did it but there is a translation from 
10 
pounds to rands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   Because it was specifically for that amount 
not any other frills. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   Everything else in terms of day to day living 
and whatever I paid for my own purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was happy to give the loan there 
was no difficulty when you were discussing – when you 
introduced the subject?  
20 
MR SMITH:   Chair there was no difficulty I say and 
somewhere there is an SMS ag not an SMS an email where 
I say to him chief this is what we had discussed here are 
the proof of it and there was no now I do not know what 
you are talking about or I do not have it.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 79 of 231 
 
          I said that and the money was put into the account 
that I had given him.  So my interpretation of that was that 
there was no difficulty.  I am not sure where he got the 
money from or who gave it to him but as far as I am 
concerned, I had made that agreement with Mr Agrizzi and 
there is an email correspondence to that effect Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let us start with this when you asked 
for the money you send him an email.  Is that right? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, correct.  
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now the email appears on page 470.  
Is that correct? 
MR SMITH:   470? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   I am there Chairperson.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And the email is dated the 11 t h of May 
it is from you, Vincent Smith …[intervene] 
MR SMITH:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And it is to Mr Agrizzi.  
MR SMITH:   That is correct Chair.  
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The subject matter is daughter ’s study 
2015, university of - how do you pronounce that name? 
MR SMITH:   Aberystwyth.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Aberystwyth sorry...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it cannot be an easy word because 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 80 of 231 
 
there is no vowel, is it a vowel A.B.C.D there is no vowel.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   There is only two.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja only two.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Chair I am a boy from a rural 
village in the Eastern Cape, so it is…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Aberystwyth.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Aberystwyth.  Now if it says – what I 
am interested is in Mr Smith the last part…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe read the whole thing.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let me read the whole thing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ja or he can read it.  
MR SMITH:   I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja do so Mr Smith.  
MR SMITH:   Chair it is an email from me it is dated the 
11 t h of May 2015 and it is to Angelo Agrizzi subject matter 
daughter study 2015.  Hi chief this email refers to our 
discussion earlier this year.  My daughter has been 
accepted to study at Aberystwyth University in Wales.   
          She commences in September 2015 and I am in the 
process of finalising her trip.  She leaves towards the end 
20 
of June to finalise varsity accommodation and other related 
matters.  I am in the process of sorting out funding 
requirements for her and hereby request any assistance in 
this regard.  Funds can be deposited directly to the 
institution if that is more acceptable and I have thus 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 81 of 231 
 
attached relevant documentation correspondence and it is 
from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.    
MR SMITH:   And it was addressed to Mr Agrizzi and 
nobody else.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now do you agree with me that there 
is no in this email, there is no reference to application or a 
request for a loan, it is asking for funds.  Am I right? 
MR SMITH:   Yes Chair you are right Chair that in this one 
10 
there is not but the very first line says this email refers to 
our discussion earlier this year.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   And that discussion was exactly that but this 
email does not have that line in it.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if I understand you said to the 
Chairperson earlier that once your child had been admitted 
to the university then they told you your child has been 
admitted this is X amount owing and then you went to Mr 
Agrizzi and you asked for a loan.  Am I right?   
20 
MR SMITH:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you had an exact amount that you 
asked for, am I right? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But if you read the last line of this 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 82 of 231 
 
email it said I am in the process of sorting out the funding 
requirements for her and hereby request any assistance in 
this regard.  It did not say I am requiring the amount we 
had agreed upon, so it is as if you are now begging for 
money.  Am I right?    
MR SMITH:   Chairperson if you go further it says thus I 
am attaching the relevant documentation.  Now I do not 
know if my English is not up to speed Chair but if you read 
the whole sentence and not part of it.  I say I am asking for 
any amount but here is the school fees, the official 
10 
statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you may be speaking at cross 
purposes at this stage.  I thought Mr, Mr…[intervene] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Notshe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Notshe’s question was this, if you had 
discussed with Mr Agrizzi a loan why is it that in this email 
you make no reference to a loan but instead you say you 
hereby request any assistance in this regard and I think he 
added you make as if you are begging now.        
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is what he was saying, so 
that is his question.   
MR SMITH:   No that was not the only, I take the point 
Chair that that is certainly not what was intended in this 
email maybe that is how it is interpreted but I make 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 83 of 231 
 
reference to an earlier discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR SMITH:   I make reference to this is the official 
obligation that I have to the university and that was my 
understanding of what I was asking for Chairperson.  I do 
take your point that that line that says any funding might 
be out of place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For any assistance.    
MR SMITH:   For any assistance I beg your pardon might 
be out of place but that was the intention and that was the 
10 
essence of our discussions Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Smith are there any 
documents you can present to this Commission showing 
where the agreement was concluded the interest on the 
loan or are there no such documents? 
MR SMITH:   No Chair there were no such documents and 
if the Commission is asking was there a written loan 
agreement there was no such documents.  I am not a 
lawyer but I do not - my understanding is that this 
20 
particular transaction did not need a written agreement 
because there was no such agreement.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Smith let me go back to my 
initial question by this time by the 11 t h of May 2015 you 
knew Mr Agrizzi was working for BOSASSA.  Am I right? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 84 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Yes, that is correct Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did you know his position financially 
how much money he had personally? 
MR SMITH:   No Chair I did not know how much money he 
had in the bank personally Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you had just dealt with him on the 
basis that he is employed by BOSASA.  
MR SMITH:   Chair I had earlier alluded to the need for 
funding.  I would have assumed that if it was not possible 
at that point somebody would have said to me look it is not 
10 
possible Chairperson.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, I am sorry Mr Notshe maybe let 
us go past this question.  As I understand the position the 
loan if this was a loan that you asked Mr Agrizzi to give 
you totalled about six hundred and something thousand, 
R700 000.  
MR SMITH:  Six hundred and something thousand yes, 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Six hundred and something thousand 
20 
which was paid over two years in succession, is that right?  
MR SMITH:   Correct Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is quite a lot of money to ask from 
an individual.  Is it not?  
MR SMITH:   Correct Chairperson.  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 85 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Notshe.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you said despite that there was no 
written loan agreement and no terms discussed about 
interest? 
MR SMITH:   No there was no written agreement Chair.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And…[intervene] 
MR SMITH:   Sorry…[intervene] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No continue sir.  
MR SMITH:   There was no written agreement Chair as I 
indicated earlier on I think it was a matter of trust and if 
10 
indeed there was going to be a requirement for a written 
agreement I do not think it would have been a problem it 
would have been a one liner because in my own financial 
statements 
that 
are 
audited 
it 
is 
raised 
as 
a 
loan 
Chairperson.  So there is – in my mind there was nothing 
untoward about it, it was there, it is still there now it is 
public knowledge and I do not recall either myself or Mr 
Agrizzi insisting on it being reduced into writing Chair.     
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you knew this company, he works 
for a company that had been alleged to be involved in 
20 
corruption.  It did not ring to you that it is inappropriate for 
me as a member of a portfolio committee on correctional 
services to borrow money from a company that has been 
awarded tenders continuously by the same department and 
here am asking money from this company.  Did you not see 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 86 of 231 
 
that as inappropriate?   
MR SMITH:   Chairperson in 2015 I was no longer the 
Chair of correctional services.  I had seized being the 
Chair in April 2014.  So it is not correct that I was the 
Chair of correctional - it was post my tenor year or so later 
from being the Chair of correctional services.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you still a member of the 
committee or no longer a member either?   
MR SMITH:   Chair in parliament we have what we call 
alternate members and full members, I at that point been 
10 
appointed to at least two other portfolio committees.  So I 
spent all my time in the other portfolio committees.  I 
hardly ever attended the portfolio committee proceedings 
of correctional services because I was Chair of at least two 
other committees Chair and I was no longer a – or the 
Chair of the committee at the time is my senior politically 
and I would never be able to undermine him in terms of 
influencing whatever happened.  I was not the Chair of that 
committee at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And going back to that discussion 
20 
between you and Mr Agrizzi about the loan.  Did Mr Agrizzi 
raise any concerns about this transaction that you were 
asking the two of you to enter into.  Did he raise any 
concerns?   
MR SMITH:   No he did not…[intervene] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 87 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not.  
MR SMITH:   Because it happened in 2015 and it happened 
again in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I am going back to the first.   
MR SMITH:   So to me – no in the first he did not sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   Sorry I beg your pardon he did not 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so in the first discussion where you 
approached him and asked for a loan, he did not raise any 
10 
concerns? 
MR SMITH:   He did not raise any concerns Chairperson, 
no.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now at that time already was the 
position that – was the understanding that in 2015 he 
would pay part of the six hundred and something amount 
and then in 2016 he would then pay another part because 
in accordance with the requirements of the university?  
MR SMITH:   No Chair it does not work like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
20 
MR SMITH:   The university gives you fees for that 
particular year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SMITH:   She was first year so the bill only was R200 
000,00. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 88 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   In 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR SMITH:   So that was settled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR SMITH:   In 2016 there was no obligation on the 2015 
anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR SMITH:   There was a new fee structure with a new 
amount Chair so it is not a continuation of R600 000,00.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.  But when you spoke to him for 
the first time, I am asking for a loan did you speak to him 
in 2015 only in regard to 2015 and then in 2016 you spoke 
to him in regard to 2016 or did you cover both years in 
your first discussion?  
MR SMITH:   No Chair I did not cover both years and it is 
simply because there was no guarantee that my daughter 
would continue at that university or she would be alive or 
whatever the case may be.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
20 
MR SMITH:   So at the time when the obligation became 
payable then I would go and say look this is now the new 
one we have dealt with the old one and this is how I am 
going to repay you because there was no issue about my 
inability to repay.  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 89 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how did Mr Agrizzi know that there 
would be no problem with you paying back in what eight 
years – when you spoke to him in 2015 it seems to me that 
on what you have said the plan was that you would repay 
him in eight years’ time, 2023.  
MR SMITH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   How did he know that you would be able 
to pay him at that time, it is a long time? 
MR SMITH:   Chair I think I…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You referred to your shares I know about 
10 
that.   
MR SMITH:   Yes, I submitted it in these things.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   I in 2011 had a shareholding or as a partner 
in a company and therefore I had the share agreement in 
2011 already.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR SMITH:   In 2015 I received from the company 
correspondence that says as things stands now in 2015 – 
because it was very clear it was a long term investment.  It 
20 
was going to take about 12 years for it to mature because 
it is a development of property.   
          But in 2015 I received correspondence that says as 
things stands now this is if today everything stopped this is 
what would be due to you per your shareholding.  And it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 90 of 231 
 
was that that I gave as comfort that look it is going to be 
possible for me to pay it Chair, yes and that is part of my 
affidavit, my annexures Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   And did the documents from the 
company reflect that in 2023 you would get enough to pay 
him back the amount that he – you were asking for? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, it did Chair more than that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   More than that? 
MR SMITH:   Far more than that Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
10 
MR SMITH:   It did reflect that as of 2015 on the basis of 
your shareholding even at that point it far exceeded and 
five or seven years down the line it would just be far, far 
more Chair and it is reflected there  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I am sorry I interrupted you.  
MR SMITH:   No, no I said I did – those documents are in 
there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but did he take them; did he keep 
some of those documents for his own peace of mind? 
MR SMITH:   Chair I do not know if he kept them for his 
20 
own peace of mind but I do know even from his own 
affidavit that he was aware of them because initially he 
speaks about me being a BEE partner which is not correct 
and secondly he says he knows that I had this business 
interest.  So I am not sure if he actually took the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 91 of 231 
 
documents but he certainly had sight of them at some 
point.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well my recollection is that in his 
affidavit he says maybe in both affidavits that he refers to 
you – him.  He says there was a time when you approached 
him for a loan that you wanted him to give you against your 
shares.   
          Now I cannot remember whether he said you wanted 
to sell him the shares or whether the shares were going to 
be the guarantee but he separates it and says that was 
10 
after this transaction of payment for your daughter.  That is 
what he says as far as I remember.   
          So if your version is correct you had the discussion 
with him in which 2015 you ask for a loan and you were 
going to use your shares as kind of security to say look 
this is where you will get your money in eight years’ time.  
On his version the transaction relating to the payment of 
your daughter ’s university fees happened on a different 
occasion and he says he did not discuss that with you as I 
understand what he says.  He says Mr Gavin Watson was 
20 
the one who instructed him.  He says on another occasion 
later you approached him for a loan and you sort o use the 
shares either he says that was going to be security or he 
says you wanted him to buy the shares and he says I 
rejected that.  That is my understanding of his version.       
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 92 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Correct Chair the email that I read earlier on 
referred to school fees and that is why I provided the 
statement.  On a different occasion outside of the school 
fees because that had been settled I went to Mr Agrizzi 
because again I said it was a cash flow problem.  I said 
you know what can we discuss a loan separate from that 
one because my security is sufficient to cover it and that 
discussion went nowhere because, it just did not happen.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   But it was that one that he refers to where he 
10 
says that I was prepared to sell my shares.  The agreement 
the shareholder agreement does not allow for that to 
happen so there was never an intention – I could not sell 
my shares to a third party without going through my 
partners in any case.  So it was never about selling shares 
it was about look – there is no reason not to accept that I 
would be in a position to pay you back that is what it was.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair just to follow up and then to 
follow up what the Chair has raised.  Turn to page 213.  
20 
MR SMITH:   Page 213? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I will let you have five minutes Mr 
Notshe I see we are at one or 13:00.  So I will let you go 
on for five minutes.  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 93 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I will just finish up this issue.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SMITH:   Page 213? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   213, yes.  What I want to do is Mr 
Smith is whilst your looking, 213.  
MR SMITH:   Yes, I am there.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, and this is the issue about the 
loan.  On paragraph – this is the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi.  
MR SMITH:   Yes, I do.  
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
 
At 
paragraph 
24.10 
he 
says 
10 
subsequent to this payment - that is the payment for your 
daughter.  I became aware of the fact that Vincent Smith 
had an interest in Euro Blitz a payment for Vincent Smith’s 
daughter following year of study was paid to Euro Blitz.  So 
he said subsequent to the first payment he discovered that 
you have got Euro Blitz.  So it seems as if when he made 
the first payment, he did not know that you have got Euro 
Blitz.   
MR SMITH:   No that cannot be, Chair that cannot be 
possible because the payments were made to the same 
20 
company.  So it cannot be subsequent to the first payment 
he found out that I owned Euro Blitz when the first payment 
was made, I provided the banking details of the company 
and in fact deposit slips proved that it was paid into that 
very same account.  So I do not understand what it means 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 94 of 231 
 
when he says subsequent to - or the following year only he 
became aware.    
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what he maybe meaning because 
he uses the word interest now that might be using that 
word in a legal sense.  What he maybe meaning is 
somebody could give you an entity’s account and say put 
that money into that account.   
          They might not be shareholders, they might not 
have directors, they might not be a director in that 
company but they know what arrangements they have made 
10 
with the director or CEO of that company about that money.  
But if the person is a director or is a shareholder that 
might be something else.   
          So what he might be meaning is not necessarily to 
say he was hearing for the first time that you have some 
connection with this entity.  He might have heard earlier 
that you have some connection because that is the entity 
you 
told 
him 
about 
but 
that 
you 
have, 
you 
are 
a 
shareholder he might be meaning that is what he was – 
what he found out after.  That is my thinking he might not 
20 
be meaning that but that is my thinking.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That is also my thinking that is why I 
referred this.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That he – you see also Mr Smith if you 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 95 of 231 
 
add what the Chair is raising a paragraph above in 24.14 
he confirms the money was paid, the first money was paid 
to Euro Blitz but then he says only after that that he got to 
know that you have an interest in that company.  It is not 
just a company with an account number but you have an 
interest.  
MR SMITH:   Chair I am the sole shareholder of Euro Blitz 
I am the sole shareholder of Euro Blitz.  Euro Blitz has 
been declared at parliament in member ’s interest since its 
inception.   
10 
          So it was not a matter of I am a part or a 
shareholder with many other, I was the sole shareholder of 
Euro Blitz Chair.  And even the documentation that 
regulates my shareholding indicates that Euro Blitz is my 
company where I hold total shares and therefore the 
shareholding is for me.   
          So it is not – we should not confuse Euro Blitz and 
for want of a better word the joint venture.  Euro Blitz is 
my company where I am alone am a shareholder and it is 
that company that I used for the loan so that I could pay it 
20 
back because my shares would come into that company 
and through that company I would pay to whoever gave me 
the money that is it.  So I was the sole shareholder that is 
the point that I am making of Euro Blitz.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the position would be on your 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 96 of 231 
 
version he may have known or he would have known that 
you 
were 
the 
shareholder 
actually 
maybe 
the 
sole 
shareholder from the first discussion you had with him.  
But on his version, it might not follow that he knew that 
you were the shareholder but he acknowledges that that is 
the name of the entity that you gave to him as the entity 
into which the money should be paid.   
MR SMITH:   Yes I think that is it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just before we adjourn Mr Smith you 
10 
referred it to us I want to look at it during the lunchtime.  
This document you say it is the loan document, the 
document which proves your investment?   
MR SMITH:   Yes.  Which document is that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The one you say it proves.   
MR SMITH:   Ja Chair I am asking about the page number 
were you asking me to find it for you? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, please.  What you can do Mr 
Smith 
you 
do 
not 
have 
to 
look 
for 
it 
now 
let 
us 
adjourn…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can look at it during lunchtime.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Lunchtime you can tell me during 
lunchtime or when we come back to it.  
MR SMITH:   Chair yes I will certainly do that Chair but 
even if it is not in here, I can certainly make it provide it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 97 of 231 
 
before of end of business today.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SMITH:   But I would look at it in lunchtime.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay no that is fine.  Okay we will 
take the lunch adjournment now it is five minutes past we 
will resume at five past two.

this clear.  The document you have shown me it is the – the 
agreement by your company with other companies about 
shares, am I right? 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chair.  There are two 
documents.  The first document is what you and I maybe 
would call a shareholders’ agreement that reflects my 
shareholding.  The second document is the valuation of my 
shares at that point in 2017.  That says at that point I had to 
get my dividends, this is what it was worth.  And gives a 
10 
projection for what it would be worth in 2023.  So those are 
the documents Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have misheard but you seem to say 
2017 I guess you meant 2015? 
MR SMITH:  No Chair the – the valuation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SMITH:  Correspondence that I received from the 
consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SMITH:  Is dated 2017. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR SMITH:  Yes which says as at 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  You are worth X amount of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 100 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought your evidence was that you 
showed Mr Agrizzi in 2015 what the shares were worth at 
that time or what they were – what it was estimated they 
would be worth in 2023. 
MR SMITH:  No at the time Chair there is a shareholder’s 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SMITH:  That says these are your shares. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR SMITH:  And what the input costs were at the time that 
this is what.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  The – the shareholding – not shareholding 
would be worth but this is what the revenue is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  And in 2017 they did the actual calculations 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So but I just want to – to make 
sure that I understood your evidence correctly.  You did not 
20 
say – did you not say that in 2015 you showed Mr Agrizzi 
documents relating to your shares. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which reflected that from those shares in 
2023 you would be able to repay him.  You did not say 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 101 of 231 
 
anything to that effect?  I thought you said something to that 
effect. 
MR SMITH:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  In 2015 when I took the first out it was just the 
– the – my shareholding in the development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  And you will recall that after the second 
payment I did one in 2015 and did one in 2016.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR SMITH:  In 2017 when I asking for the – for a totally 
different one that we discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  At that point I then had this evaluation that says 
look even if we take those two into consideration and 
anything else it will far exceed what it was.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Does that mean that in 2015 when 
you asked Mr Agrizzi for a loan on your version you did not 
show him any documents that showed what the value of the 
– of your shares were at that time or what the value of the 
20 
shares were – was likely to be in 2023? 
MR SMITH:  I did not show him a document because I 
received that document Chair in 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In 2017.  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  But at the onset of the project we all knew that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 102 of 231 
 
this project was going to be worth so much but I would not 
have had a written… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:  Proof from the consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  If you want to call it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Because you remember I – I 
think I did ask the question whether he – he that is Mr 
10 
Agrizzi when you asked him for the loan looking at the 
amount involved whether he asked you for anything that 
would give him peace of mind that come 2023 you would be 
able to pay – to pay back?  I thought I asked that question 
and my recollection was that you said you showed him the 
documents that showed that you would be able to – to more 
than – or what you had would be more than what you were 
asking for from him.  That is my impression of our exchange. 
MR SMITH:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your impression different? 
20 
MR SMITH:  No, no Chair I – I am saying we can – or the 
transcripts will probably prove it but – but the reality is 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  That I would not have been able to give him the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 103 of 231 
 
Rand valuation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  Into 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:  I could only give that to him at the earliest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  When I received from the consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  After three years what I was worth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So on that basis would it not be 
10 
correct then to say when you asked him for a loan in 2015 
there was nothing that you showed him that would have 
given him peace of mind that in 2023 you would be able to 
afford paying him back such a lot of money.  Would it be 
correct to say that was the position? 
MR SMITH:  I am – yes Sir.  Yes Chair in terms of the Rand 
value but in terms of the quantum of shares that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  It would have been possible to calculate it but 
in terms of the Rand value I agree with you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So you then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – I am sorry – I am terribly sorry Mr 
Notshe.  Maybe let me just put this as well Mr Smith.  Would 
you agree that reliance on – on shares on the value of the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 104 of 231 
 
shares going up over a certain number of periods – by a 
certain number of years would be a little risky?  Maybe not a 
little risky it would be risky in the sense that the share value 
of – of shares of the company can go up and down anytime if 
certain things happen to that company or in the markets you 
know.  The company that – whose shares today cost X Rands 
in a weeks’ time if something happens they can just go down 
and those share are worth very little after that event. 
MR SMITH:  This was not the case in this particular one 
Chair.  Because the shares went up… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not general proposition you accept 
that? 
MR SMITH:  As a general proposal we accept that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying in this yes. 
MR SMITH:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say in this case it was different. 
MR SMITH:  Yes it was not in the stock market for instance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:  This was for a physical project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SMITH:  That we knew would cost so much and bring this 
return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SMITH:  As opposed to a stock market where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 105 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:  Shares go up and down according to the market 
sentiment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But just following up what the Chair has 
raised is so you say the loan was advanced to you without 
Mr Agrizzi having security at all? 
MR SMITH:  In terms of security in writing or ceding 
something to him no Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And without him seeing the valuation of 
the shares you have? 
10 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chair without seeing the Rand 
valuation of the share we had other than my shareholding 
and everybody knows the extent of the development that was 
taking place there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  Now the – after the first request 
for payment did, he confirm to you that he had made the 
payment?  Did he confirm the – because remember your 
evidence was that the payment was going to be made in that 
university in Whales.  Did he confirm to you – come back and 
20 
says we have made the payment to the university? 
MR SMITH:  The payment was made into my company 
account Chair and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  First payment at least I think? 
MR SMITH:  Both of them were made. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 106 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh both of them. 
MR SMITH:  To the company Euro Blitz that we are talking 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought the second one was paid 
directly. 
MR SMITH:  No both of them were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SMITH:  So I could have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  Even on my own. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  Checked that monies have been deposited.  
Whether he physically came to me and said hey listen that 
transaction has now been done I am not a hundred percent 
sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
MR SMITH:  But just a cursory glance at my own bank 
balance in the company would have shown that there was 
this payment made Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can you remember now whether you 
were given the proof of payment of the money? 
MR SMITH:  No I was not given proof of payment of the 
money Chair.  As I say I saw it in the bank account.  I get my 
own bank statements on a monthly basis and in the bank 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 107 of 231 
 
statements it would have reflected that there were indeed 
those payments.  After all Chair as the money came in I 
immediately then made payment to the institution.  So I was 
aware that indeed the money had cleared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And do you confirm to the commission 
that even the second payment of R395 076.00 there were no 
written loan agreement, there was no security given? 
MR SMITH:  I confirm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you confirm that the amount was 
10 
also paid into your company? 
MR SMITH:  I confirm that the amount was paid into the Euro 
Blitz company and the rationale is simple Chair.  I wanted it 
to be paid into that account because my dividends would 
have been paid into that same account and therefore it would 
have offset each other.  As opposed to the loan being put 
into my own private account.  It was there for audit 
purposes.  So the money went into Euro Blitz and my 
dividends would be paid to Euro Blitz not to Vincent Smith.  
And Euro Blitz then would pay the loan. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I wanted to find out about that 
because as I understand the position it was a personal loan 
that you asked for. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 108 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To you as Mr Smith.  It was not a loan by 
your company.  A loan your company asking for a loan from 
Mr Agrizzi.  And you wanted it for purposes of paying for 
your daughter’s university fees.  It was very personal as I 
see it.  So I wondered why you would have wanted it go to 
the company which had nothing to do with it other than that 
you were hoping to use the money that would come from the 
shares in order to pay back.  But as I understand it your – 
your right to the shares or to dividend that was your personal 
10 
– it was personal that that money would come to you you 
know and you had an obligation to pay for your daughter and 
not your company had an obligation to pay for your daughter.  
So I was just wondering why say the money must go to the 
company when it could just put – be put into your account – 
personal account and then you pay over. 
MR SMITH:  As I indicated Chair the company for me was 
the most convenient vehicle for audit purposes and audit 
share purposes.  It could well have gone into my account 
Chair.  I do not know at the time but if hypothetically my 
20 
account had an overdraft facility – or an overdraft that 
money would have been swallowed up there.  Whereas in the 
company the company never had an overdraft facilities.  I – 
it could – and the company and Vincent I mean I was the 
sole shareholder to the company so I could advance a loan 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 109 of 231 
 
from the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SMITH:  And then pay this – the fees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  But it might be around about way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  But today I have proof that it is – the loan has 
been raised and that is how I thought about it at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But if one were to look at the source of 
10 
the payment no one will see the name Vincent Smith being 
credited with this amount. 
MR SMITH:  No nobody would have seen Vincent Smith 
because the amount went into the company. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So if – if you wanted – you did not want 
your name to appear in the accounts of the company that 
was paying – paying to the company the convenient way. 
MR SMITH:  No it would not be a convenient way because I 
was the sole shareholder of the company.  It could not have 
been hidden that this money ultimately would be money that 
20 
Vincent Smith would use in whichever way.  Whether it is to 
pay his water and lights or salaries so it was paid into a 
vehicle where I and only I was the shareholder of the 
company.  So it could not have been a mechanism of – of 
masking who the ultimate beneficiary would have been Chair. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 110 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think what – the point that Mr Notshe 
is making I think is this one.  That if let us say BOSASA had 
to reflect – I know that you have made the point repeatedly 
that you borrowed from Mr Agrizzi not from BOSASA.  But let 
us say for argument sake if this was a loan from BOSASA to 
you BOSASA would have had to reflect that in the – in their 
books and what would be reflected is a loan by BOSASA to 
Vincent Smith.  And the name Vincent Smith is quite well 
known 
– 
Public 
Representatives, 
Senior 
Member 
of 
Parliament, Chairperson of or former Chairperson of the 
10 
Correctional Services Portfolio Committee does that it – 
somebody might just pick that up.  Whereas if what is written 
is it is a loan from BOSASA to company ABC on the face of it 
you will not see that ABC is Mr Vincent Smith’s company 
unless you have personal knowledge or unless you have 
reason to go and dig up who owns this company.  But on the 
face of it you will not connect Mr Smith with this loan.  I 
think that is the point he is making. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  May I say this Chair without arguing about it? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  As a Member of Parliament you are obliged on 
an annual basis to reflect all your assets in the Members 
Register.  This was declared.  So anybody who knew I was a 
Member of Parliament if you went and said let us see what 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 111 of 231 
 
Vincent Smith owns would have picked up that Vincent Smith 
is the owner of –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  So – so it is out there in the public for exactly 
the same reason you are talking about Chair.  But I am 
saying it is not inconceivable that it could be used but the 
Members Register is to deal with exactly that.  And the 
Members Register is public – or it is accessible to all public 
men – to everybody in the public. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But somebody who just sees for 
10 
example BOSASA books and sees the name Euro Blitz or 
whatever the name of the company was nothing necessarily 
attracts them to this transaction because at that stage it 
does not relate to anybody in the public eye.  Unlike if they 
would look at the books and they see Vincent Smith then 
they might dig.  But if somebody were to say who  is this 
Euro Blitz or whatever the name of the company then they go 
and dig then they obviously find out that it is owned by Mr 
Vincent Smith and then they check in Parliament whether the 
company was declared and so on.  But will – without 
20 
somebody going digging on the face of it they might just see 
some unknown company.  You understand that? 
MR SMITH:  I accept that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And just to add to that.  If one looks at 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 112 of 231 
 
BOSASA records and see Euro Blitz no one is going to 
immediately think ah I must look at Members of Parliament 
declaration account.  Am I right? 
MR SMITH:  No Chair you are right but I am – may I say this 
without disputing it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  In retrospect it might have been good that I did 
not go to a company and I went to an individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can I – then when you looked at – you 
said you saw in the – in Euro Blitz account that the money 
had been paid.  Who was the payee who reflected in Euro 
Blitz books – Euro Blitz bank account? 
MR SMITH:  Chair the first payment was – or not the first 
payment.  One of the payments was a cash payment and the 
second payment was a payment from a lawyers trust 
account.  Not one of them had any reflection of BOSASA or 
anybody like that and that is what was reflected in my bank 
20 
statements.  So there was no ways that even if it did come 
from BOSASA that from my records I would have known that 
it came from BOSASA because there was no reference that 
made – or there was no reference made of BOSASA. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And let us deal with the first one.  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 113 of 231 
 
It is R267 000.00. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The first one was R267 000.00 and 60 
cents.  R267 667.00.  You agree with me? 
MR SMITH:  I agree Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is a lot of money to be paid in cash.  
Did that not raise queries with you?  A lot of money.  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Particularly when you know as you did in 
2015  
1. That on your version the person you were asking the 
10 
loan from was Mr Agrizzi. 
2. You knew that Mr Agrizzi was a high ranking official of 
BOSASA. 
3. A number of years had lapsed since that meeting I think 
in 2011 or 2010 or when your committee was shocked 
by the presentation from the SIU about the corruption 
that seemed to be happening which allegedly involved 
BOSASA. 
So I am saying as you answer this – that question from 
Mr Notshe to say were you not concerned about such a lot of 
20 
money being paid in cash in circumstances where you knew 
that on your version this was a loan from somebody who was 
a high ranking official of a company that to your knowledge 
had all kinds of allegations of corruption against it? 
MR SMITH:  Honestly Chair at the time I was not.  In 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 114 of 231 
 
retrospect 
now 
and 
going 
through 
it 
as 
we 
have 
systematically went through it now maybe it should have 
rung a bell but honestly at the time it never registered either 
way.  I want to be very honest with you Chairperson that yes 
it is – it could be conceived that way but I did not register it 
at the time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now the second payment you say it was 
from a lawyer?  The second payment you say it was from a 
lawyer?  It was from an attorney? 
CHAIRPERSON:  A law firm? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  A law firm.  The second payment it was 
from a law firm.  Which law firm was that? 
MR SMITH:  No I – I know that in retrospect Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  From what I have here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  In my records it did not say it was from a 
lawyer.  I am saying I know that only now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Afterwards? 
MR SMITH:  Afterwards yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  At the time in my records it just shows 
repayment for the car accident.  That is what it says actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  Yes.  Not – not – not came from lawyer – X 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 115 of 231 
 
lawyer – Lawyer X – I beg your pardon from Lawyer X or 
Lawyer Y. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You see I was getting there.  You stole 
my thunder now.  I was getting to this part that it must have 
reflected as a car accident settlement, am I right?  And you 
had no dispute about the car settlement with Mr Agrizzi did 
you? 
MR SMITH:  No I did not and let us be honest on that one 
again Chair.  And the bank statements are there.  Page 1 of 
the bank statement just shows the amount.  It is the 
10 
subsequent bank statements that would show what the 
references were for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  In my head I – I am expecting R10.00 I get 
R10.00 and I know it is coming from the Judge the R10.00.  
It is when these allegations were raised that I said let me as 
I did homework now to find those things out.  I – I was 
shocked when I realised that this thing was reflected as a 
car accident.  Because indeed there was no car accident due 
to me from – from Mr Agrizzi.  Mine was a loan from Mr 
20 
Agrizzi and he was going to give me that money from his 
sources not – I never questioned where it came from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Would you agree with me that to – 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 116 of 231 
 
or before we get there.  Let us go to page 334. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 334 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  334. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  334 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair I notice Mr Smith when he talks 
about it he gives an example about Judges.  He limits the 
R10.00 and not more.  I do not know why he is doing it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that connected Mr Notshe with why you 
10 
are not on the bench? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair.  Chair I must confess I did not 
expect – I did not expect that one.  Mr Smith look at page 
334. 
MR SMITH:  I am there Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This is an email from Mr Angelo Agrizzi 
at the top.   
MR SMITH:  Yes I see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then it is to Mr Carlos Bonifacio and 
Andries Van Tonder. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Because you were 
talking about other things Mr Notshe I looked at red numbers 
instead of black numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I went to a wrong.. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 117 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Problem of [00:26:23]. Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Mr Notshe want to – wants to 
continue talking about those things.  Yes 334. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair – so Mr Smith you agree this is 
from Mr Agrizzi and it is to Mr Carlos Bonifacio and Andries 
Van Tonder. 
MR SMITH:  Yes that is what the communication says Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  It says: 
“Subject payment trust account.” 
And then it says: 
10 
“This is for specific consultant that we cannot 
do cash.” 
You see that? 
MR SMITH:  I do see that Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry where – where about is that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I am reading at the top Chair going 
down. After subject. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is for – this is for a specific 
consultant. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we cannot do cash. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is an email from Mr Agrizzi to Mr 
Carlos Bonifacio – Bonifacio and Andries Van Tonder dated 5 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 118 of 231 
 
August 2016.  Yes okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And just to pause there you were not a 
consultant to them were you? 
MR SMITH:  I beg your pardon I never heard that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You were not a consultant to Mr Agrizzi 
were you? 
MR SMITH:  No I was not a consultant I was a Member of 
Parliament Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  Now and then the blow that there 
is an earlier – there is an earlier email so one minute apart. 
10 
It is also from Mr Agrizzi and it is to Mr Van Wyk, Andries 
Van Tonder and – at BOSASA and then Mr Carlos Bonifacio 
and then – and then it says subject Payment Trust Account.  
And then if you read further it says: 
“Morning Christo could you please effect 
payment – then settlement from the Trust 
Fund you have currently under BOSASA 
Operations Pty Ltd account to the following 
account.” 
Now he gives the account First Bank and then Euro Blitz – 
20 
Euro Blitz 48 Pty and then he gives the amount and then this 
is – this is the account of Euro Blitz I suppose.  Am I right? 
MR SMITH:  I beg your pardon Sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This is the account of Euro Blitz? 
MR SMITH:  That is the account number that I provided to Mr 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 119 of 231 
 
Agrizzi Chair and it is the account that belongs to my 
company. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then it is a reference car accident 
settlement? 
MR SMITH:  I see that Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Would you agree with me that this 
reference and also what appeared in your statement clearly 
was hiding who the money was paid to, what was the 
purpose of the money? 
MR SMITH:  No I would not know Chair.  The honest fact 
10 
again is these documents – first of all I was not copied in 
any of these correspondence.  I am seeing this as part of Mr 
Agrizzi’s evidence.  I was not aware of this correspondence.  
It has never been copied to me and I had never seen it Chair 
so reading it now I agree with – with the commission but I 
had nothing to do with it and I was not even aware of this 
type of communication Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the – the – the question that 
20 
arises is this.  This is 2016 when this Mr Agrizzi sends these 
emails okay.  It is not 2018 when he gave evidence in this 
commission.  It is 2016.  It is at a – it is the same year when 
even on your version I would imagine the two of you are 
getting well.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 120 of 231 
 
You – you can ask – approach him for a loan.  He 
gives you a loan.  He makes payment.  He does not even 
insist on a written agreement.  He does not even ask you to 
put up security.  He does not even seek anything that 
assures him that in 2023 he will be able to get his money 
back.  He does not insist on anything like that.   
But he writes to certain people and he seems to wish 
to conceal the true nature of this arrangement.  That is now 
if your version is correct that this was a loan.  He seems to 
be – he seems not to want to acknowledge that it is a loan.  
10 
He seems to want to hide the true nature because you have 
said there was no car accident claim that you were involved 
in.  But he says what you are being paid – the amount – the 
money that will paid to your company is for a settlement of a 
car accident.   
So the question is, if he knew that as you say he 
knew that the arrangement between the two of you was a 
loan why would he not be saying this is a loan?  Why would 
he say this is a settlement arising out of a car accident?   
MR SMITH:  Chair I cannot – I cannot – I cannot speculate 
20 
as why he says that Chair.  For me the reason why I 
presented my company account that is audible was because 
it was above board.   
For me my understanding that this was a personal 
loan person to person.  When one reads this it is very clear 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 121 of 231 
 
that the source of the funding might have come from a 
different source and that is – could be – one – I am not 
saying it is.  
It could be one of those reasons but I had nothing to 
conceal and that is why it went to a company via EFT or via 
normal payment which is traceable and it was raised as a 
loan in my books that were audited.  So I want to reiterate 
Chair from my side it was a legitimate – a transaction.  
Otherwise I would have found more creative ways of doing it 
and I cannot speculate as to why he adopted this approach 
10 
Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You see there are these two versions and 
of course ultimately, I have to – got to weigh them up and 
make findings. But there are these two versions.  On your 
version this payment was in terms of a loan, a verbal loan 
agreement that you concluded with Mr Agrizzi in 2015.  On 
his version this was corruption.   
On his version he took a stand at a certain stage for 
whatever reasons and I am sure different people would give 
different reasons as to why but he took a stand or he made a 
20 
decision that he was going to expose what he knew as 
corruption that he was – he said he was taking place or had 
been taking place at BOSASA.   
And he said I am not saying I did not involve myself 
in that corruption.  He said I too was involved in that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 122 of 231 
 
corruption.  But I am exposing it now.  And if I must be 
punished that is fine.  But I am exposing it now.  This is the 
corruption that Mr Watson and I and others were involved in.  
You will remember he came to the commission.  He showed 
videos of cash being prepared and all of that.   
Now what he would be saying is, I had to – I had to 
say this was for a car accident settlement so that it looked 
legitimate.  Now if indeed Mr Smith and I had concluded the 
loan arrangement it would have been legitimate for me to 
write it as a loan to say it is a loan.  I put it down as a car 
10 
accident settlement because I had to look for something and 
because there was no loan arrangement I said – car accident 
settlement.  That is the kind of explanation that is possible.  
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR SMITH:  Yes Chair I want to comment guardedly because 
I do not want to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but to speak freely. 
MR SMITH:  But – speculation but in my view Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  And… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Feel free to explain. 
MR SMITH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I need to look at both sides and I 
need to hear what your perspective is on these things. 
MR SMITH:  In – In looking at it now Chairperson and taking 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 123 of 231 
 
into consideration that all along Mr Agrizzi had indicated that 
this was an instruction from Gavin Watson.   
Nowhere here does it – in fact all these instructions 
are from Mr Agrizzi.  So where he sourced the funds from 
could – might have been his challenge because I do not 
believe that there was an instruction from BOSASA if you 
can call it BOSASA to pay this money.  My loan was with Mr 
Agrizzi and not Gavin Watson.   
So I am saying without speculating that that could 
have been it.  Because if he had said to me, I do not have 
10 
cash but I am going to go and source cash from the company 
I would have then gone to Mr Watson with whom I have a 
relationship and asked him for it.   
So I was very clear that I do not want to have 
anything to do with the organisation. I was dealing as I 
indicated earlier on, I had a relationship with him from 
helping each other.   
So that was how I understood it Chairperson.  It is – 
it is my version.  It is something that you would have to take 
a judgment on but that is from the bottom of my heart what I 
20 
firmly believed in until these things came to the fore where 
these informations were given to us.  But at that time, it 
certainly was not something that I was aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just on that can you turn to – firstly you 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 124 of 231 
 
turn to page 354. 
MR SMITH:  354? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  354. 
MR SMITH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This is the bank statement of Euro Blitz 
and the statement is dated the 31 August 2016. 
MR SMITH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you must have received the 
statement shortly after that date.  You must have? 
MR SMITH:  The statement? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The statement yes. 
MR SMITH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Sorry am I speaking softly? 
MR SMITH:  No, no.  Sorry Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You must have received it shortly after 
that date.  But go over to 355.  There is an item there of – on 
6 August it says:  General credit domestic tree – car 
accident settlement and then there is the amount.  You see 
that? 
MR SMITH:  I do see that Chair. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry let me see where that is.  You said 
355? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  At page 355 I think that is the second 
page of the statement Chair. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 125 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then there is an item on the 6 
August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh oh yes.  General credit domestic tree 
car expense settlement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I can see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now firstly when you noticed this there is 
nothing which about Mr Agrizzi here.  There is no indication 
of – there is no name of Mr Agrizzi here. 
10 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the only thing is the amount of 
R395 076.00, am I right? 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now how did you link this with Mr 
Agrizzi? 
MR SMITH:  Chair I indicated earlier on that with every loan 
I had given the information to Mr Agrizzi from – in other 
words the university’s bill and I knew that R300 000.00 per 
my arrangement with Mr Agrizzi was due in this account to 
20 
be paid over.  I knew because there is no other source that 
would have come into this account unless it was a mistake 
from somebody else.  So I was expecting this kind of money 
from an arrangement that I had made with an individual 
Chairperson. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 126 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the amount comes.  When you 
saw this you see it said car accident settlement.  It did not – 
it did not worry you that this has not come as a loan of Mr 
Agrizzi it has come as a car accident settlement? 
MR SMITH:  I never noticed that Chairperson and if I did I at 
the time did not reflect it.  I must be honest I did not reflect 
upon it at the time Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But you – you agree with me that when 
you look at it now anyone looking at this on your statement 
hides that the money is from Agrizzi or from BOSASA it does 
10 
not show there? 
MR SMITH:  I agree Chairperson.  I agree. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  Now the – in your – in discussing 
the loan what you call a loan with Mr Agrizzi what was the 
interest of – what was the interest that is going to be and 
what – that you are going to pay on this loan? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, I have been advised by my legal team to 
ask you that question not be answered because it could 
potentially incriminate.  That is what I was advised by my 
team, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Notshe, what do you say? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, it is his right to... if he feels that 
the question will incriminate... the answer will incriminate 
him and he refuse to answer it on that basis.  But what I 
would appreciate from him, I must say, I will appreciate is. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 127 of 231 
 
 
Unlike 
some 
other 
people 
we 
have 
had 
in 
this 
Commission, who refuse just in to come.  He has come, he 
has answered a lot of questions, and this particular question.   
 
And this is, for me, what I would expect if he feels that it 
is going to incriminate him.   
 
But Chair, I would ask the Chair to then inform Mr Smith 
that the fact that he refuses to answer the question, does not 
prevent the Commission to make a finding on the basis of 
what is there and of where there has been no answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think what we will do, Mr Smith.  
10 
Well, let me say one thing is that I wanted to mention.  I 
thought it was quite a good thing you did that when you 
furnished the Commission with your affidavits, you have put 
your version of what happened. 
 
Because of what you know had gone before, namely, 
there had been issues about whether you would submit an 
affidavit to the Commission or testify.  Whether you would 
feel that you might wish not to give evidence because there 
might be criminal charges.   
 
Because of that that discussion that have been going 
20 
prior to you furnishing the affidavit, one could expect that 
you might not come out with your version.   
 
So when we have read your affidavit so that you put up 
your version, my feeling was, you know, that this is good, 
you know.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 128 of 231 
 
 
Because I thought you might have taken the view that I 
am public representative, a member of parliament, issues a 
reason.  I will put up my version and the Commission will 
decide or will decides but I will put up my version.  I will tell 
South Africa what my version is.   
 
But having said, the Commission will respect your right 
if you feel that in regard to a specific question, you would 
like not to answer the question for fear of incriminating 
yourself.   
 
So if you say that is your position, we will move onto 
10 
another question.  But as Mr Notshe indicates, in the end 
when I weigh up the evidence of the witnesses and seek to 
establish where the truth lies, I will have a situation where in 
regard to your version, there is this one question or there 
may be more question s that you might have said:  I refuse 
to answer this.   
 
And maybe Mr Agrizzi might have said there is no 
question that I am not able to answer the Commission on my 
version.  I will tell the Commission everything that it was 
about my version.   
20 
 
So that is the position.  But in the end, if you wish to 
exercise that right, feel free to exercise it.  That is... we will 
respect that.   
MR SMITH:   That was the advice given to me by my legal 
team, Chairperson. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 129 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  Let us move 
on. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Smith, is it correct that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe... maybe I should just say this 
Mr Smith.  I had formed the impression - and maybe I should 
not have formed it - that your discussion with Mr Agrizzi 
about the loan did not include an interest, simple because...  
 
You will remember before lunch there was a time when I 
said:  What were the terms of these loan agreement?  And 
10 
you answered in the way you answered.   
 
But you do not have to clarify that or anything in case it 
might go against the advice you have received. 
MR SMITH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, I have or have included in 
your... in the bundle with you... before you... no, in front of 
you, starting from page 404 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say we must go to 404? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   404. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Up to 424.   
MR SMITH:   I am there, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You will confirm... I do not want to go 
through all these documents but you confirm that these 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 130 of 231 
 
contain your declaration to parliament? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you confirm that in these 
documents, there is no declaration of a loan made either to 
you or to your company. 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair there is on page 405 a declaration of 
Euro Blitz (Pty) Ltd on 405. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   405? 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see. 
10 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Euro Blitz (Pty) Ltd. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And just to be on record ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, unless I misunderstood Mr Notshe, 
I think he was not talking about declaration of the company 
but of the laws. 
MR SMITH:   I was getting there, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you will get to it? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay. 
MR SMITH:   My understanding, and I have canvassed it at 
20 
the time... well, not at the time but when these things were 
raised, was that most MP’s or whoever would say I have 
shares in this company but would not put a line-item. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would not put...? 
MR SMITH:   The line-items ...[intervenes]  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 131 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SMITH:   ...of all the transactions, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja. 
MR SMITH:   But in that discussion, somebody was saying:  
Well, that was implied that you put the line-item.  Now I did 
not put it in here.  I put the company here.  And people could 
go to the audited financial statements.   
 
And I am just thinking from my side, giving my 
understanding.  If that was the expectation Chair and I had 
500 loans, I give it as an example, it would mean that I must 
10 
put 500 line-items here.   
 
That is what it would mean in practise in Chair and that 
is now how I understood it.  And there was that debate within 
parliament.  Do you put the line-items?  Or do you say:  I 
own shares here?  And so on.   
 
And by the time I had left, I have not reached any 
conclusion, other than saying:  Here is my company.  And if 
somebody wanted to, to go and look at the transactions, they 
probably could have gone to look at the transactions.   
 
But to answer the question of the Commission.  There is 
20 
no declaration of that line-item but there is a declaration of 
the companies.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But Mr Smith, this is not helpful because 
the loan was to you, not to Euro Blitz.  Am I right? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 132 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In your version, Mr Agrizzi lent money to 
you, not to Euro Blitz. 
MR SMITH:   I suppose technically, the Commission is right 
that the money was loaned to me but it went through the 
company because that was the vehicle that I have used, 
Chairperson.  So if the money was lent to me as a person... 
and maybe indeed it should have been, I received this 
benefit here.  But by the version of this register, I had just 
reflected the company. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the position is that as far as 
parliament is concerned, there is nothing that you did to 
disclose to parliament that you had been given a loan of the 
amounts that you are talking about, to you personally.  But 
also, there was nothing indicating that Mr Agrizzi had given a 
loan to Euro Blitz.  Those two statements are correct, is it 
not? 
MR SMITH:   They are correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are correct. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So anybody looking here, looking at these 
disclosures would not see that there was this transaction 
between Mr Agrizzi and yourself or even between Mr Agrizzi 
and Euro Blitz.  You accept that? 
MR SMITH:   I accept that, Chairperson. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 133 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And do you also accept... do you also 
confirm that you remained a committee member even after 
you had... you are no longer a chairperson but you were still 
a member of the Parliamentary Committee which on... I 
mean, Correctional Services.  You confirm that? 
MR SMITH:   I did indicate earlier on, Chairperson that 
incorrect... in parliament – I beg your pardon – you are a 
member, a full member or you are an alternate member.  And 
I indeed was an alternate member that never participated 
10 
because I had chaired three other committees.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you were privy... you... well, you 
would 
not 
been 
given 
the 
minutes 
of 
the 
committee 
discussions? 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair I would not be given the minutes of 
the committee discussions. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So even ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you be entitled to them if you ask 
for them? 
MR SMIT:   Every member of parliament would be entitled to 
20 
them, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Not only members of the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Committee members, ja. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, every member of parliament. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 134 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   If indeed they wanted to participate or read, 
members will be entitled to it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but as alternate member, you would 
also participate in a meeting if somebody else was not 
attending?  In other words, if somebody was not there, then 
you would come in or, what did it mean to say you are an 
alternate member in the context of parliament? 
MR SMITH:   You know, Chair.  Any member of parliament 
can attend any committee ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   ...whether he is a member or not of the 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   I think this term alternate would mean if you 
need a quorum for instance.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And A is not there, you could go there.  But the 
practice that even if A was not there and I was an alternate 
member, if they needed a quorum, you would affect the 
20 
quorum.   
 
But the basic understanding, or certainly my basic 
understanding was, that full-time members were expected to 
make sure that the business of the committee works.   
 
An alternate member, if and when he is available or 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 135 of 231 
 
required, should be, in other words, a resolve if you put it 
that way Chairperson.  That is how I understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Smith, the other issue here is, 
BOSASA hired a car for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go there because I think you 
are moving away from parliament. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to... With regard to the 
disclosure of the transaction between yourself and Mr Agrizzi 
10 
to parliament... I think you said, you did on the over how it 
should be disclosed and whether if you just write the name 
of the company, that you have got shares in the company, 
that is enough.  Or whether you should put what you called 
line-items.  Is that right?  That is what you said? 
MR SMITH:   That is right so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now that seems to suggest to me 
that the issue of this transaction was uppermost I your mind 
at the time.  Am I... do I understand your evidence correctly? 
MR SMITH:   At which point was ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time of making this disclosure.  I 
am assuming this disclosure... or this is what, 2018?  But 
there would be some for every year, is it not?  2017 and 
twenty, and so on.   
MR SMITH:   [No audible reply]  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 136 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   A disclosure in parliament in annual, is it 
not? 
MR SMITH:   It is annual, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So this one that we are looking 
at 404 and 405, it seems it was 2018.  Is that right? 
MR SMITH:   That is the date of it.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So my question is whether when you 
had to make the disclosure here, am I right to think that the 
question of the transaction on your version, the question of 
the transaction that you have had with Mr Agrizzi, namely the 
10 
loan, was uppermost in your mind as to in what way you 
were required to disclose it.  Am I right to think that is the 
position or that is not necessarily the position? 
MR SMITH:   No, that is not necessarily the position, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Because as you have indicated, this was done 
annually.  And I am... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SMITH:   And I am sure if you went to twenty... because 
this company was from 2011. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I am sure if you went from 2011 onwards, this 
is how I had registered.  So it was not on the basis of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, uppermost ...[intervenes]  
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 137 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Uppermost in my mind.  No, it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  But I would have 
expected it to have been uppermost in your mind, that list 
from 2017, because you, on your version, the loan was some 
time in the course of 2015.  Actually, from 2016.  The loan 
transaction in regard to the 2015 academic year was in 2015 
and the arrangements with regard to the 2016 academic year 
for your daughter was in 2016.  Is that right? 
MR SMITH:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am raising with you is that when 
10 
you made the disclosures that you needed to make in 
parliament in 2016 - and I guess it was probably done earlier 
in the year - when you had to make the disclosure in 2016, 
you would have... I expect that you would have remember 
that there is this loan that you had with... from Mr Agrizzi in 
regard to 2015 which he had paid and you would have 
wanted to disclose that.  Is that... would that not have been 
the position?  
MR SMITH:   That was my position at the time, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SMITH:   Chair, maybe from an ignorance point of view 
that it was in the company and the company reflected the 
transaction.  It was not uppermost in my mind, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I have difficulty in understanding 
why it as not because my understanding of your evidence is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 138 of 231 
 
that this was a personal loan.   
 
Mr Agrizzi personally was giving you a loan personally 
for you to discharge your personal obligations as a parent to 
your daughter.   
 
And that it went into the account of your company that 
may have been convenient or that may have been because, 
as you have put it, the repayment will come from the 
dividends in the company.   
 
But I would have thought that from your point of view, if 
your version is correct, you would have regarded yourself as 
10 
somebody who have received this loan from Mr Agrizzi.   
 
And when it comes to you making a disclosure to 
parliament, you would have wanted to disclose this loan and 
you would not disclose this loan by listing Euro Blitz as your 
company because what you disclosed in regard to Euro Blitz 
is that it is a company in which you have an interest.  It said 
nothing about this transaction. 
MR SMITH:   Chair, sitting here now, I suppose you are 
correct Chairperson.  But I just want to bring to our attention 
and I am not saying it is a justification. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   This transaction happened after I had exited 
being Chairperson of Correctional Services and had no 
influence one way or the other over the department, 
Chairperson. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 139 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   So I am not disputing.  I am saying, in 
retrospect, you are absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   But I would not want the... or I should not say I 
would not because it is your decision.  From my view was 
that from where I was not being a chairperson, not 
participating at all or very little.   
 
I do not think I participated more than two or three 
times, if it all, that it would not... I would not have had any 
10 
difficulty if somebody had, at the time said to me:   
 
You must declare the line-item.  Because I did not see 
any conflict and there was no ways at that point that I was 
able 
to 
have 
a 
quid 
pro 
quo 
type 
of 
arrangement, 
Chairperson.   
 
That is what I want to put.  But ultimately, yes you will 
have to take that decision, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you, is it correct that even if you are 
not a member or you are no longer a member of Correctional 
Services Portfolio Committee, just because you are a 
20 
member of parliament, this was a transaction, this was a 
loan, you had an obligation to disclose to parliament or not. 
MR SMITH:   No, I am agreeing with you, Chair.  That is why 
I am saying, I am agreeing with you on that one.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 140 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Of course, somebody listening 
to this and listening to your evidence and having listened to 
Mr Agrizzi’s version about this payment, might say, the 
reason why you did not disclose it, is because it was not 
legitimate to make loan.  There was no loan.   
 
If it was a loan, which you regarded as legitimate, you 
would have easily disclosed it.  In other words, you... 
somebody might say:  We have a situation where on Mr 
Agrizzi’s side, he wants to hide.  He does not say this is a 
10 
loan.   
 
But now in parliament, you also do not disclose it.  And 
yet, if it was a legitimate loan, a loan, one would have 
expect that you would disclose it if you thought there was no 
problem with it.  What do you say to that? 
MR SMITH:   I am expecting your version of what you are 
saying, Chairperson.  But from where I am sitting, and I 
could 
well 
have 
been 
incorrect, 
that 
transaction 
was 
reflected as a loan in the company.   
 
I accept that you are saying it was personal and not a 
20 
company.  It was or is reflected as a loan in the company, 
repayable.   
 
Where I am sitting, the fact that I had reflected it, the 
fact that it is audited, said to me, from where I am sitting 
that this is something that I have got to pay back at some 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 141 of 231 
 
point.   
 
Whether it was Vincent Smith personally or the company, 
I take your point that maybe I should have reflected it 
personally.   
 
But honestly, from where I am sitting, there was never 
ever the intention to hide or to get it in return for something 
else.   
 
That is just the point that I am making.  It could be the 
impression created.  I am giving you my truth.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, another point that I ... another 
10 
question that I want to raise with you is this.  As I 
understand the position, Mr Agrizzi came up with this 
allegation publicly for the first time in 2018.  Is that correct?  
Or was when he gave evidence when he was here in 2019?  I 
cannot remember. 
MR SMITH:   I think it was September 2018, Chair when 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it 2018? 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now, at that time, he had left 
20 
BOSASA, is that right? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he had left BOSASA after being 
employed by BOSASA, as I recall, or close to 20 years if not 
more, if I recall correctly.  You might not be able to say? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 142 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just from his evidence.  But he had been 
employed by BOSASA for a very long time.  Now, why would 
Mr Agrizzi, who, on your version, had a loan agreement with 
you involving a lot of money, over R 600 000,00, to say to 
the Commission and to the world there was this money that 
was paid to Mr Vincent Smith.   
 
Effectively, it was part of corruption.  When by saying 
that, it would mean that he is not going to be entitled to 
demand this money back from you.   
10 
 
And yet, if he did not say this was not corruption money 
and indeed, as I recall were in documents that are in the 
bundle, when he heard that where you had said in parliament 
this was a loan.   
 
He said:  No, it was not a loan.  But if he said:  No, Mr 
Smith is actually...it is true.  This was a loan.  Or, my 
memory has been jogged.  This was a loan.   
 
Then he would know that in 2023, he is going to be 
entitled to demand a lot of money from you.  But if he 
continued to say:  No, it was corruption money.   
20 
 
He would be depriving himself of getting this money paid 
back to him.  It seems strange that somebody who knows 
himself to be entitled to this money being paid to him 
because it was a loan, would actually denounce and 
disentitle himself to the payment of this money.  Well, what 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 143 of 231 
 
do you say to that? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, I have... I do not know what was the 
motivation by Mr Agrizzi, why he did or why he did not.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You can understand the logic that you 
would expect that if somebody has given somebody a loan 
and especially when it is such a lot of money, that one would 
expect 
that 
they 
would 
not 
do 
anything 
to 
disentitle 
themselves to the repayment of that money.  And yet, his 
version means that he can never demand that money from 
you.   
10 
MR SMITH:   Except Chair if he himself knew that it was not 
his money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   If he himself knew that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And that is why I am saying, I am the last one 
to get into that argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Because I do not know what were the 
dynamics.  In fact, at the time, as you say, he was no longer 
20 
a member... he was no longer an employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes of BOSASA. 
MR SMITH:   So I do not understand what caused that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I do not want to venture into that. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 144 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Into that area, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Of course, he, as far as I know, 
as I remember, of course, he does not say it was his 
personal money.  He says it was BOSASA money because he 
says he was instructed by Mr Agrizzi to affect the payment.  
That is what he says.  But you said what you have to say on 
that question.  Is that right?   
MR SMITH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, before I move 
to the topic I was going to start with.  Mr Smith, can I ... I am 
handing back the document you gave me.   
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Right, these are the copies we have 
made.  Unfortunately, we did not stapled them but we will 
deal with... oh, they are stapled.  We will deal with them.  
Bearing in mind what the request of Mr Smith.  Mr Smith, the 
only thing I want to raise with you is this.  At the top, there is 
a single document, a single page that flies on its own, which 
20 
is ...[intervenes]  
MR SMITH:   Which document is that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry? 
MR SMITH:   Is it the document that you gave? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 145 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The hospital evaluation. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, it seems as if someone made an 
entry by hand to reflect ‘23.  Am I correct? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, correct Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Was it someone who wanted to doctor 
this to be in line with what you are saying that this will 
mature in 2023? 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair.  I am sure if you went through the 
10 
source, you would probably be able to find that that was not 
my... we received the document in that fashion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Mr Notshe ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...should 
we 
not 
paginate 
these 
documents first?  Are you looking at the covering letter or at 
the actual agreement? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, the... no, they did not go together 
although they are bounded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   One is standing alone and the other one 
is standing alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, are you looking at the email or letter? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The email, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dated 17... 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 146 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   17 November.  Okay alright.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just... I see that the... I think you must 
first read what is said there and then indicate what is 
handwritten and what was typed ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...first before you ask the question. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, the email is dated Thursday, the 
16 November 2017.  It is from Brian Landman at Waterfall to 
10 
Mr Vincent Smith at ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, before you proceed.  Who is Brian 
Landman? 
MR SMITH:   Those are the accountants of the consortium 
for a want of a better word, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In which you have shares? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, of that.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay.  Maybe I must get this 
clear.  The shares are... that you are talking about from 
which you are going to get money to pay back Mr Agrizzi.  
20 
There is not shares in Euro Blitz.  It is shares in some other 
entity or the positions that Euro Blitz had shares in another 
entity. 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, it is a holding company that was 
called Waterfall Investment Company.   
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 147 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   It had three shareholders, as you see on the 
agreement at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And Euro Blitz was one of those three 
shareholders.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay.  Now I understand.  
Okay Mr Notshe, then you can read the... and Mr Brian 
Landman was one of the... was an accountant ...[intervenes]  
MR SMITH:   Was an employee for WIC, the top company. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Notshe, 
continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then he writes:   
“Hi, Vincent.  I apologise for the delay.  I have 
discussed 
details 
with 
Werner 
this 
afternoon.  
Werner 
confirms 
that 
dividends 
will 
only 
be 
distributed once all loans have been settled.  This 
will be August ‘26.” 
 
And then there is a line drawn across.  It says: 
“Dividends would obviously be payable only after 
20 
annual income tax is settled by the company to 
SARS for each year.” 
 
And then there is a handwritten ‘23.  It says: 
“5% Equity Evaluation as at November 2017.” 
 
And then it gives the valuations.  So my issue is about 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 148 of 231 
 
August ‘26 which seems to have been crossed.   
MR SMITH:   That was not my adjustment, Chair.  I am 
saying it would have been there.  And I am saying that Chari 
because there was always clarity that the repayment there 
where it says less debt, was always going to be... if you look 
at the net asset value box, the bottom... the second... or the 
table.  Let us put it that way there.   
 
It was always our understanding that that loan would 
take twelve years.  And that is why I indicated earlier on that 
it is a long-term loan, Chairperson.   
10 
 
So if you took – and we can verify it with the authors – if 
you took the time that this thing was agreed upon in 2011 
and you add the 12 years, it would come to 2023.   
 
So my answer to you is that that adjustment was not my 
adjustment and it can be easily verified by the authors of this 
transaction.  Oh, not the transactions.  The witness of the 
email.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the year 2026 is crossed out and 
you skip a line and below the next line, the number 23 is 
written.  I... it seems to me that you have understood that 23 
20 
and it does not 2023, it says 23, you have understood that 
23 to be have been intended to be 2023.  Is that right. 
MR SMITH:   I understood it and that is what I have received 
from Mr Landman when I spoke to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 149 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you ever speak to him to clarify 
that or you left it on the basis that is how you understood it? 
MR SMITH:   No, I left it on the basis that is how it ease. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Because it is not in the financial statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   As a shareholder, you are entitled to financial 
statements.  So it would have been at the next financial 
statements clarified. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes.  This was just for me to say where I am 
now but I am sure the financial statements would have 
shown differently and the audited financial statements are 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And as a shareholder, I mean entitled to the 
books. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   So that is easily available.  And if you wanted it 
20 
as the Commission, I am sure you could source it and give it 
to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  I think if there is some 
document that would show that this August... this 23 was 
meant to be August 2023, I think that it would be... you might 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 150 of 231 
 
wish to provide that.  Or if there are other documents on the 
basis on which one can say, if this document says 20 August 
2023, then August 2023 is what must have been meant here, 
that is fine as well. 
MR SMITH:   I am sure we can source it from WIC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And if they have, I will make it available Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Notshe, continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now you received this document on the 
16t h of November 2017.  Am I right? 
10 
MR SMITH:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, how could you have told Mr Agrizzi 
that you will pay him in 2023 if you received this only in 
2017?  How could you have told him in 2015 that you receive 
his money back in 2023? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, we signed the shareholder’s 
agreement in 2011 and at that time it was clear to all us, in 
fact, it was indicated to all us, maybe not here, that it is a 
12-year agreement Chairperson.   
 
And I am saying that information – I have not gone 
20 
through this to see if it was there – but that information is 
attainable.  That you can expect after 12 years, ordinarily, 
that the loan... not the loan, that the input costs would have 
been covered and you will start getting dividends.   
 
That was made clear to us Chairperson.  And it was on 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 151 of 231 
 
that basis that I made the decision.  But again, if you wanted 
something to that effect, I am sure we can go and get the 
confirmation, Chair.   
 
I was very clear – and let me put it to the Commission 
that when I participated here, I knew that this was when this 
money was going to come available so that I could fund my 
daughter’s... this was, in fact, prosperity for my children.   
 
So I knew that this was the timeframes that ordinarily, 
unless there is a crisis, you could expect the returns to 
come.   
10 
 
That was discussed even when we were agreeing to the 
shareholding that:  Look, guys.  It would you take you about 
so long before we start seeing dividends.  That was the 
basis of the shareholding agreement, Chairperson.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Alright.  Now Mr Smith, let us move on.  
You do not dispute that BOSASA hired a vehicle that was 
used by your daughter, right? 
MR SMITH:   I do not know, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You do not dispute that? 
MR SMITH:   No, I do not dispute that. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, he does not dispute what? 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
 
That 
BOSASA 
hired 
a 
vehicle 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 152 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...that was used by his daughter.  You 
do not dispute that? 
MR SMITH:   No, I do not dispute that, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And without wasting time, you will 
not dispute that you did not disclose that to parliament that 
you got a benefit from BOSASA in the form of a vehicle hired 
for your daughter? 
MR SMITH:   No, I did not declare it, Chairperson.  But just 
to put context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR SMITH:   And I am not disputing it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   It is in my affidavit.  My daughter came home 
from school.  I had approached a friend:  Listen, give me a 
little run around.  And I approached Gavin Watson for it.  I 
received it, Chairperson that little run around.   
 
And that is why I am saying, I am not... at the time, it 
was no indication that it was going to be rental car.  There 
was no indication.   
 
Today, after the... no, today but after the invoices that 
20 
were given to me, I then... not after the invoices.  When we 
went to get the car, it became clear that this was a car that 
was rented from whoever.   
 
And I... yes, to answer his question.  I did not declare 
that.  I had received this benefit in kind.  No, I did not. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 153 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And this one, I mean, this one you knew, 
it was from BOSASA.  It was not from Agrizzi.  It was from 
BOSASA. 
MR SMITH:   That is what I knew, it was from Gavin Watson, 
Chairperson.  A friend of mine who had... in fact, in the past 
helped me all along.  And in fact, when I raised it with him, 
he had indicated to me:  Listen, man.  If it happens again 
that you need it, let us have a discussion.   
 
So I had approached Gavin Watson as I would have 
normally approach and he had given it to me, Chairperson.  
10 
And again, I never asked him whether he is going to source 
it from the company or whatever but now when you look at 
the blank invoices, it is clear that it came from there.  Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about the distinction you 
emphasised repeated, levelled whether it is the company or 
an individual.  The fact of the matter is - I think somebody 
gave evidence or I read somewhere that Mr Gavin Watson 
was for all intense and purposes Mr BOSASA.  You know.   
 
Legally, BOSASA is a separate entity or was a separate 
20 
entity but as I understand, I think somebody’s evidence, he 
really... everyone knew that Mr Gavin Watson was BOSASA.   
 
Now, of course, once you got to know Mr Agrizzi, my 
expectation is that he would also knew that, as I see it, it 
looks Mr Agrizzi was Mr Gavin Watson’s right-hand man in 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 154 of 231 
 
the group of companies. 
 
 So I am not sure that if you were asking for a 
benefit of a financial nature or any benefit from Mr Agrizzi 
or Gavin Watson in your own mind being aware of all the 
allegations of corruption, you know, relating to BOSASA 
that you had been told about in the Correctional Services 
Portfolio Committee from around 2010/2011 that you ought 
to have been seeking to make a distinction that this benefit 
that I am asking for, I am getting from Mr Gavin Watson 
and not from BOSASA, this one I am getting from Mr 
10 
Agrizzi and not from BOSASA because if BOSASA – if the 
allegations, the serious allegations of corruption that you 
had heard about relating to BOSASA were true, what are 
the chances that the top people at BOSASA would not have 
been involved in that corruption because companies act 
through human beings, they do not act on their own and, 
therefore, I would expected that if, because of the 
allegations of corruption that you have heard over the 
years about – relating to BOSASA, you would be concerned 
to get any benefit from BOSASA.  I would have thought 
20 
that even a benefit from Mr Gavin Watson, whom you had 
known for some time, you would be concerned because he 
was effectively, you know, the owner or one of the owners 
of BOSASA.  What do you say to that kind of thinking? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, I distinguished between the individual 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 155 of 231 
 
and the company, as you said, because even earlier on, 
when I said that Euro Blitz and Vincent Smith, you said to 
me but one is personal and one is the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no …[intervenes] 
MR SMITH:   It is what you – I beg your pardon, it is what 
the Commission had said, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SMITH:   So long before I knew or long before, for 
instance, 
these 
things 
came 
out 
of 
SIU, 
I 
had 
a 
relationship with Mr Watson and I would have dealt with 
10 
him at that level Chairperson and I – if had time, I would 
look, I think even somewhere where I raised – and I think it 
was the documents that came last night.  Mr Agrizzi 
somewhere said look, this I was not doing on BOSASA or 
anybody else, doing it as me.   
 
So 
everybody 
distinguished, 
whether 
for 
convenience or otherwise, to this is me and this is the 
company and this is me and this is the company.   
In my case, I am not sure that is the Commission 
suggesting to me that I would – or however wrong, not be 
20 
able to have a relationship in terms of being assisted by 
somebody who might at company level, or wherever, I do 
not know that, Chair, but I am just saying to you, from 
where I am sitting, I made that distinction very clearly, that 
I have a personal friend called Gavin who in the past I 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 156 of 231 
 
would go to and say give us tee-shirts for the ANC, he will 
do it from the company. 
I want to reiterate, Chair, that now we are having 
this honest and frank discussion, in retrospect the lines 
were blurred or possibly were blurred.  I want to make that 
upfront, I do not want to fudge that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I want to be upfront with you that hindsight is 
always where one learns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. No, that is fine.  Maybe I 
10 
would just add this just to underline something about 
making the distinction between a personal relationship or 
somebody as a person representing their company, you 
have a company called Euro Blitz and you are the sole 
shareholder in that company, if there are all kinds of 
allegations of corruption that your company called Euro 
Blitz is alleged to have been involved in, even if you were 
my friend I would think that, you know, I need to think 
carefully about this relationship because there are all 
these allegations around this person which, if true, mean 
20 
that he is a very bad person.   
Now maybe, I do not know if it is true or not, but I 
would be concerned about being seen to be friends with 
this person who has – who is alleged, let us say for 
argument’s sake to be a bank robber and all kinds of 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 157 of 231 
 
things.  So if your company, and you are the sole 
shareholder, I am making example, there are all those 
allegations, I might want to place some distance between 
myself and yourself even if before those allegations came 
up, we were quite close because what if they are true?  It 
looks like maybe during the day you are such a nice person 
but you do all kinds of wrong things.  One day they might 
be proved to be true, maybe not true, but it is something 
that I would imagine would concern me. 
Of course it depends what the allegations are, some 
10 
allegations, you know, might not be so serious, but – so I 
am just saying that in a certain situation you might say 
look, I am not going to be drawing distinction because, for 
example, Mr Smith is the only shareholder of this entity, so 
if these things are true there is no way he is not part of it.  
You might wish to say something on that or you might not 
wish. 
MR SMITH:   Nothing other than to say I take your wise 
counsel, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Tell me, is this view – is this the view 
you hold, is that why you did not disclose to parliament 
that you were friends with Mr Gavin Watson whose 
company was involved in this alleged corrupt activities? 
MR SMITH:   Could you please repeat the question? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 158 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Why is your view that there is a 
distinction between Mr Watson and BOSASA the reason for 
not disclosing to parliament, that you were friends with 
Gavin Watson? 
MR SMITH:   Not, it is not my view, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did you disclose? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am not sure whether there is an 
obligation to disclose friendship in parliament, I think there 
is a [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let me put it the other way.  Your – 
10 
you saw in the Portfolio Committees that there were 
discussion about BOSASA, am I right? 
MR SMITH:   I was aware in the  - will you please repeat 
your question? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You were aware that the Portfolio 
Committee on DCS, Department of Correctional Services 
was discussing now and again the issues of BOSASA. 
MR SMITH:   I was aware, I was part of it, yes, 
Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But did you disclose then to the 
20 
members of the committee that this company is owned by a 
friend of mine?  When I say mine, I mean yours. 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair, I did not disclose that and I have 
friends that own – and I am not justifying it, I am just trying 
to follow the logic that if – this particular one I agree has 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 159 of 231 
 
this problem but I did not disclose it because there was no 
need for me to – not there was need, I am saying I never 
disclosed any other friendship and I do not think any other 
member of parliament does it.   
So to answer your question, no, I never disclosed it 
and again I am saying, Chair, my understanding is that 
even if he was my friend, with the doctrine of separation of 
powers, a member of parliament is unable to influence 
positively or negatively the operations of the departments, 
Chair.   
10 
I never saw any conflict at that level, Chair, and 
depending what the Commission is asking me, it makes it 
even 
more 
pronounced 
for 
me 
if 
these 
transactions 
happened after I have ceased being a – I was still a 
member of parliament but I had ceased any active role in 
direct oversight over the committee, Chairperson.  That is 
how I understand it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, just to be clear, Mr Smith, are 
you saying a member of parliament is entitled to sit in a 
Portfolio Committee meeting wherein issues are discussed 
20 
about serious issues of corruption, are discussed about a 
company who is – one of the directors is a friend.  You say 
that a member of parliament is not entitled – is not obliged 
to disclose that to the Portfolio Committee members? 
MR SMITH:   No, Chairperson, I – and again I could be 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 160 of 231 
 
wrong, I think that my obligation to recuse myself because 
I think that is what is being alluded to, it is only when there 
are decisions or whatever but in the broad general 
discussion, I do not under – it happens in parliament, 
Chairperson, so would it then automatically mean that 
when there is a discussion of this matter in the National 
Assembly I would have – I understood that if there were to 
be decisions taken, that I must declare and/or recuse 
myself, Chairperson. 
 
But if it was a broad discussion in a committee, I 
10 
could be wrong but I did not see the need to say by the 
way, the company you are talking about, I have friends that 
are 
directors 
or 
shareholders 
in 
that 
company, 
Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now Chair, I am going to move 
to another item.  The issue of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, the issue of BOSASA hiring a 
car or cars for your daughter, I think to be complete you 
need to – Mr Notshe, need to cover the question of was 
that a once-off thing or did it happen over a certain period 
20 
of time?  Mr Smith, do you want to just talk to that?  As far 
as you know, how often did that happen? 
MR SMITH:   It happened three times, Chairperson, and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How many times? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 161 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three times?  Oh. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I speak under correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   But I think that is what is here and it was – 
my daughter would come home twice a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SMITH:   Midyear, for them, that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, from overseas. 
MR SMITH:   And yes, midyear and end of the year. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And it happened four ten days when she was 
hear and midyear and so it was a three – there were three 
invoices, let me put it to you that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I made a note somewhere, I picked 
up either three or four occasions when in terms of the 
invoices from Blake’s Travel, which was the travel agent 
used by BOSASA and on some of the occasions the – at 
20 
least some of the occasions, I do not know if it is all of 
them, the period during which they hired a car for her was 
about a month.  I think there is one that was from 11 June, 
I think 2016, to 11 July 2016.  There was another one that 
was, I think, sometime in December, I do not know whether 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 162 of 231 
 
2016 or 2015, to January the following year.  So does that 
more or less reflect your own understanding or is that 
something you have not looked at closely in terms of how 
long the periods were? 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair, you can look at page 464, it was 
17 days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   464? 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Smith? 
MR SMITH:   464, Chair, yes, the black 464. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second?  464 you said? 
MR SMITH:   464, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SMITH:   I am just reading that one because I had 
remembered it was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, I am at 464. 
MR SMITH:   17 days, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That one is 17 days? 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think I saw one that is 17 days but 
20 
I certainly saw either one or two …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I just …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was 30 days or so. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I expedite this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 163 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   By referring to them and then we can 
just collect all of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us do that, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, turn to page 381. 
CHAIRPERSON:   381? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   381. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, ja. 
MR SMITH:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You see there, Mr Smith, is the invoice 
BT26840, it is from the 11 July 2016 to 5 August 2016.  Do 
10 
you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be about three weeks, or 
what? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About three weeks. 
MR SMITH:   Three weeks, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, about three weeks or just over three 
weeks. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is about 25 days. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and according to that invoice from 
Blake’s that seems to have cost BOSASA R7 954.08, is 
that right? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, that is the invoice, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 164 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the next invoice is on page 
385 and it is invoice BT28727 and it is from …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   18 December. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   18 December to 5 January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   18 December 2016 to 5 January 2017. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe that is another about three weeks 
as well. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   17 days. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, 17 days and that is the total of that 
invoice – that seems to have cost BOSASA R12 444.83, is 
that right? 
MR SMITH:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, take us to another one. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the following one where there 
is a small amount for a fine, on 385, was merely a fine.  
Then there is the next one, there is at page 395 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before 395 you have got 392. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh sorry, I beg your pardon, 392. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That one is for the period 11 June 2016 
to 11 July 2016.  I think that is the one I was saying was 30 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 165 of 231 
 
or 31 days, I am not sure. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see that one, Mr Smith? 
MR SMITH:   392? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 392, yes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chairperson, I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That is 30 days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that one is for about a month? 
10 
MR SMITH:   Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the amount is R9 151.98 or 93 
cents.  I think 98. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   98 cents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Is there another one? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, there is no – 295 is just an invoice 
from Avis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But it is for that invoice, 392. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I do not know what the total of 
20 
those amounts is but it should not be difficult to work it 
out, it might be about what, 20 000? 
MR SMITH:   It was about 26 000, I saw somewhere, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, about 26 000? 
MR SMITH:   I speak under correction. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 166 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   But it was about 22 000 something like that 
there, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, no, that is fine.  Yes, Mr 
Notshe, you may proceed.  But you wanted to move away 
or you have some question? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I was about to move away from 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But the record – for the record, that is 
10 
about R26 000 you did not disclose to – as a benefit. 
MR SMITH:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I want to put this also.  The thrust 
of Mr Agrizzi’s version is that from a certain time BOSASA 
was looking after you.  I am using those words, I think we 
all understand what they mean and he says in support of 
that version, he says one, initially Mr Smith was not 
entertaining us as BOSASA and yet we want to have – to 
talk to him so that from the Portfolio Committee on 
Correctional Services he could make sure that the tenders 
20 
that we were getting from Correctional Services did not 
stop.  But he was not entertaining this idea, he was not 
interested in meeting us until we had to speak to Mr Frolick 
and then Mr Frolick approached him and from a certain 
time, he changed his attitude to us. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 167 of 231 
 
 
And then he says, BOSASA paid him R45 000 a 
month or whatever the amount is, he says, that is what we 
paid him and we paid for his daughter ’s university fees and 
we hired cars for his daughter. 
 
Now if you look at the part relating to them hiring 
your – cars for your daughter for these kinds of periods 
and not charging you, one might say that does appear to 
be people who are looking after you.  What would you say 
to that? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, we canvassed the first part, I do not 
10 
which part you asked me but the first part, as I start with 
that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, the first part we have dealt 
with, I am talking more about their conduct in extending 
this benefit to you through your daughter, if there is 
anything.  You might not have anything to say. 
MR SMITH:   No, there is not anything I want to say, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Except that, Chair, if – and we can do the 
sums, I think it was R26 000 or R22 000. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   Honestly, if they were looking after me in any 
other way it would be easier to take that money and pay 
this so that there is no track record about it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 168 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   It was an honest – a run-around for my 
daughter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   You gave that to me.  If it was anything else, 
as Mr Agrizzi, they were looking after me, I would have 
used that looking after, whatever, to do it.  That is all that I 
want to say on that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now there is no 
dispute, you do not dispute this, that BOSASA installed 
10 
security cameras at your place and after there was a 
break-in.  Am I right? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you did not pay for that. 
MR SMITH:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You did not pay for that, or did you? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, when the incident happened, I had 
canvassed at least three individuals or organisations for 
quotations, one of which was Gavin company.  He made 
arrangements for Mr le Roux to come and do a site visit, 
20 
like all the others did and to return a quotation to him, 
which was done, in terms of him doing the site visit, 
Chairperson.  A few days or a week, I am not sure how the 
timeframe is, but they came to do the job.  
 
At the completion of the job I requested Mr Watson 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 169 of 231 
 
for the invoice.  Not only then, on at least three other 
occasions, Chairperson, I had asked the late Gavin Watson 
to provide me with the invoice because this job had been 
done.  So it was not that it was a freebie, I had requested 
for an invoice from Gavin Watson which was never 
forthcoming, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And by that time, you knew – you 
knew, when you asked for this service that this was a 
company that had been involved in – alleged to be involved 
in corruption and which issue had been brought before the 
10 
Portfolio Committees, am I right? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, you are correct and I will – and please 
forgive me, Chairperson, and maybe if I am wrong, you 
indicate it immediately so that I do not return to it, 
Chairperson.  When this incident happened, I was no 
longer active in the committee.  I had no ways of benefiting 
the company even if I wanted to, Chairperson.  And 
therefore, I did not see it – I did not see it as any risk from 
a conflict point of view, Chairperson, because I had no 
direct oversight over the company …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Not over the company. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, at a parliamentary level, Chairperson.  
And even if there was, my contention is the separation of 
powers does not allow MPs – there could be a conflict of 
interest because it is in the committee you are working 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 170 of 231 
 
with.   
But, Chairperson, there was no ways that any 
member of parliament could influence it because then it 
means anything that comes to the National Assembly, MPs 
would be reluctant to do it because you might be doing – 
and I am being maybe facetious about the whole thing, 
Chair – if you want to go to the bank do you worry that the 
bank, because you do business with it?   
So, in my case my reasoning was I have no direct 
responsibility where I can influence it one way or the other. 
10 
Secondly, the separation of powers does not even 
allow it even if you have direct responsibility. 
So there was never an intention that I am doing this 
for you because in return you will do that for me.  That was 
never ever on the table, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course one could have a situation 
where a company that wants to engage in corruption and 
benefit from corruption in a government department, for 
example, where such a company could have certain people 
both inside the relevant department or outside, which could 
20 
include parliament, for argument’s sake, where they would 
say look, do this for us to make sure we continue these 
benefits, this is where we think you fit in, you know, and 
we will look after you.   
Maybe we will not look after you now because it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 171 of 231 
 
might be difficult but we will look after you after you have 
left here.  Theoretically that is possible. 
Or they might say, we will give you something now 
but even after you have left, we will continue.   
In this regard I make one example.  The evidence 
that I have heard in regard to BOSASA and the Department 
of Correctional Services includes evidence from Mr Agrizzi 
that says Mr Gillingham was working for the Department of 
Correctional Services.   
They talked to him and for a long time while he was 
10 
an official of the Department of Correctional Services, he 
was working with them to make sure that they got certain 
contracts and so on and so on. 
When 
he 
left 
the 
Department 
of 
Correctional 
Services they continued to look after him, even when 
therefore he could do nothing for them anymore.  Actually, 
if I remember correctly, the evidence from Mr Agrizzi is that 
when you left the Department of Correctional Services they 
were paying him a certain amount per month but after he 
had left he said you see now, now that I have left, you 
20 
people have got to increase the amount in order for me to, 
I think, get effectively what I was getting before I left.  And 
according to Mr Agrizzi, when he left BOSASA they were 
continuing to make that payment. 
So I am just saying theoretically you could have 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 172 of 231 
 
that situation.  You understand that? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I accept that theoretically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might not have applied in your 
situation but theoretically. 
MR SMITH:   Absolutely, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And when this in the newspaper got 
wind of these payments to you, why did you deny that the 
security features like CCTVs were installed by BOSASA at 
your home? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, Mr Notshe, it is better that we 
refer to these newspapers first.  I think you are referring to 
page 346. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   356, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 346, Mr Smith.  Have you got that?  
Have got page 346?  It has got your picture and there is 
somebody else next to you.  Have you got page, 346? 
MR SMITH:   Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.  I am sorry, yes, I 
am there.  I beg your pardon, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Now that – I do not know from 
20 
which newspaper that is but it says opinion there and at 
the top it reads – must read, then it says: 
“Vincent Smith’s response to BOSASA payment 
claims is dated 4 September 2018.” 
Then it has got your picture and somebody else next to you 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 173 of 231 
 
and below your picture it says: 
“Vincent Smith says he borrowed me at least 
R600 000 to pay his daughter ’s tuition fees.” 
And then below that it says: 
“ANC 
NPM 
co-chairperson 
for 
parliament’s 
Constitutional Review Committee, Vincent Smith, 
responds to allegations that he was irregularly paid 
R670 000 by facilities management group BOSASA 
over the past three years.” 
Then it says: 
10 
“In the light of the allegations that were made in the 
media over the past weekend I have since consulted 
with the leadership of the ANC in caucus.  We are 
all in agreement that I am obliged to respond.  I 
confirm having entered into an agreement for a 
personal loan with Mr A Agrizzi which is repayable 
by me.  This loan was processed to me in two 
separate payments, an amount of R220 000 in 2015 
and R395 000 in 2016.  The loan was for the 
university tuition fees of my daughter in year one 
20 
(2015) and year two (2016).” 
Then the next paragraph and that is the one I think Mr 
Notshe was talking about. 
“I 
deny 
any 
further 
assistance, 
financial 
or 
otherwise, 
including 
the 
installation 
of 
CCTV 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 174 of 231 
 
cameras at my home from him or any other person 
or company.  The cameras that are at my home 
were paid for by myself.” 
Do you know what newspaper that is or what publication 
that is? 
MR SMITH:   No, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you see this publication at 
some stage in 2018? 
MR SMITH:   Did I see this publication? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2018, this article? 
10 
MR SMITH:   I do not recall, Chair, but I could have seen 
it, I do not recall, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  What do you have to say 
about the content of what I have just read? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, this report apparently was in – 
the date there is 20 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Smith, 
actually it continues in the following page.  I did not realise 
that.   
“My sole directorship of Euro Blitz 48, a company 
20 
through which the loan was processed, is fully 
declared in the register of members’ interest and 
this has been the basis the acquisition of the 
company.  I am in total support of being held 
accountable 
and 
I 
therefore 
welcome 
any 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 175 of 231 
 
investigation to my personal loan transaction.  I will 
fully participate the parliament process led by the 
ethics committee, a process which I have no doubt 
will absolve me completely.  I am also going to 
present myself to the ANC Integrity Commission at 
their earliest convenience in the interest of being 
held accountable by my own organisation.” 
And then it continues.  And it says: 
“This is the unedited text of the statement released 
by the ANC on behalf of Vincent Smith.” 
10 
Do you want to comment on this statement or article? 
MR SMITH:   Indeed, Chair, I am saying if we went – if we 
started with page 2, for instance, that all happened, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It all happened. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I am saying page 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   That I am a sole director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I voluntarily stepped down and so on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   Everything on page 1 I also agree to, Chair.  
That last statement, the last paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on page 346. 
MR SMITH:   On page 1, what I am calling page 1. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 176 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 346. 
MR SMITH:   On 346, I beg your pardon, that is what I 
should say, Chairperson.  In 2018 and even as I speak 
today, the CCTV equipment is equipment that I had 
installed and paid for, Chairperson.  Yes, that is my 
understanding from that.  In 2018 it was equipment that I 
had installed. 
 
Now to the long – maybe have a fight about it, if 
you read it there it says: 
“I deny the installation of cameras at my home.” 
10 
I mean, if I am paraphrasing that one there, Chair, that last 
line, yes. 
“I deny installations at my home.” 
There were indeed installations at my home initially, as I 
indicated, which after a while I have asked them to remove 
and 
I 
put 
my 
own 
cameras 
which 
are 
there 
now, 
Chairperson.  That is the state of affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the ones that you admit as having 
been installed by BOSASA, when were they installed? 
MR SMITH:   They were installed at the time of the break-
20 
in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2014. 
MR SMITH:   Around about 2014, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2014.  But you say they were taken out 
at some stage? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 177 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When was that?  2018? 
MR SMITH:   2017, I think the end of 2017, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   End of 2017. 
MR SMITH:   2017, 2018, around about there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and they put in ones that you bought 
for yourself. 
MR SMITH:   Those had become very unreliable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   They were, in my words, become obsolete. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I had been asking Mr Watson to invoice me 
for a long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And when it became clear that I needed to 
upgrade, even of those upgrades I asked them to remove 
their stuff and I put superior, if you could put it, that 
equipment, yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And that was in 2018. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The removal was in 2017. 
MR SMITH:   I think it was the end of 2017 beginning of 
2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But why did you not just come upfront 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 178 of 231 
 
and say there were cameras installed by BOSASA but I had 
them removed?  Why did you not say that in this 
statement? 
MR SMITH:   Perhaps I should have said that, Chairperson, 
I have no answer to that.  I am saying perhaps I should 
have said that there, but at the time when I made this 
statement, they were my ones, I could have said I initially 
had that and I put those ones in.  Yes, I cannot dispute 
that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, when were the – just be 
10 
careful about this, please be careful. 
MR SMITH:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Was it these – were the cameras not 
removed in October 2018 from your place? 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair, they were not.  They were not, I 
mean, I do not have the date but it was – they would not 
have been removed in October 2018 because I had my own 
cameras installed in 2018 for which I have invoices and 
proof of payments.  So they were not removed in October 
2018, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Were these cameras at your place, the 
ones installed by BOSASA, not removed after this article 
appeared? 
MR SMITH:   No, they were not. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Alright, turn to page 342. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 179 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before he does so.  Mr Smith, 
you know, this statement at the end of that paragraph, last 
paragraph of page 346 of the article. 
MR SMITH:   Oh, I beg your pardon, yes, I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what you call the first page of the 
article. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that denial, one must look at it in the 
context of why you issued the statement, is that right?  As 
I understand it, you were responding, according to the 
10 
document, to the allegations made by Mr Agrizzi. 
MR SMITH:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Mr Agrizzi – two of the allegations 
that Mr Agrizzi had made against you were that: 
1. BOSASA had paid for your daughter ’s tuition fees. 
2. BOSASA had installed CCTV cameras at your home. 
Alright.  Now, in response to those allegations, you admit 
that – well, at least you say that Mr Agrizzi and yourself 
20 
had a loan agreement in terms of which Mr Agrizzi made 
certain 
payments 
to 
you 
which 
you 
used 
for 
your 
daughter ’s tuition.  Yes, that is the version you put up. 
 
And then with regard to the other allegation, namely 
Mr Agrizzi’s allegation that BOSASA also installed CCTV 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 180 of 231 
 
cameras in your home, you addressed that by saying I deny 
any further assistance, financial or otherwise including the 
installation of CCTV cameras at my home from him or any 
other person or company.  The cameras that are at my 
home were paid for by myself. 
That last sentence may be factually correct, may 
have been correct at that time but remember you are 
responding 
to 
specific 
allegations 
and 
one 
of 
the 
allegations is BOSASA installed CCTV cameras in your 
home. 
10 
 
So if you then make a sentence, a denial like this it 
must mean you are saying the only that Agrizzi did, the 
only thing that I know is the money which was the subject 
of the loan.  Any other thing, including the installation of 
CCTV cameras that Mr Agrizzi is talking about is not true.  
That is how I understand that if I look at the context.  It 
may have been different if you were talking just in general 
and saying well Mr Agrizzi and I had this loan agreement 
and then you say as for my situation at home I paid for my 
own CCTV cameras without responding to any allegations, 
20 
one could understand that but where you are responding to 
a specific allegation about BOSASA having installed CCTV 
cameras in your home it’s difficult to say you were not 
denying that in this statement, what do you say?  Because 
you are responding to specific allegations you’re not just 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 181 of 231 
 
talking in general, if you meant to admit – if you meant to 
say the cameras that are in my house right now were paid 
for by myself but you did not intend to deny allegations by 
Mr BOSASA – by Mr Agrizzi that BOSASA had installed 
CCTV cameras in your house, one would expect you to say, 
I admit, that indeed, BOSASA did, sometime back install 
CCTV cameras in my house, these were the circumstances 
under which it happened, I asked Mr Agrizzi for or Mr 
Gavin Watson or whoever for an invoice, two times, three 
times they never gave it to me but as we speak now, those 
10 
were removed and the ones that are in my house were paid 
for by myself, that is what one would expect if the intention 
was not to deny what Mr Agrizzi had said, what do you say 
to that? 
MR SMITH:   It’s very difficult at this point, Chairperson, 
what you are saying makes sense, let me put it to you that 
way, that what you are saying makes sense, Chairperson, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright thank you.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Smith, I’m referring you to 
20 
page 342, are you there Mr Smith? 
MR SMITH:   I beg your pardon, I’m sorry I am there 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: I’m terribly sorry Mr Notshe and Mr Smith, 
I’m going to take you back to something that we dealt with 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 182 of 231 
 
a long time ago because there’s a question that I should 
have asked and I keep on forgetting it and I don’t want to 
forget it and I’ll remember only tomorrow.  Please don’t 
move away from the page where you are.  I wanted to say 
to you, Mr Smith, it seems strange to me, I’m going back to 
the log of Mr Agrizzi, it seems strange to me that when you 
needed a loan, on your version, you went to Mr Agrizzi and 
not to Mr Gavin Watson, whom you had known for a long 
time even before you went to Parliament and the person 
that you would have known as, effectively Mr Agrizzi’s 
10 
employer, you know, because he was the top person at 
BOSASA, so I wondered why you didn’t go to Mr Watson, 
somebody that you had known for a long time, you went to 
this person that you had known as long as that, as Mr 
Watson and somebody, who maybe, could be thought was 
likely to have more money than his employee, Mr Agrizzi, 
do you want to say something on that?  
MR SMITH:   Chair, I tried to contextualise it earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   That at that period of 2015, we had a 
20 
relationship ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Agrizzi and yourself? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, by virtue of assisting the son getting a 
job and assisting my son and so on and it was, I guess, in 
that period that I just raised it with him.  It was nothing 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 183 of 231 
 
planned or unplanned, I guess if Mr Gavin Watson was in 
the – at the time, I would have asked him probably and 
anybody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja okay.  Sorry Mr Notshe I 
disturbed you in your plan, you can go back to your plan 
now. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look, just taking you to that page 
there is a photograph…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is 342? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  342 Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I’m sure you have seen this photograph 
a number of times.  
MR SMITH:   I have. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And this is a photograph at your home. 
MR SMITH:   That’s correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I’m told this is a photograph of 
technicians taking down the cameras that had been 
installed by BOSASA, correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should start by asking the 
20 
question – prior question, who removed the BOSASA CCTV 
cameras in 2017 or beginning of 2018 because you said 
they were removed in 2017 or early 2018, who did the 
actual 
removing 
and 
where 
were 
they 
taken, 
what 
happened to them? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 184 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair, I don’t know who did the actual 
removal, I had requested Gavin Watson to remove them, 
Chairperson, so the individuals who did them – I’m not 
even sure if I was at home at the time, to be quite honest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no that’s fine okay but at 
least, I think from what you say, whoever removed them, 
you expected that there would have been instructed by Mr 
Gavin Watson to do so or by somebody instructed by Mr 
Gavin Watson? 
MR SMITH:   Correct, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright, Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the date and time there on the 
screens, on the two screens, do you see that?  
MR SMITH:   I do Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What are the dates that are shown 
there? 
MR SMITH:   1 s t of October 2018 and the second one, I 
think was also the 1 s t of October or the 6 t h of October 
2018. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And it seems as if, on this screen, they 
20 
were removed in October 2018? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson these are screenshots of – I 
don’t know where they came from.  I am saying to the 
Commission that I put my cameras in prior to these, I’ve 
got proof of payment thereof and the invoice thereof.  Now 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 185 of 231 
 
I am seeing this here now, Chairperson and I’m not 
suggesting anything else but I can prove that mine were 
installed and it’s not inconceivable that the dates and 
times on the recorder could not be in sync, it’s not 
inconceivable Chairperson.  In fact, and I again speak 
under correction, there was a News24 video, I think, round 
about this time that exposed me – my security by showing 
it and I think that one also indicates the date of January 
Chairperson so, is this accurate, is this doctored, it’s a 
black and white picture.  I want to say to the Commission 
10 
those cameras were removed in 2017/2018 Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And Chair, to add to what Mr Smith is 
saying, there is – actually I had not verified it properly 
because the camera’s also have this tendency of using the 
American way of date, starting with the month and then, so 
it could be the 10 t h of January in all fairness it could be the 
10 t h of January and I wouldn’t  want Mr Smith to commit 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   On this one, in fairness to him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Doesn’t Mr Le Roux say something about 
when they are removed? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He says, they were removed, it doesn’t 
give…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He doesn’t say when. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 186 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes all he does recognise is the 
people and the cars that they were BOSASA cars and 
BOSASA person but …[indistinct] doesn’t deal with the 
times of – dates of removal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But it would be unfair to push Mr Smith 
to comment on – when there’s a possibility that it could be 
10 January or…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, let’s move on to the affidavit 
10 
of – the latest affidavit of Mr Agrizzi.  In it, Mr Agrizzi’s 
attached some SMS messages, can you go to page 460. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   460, Chair. 
MR SMITH:   I am there Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, Mr Agrizzi attaches 
these…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second – yes continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Smith, before we deal with this, the 
context in which they are attached here, if you read the 
20 
affidavit of Mr Agrizzi, he demonstrate to the Commission, 
he says, you continued to assist them.  Now the first one is 
on 460 and then says Gavin Watson and then says, 27 
August 2016, do you see that. 
MR SMITH:   I do Chair. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 187 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It says, 
“No further payments were needed, we need to have 
a meeting before we get too involved and embroiled 
in the fight with the EFF, this is going to be ugly.  
Nomvula is being sucked in as well with the funders 
which could backfire on us…[indistinct 2.18.47] has 
also confirmed this, God bless”, 
 
This is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is this, is this a SMS, is it a 
WhatsApp message? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This is a SMS, Mr Agrizzi referred to it 
on page – let me check now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Mr Gavin Watson sending it to Mr 
Agrizzi?  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just a minute, Chair, I’m just going to 
– and on page 347 Chair, Mr Agrizzi deals with it, he 
says,…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja just say what he says. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   On 12.7 he says, 
“Vincent Smith, was knowingly, fully assisting the 
20 
late Gavin Watson and BOSASA and was in contact 
with the design makers and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I’m sorry Mr Notshe, I think Mr 
Smith needs to see that and he couldn’t find it, just let’s 
wait for him to find the page. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 188 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   437. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I’m at 460, I thought you said 460? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, he has found 460 but he’s looking 
for what I’m reading, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, 437, okay. 
 
MR SMITH:   437? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   437 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Agrizzi’s affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Affidavit yes. 
10 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I’m there Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And at 12.7 he says..[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe you can just read again, Mr 
Notshe, now that Mr Smith has found the page. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He says at 12.7, 
“Vincent Smith was knowingly, fully assisting the 
late Gavin Watson and BOSASA and was in contact 
with 
the 
design 
makers 
and 
people 
at 
DCS.  
Annexure of messages are attached as AG1”, 
 
Then AG1 is on 460, it starts from 460. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you want to read 461 – or 460. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   460, is a message it says – on the 27 t h 
of August 2016, it says, 
“No further payments, we need to have a meeting 
with them before we get too involved and embroiled 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 189 of 231 
 
in their fight with the EFF, this is going to be ugly.  
Nomvula is being sucked in as one of the funders 
which 
could 
backfire 
on 
us, 
Clove 
has 
also 
confirmed this, God Bless”, 
 
Do you know of this? 
MR SMITH:   No I have no clue what’s happening here 
Chairperson, I don’t know what reference this has to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
 
And 
then 
over 
the 
page 
at 
461…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think, what you need to say, Mr – 
okay I think Mr Agrizzi puts up this message as support for 
what he says in his affidavit and what he says, is that as at 
this time, we’re talking August 2016, he says Mr Smith was 
knowingly assisting Mr Gavin Watson, you know, what he 
says at 437 and he puts up this message as showing what 
was being discussed between himself and Mr Gavin Watson 
and I think he seeks to say, when you read what is said in 
this message, it’s connected with Mr Smith being involved.  
So, you might wish to comment on that, whether this 
20 
message supports that or not, as you understand it. 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson page 460 makes no reference to 
me, Chairperson yes and I’m indicating to you that I’m not 
aware what this was about, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 190 of 231 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, that’s fine, let’s go over the page, 
now Mr Smith, when I read this, bear in mind what the 
Chair has put to you, that Mr Agrizzi tried to show that you 
are working with them, now he says – it seems as if this is 
from Gavin…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is from Gavin Watson to Mr Agrizzi 
as well? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, it says,…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   AG1.2? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   AG 1.2, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 461, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It says, 
“Vincent Smith just got hold of me, he says let’s 
wait until Tuesday because he is having a meeting 
tomorrow with ZM and Sal Burger, God bless”, 
 
And then Agrizzi says, 
“He called me as well, what he said was to continue 
the 
prep 
meetings, 
drafting 
documents 
we’ll 
convene on Tuesday at 14h00 the review our 
approach 
and 
adjust 
the 
[indistinct 
2.23.56] 
20 
approach but he didn’t say we should halt it, then 
he says, tried to call you on WhatsApp”, 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SMITH:   I do see that Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now your name is mentioned and as 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 191 of 231 
 
Chair was putting to you, Agrizzi is trying to prove that you 
were still working with them, they’re talking about you. 
MR 
SMITH: 
 
 
I’m 
sorry 
Chair, 
I 
never 
heard 
the 
question…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the question is, Mr Agrizzi is putting 
up this message to support his version or statement that in 
2016 you were still assisting them and he used the word, 
knowingly assisting Mr Gavin Watson, and then he’s 
putting up this message, it’s a conversation between 
himself and Mr Gavin Watson but it’s a conversation about 
10 
you and them.  So, you need to be able to say, what you 
have to say about Mr Agrizzi saying, one, in 2016 you were 
knowingly assisting Mr Gavin Watson and saying this 
message supports what he’s saying, that you were working 
with them on something.   
MR SMITH:   First of all, I note my name here Chairperson 
it’s a conversation between Gavin and Agrizzi.  In response 
to your question, at that time I was no longer the 
Chairperson of Correctional Services.  The Chairperson of 
Correctional Services, as I indicated earlier, I think, was 
20 
my senior.  I would never, undermine my senior by going to 
work with officials in a Department where Mr – where I’m 
not the Chairperson.  I don’t – not I don’t understand, I 
understand what they’re trying to say here Chairperson but 
I’m not privy here to what they were discussing here 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 192 of 231 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that stage, how was your relationship 
with Mr Agrizzi, how was your relationship with Mr Gavin 
Watson, 2016? 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr relationship with Mr Watson was 
consistent until his untimely passing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it was fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr – with Mr Agrizzi, at that time, it 
10 
probably was fine Chairperson, I think that only after the 
2018 that I took a decision not to but 2016 there had been 
no reason so it had been as we had been operating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As before. 
MR SMITH:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also, with Mr Agrizzi, your relationship 
was fine? 
MR SMITH:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  Now, they make a reference 
there – or Mr Gavin Watson makes a reference in his 
20 
message to Mr Agrizzi to ZM, do you have any idea who ZM 
may have been? 
MR SMITH:   I don’t know who they are referring to Chair, 
but if I had to speculate, I would assume that ZM would 
have been the National Commissioner at the time, Mr 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 193 of 231 
 
Modise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Modise? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, but I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s what comes to my mind as well 
but they don’t put a full name. 
MR SMITH:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Smal – or Smalberger do you 
have…[intervenes]. 
MR SMITH:   Smalberger is a Senior Manager, I think, in 
the Department, I’m not sure what his responsibility is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, what Mr Gavin Watson says is 
that, one, you got hold of him, you called him, you said 
they must wait until Tuesday because you were going to 
have a meeting the following day with ZM and Smalberger  
If ZM referred to Mr Modise who was the Commissioner of 
Correctional Services at the time, and if Smalberger 
referred to Mr Smalberger who was also in Correctional 
services at the time, it would appear that what they were 
saying is, what Mr Gavin Watson was saying was, you said 
there was something that, either you were working on with 
20 
them or they were working on which you said they must 
hold on because the following day you were going to have 
a meeting with ZM and Sal Burger, that’s the gist of the 
message, you accept that, that’s what it says? 
MR SMITH:   I’m accepting that, that’s what the message is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 194 of 231 
 
saying Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, alright and then Mr Agrizzi, in 
response to Mr Gavin Watson, says, 
“He called me as well, what he said was to continue 
the prep meetings, drafting documents, we will 
convene on Tuesday at 14h00 then review our 
approach and adjust the three-pronged approach 
but he didn’t say we should halt it”, 
 
Now it seems to me that what – if, indeed, you had 
called Mr Agrizzi, and if indeed you had said what he says 
10 
you said, then what you said to him was that they must 
continue with preparations for meeting and they must 
continue with drafting documents and then there would be 
a review of an approach and a three-pronged approach 
would be adopted.  If that is true, it does seem to reflect 
that you were working on something with them, would you 
accept that as a fair understanding of this, if it is true? 
MR SMITH:   If it is true, it’s a fair understanding, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SMITH:   But I can…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you maintain you know nothing 
about it? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chairperson, I know nothing about it and 
I’ve…[intervenes]. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 195 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are you able to say, in 2016 there 
was nothing you were working with them, on or are you 
saying – or are you able to say, there was something we 
were working on, I’m not sure if they’re talking about it but 
this is what we were working on – that I was working on, 
with them? 
MR SMITH:   Chairperson, in 2016 there was nothing that I 
could have been working with them on.  As I indicated, the 
Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee was somebody 
else.  Unless there’s context given to this, the realities is, 
10 
I’ve seen this thing this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it doesn’t seem to …[intervenes]. 
MR SMITH:   It doesn’t resonate with me, Chairperson, no, 
what exactly are they talking about here and what is it that 
– I can also indicate to you that I don’t recall ever meeting 
with Mr Modise and Mr Smalberger in 2016, I don’t know 
why they would come to me when they have a Chairperson, 
I don’t know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us say, maybe, whatever it is 
they were talking about, or let me put it this way could 
20 
there have been something that you may have been 
working with them on, that may have nothing to do with the 
Portfolio Committee in Correctional Services, is there 
anything that you may have been working with them on that 
might not be what they’re talking about or is the position 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 196 of 231 
 
that, for all intents and purposes, really, you were out of 
the Correctional Services Committee and you had nothing 
to work with them on or could there have been personal 
matters that you were dealing with, with them at a personal 
level? 
MR SMITH:   Chair, reading this it refers to current, at the 
time, officials in the Department.  So, I can’t see me 
working on matters outside of that, it’s just my reading of it 
Chair, to answer your question, could it be something else, 
no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In fact, Mr Smith, that SMS goes over 
and continues on page 463, go to 463. 
MR SMITH:   I am there, Chair, I’m sorry I am there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The it says – remember in 461 Mr 
Agrizzi tried to call you on WhatsApp then over 463, he 
says, 
“I 
agree 
it’s 
a 
three-pronged 
approach, 
our 
approach, Vincent’s approach, Cedric’s approach.  
It is for meeting for Tuesday to give us more 
20 
information how to approach this thing, this is why 
he is having a meeting with Smalberger to give us 
more information on what’s taking place at DCS”, 
 
And Mr Watson says, 
 
“Okay understood but by 8h30 I need – sorry 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 197 of 231 
 
Agrizzi, okay understood but by 8h30 I need 
confirmed drafting papers otherwise we miss the 
deadline, I will send you and explanatory”. 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SMITH:   I do see it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well this part seems, when one reads it 
at page 463, seems to emphasize that they were certainly 
working on something and whatever it is that they were 
working 
on, 
it 
was 
connected 
with 
DCS 
which 
is 
Department of Correctional Services and Mr Smalberger 
10 
had something to do with it and according to them, you – I 
mean I take it the reference to Vincent, is a reference to 
you because they’ve referred to Vincent Smith and then 
they’ve also referred to Cedric.  They have not, on these 
messages, indicated the surname of this Cedric that they 
are referring to but they are saying, Vincent’s approach 
and Cedric’s approach, they talk about that approach.  So, 
it appears that, certainly they’re talking to each other 
about 
something 
that 
relates 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Correctional Services and they seem to reflect that you 
20 
have an input on whatever it is they were discussing, 
would that be a fair understanding? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That would be a fair interpretation of 
what the text says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the text says? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 198 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:   Yes, it’s a fair interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
MR SMITH:   May I? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes sure. 
MR SMITH:   This was reflected in, I think, Mr Agrizzi’s 
first affidavit or one of those and in that one it’s very clear 
that he talks about Cedric Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
MR SMITH:   On reading it the first time, I approach 
Cedrick Frolick to say, this is what I’m reading here 
10 
because I think he said, he spoke to Cedric and Cedric 
said something to him, something to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And I asked Mr Frolick, Cedric Frolick, what 
does this refer to, Cedric denies any of these things, that 
he never or he is not aware of what is being said here.  I, 
certainly, was not party to any planning with Cedric Frolick, 
I don’t understand how would I. In 2016, Cedric Frolick, I 
think, was definitely Chair of Chairs, I was not in that 
department so there would be a need for context in this 
20 
thing, if any Chairperson, but I, as I’m standing here has 
said to you, I approached Mr Frolick on this matter, he 
denies having spoken to Mr Agrizzi so that, or saying to Mr 
Agrizzi I’ll talk to Vincent or I’ve discussed it with Vincent 
or whatever the case may be.  What is the context, he 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 199 of 231 
 
didn’t understand, the context? So from my side I didn’t 
follow it up any further, I certainly didn’t meet with Mr 
Smalberger and with Mr Modise at any point in 2016 to 
discuss 
matters 
of 
DCS 
because 
it 
would 
just 
be 
undermining the Chairperson, the current – the incumbent 
at the time, Chairperson because I would assume some 
point or the other he would have got wind that I’m talking 
to his departments or to officials of his departments and I 
would not undermine the Chairperson in that fashion. So, 
my plea is, I received last night, though this morning.  If it 
10 
is at all possible for somebody to elaborate on it, I’m 
prepared to respond in writing that says, this is the context 
but I think at this point, my answer is I don’t know what 
they’re talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s fine.  I think after today if 
– well, one it may be necessary to call Mr Agrizzi so that 
he can clarify the context of this and you should be able to 
get an opportunity to react to it, to react to Mr Agrizzi’s 
evidence after he has given context and either by coming 
back for a short time to put your side of the story as you 
20 
understand it after the context has been given or by putting 
up an affidavit to say, I’ve heard what Mr Agrizzi says 
about this, this is what I have to say about it.  The one 
thing which may need to be borne in mind is that, as I 
understand the position from Mr Agrizzi’s evidence at this 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 200 of 231 
 
time in 2016 or during 2016 Mr Agrizzi is still working at 
BOSASA, Mr Gavin Watson is his boss and I think they 
were in good terms, you know and from what you have said 
your relationship with each one of them had no problems.  
They are not writing something to give to a third party, 
they’re talking between themselves as the CEO and COO 
of BOSASA, I think and they’re talking about – they seem 
to be talking about something that they’re working on and 
then they mention your name, they mention somebody 
called Cedric, maybe that is Mr Cedric Frolick but Mr 
10 
Agrizzi might have to come and just give more context but 
at that stage the relationship between the two of them, that 
is Mr Gavin Watson and Mr Agrizzi seems to have been 
fine in their relationship individually and collectively with 
you seems to have been fine as well. 
MR SMITH:   May I just say one thing? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I agree Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine. 
MR SMITH:  I would have, and I don’t, like I say, I don’t 
20 
understand what’s happening here but my relationship with 
Mr Gavin Watson is such, that I’m sure that he would have 
either copied me or there would have been something that 
said, I said that, John said that, Vincent said that, that’s all 
that I’m saying, Chairperson. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 201 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s fine and feel free, if you 
want to investigate these messages, you know, to do that 
as well because as you say you are not copied, you don’t 
know anything.  So, I’m simply emphasising that it’s 
important to hear, fully your side about it, so when you do 
respond after Mr Agrizzi has given context, feel free to 
look into it fully.  
MR SMITH:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Also – but are you saying, despite the 
10 
fact that you just got this now and you don’t know this you 
never had – in 2016/2017 you never had any interaction 
with Mr Modise or Smalberger? 
MR SMITH:   No, what I’m saying is, that I never had a 
meeting, now the reality, Chair is, because I don’t want to 
be caught in a trap.  When you travel to Cape Town on a 
Monday and there are officials going, chances are you will 
bump into them or even yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   When you travel on Tuesdays so – if I say to 
20 
the Commission, I never had any contact and somebody 
locates me in the airport with them, I would have fallen 
foul, so I’m saying in relation to this matter…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t remember. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chairperson, so not that I never had any 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 202 of 231 
 
relationship with – or bumped into them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Contact ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you are saying, according to this 
you had planned to meet them on Tuesday and you are 
saying…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he’s not saying that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, no I’m saying the message. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no but you are saying he is saying. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh, sorry, according to the – no 
according to this message the message seems as if to say 
10 
that you are going to meet them on Tuesday, am I right? 
MR SMITH:   According to the message, that’s correct 
Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you say to the Commission now, 
you never had plans and you never met Mr Modise or 
Smalberger, you had never planned to meet them on a 
Tuesday. 
MR SMITH:   No Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he says, he can’t remember 
whether he had any contact with them but certainly he had 
20 
no contact with them in regard to this matter, am I right? 
MR SMITH:   That’s what I’m saying Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   And also, if I may, Chairperson, if this 
document had dates on it, that’s why it’s important to get 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 203 of 231 
 
the context because it says Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Which Tuesday are we talking about, if it 
gave us a date, it’s also easy to indicate to you Chair, that 
on Tuesday the 18 I was in Cape Town or – all I’m asking 
for is that if this could be elaborated upon for me to give 
an intelligent answer.  As it stands here, which Tuesday 
are they talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fair enough ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No it’s – I concede it’s fair to get more 
10 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair on that I do not have any further 
questions for the witness.  What is left for me to do is to 
put together – go back and look at the individual Exhibits 
and then approach you, either here or in chambers and 
then deal with those individuals if – on those Exhibits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that’s fine.  So, you have no 
further questions? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I have no further questions for the 
20 
witness, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going to seek re-examination?  
Yes, okay alright, how long do you think you might be? 
ADV PHALANE:   Ten, fifteen minutes at the most Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe we could take a short break 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 204 of 231 
 
and then come back, of ten minutes, then I’ll give you time 
to re-examine.  We adjourn now we’ll resume at five past 
five, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV PHALANE:  Mr Smith has requested an indulgence that 
at the end of my question if he can perhaps address you for 
about three minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – that… 
ADV PHALANE:  Just in terms of summing up how he 
10 
understands his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV PHALANE:  Okay Mr Smith if I can refer you to page 
106 of the bundle being referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  106? 
ADV PHALANE:  106 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHALANE:  Are you there? 
MR SMITH:  I am there Chair. 
ADV PHALANE:  You will see there in paragraph 134 of your 
20 
affidavit 
you 
speak 
about 
your 
understanding 
of 
the 
commission’s Terms of Reference and what I want to ask you 
is, in the context of the Term of Reference of the commission 
did you at any point facilitate any unlawful awarding of 
tenders whether it is BOSASA or any other entity? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 205 of 231 
 
MR SMITH:  Sorry Chair I am not – I did not get which 
paragraph you talking about. 
ADV PHALANE:  Oh sorry paragraph 13. 
MR SMITH:  13 
ADV PHALANE:  On page 106 you are in? 
MR SMITH:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV PHALANE:  So paragraph 13 you will see there there is 
a in bold TOR1.4 which refers to Term of Reference 104 of 
the commission’s Terms of Reference, do you see that? 
MR SMITH:  Yes I do Chair. 
10 
ADV PHALANE:  Now I do not want to read the entire 
paragraph.  In bold there is a – there are words that read: 
“By facilitating the unlawful awarding of tenders.” 
Do you see that? 
MR SMITH:  I do Chair. 
ADV PHALANE:  Now what I am asking you is, during your 
tenure as a Member of Parliament have you facilitated any 
unlawful awarding of tenders? 
MR SMITH:  The answer Chairperson is no.  I have not even 
going through my own evidence seen any allegations to that 
20 
effect.  The second point that I want to make just on that one 
is a – had said earlier on.  I do not believe that a Portfolio 
Committee 
or 
a 
Member 
of 
Parliament 
taking 
into 
consideration the separation of powers would be able to 
meddle in the adjudication and awarding of tenders.  So I 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 206 of 231 
 
have not facilitated any unlawful awarding of tenders Chair. 
ADV PHALANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess you would say you have not 
facilitated even lawful tenders. 
MR SMITH:  I have never any tenders lawful or unlawful 
Chairperson. 
ADV PHALANE:  If you – if you then go overleaf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – before – before you go to your next 
question.  The – the reference – your reference to the 
separation of powers is good if you are dealing with 
10 
somebody who does not intend to do anything wrong.  But if 
somebody intends to do wrong – intends to facilitate 
corruption they would not bother about the separation of 
powers, would they? 
MR SMITH:  They would not I agree Chair they would find 
means and ways of getting around these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV PHALANE:  Okay if you can then go overleaf to page 
107. 
MR SMITH:  I am there Chair. 
20 
ADV PHALANE:  The very first paragraph on the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV PHALANE:  107 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHALANE:  You will see one of the matters the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 207 of 231 
 
commission is to determine whether any Member of the 
National Executive [including the President] Public Official, 
well close brackets.  Then Public Official, Functionary of any 
organ of state influence the awarding of tenders to benefit 
themselves, their families or entities in which they held 
personal interest.  The question to you Mr Smith is, have you 
played any role in influencing the awarding of tenders to 
benefit yourself, your family members or entities for personal 
interest? 
MR SMITH:  No Chair I played no role in the awarding of 
10 
tenders legal or illegal Chair. 
ADV PHALANE:  Okay.  Then you were referred to various 
minutes of the Portfolio Committee that you chaired spanning 
the years 2009 to 2013.  Mr Agrizzi’s testimony in essence 
suggested that prior to 2013 – sorry 2011 you were very 
opposed to BOSASA and following a meeting that took place 
in Rivonia which you have admitted to having attended your 
stance on BOSASA softened.  Now having considered the 
minutes although they arrived late yesterday have you found 
anything that remotely suggests that there is a change in 
20 
tone in how you applied yourself as the Chairperson of the 
Portfolio Committee? 
MR SMITH:  Chair I think the first point that I want to make 
so that it is very clear is that neither for me as an individual 
or the committee were anti BOSASA.  What we strongly 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 208 of 231 
 
objected to was the practice of outsourcing services whether 
it was BOSASA or whether it was anybody else.  So that is 
what we were anti Chair.  And that stance of being anti-
outsourcing started when I was first elected Chairperson in 
2009 and it continued until the very last day that I was a 
Chairperson.  And the minutes as Counsel is alluding to 
illustrates that very clearly that there was no all of a sudden 
after 2011 a softening because that was the allegation that 
mine was to make sure that the committee ensure that there 
was no negative publicity for want of a better word.  Because 
10 
that negative publicity would make it difficult for BOSASA to 
get further contracts and that was the essence of the 
R45 000.00.  Our stance and my stance from 2009 until 2014 
remained the same that we were opposed and remained until 
the very end opposed to all sorts of outsourcing including 
that that BOSASA was doing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Maybe let me ask this question as a 
follow up to that – as a follow up to that question.  Let me 
ask this question.  You pointed to certain parts of the 
minutes and said they reflected the committee’s attitude 
20 
against outsourcing.  And you indicated that quite early in 
the life of your committee as Chair of the Correctional 
Services Portfolio Committee 2009/2010 you were informed 
of 
what 
seemed 
to 
be 
shocking 
corruption 
allegedly 
happening in the 
Department 
of Correctional 
Services 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 209 of 231 
 
involving BOSASA, is that right? 
MR SMITH:  That is correct Chairperson.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Now if one goes through the minutes 
of the meetings of that – of your committee from 2009 to 
2014 and I know that what we have is not all the minutes but 
I would like to have them and I am going to ask you later on 
what role you can play to getting us those minutes.  Would 
one find an emphatic attitude from the committee that said, 
no to this corruption at the Department of Correctional 
Services involving BOSASA or any company?  Would one 
10 
find something in the minutes over the years that you were 
horrified as a committee that BOSASA continued to get 
tenders or continued with the – getting contracts from the 
Department of Correctional Services and that you were 
saying to officials of the department why can you not stop 
this corruption?  Why can you not stop these contracts?  Or 
is the position that you would say, your stance against 
outsourcing was effectively your stance against corruption? 
MR SMITH:  Chair yes I think even in these minutes and I 
speak under correction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SMITH:  I think there are at least the – that is if I 
remember just from.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that there was … 
MR SMITH:  Warnings, discussion. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 210 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there was earlier on. 
MR SMITH:  Where it alluded to members that were there 
even prior who said it is the most horrific report that – I think 
it was the SIU Report at the time.  Another area was I think 
with the access control or something Chairperson where we 
were very emphatic whether it was an individual putting the 
point but adopted ultimately by the committee.  To the extent 
Chairperson where almost every meeting where we had 
budget preparations or strategic plans our [00:11:18] always 
was when are you going to take over the core functions of 
10 
Correctional Services and not outsource them? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  Chair there was a massive debate in our time 
about the wisdom or otherwise of private prisons which is 
also a form of outsourcing Chairperson.  So yes I have no 
doubt that if we went through all the minutes at any given 
point where you  
CHAIRPERSON:  It will come out. 
MR SMITH:  Where this thing was discussed it is very 
unambiguous that the entire committee just did not support it 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  Many a time we were told that to change 
[00:11:58] immediately might create a problem because we 
do not have the capacity as the department. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 211 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  But we were not ambiguous of you have to find 
that capacity at some point Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SMITH:  So yes we were – we were throughout my 
tenure anyway and I am sure it could be borne out in the 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I will come back to it.  I will allow 
your Counsel to finish because I will come back to it and 
think about it. 
10 
ADV PHALANE:  Thank your Chair.  During your testimony 
earlier the Chair asked you whether you will accept that the 
loan arrangements between yourself and Mr Agrizzi were 
risky considering that he had nothing to hold onto, do you 
recall that? 
MR SMITH:  I recall that yes Chair. 
ADV PHALANE:   Now as I understand it, the development, 
the property development you are referring to, is a fairly 
well-known development.  Is that correct?   
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV PHALANE:   Is it also correct to assume or rather to 
conclude that you would have informed Mr Agrizzi about 
which development you were referring to? 
MR SMITH:   Yes, I would have.  And I think at some point 
even in his affidavit he alluded the development project that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 212 of 231 
 
we are talking about, Chairperson.  So I think he was quite 
aware of where the investment had taken place. 
ADV PHALANE:   And so he would have possible taken 
comfort in the fact that that type of development your 
investment was in is likely to yield the investment return you 
were hoping for in eight years’ time? 
MR SMITH:   I would have thought that he would have taken 
comfort in that Chair but I do not want to speak on behalf of 
anybody but ordinarily ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know it for sure but you say 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR SMITH:   But ordinarily people will look at that and it has 
been born out over and over that it was a less risky 
investment 
than 
most 
other 
investments, 
property 
development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  H’m. 
ADV PHALANE:   If I can refer you to page 470? 
MR SMITH:   I am there, Chairperson. 
ADV PHALANE:   That is the email that you sent to Mr 
Agrizzi on the 11t h of May 2015.  Now there was much asked 
20 
about what appears to be a clandestine arrangement in 
respect of this loan agreement.  If you can just read for the 
Chairperson’s benefit the second paragraph in that email, 
please Mr Smith? 
MR SMITH:   The paragraph that starts with I? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 213 of 231 
 
ADV PHALANE:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes. 
“I am in the process of sorting out the funding 
requirements 
for 
her 
and 
hereby 
request 
any 
assistance in this regard.  Funds can be deposited 
directly with the institution if that is more acceptable 
and 
I 
have 
thus 
attached 
relevant 
documents/correspondence.  Kind regards.” 
ADV PHALANE:   So to the extent that there may have been 
an intention to conceal this arrangement, you would not have 
10 
been open to the idea of a payment been made directly to 
the institution.  Is that correct? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson.  More than that, if 
there was – I am talking for myself – if there was an attempt 
of concealment, I would not even have wanted to have an 
arrangement where the transaction at any audit trial.  I would 
have looked for another means.  But yes, if... the fact that I 
have said paid directly, for me it is an indication that it was 
legit, above-board and I think an honest request from my 
side, Chair.  
20 
ADV PHALANE:   And then if you go to page 335... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if it is paid directly to the 
institute, to the university, apart from you and Mr Agrizzi of 
BOSASA, it is only the people at that university who may 
have known who paid for you and they are out of South 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 214 of 231 
 
Africa.  You accept that? 
MR SMITH:   That is true, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I mean, that would have been even more fool 
proof, if you want to call it hiding of it, because nobody else 
would have known if you had done it directly.  It would not 
have gone through any records that could be linked to me 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the point I am making is that, that 
made it more unlikely.  It made it more unlikely that anybody 
10 
who could pursue anything would know that you had been 
assisted by BOSASA or Mr Agrizzi, because it would be 
people in ways who know who paid.   
 
Whereas, if the payment maybe was within the premises 
of within the country and if it was reflected that the payment 
was from BOSASA, that might raise eyebrows even within 
the university and that would be internal and the information 
could be leaked.   
 
And the next thing you know, it is in the media that 
BOSASA paid for M Smith’s daughter’s fee, as intuition fees.  
20 
Whereas, because you are dealing with an institution that is 
overseas, it was unlikely that anybody there would not know 
anything about BOSASA.  They receive their money and that 
is it.   
MR SMITH:   I agree.

CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept that? 
MR SMITH:   I accept that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV PHALANE:   Mr Smith, sorry, it is 355 actually, not 335, 
355. 
MR SMITH:   355? 
ADV PHALANE:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   I am there, Chairperson. 
ADV PHALANE:   So the transaction itself into Euro Blitz 
was on the 6t h of August 2016.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PHALANE:   So this reference to again a car accident 
settlement which implies an attempt by somebody to conceal 
the true nature of the payment.  At the time of receiving the 
payment, you were not aware of the reference attached to 
the payment.  Is that correct?  As on the 6t h of August. 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PHALANE:   Because the statement, if you go a page 
before... no, two page... oh, ja a page before, on 354, there 
is a statement that only came out in 2016.  So you only 
20 
really would have become aware of the ...[indistinct] [dip in 
audio recording] attached to the paint, only some 20 odd 
days later.  Is that correct? 
MR SMITH:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PHALANE:   Chair, that is the bulk of the questions I 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 216 of 231 
 
had for Mr Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PHALANE:   Thank you for the indulgence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Mr Smith, I may 
have just a few questions and some of them will relate to 
them to the question of oversight, parliamentary oversight.  
And I am sure by now, you have a good idea that it is a 
subject that this Commission is very interested in just from 
what we have said in the public domain. 
 
One of the concerns that I have with regard to BOSASA 
10 
and all the allegations of corruption and the evidence, 
corruption that has been given to the Commission about 
BOSASA and the Department of Correctional Services, 
Department of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and other 
departments is, how it was possible for a company against 
whom there were such serious allegations of corruption over 
many years, how it was possible for that company to 
continue getting more contract and more contracts, jobs from 
government departments and no prosecution of the company 
and no prosecution of anybody within the company about 
20 
such corruption? 
 
I mean, from what you have said, when you came into 
the Portfolio Committee of Correctional Services in 2009, 
you indicated that the committee that had been there before 
had been grabbling, as I understand it, with allegations of 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 217 of 231 
 
corruption involving BOSASA in the previous years before 
that. 
 
But we know that nothing seems to have been done in 
terms of prosecution of anybody in BOSASA until at least 
2019.  So from around, what, 2005/2006, I am not sure, to 
2009, from 2009 to 2014 during your time, that five year 
period and your own after 2014, BOSASA just continued 
getting a lot of contracts and having some contracts 
extended within government departments. 
 
Nothing seems to be happening.  Nobody was stopping 
10 
this thing.  That concerns me, to say:  What were people who 
were supposed to prevent this, doing?  Where were they?  
What were they doing? 
 
And when I ask that question, I also look at parliament 
and say:  But parliament has got Portfolio Committees that 
relate to various government departments.  What did they do 
about this? 
 
What mechanisms were there at their disposal to stop 
this thing if they wanted to stop it?  Was it a problem of 
there being no mechanisms or was the problem that of no 
20 
willingness of commitment to stop this corruption at the 
Department of Correctional Services? 
 
You may or may not be able to say something about it 
but that is one of my concerns and I certainly want to ask 
you whether, after today, you might be willing to assist the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 218 of 231 
 
Commission in any way by putting together documentation to 
say, during your time as Chairperson of the Portfolio 
Committee of Correctional Services, 2009 to 2014, these are 
the issues that came to your attention about Correctional 
Services as a committee.   
 
This is what you did about these things.  Maybe in 
hindsight, you see that there are many others who did not 
look at which you should have looked at.   
 
Maybe these are the reasons why you did not look at 
them.  But this is what your committee did.  And one of the 
10 
questions I would be interested in is, when in 2010 you had 
this presentation from the SIU which shocked all of you 
about what was happening.   
 
How did it happen that five years later when you got 
out of the committee, BOSASA was still just continuing and 
so on and so on.  So you might wish to say something now 
about what I am saying but you might wish to say I am 
willing to assist the Commission in the way that has been 
suggested and maybe I will prefer to deal with this 
substantively when I have look at everything that we may 
20 
have been doing when we did and so on. 
MR SMITH:   No, Chair, I am more than willing to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To assist. 
MR SMITH:   To assist the committee in terms of my 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 219 of 231 
 
experience and my institutional memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   I will certainly try and put a paper or 
something …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   But, Chair – and this is a self-criticism when I 
am raising it because I was in the system at the time 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must say, before you say that, 
that we need a lot of people who are able to self-criticise 
10 
because I think a lot of things in our country are not going 
right because people do not want to self-criticise, they are 
averse to any criticism and yet criticism can be very 
important in order to improve.  Yes. 
MR SMITH:   Yes, Chair.  I wanted to say that I am part of 
it.   That I think in the former years, certainly since I have 
been in parliament, we were accused of being a very docile 
parliament, at the time because I think there was an 
emphasis of yours is only to recommend or to make 
suggestions without any bite.  I think the bite and those 
20 
things came when you started getting people like the 
Public Protector and so on. 
 
Even the Auditor-General, Chair – and I have been 
through at least three of them, all of them lamented the 
fact that year in year out reported on what we called, in my 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 220 of 231 
 
time, serial offenders, the things you are talking about, 
people continually  did everything and all we could do, 
whether it was public accounts or a Portfolio Committee, 
was to go and write a report to the House and say this is 
ours because portfolio committees on their own are 
subdivisions, if you want to call it, of parliament.  It is the  
Speaker and parliament as a whole who would request 
some sort of intervention and I think that that was the 
problem then, Chair. 
 
I can indicate now that, for instance, we have 
10 
strengthened the Auditor-General tremendously.  I think 
there is a greater awareness even from committees, 
SCOPA and everybody that we need to put pressure in 
terms of asking tough questions in terms of being on top of 
and doing proper follow-up on these types.   
So I think in all honesty parliament today is a totally 
different animal to parliament when I joined it, in terms of 
oversight and so on.  But there is a long way to go and 
with correct political will, which I think is probably there 
now with the current Speaker and other people, I would 
20 
expect that things will continue to improve.   
But, Chair, it is a journey, it is not an event, it will 
take a change of culture in even how, as Portfolio 
Committees, but I think we need to keep on raising the 
flag, keep on raising our concerns, keep on self-criticising 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 221 of 231 
 
and eventually we will reach there, Chairperson. I think it 
is doable but I do not think it is going to be doable 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well I would like to believe that 
there is a change of attitude but I am not sure about it.  I 
have an observation which may or may not be correct 
about parliament, namely that when there is a new 
President 
in 
the 
country, 
in 
terms 
of 
parliamentary 
oversight, sometimes one gets the perception that – at 
least in the past, you know?  One gets the perception that 
10 
member of parliament, certainly from the ruling party’s 
side, you know, would treat the President and maybe his 
ministers – I must say we have only had male presidents – 
in a certain way which might be different from the way they 
treat that President and some of his ministers maybe 
towards the end of that President’s second term, so – and 
an outsider like me looking from outside says oh, so maybe 
when they know this President is not going to be there in 
the next – after the next elections, the attitude changes, 
but at the beginning there seems to be an approach that 
20 
seems to handle the executive very softly.   
I may be wrong but if you observe – I think towards 
the end of President Mandela’s time, towards the end of 
President Mbeki’s time, towards the end of President 
Zuma’s time, certainly there seemed to be – probably it 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 222 of 231 
 
does not mean with everybody but maybe just some.  But I 
think that what is important is that we need to try and see 
whether the oversight mechanisms that parliament has are 
adequate, number one, in order for them to do a proper 
job. 
Number two, what can be done to make sure that 
when a member of a Portfolio Committee or a member 
needs to perform oversight functions, needs to ask difficult 
questions to Members of the Executive, whether it is the 
President or a Minister or in a Portfolio Committee, a DG, 
10 
they feel that they can ask them those difficult questions 
without hearing that they might be labelled as if they are 
opposition member of parliament to say why do you ask our 
Ministers as if you are a DA member?  Do you not know 
this is our Minister?  Why are behaving like an opposition 
member?   We need to look at what it is that can be put in 
place that will enable even members of the ruling party in 
parliament because they are in the majority, to perform that 
function properly even if – or despite the fact that the 
Minister may be in the same party as them and so on and 
20 
the President and that even the ruling party does not make 
people feel that if you ask too many questions of our 
Ministers you are behaving like an opposition party. 
MR SMITH:   Chair, I will make an undertaking to include it 
in the assignment that you have given me, but just 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 223 of 231 
 
upfront… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   …I can indicate to you, Chair, that we have, 
when I was member of parliament and I guess it is the 
same now, lamented the fact that parliament is woefully 
under capacitated relative to the executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   A member of parliament has no support. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   A department has access to all sorts of 
10 
support.  So it is very difficult for somebody to be able to 
read up and do real oversight if you do not even have a 
researcher and the department can call on everybody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   So I am saying, Chair, it is never going to 
happen until you capacitate parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SMITH:   I know that if you compare our MPs to MPs in 
Germany or everywhere else, just from a capacity point of 
view, it is chalk and cheese.  So I am saying those are the 
20 
kinds of things that I will try and put in this paper if you 
ask me to do them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SMITH:   But it is that kind of kind of thing that I think 
would be …[intervenes] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 224 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Assist. 
MR SMITH:   Allowing us to go to the next level of 
oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SMITH:   The capacity of member of parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I think that is a very important 
part as well because you might have a commitment if you 
do not have capacity, you are going to be, you know, 
hampered.  If you have capacity but you do not have the 
commitment, the capacity does not help, does not serve its 
10 
purpose.  So you need to have both.   
But to the extent that in assisting the Commission 
on this assignment you need any assistance from the 
Commission there will be people who can assist in terms of 
drawing affidavits or whatever, there will be people that 
can assist.  I think you can make contact with the legal 
team – the evidence leaders here or your lawyers can 
make contact and there is somebody that is looking at that 
issue and they can assist. 
But I just want to say before I leave that subject 
20 
that earlier this year the Commission wrote to almost all 
the political parties who were represented in parliament 
before the 2019 general election, same letter, and that 
includes the ruling party, but everybody, and it said – it 
was saying one of the areas that the Commission is looking 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 225 of 231 
 
at is precisely this to say to the extent that we can all see 
that a lot of wrong things have happened in various 
government departments and SOEs over the past years, 
one of the things we need to look at is where was 
parliament when these things were happening Because 
they had a constitutional obligation or oversight, what did 
they do?  Did they have enough mechanisms to deal with 
these challenges or is it a problem of capacity or is it a 
problem of whatever mechanisms, oversight mechanisms 
there were, they were not enough to deal with these 
10 
problems. 
We said to the various political parties tell us what 
your Members of Parliament, what their experiences have 
been with regard to trying to perform oversight over the 
executive 
over 
the 
years, 
tell 
us 
if 
you 
think 
the 
mechanisms of oversight were not adequate.  Make 
suggestions or recommendations as to what should be 
done to make sure that Parliament will be able to exercise 
its oversight functions effectively but unfortunately I have 
heard that apparently one of the parties didn’t get the 
20 
letter but not a single one of the political parties has 
shown interest in that and it is difficult to think all these 
political parties didn’t receive those letters, actually those 
letters were sent twice, first they were sent before the 
lock-down started and later on they were sent again to say 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 226 of 231 
 
in case you didn’t get them they were sent, but there 
seems to be no interest and it is very difficult to 
understand why it is that they would not be interested in 
something so important to their function. 
 
I have spoken to the Speaker of Parliament and the 
Chairperson of the NCOP, they are fully committed to 
assisting the Commission in regard to those matters and 
they will be assisting but I am just saying I would have 
expected the political parties themselves will be interested 
but it doesn’t look like, but I am very grateful that you are 
10 
prepared to assist in whatever way you can. 
 
I think the only other matter I want to mention, and 
again you might not be able to say anything, you know if 
Mr Agrizzi’s evidence before this Commission is true or 
some of it is true one gets the impression that BOSASA 
may have wanted to capture some people in Parliament, 
Legislature, 
some 
people 
in 
Cabinet 
and 
even 
the 
President during President Zuma’s time. 
 
I am saying this because they have given evidence, 
Mr Agrizzi gave evidence about alleged payments that he 
20 
said were being made by BOSASA to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation through Ms Dudu Myeni, that if I understand Mr 
Agrizzi’s evidence correctly were meant for the then 
President and then of course he has given evidence about 
some people, some Ministers, he has given evidence about 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 227 of 231 
 
people in the legislature.  It may well be that if his 
evidence is true BOSASA sought to do this.  Again, it is 
something that you might not be able to say anything 
about. 
MR SMITH:   No Chair certainly there is nothing I can say 
about it Chairperson, because as you said those are 
allegations and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja. 
MR SMITH:   I suppose at some point, very much like this 
exercise, we can learn lessons from this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   No thank you very much.  
There is nothing arising counsel from this?  Nothing, okay, 
thank you very much Mr Smith, I think you wanted to say 
something for a few minutes.  I give you that chance now. 
MR SMITH:   Chair thank you very much for this 
opportunity, it is really just four brief points that I would 
want to put to contextualise my understanding and my 
participation. 
 
The first point that I wish to raise Chairperson is 
that 
immediately 
that 
these 
allegations 
surfaced 
in 
20 
September 2018 I as a person voluntarily stepped down,  
because I did not want to contaminate Parliament any 
further, but also because I was informed by the resolutions 
of the ANC at NASREG that rather step aside until you 
have had this kind of opportunity to do it, so I wanted to 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 228 of 231 
 
put it on record that I voluntarily stepped down and allowed 
for the process. 
 
I think the second point Chairperson, and we 
probably canvassed it earlier on, that I would like to lead, 
is that personally my relationship with the Late Gavin 
Watson precedes my being a Member of Parliament and it 
spans over almost twenty five years Chairperson, until his 
untimely death, so it was not a matter of me and the late 
Gavin knowing each from 2019, and as we alluded to that, 
it was born from the ANC’s programme of rebuilding 
10 
organisation and rebuilding communities and we had to go 
through people who are able to assist us, so that is how 
my 
relationship 
with 
Gavin 
Watson 
– 
or 
that’s 
the 
relationship that I had with Gavin Watson until his untimely 
death and I wouldn’t want the impression created that it 
was just a 2019 or a 1999 exercise, and then the third 
point and again you also cautioned me against it Chair is 
that I wanted to talk about the intention of this separation 
of powers to be able to say nobody interferes in anybody 
and everybody is independent, and if operated the way it 
20 
was intended I think it will go a long way that I cannot 
dictate the judiciary and so on, because if that is working 
Chairperson then no member of Parliament would be able 
to even go near adjudicating of tenders and so on and so 
forth, and I thought, I thought I wanted to put that on the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 229 of 231 
 
table that says it is true even for MP’s, if you believe in the 
separation of powers I cannot get involved in the day to 
day work of the departments Chair. 
 
I also wanted to say Chairperson that I think that 
the systems that Parliament uses of Portfolio Committees 
where the media is able to have access, where any civil 
society, organisation or even the public has access, where 
there are multi-party members in that committee, bodes 
well because they have transparency so it cannot be 
anything, even – almost all committee meetings today are 
10 
publicised live, so I think it brings out transparency and it 
will make it very difficult, if not impossible for any single 
individual or political party to dictate or impose his or her 
will 
on 
the 
functioning 
of 
Parliament, 
by 
the 
way 
committees are the engine room of Parliament so I think 
that transparency bodes well. 
 
Chair the – this morning we discussed, well not 
really discussed but we went through what I thought when I 
received them last night were all the minutes where there 
was reference to BOSASA and I am raising it Chairperson 
20 
because there was an impression created, rightly or 
wrongly, I am not even talking about the merits of it, that 
there is this individual who was very anti, he then has a 
meeting and he becomes very pro, to the extent that he 
works even after he has left the Portfolio Committee and I 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 230 of 231 
 
am not saying that it is right or wrong, that is yours 
Chairperson 
but 
I 
don’t 
think 
the 
minutes 
that 
we 
discussed, at least these that we discussed now, the facts 
that we discussed don’t bear out that perception, I thought 
I want to put it on the table Chair that at least from my side 
I am happy that – it was a blessing in disguise that those 
minutes came late last night, because I would not have had 
opportunity to prove to you that my attitude and that of the 
department didn’t change Chair. 
 
So to that extent Chair I am hoping that what came 
10 
out today and this debunking of that narrative that Smith or 
others were up for cash I am hoping that when you look at 
the report or anybody else you take that into consideration. 
 
I want to end Chair by saying that I did not have the 
authority and neither did any member of Parliament have 
the authority to award or to influence who got tenders or 
contracts in the department, but I never once enabled any 
undue, illegal awarding of tenders personally, I never once 
influenced undue or illegal tenders to any individual or to 
any other company or to any institution, that is my – and 
20 
Chair and other people will be the judge of that ultimately. 
 
And I thought that if I said that Chairperson at least 
there will be closure from my side in terms of I hope you 
understand where it is, and I thank you for your indulgence 
Chair. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 261 
 
Page 231 of 231 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you very much Mr Smith and 
thank you for coming to give evidence to the Commission 
and thank you in advance for the assistance you are going 
to give to the Commission with regard to the performance 
of 
oversight 
functions 
by 
the 
Correctional 
Services 
Portfolio Committee from 2009 when you were Chairperson 
up to 2914 when you were Chairperson so as to give us, 
give the Commission more light and more information into 
what kind of issues in relation to Correctional Services the 
Committee was aware of, what kind of information it asked 
10 
for, what kind of decisions, if any, it made about those 
matters and what step it sought to be pursued to deal with 
the problems, thank you very much, you are excused now. 
MR SMITH: Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  I must thank everybody for 
their cooperation for us to be able to sit until this time in 
order to finish, we appreciate that very much.  We are 
going to adjourn, next week the Commission will be hearing 
evidence relating to Eskom, in particular the suspension of 
various executives and that is what the Commission will be 
20 
dealing with next week. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 7 SEPTEMBER 2020
