PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 24 MAY 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are we ready? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Gonsalves before we proceed 
further with your evidence just to recap.  Could you please capture a 
brief synopsis of the testimony that you adduced before the Chair 
10 
yesterday.  Just capture the essence so that we can be able to follow 
from where we have left yesterday. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Certainly.  Good morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So perhaps let me start off with saying 
that on the 9 August 2012 the CNR consortium informed Transnet that 
they would tender for both the diesel and electric locomotives.  On the 
17 March 2014 a locomotive supply agreement was signed for 232 
diesel locomotives between the CNR consortium and Transnet TFR.  
Prior to us signing that locomotive supply agreement Transnet had 
20 
informed that the assembling and manufacturing of the 232 diesel 
locomotives would take place in Bayhead in Durban as opposed to 
Koedoespoort in Pretoria and they requested that we provide them with 
analysis of the cost impact of assembling and manufacturing in 
Bayhead as opposed to Koedoespoort.  And even though the locomotive 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 3 of 89 
 
supply agreement had a definition of contractive facility saying either 
Bayhead or Koedoespoort there was an amendment to that stating that 
it was going to be at Bayhead – the contractive facility was Bayhead.  
Then on the 11 March 2014 after the request from Transnet to provide 
an impact analysis of moving from Koedoespoort to Bayhead a letter 
was sent to CNR – to TFR stating that the amount was R9.7 million that 
was the impact of the additional cost associated with the move from 
Koedoespoort as opposed to Bayhead.  Then on the 10 April 2015 we – 
there was a board meeting and at the board meeting we were – the 
minority directors were presented with a contract for BEX and they 
10 
objected very strongly to this when they saw that the contract contained 
provisions of a fee that could have gone up to R370 million for BEX.  
They had no idea who BEX was. There were no tender procedures 
followed by CNR South Africa.  Despite all of that the company CNR 
South Africa signed an agreement on the 23 April 2015 with BEX and 
they were able to do that because CNR had four directors on the board 
and the minority directors only totalled three.  Then we subsequently 
received a document dated 21 April 2015 where CNR South Africa 
produced some calculations showing a supporting amount of R287 
million as a relocation claim.  We felt that the document was very 
20 
poorly drafted and quite amateurish.  Then in July 2015 there was a 
variation order that had been put together by BEX signed by Jeff Wang 
of CNR South Africa and Anoj Singh of Transnet for an amount of R647 
million the calculation show an amount of R719 million less the 10% 
discount amounting to R647 million.  And then lastly on the 16 August 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 4 of 89 
 
2016 the minority directors met with the executives of Transnet that 
included the CEO, the CFO, the head of Legal and Compliance where 
we expressed our concerns around the BEX contract.  At that meeting 
we provided them with documents showing that BEX was a – and 
subsequently we emailed it to them and presented hard copies to them 
showing them that BEX was a sham company.  The Sipsey documents 
showed that the director – there is one director only.  It was an exempt 
micro enterprise with a turnover of less than R5 million.  We showed 
them that there was a document claiming that the initial amount was 
R287 million.  We showed them that the amount had increased to R647 
10 
million.  The only document we were not able to show them at that 
meeting because we did not have it in our possession at that stage was 
a document that Mr Gama had signed the acceptance letter of the 
variation order because we only received that subsequently from Hogan 
Lovells. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And yesterday we parted ways at 
the point where now this matter was referred to KPMG and you were 
now informing the Chair about the two reportable irregularities and you 
have also done that up until page 13 paragraph 46.  You were just 
about to elaborate on the contents of that paragraph and proceed with 
20 
your evidence from that point.  Could you please take us through those 
relevant facts? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Certainly.  Chair I think maybe even 
though we are going to start on paragraph 46 if I perhaps could go to – 
back to paragraph 42? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 5 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Because I think it is a natural flow of 
events.  So on the 22 September 2015. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Daisy Chong from CNR called me to say 
that KPMG was considering issuing a report called irregularity.  I called 
the audit partner from KPMG and on that call he informed me that this 
was not the first reportable irregularity there had been an initial one.  
Number which I refer to as the first RI.  And the first RI was the BEX 
matter. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I then sent an email to Mr Van 
Reckitstein the KPMG audit partner requesting that he send me all the 
information on the reportable 
 irregularity.  And that takes us to paragraph 46 and should I continue 
from there? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes you may then continue from there. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Okay.  At – then subsequent I – we 
informed the Endinamix board of this and the Endinamix board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Is the conversation between you and this 
20 
partner from KPMG – does this capture the gist of the conversation 
what you have just read? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite – quite correct Chair and I know 
that it is accurate because subsequent to the call I sent an email to all 
my fellow directors saying I have just had a call and I have literally 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 6 of 89 
 
taken this from my email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So your call to him was more to find out more 
about the reportable irregularity that he – you were told he was 
considering making? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair so I wanted to know 
what the first – the second reportable irregularity was about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And I wanted to know what the first one 
was all about as well because we did not even know there was a first 
one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If I understand your evidence that 
despite being the minority shareholders all this information pertaining 
to these irregularities or reportable irregularities were never conveyed 
to the minority shareholders up until the time when at least that 
information came your way, am I correct? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is quite correct.  We only knew 
that there was a first reportable irregularity when the second reportable 
irregularity came to our notice. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes and it was at that point then when you 
20 
sought clarity as to what does it – what does the first irregularity and 
the second one entail? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long before had the first one being reported if 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 7 of 89 
 
you got to know prior to the con – telephone conversation that you had 
with the partner of KPMG, did you get to know? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So my conversation with KMPG was on 
the 22 September 2017 and the Hogan Lovell’s response to KMPG took 
place in terms of Annexure 20 I will give you the precise date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  It seemed that that was on the 4 
September 2017.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So – and it seemed there is an annexure 
10 
to it with the actual reportable irregularity to IRBA from KPMG and that 
took place on the 12 June 2017.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the first one? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Do you have any idea as to why this 
crucial and vital information which ordinarily a shareholder must 
actually be told about why was it kept away from the minority 
shareholders? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we have no idea and you will see 
20 
that we were very, very upset that there could be a reportable 
irregularity and you know the board – the minority – the other directors 
of the board not be informed about it and the other shareholders not be 
informed about it. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And this was kept away from you despite 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 8 of 89 
 
the full knowledge from the majority shareholders that you had serious 
concerns that you have raised about the BEX issue and you have even 
elaborated as to why that money should not be paid to the consortium, 
am I correct? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is absolutely correct and I 
think that is probably the reason why they kept it away from because 
they already knew that we had concerns and what KPMG was just 
supporting the concerns that we had. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Just confirming what we had already 
10 
believed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes you may then proceed with your 
testimony from paragraph 37. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So – so are saying what happened is on 
the 27 September there was an Endinamix board meeting and they 
expressed their concern in paragraph 46 and demanded that a meeting 
be set up immediately with – between the company, management, 
KPMG and the shareholders and whatever legal advisors needed to be 
there.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes proceed. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And then what happened next is on the – 
the very next day I spoke with Charles You of the Hogan Lovells 
because I knew that they were their legal advisors to CNR South Africa 
and on that call for the first time that we realised that the first RI 
reportable irregularity dealt with the BEX matter.  He also informed me 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 9 of 89 
 
on the call that Hogan Lovells no longer wish to act for the company on 
that reportable irregularity and to provide any advice to them. The 
reason for that is that they had heard that one of the BEX directors had 
a relationship with the Gupta’s and those were exact words.  And you 
will remember that in Annexure 20 that is the response that Hogan 
Lovells gave to KPMG on behalf of the company to support why they 
believe that the BEX issue was not a reportable irregularity. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now just you know to seek clarity 
here a reason is given that one of the BEX directors I thought that 
yesterday you informed the Chair that this BEX which ultimately you 
10 
know was paid this huge sums of money it only had one director as – 
because it was dormant for some time and at the time when it 
concluded the agreement there was only one director. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is quite correct.  There is a 
Mark Shaw I believe his name is he is the only director on the date.  
Look subsequently whether new directors were appointed or whether he 
resigned as a director I am not sure about the history post that date.  
So there could have been new directors on the board that had a 
relationship with the Gupta’s or he could have had a relationship with 
the Gupta’s. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now these issues which we are 
now known to the consortiums you know minority directors where – was 
Transnet aware of these reportable irregularities and whether or not 
KPMG did in fact report the issue pertaining to BEX? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I would not know whether Transnet 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 10 of 89 
 
was aware of that.  Remember that we had met with them in 2016. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And this is in 2017. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  and 17. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Whether the company informed Transnet 
about it or whether Hogan Lovells did I am not sure. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take you back a little bit?  You said that one of 
the directors or the director of BEX apparently had a relationship with 
the Gupta’s according to what you were told.  Was it one of the 
10 
directors that had an – one of the – I mean the director – the sole 
director of BEX that had an agreement with your consortium or was it 
one of the directors of the other BEX with which your consortium did 
not conclude an agreement? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I believe it was the BEX entity the 
2009 entity that we had signed the legal agreement with because I think 
the initial BEX entity was never involved with it.  It was just a façade 
and they were just using that company’s proper name and registration 
number and then probably acquired a shelf company and it seems they 
had acquired a shelf company appointed a director and then signed this 
20 
agreement with let us call it this new BEX.  So my understanding from 
what Charles You from Hogan Lovells was saying was that the 
relationship was between the new BEX one of the new BEX directors or 
the director and the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I am trying to establish is whether it was as 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 11 of 89 
 
you understood it was a reference to the sole director of the 2009 
registered BEX or the one that was – one of the directors of BEX that 
was just used to give the other one some credibility. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I understood it to be either the sole 
director Mark Shaw or any new directors that had been appointed to the 
new BEX companies board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh to the 2009 registered one? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you just did not know whether at that time 
that 2009 registered BEX still had one director or there were – there 
10 
were more? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  I take it that at some point the 
minority shareholders did have a meeting with KPMG in order to 
discuss the first reportable irregularity, am I correct? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is quite correct.  On the 10 
October we met with KPMG and we discussed both the reportable 
irregularities.  We made it very clear to them that the first reportable 
irregularity was a concern of ours as well and that is the reason why we 
20 
had never approved signing the financial statements of the company 
from 2015 onwards but that we disagreed with them on the second 
reportable irregularity and we would be giving them evidence to support 
that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And then what happened 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 12 of 89 
 
subsequent to that? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Then on the 20 October 2017 we sent a 
letter to which is Annexure 22 to KPMG dealing with the second 
reportable irregularity.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May I refer you to folder 22 RG22 
Chair is to be found on page 294 and request you Mr Gonsalves simply 
to identify that document for us and simply take us through the 
highlight of that document? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure Chair this is a letter from CNR 
South Africa to KPMG on dealing with the second reportable 
10 
irregularity.  It is a document that goes – it is probably a 26 page letter 
that had probably a few hundred of annexures as well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  What it was purporting to do is give 
KPMG confidence that this was not a reportable irregularity.  The 
concern that KPMG had I think they were in the media – there is a lot of 
– in the spotlight in the media.  There was concern I think with any 
companies that had anything to do with rail and you will see 
subsequently that KPMG did resign as auditors.  There were payments, 
project management fees that was paid from the company CNR South 
20 
African to Endinamix.  They were concerned that maybe these were – 
there was no commercial substance behind these.  And what this 
document purported to do was demonstrate that there was more than 
adequate commercial support and economic support for the project 
management fees and that they were bona fide.  I know I am jumping 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 13 of 89 
 
ahead but subsequently the new auditors that replaced KPMG withdrew 
the second reportable irregularity as an issue but not the first one, the 
BEX one. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Let us – may I 
refer you back to your statement and please go to page 14 and deal 
with the events from the 1 November as per your paragraph 51 
onwards. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So on the 1 November 2017 we had 
another meeting with Werksmans.  Remember that they had been 
engaged by Transnet. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  To look into the BEX matter and we 
basically gave – shared all the information that we had on the BEX 
matter with them.  At that stage we still did not have the Hogan Lovells 
annexures we just had their letter.  We got that I think the next day 
from Hogan Lovells and – so we met with Harold Jacobs and his team. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And when you met with Werksmans 
were they aware that you know KPMG has actually reported this to 
irregularities? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I cannot recall whether they were aware 
20 
of that or not Chair to be honest with you.  I am not sure whether we 
mentioned that in the meeting to them or not. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now you have highlighted the 
seriousness of these issues pertaining to the BEX you know payment 
and how it was engaged and how the amounts escalated.  Was the law 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 14 of 89 
 
– I mean – any law enforcement agencies engaged in order to deal with 
this matter? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair subsequent to the meeting with 
Werksmans it was apparent that this thing was just dragging on and it 
is still dragging on.  And we were concerned that quite a lot of time had 
elapsed before we were first expressed our concerns to the board and 
then to Transnet and now Werksmans had been engaged but we did not 
see significant progress.  So we took it upon ourselves as the minority 
directors to report this to the Hawks and what happened was Lulamila 
Xate as a director put together an affidavit and both Rowlen Von 
10 
Gericke and myself signed supporting affidavits 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can I refer you to RG24.  Chair it is on 
page 323 and if you can please identify that document for us and to the 
extent that is necessary you may simply highlight the important aspects 
arising from that document? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure.  Chair it is page 323 this is the 
affidavit from Lulamila Xate and he basically summarises that he is a 
non-executive director of the board and he is deposing this affidavit in 
that capacity.  He notifies them that KPMG has raised this reportable 
irregularity around the fees received from Transnet and the payments 
20 
made to BEX and he basically also attaches all the Hogan Lovells 
documents which was extensive record of all the contracts signed 
between BEX, the variation orders etcetera, etcetera and he signs that 
on the 29 November 2017.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now when the minority 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 15 of 89 
 
shareholders approached the Hawks what was the reaction of the 
majority shareholders?  Were they aware? They simply ignored what 
was happening?   
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We – Chair we informed them that we 
had reported it to the Hawks because we thought it was the proper 
thing to do.  We had nothing to hide and we knew that it was going to 
obviously effect the relationship with them but we let them know.  
Obviously they were not pleased with that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  What happened after the matter 
had been reported to the Hawks?  Do you know if the Hawks did 
10 
anything about the matter? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The only thing other engagement with the 
Hawks was a few months later there was a Captain Frank [Rangwashe] 
from the Commercial Crime Unit and Serious Economic Offences and he 
met with Rowlen Von Gericke and just to understand a bit more about 
the matter but no real progress on it and since then there has been no 
progress.  No other communication from the Hawks. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Where the minority shareholders did 
they make any follow ups with the Hawks or with the Captain? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No other than that the – there had been 
20 
one or two discussions between them and Rowlen Von Gericke.  I know 
someone from the SIU has also made contact with Rowlen Von Gericke 
but I believe from the Hawks there has been no other communication. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May I then refer you back to your 
statement page 14 and summarise for us the contents of paragraph 54? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 16 of 89 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair so this is a few months later – ten 
months later we have insisted on a board meeting to understand a few 
things.  Firstly what has happened with KPMG’s replacement auditor?  
We need to understand what the status is of the financial statements 
could we – had not approved them from 2015.  We need to also 
understand how the reportable irregularities have been dealt with 
etcetera.  At that meeting we were informed that there are new auditors 
J Theron and Pietersen and they have in fact issued signed audit 
10 
financial statements in respect of the 2017 year and prior years as 
well.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When these new auditors were appointed 
I mean were the minority shareholders engaged in any manner? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolute not Chair and there is enough 
evidence on record where we demanded that we have the right to at 
least interview who the new auditors were and also to inform the new 
auditors of the reportable irregularities. We thought it was improper to 
appoint someone and not let them know of the history and the 
background of the reportable irregularities. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  It appears that the minority 
shareholders played no role in this company? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we were absolutely excluded from 
many, many important decisions and that is why there has been quite a 
lot of tension at these board meetings. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 17 of 89 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was it as a result of the position that you took 
in relation to the BEX issue or were there any other things that were – 
you – happening within the company that could have strained this 
relationship? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair the BEX issues obviously 
definitely caused a lot of tension.  The other tension is around the 
corporate governance.  We insisted on – we demanded from day 1 
actually that they appoint a South African financial director, chartered 
accountant we thought that would be useful for the company. Ensuring 
compliance with all our rules and regulations.  You know we demanded 
10 
that we have proper genders for board meetings that we have regular 
board meetings.  That all matters pertaining to board meetings are 
circulated before the board meeting etcetera.  The Chinese directors 
obviously did not like that approach. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You can then pick up with your 
evidence form paragraph 55 on page 15. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So following the board meeting Chair on 
the 25 September the next day I wrote to the audit partner Nadia 
Pietersen and I informed her that we were very surprised that their 
audited financial statements for 2017 had been signed off and given 
20 
that we had not had a board meeting for such a long time and I also 
told her that we needed to understand how the – they had dealt with the 
BEX matter and also any other RI’s. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And in paragraph 6 you deal with 
quite an important letter which was written by Mr Stephen Teti and the 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 18 of 89 
 
contents of which are quite crucial and important and relevant to the 
terms of reference of this commission.  Could you please you know take 
us through that paragraph and please read in full the contents of that 
letter please? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure Chair so Stephen Teti who is from 
Endinamix representing Kopana Ke Matla was at that board meeting on 
the 25 September and it was quite a hostile meeting because the issue 
of BEX came up once again and on the 27 September 2018 Stephen 
Teti signed a letter on behalf of Endinamix to the CNR board and in it 
he stated the following: 
10 
“We as Endinamix regard the payment of R67 181 494,00 including 
VAT” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Gonsalves I have just received a note 
that a ten minutes break is being requested.  Chair there is a serious 
technical break that – technical break – that break that needs to be 
dealt with and on those basis I am not sure whether we were able to 
capture all the evidence or whether we have lost any or whether it is 
only related to the camera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us see it looks like so far we have been 
recording.  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is fine so we can take the ten minutes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Break to enable the technicians to fix the problem.  
Okay it is half past twelve – ten sorry.  Twenty to eleven we will 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 19 of 89 
 
resume.  Thank you.  If there is need for more time I will be told.  Okay 
we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand the problem has been fixed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The problem has been resolved Chair.  I 
am told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Let us proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Gonsalves just before the short 
adjournment you were taking the Chair through paragraph 56 of your 
10 
statement and I have requested you to also read in full what is 
captured in the letter that you are referencing as RG26.  Please 
proceed to do so. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
Thank 
you 
Chair. 
 
So 
on 
27 September 2018 Stephen Teti who is a Director of Endinamix who 
represents Kopano Ke Matla wrote to the CNR Board on behalf of the 
Endinamix Board and in the letter he stated inter alia the following: 
“We 
as 
Endinamix 
regard 
the 
payment 
of 
“R67 181 494.00” including VAT to BEX as a bribe 
to induce the award of this tender.  This is a breach 
20 
of your fiduciary duties as Directors of CNR.  We 
therefore demand that CNR take the following 
minimum measures to reverse and correct the 
situation:  i, you report this matter in terms of the 
Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 20 of 89 
 
12 of 2004 “PCCA Act”; ii, you report this matter to 
the SAPS “Hawks” as having been the subject of 
extortion by BEX; iii, you report the behaviour of 
BEX in terms of the Financial Intelligence Act 38 of 
2001 “FICA”; iv, any other measures necessary to 
recover the monies that you paid to BEX.” 
The next paragraph says: 
“Our position as Endinamix is simply that unless 
CNR demonstrates a willingness to correct the BEX 
matter and all the other issues raised above by the 
10 
Endinamix Directors we are not willing to sign and 
confirm any BEE credentials of the joint venture as 
we will be complicit in the very things we are 
complaining about and we will be – and we will 
demand the resignation of the Endinamix Board 
Director who sits on your Board as that amounts to 
conflict of interest.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now did the Board of CNR or 
Directors deal with the issues which were referenced in this letter?  Did 
they take any remedial action? 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair despite numerous requests we 
have seen no reaction by the CNR Board of CNR to this letter. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You can pick up then from 
paragraph 57 and deal with the events from 3 October 2018. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure and so Chair on 3 October 2018 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 21 of 89 
 
Lulamile Xate, myself, Jeff Wang the CEO and some other CNR South 
African representatives met with Nadia Pietersen of J Theron & 
Pietersen and it was very obvious from the discussions that we had 
with her that she was not fully informed about the nature of the BEX 
issue and that management of CNR had not provided them with the full 
information.  Over the next few days we – we proceeded to do that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes but did you furnish them with the 
relevant information?  Did you give them the documents that would 
sustain – you know- whatever complaint that you had in relation to the 
BEX matter? 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair.  We - we then 
emailed them all the BEX related documentation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Do you know whether they reacted to 
same?  What did they do with that information? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I must give them credit.  They 
reacted very quickly.  On 8 October 2018 they informed us that they 
had retracted the 2015/2016 and 2017 annual financial statements and 
I will quote: 
“As a result of information that came to our 
attention 
after 
the 
finalisation 
of 
the 
above 
20 
mentioned reports.” 
And in addition they said – a direct quote: 
“We will need to reopen the December 2015 audit.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So they – they too considered this 
matter to be very serious? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 22 of 89 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja, absolutely Chair and the latest audit 
report - as I will talk about a bit later - has an emphasis of the matter 
on – in relation to BEX. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and then on 15 October there – 
thereabout you wrote a letter to Ms Pietersen? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes I wrote on 15 October 2018 to 
Ms Pietersen and I made it very clear to her and I will quote: 
“Regarding BEX we “the Directors” representing the 
minority 
Directors 
that 
is 
Lulamile Xate 
of 
Endinamix, Rowlen von Gericke from Global and 
10 
Robbie Gonsalves 
– 
Cadiz 
- 
were 
descenting 
Directors when the Board voted on the BEX 
contract.  That is we did not support the contract 
and do not support that the payment made to BEX 
was a bona fide payment for services rendered to 
CRRCSARS.” 
Which is CNR South Africa. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  “For this reason we wanted to 
know how this payment was going to be disclosed in 
20 
the December 2015 annual financial statements.  
We have as yet not received a response from 
CRRCSARS on 27 September letter.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Did Ms Pietersen responded in reacted 
in any manner to this letter? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 23 of 89 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes they – no remember that Chair on – 
they – they withdrew the – the financial statements. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  For 2015/2016 and 2017.  They only – 
the next that we heard from them was on 22 March 2019 - so not very 
long ago - where I received a copy of the draft financial statements for 
31 December 2018 
and 
in 
that 
draft 
financial 
statements 
the 
independent auditors report included an emphasis of matter in respect 
of the BEX issue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May I refer you to RG29?  Chair 
10 
that will be on page 340.  If you may please identify that document for 
us. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair this is a draft independent 
auditors report and that would be from J Theron & Pietersen in respect 
of the 2018 financial statements – year ended 31 December 2018. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and what are the issues which you 
wish to highlight to the Chair? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair in the audit report about in the 
middle you will see a paragraph with a heading “Emphasis of Matter” 
and in it they state: 
20 
“We draw attention to the following circumstance.” 
I will not read it out word for word but in a nutshell they say that there 
is a reportable regularity and there are two points here.  One, they say 
according to the information received the proposal by CNR in respect of 
the relocation from Koedoespoort to Bayhead – and I will – these are 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 24 of 89 
 
direct words: 
“…significantly 
misrepresented 
the 
cost 
to 
Transnet.” 
That was the issue and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Effectively it is the one you quoted in your statement 
on the last page? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And then the second point that they raise 
that – is that CNR entered into an agreement with BEX on 25 April 2015 
10 
and that it appears that the payments made to BEX sound – lacks 
sound commercial substance and purpose. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now how was this matter ultimately 
resolved if it was resolved?  I mean we know that the minority 
shareholders did interact with Transnet.  They interacted with the 
Hawks.  They interacted with the auditors.  What happened ultimately 
with this matter?  Do you know if the monies were paid back to 
Transnet or whether are they being pursued?  What is the status quo of 
all these issues? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair to our knowledge from the 
20 
company’s perspective absolutely nothing has happened.  They have 
definitely not repaid Transnet the amount back unless they have done it 
without informing us and I understand that they are not pursuing BEX at 
all.  Remember that we wrote to them demanding that they do that.  We 
have subsequently written to them a few times and received no 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 25 of 89 
 
response from it.  So I assume that they have done absolutely nothing 
about it.  The only thing that we have managed to achieve is get the 
financial statements in respect of 2015/2016 and 2017 retracted and an 
emphasis of matter now included in the later set of financial statements 
by the new auditors stating that the BEX matter is a reportable 
regularity and it has not been resolved. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and within that company itself I take 
it that are – are you still the minority shareholder in that – in the 
entity? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we are still minority shareholders and 
10 
we still minority Directors other than Rowlen von Gericke who has 
resigned since.  I understand that we are going to have a Board 
meeting next week.  I assume that it is going to be quite a hostile one 
but that is the plan. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Did the company – I mean – do you 
know if the majority shareholders have dealt with this matter or taken – 
taken it any further? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No not at all Chair and I assume that if 
they had they would have informed us.  So my assumption is that they 
have done very little on it if anything at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you or any of the minority shareholders has 
interacted with the new Board of Transnet?  There was a new Board 
that was appointed early last year for Transnet and its Chairperson 
Mr Popo Molefe gave evidence about two weeks ago here and he gave 
evidence about how the new Board is trying to recover monies that may 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 26 of 89 
 
have been paid to individuals or entities in the manner – in 
circumstances where they were not entitled to such payments.  Do you 
know whether any of the minority shareholders have interacted with the 
Board to say are you aware of this, what is Transnet doing about it? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair now we have not.  Obviously we 
reported this to the Hawks and we reported it to the old Transnet 
Executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we have not reported to the new one 
but I am hoping that as a result of this testimony that I am giving now 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That Transnet now will engage with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We are open.  We will give them or share 
everything with them.  We will cooperate fully with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We want this resolved.  So I would be 
very pleased if Transnet can engage us and assist us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  With this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I – I would encourage you to take the first 
opportunity you get after you are finished here to communicate or make 
contact with the – maybe with the Chairperson of the Board of Transnet 
to – to bring to his attention that there is this matter and you have 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 27 of 89 
 
given evidence about – probably – well he was here yesterday morning.  
I think probably he may well be watching but I believe that he would be 
interested to know about anybody who may have received payment from 
Transnet in circumstances that are suspect.  So I – I would encourage 
that you - you do that. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we will certainly take you up on 
that.  I briefly Mr Molefe yesterday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  In the area outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but to go back to this BEX issue assuming 
10 
that you were correct in estimating the cost at R9.-something million.  
It means that since they were ultimately paid about R600-something 
million – is that right? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  R647 million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 647 million.  It means that if your estimation of the 
cost was correct it means that there is a good chance – there chance 
that more than 600 million might not have been justified that was paid 
by Transnet.  Is my rough calculation correct in terms of what may have 
been unjustified to be paid? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair we believe that the full R647 
20 
million is unjustified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We were already paid R9.7 million that 
we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh that was separate? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 28 of 89 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That was built into the price of a 
locomotive.  So when we are putting the final price per locomotive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  In the tender document … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We included this R9.7 million and 
increased the price of the locomotives already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes I think you did say that. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we have been paid Chair R9.7 million 
plus … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  R647 million.  Even if the R9.7 million 
Chair was incorrect and it should have been 5 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Or it should have been 15 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Or it should have been 18 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I think it is large – it is irrelevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  It was an agreed number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The number was agreed with TFR … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And it was built into the pricing of the 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 29 of 89 
 
final fixed price per locomotive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So it has already been incorporated in 
the locomotive price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this whole R647 million that was paid on your 
evidence was really completely unnecessary and there was really no 
cause for Transnet – Transnet to pay that amount? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is what we believe and that is 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The reason why we approached Transnet.  
We thought perhaps (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes) you did not know? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And nobody told you anything.  You did not know up 
to now? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we are still waiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Nor did your majority shareholders? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You gave everyone an opportunity to explain to you 
20 
what the justification was both Transnet and the majority shareholders 
and nobody told you what the justification was.  Is that right? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair and that – that is the 
reason why we felt obliged to report this to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Then the Hawks themselves do not seem to 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 30 of 89 
 
have acted as quickly as one would have thought they would? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes because you reported to the Hawks when? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That would have been towards the end of 
2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so there has been a whole year and a half at 
least? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and have the Hawks been keeping you informed 
about their progress?  Have they been in touch with you to make sure 
10 
that you know that the delay is not because they are not doing anything 
but they are working on the matter in anyway? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair there was just one meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Subsequent to that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Subsequent to the affidavits being 
submitted and that was with Rowlen von Gericke … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  But nothing came out of that meeting and 
20 
no new information.  They already had all the information.  So nothing - 
it was kind of just a brief update but nothing came out of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the meeting itself you say there was really no 
value to the meeting as such? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No value whatsoever Chair.  I mean I 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 31 of 89 
 
actually spoke to Mr von Gericke – Rowlen von Gericke – this morning 
just to confirm that and he confirmed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the meeting had been asked for by them – by the 
Hawks – or you had asked for it or your side had asked for it? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
Chair 
I 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
Mr von Gericke had called them or they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Or they had called him for the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but a meeting had taken place but nothing – there 
was nothing of any significance that came out of it? 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Hawks have never said to you we need some 
more information or your statements are not adequate or your affidavits 
are not adequate or there is something that you affidavits do not clarify 
or they have never said anything like that to you? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No Chair absolutely not.  I mean we are 
willing and able to assist whenever – whenever – if anyone needs any 
information we are willing and able to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Whether it is Werksmans whether it is 
20 
Transnet whether it is the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you get to know who at – at the Hawks was 
assigned to deal with the matter? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes Chair.  So the actual statement was 
signed in front of Lieutenant Colonel Percy Koekeman of the Germiston 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 32 of 89 
 
Branch of the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What is his name? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  In paragraph 52 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Of my statement – you will see in the last 
sentence Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  It is Lieutenant Colonel Percy Koekeman 
for the Germiston Branch and then Chair in the next paragraph you will 
see a Captain Frank Rangwashi (?) … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Came to visit Rowlen von Gericke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it may be that they have a lot of work – a 
lot on their hands but one would have expected that at least they would 
keep you informed about what is happening particularly – it is 
particularly important that they should keep – you know – people who 
have submitted complaints to them informed because there are all kinds 
of allegations against some of the law enforcement agencies that for 
some time they were not pursuing matters that they should be pursuing 
and so on.  So to deal with that it is important that they should keep 
20 
people who submit complaints to them informed so that those people 
know that something is happening – you know – because otherwise if 
people think that they submit complaints to them for investigation and 
nothing happens people lose confidence in them.  So, okay thank you. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Thank you Chair. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 33 of 89 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Gonsalves I just want to conclude 
your testimony by referring you to something that does not appear to be 
quite clear from your testimony.  You referred to the two BEX you 
remember?  I mean you identified the one as the real BEX that might be 
having capacity and necessary resources that you can engage in the 
transaction of that magnitude but you said that after you were finished 
with the relevant documents of this other BEX - for want of a better 
word I will say that you know - the one with one Director.  Now did you 
at any stage as the minority shareholders engage with this you know 
the real BEX in order to find out as to what was happening?  What was 
10 
the distinction between these two entities and why were you misled as 
you have testified to the Chair? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair you must realise that we only 
saw these agreements after they had been signed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So when we – when BEX was first 
mentioned to us in that April 2015 Board Meeting a document was put 
on the table that purported to show BEX’s capabilities and there were 
great colour photographs of roads and bridges and trains etcetera 
showing the expertise of BEX but subsequently obviously we know that 
20 
they never signed with that BEX entity and so it appears – I think – 
amaBhungane did an investigation and it seems that there was a 
hijacking.  In other words they just used that company.  Now whether 
they did it to try and fool CNR South Africa or whether they tried to fool 
us as the minority Directors I do not know what the intent was but it 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 34 of 89 
 
was obvious that they had hijacked this company and that the intention 
was never to sign an agreement with this company and – but rather to 
form a new company.  Have a very similar name so there is confusion 
and unless someone was astute and awake they had probably think that 
they were dealing with the same entity - BEX - but you will see that the 
names are different – slightly different and – but the registration 
number is very different and the new BEX – the second BEX – is a 
company – a shelf company just newly appointed a Director, never 
traded and that is the entity that they had signed a contract with. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I mean surely flowing from that evidence 
10 
this could have not – not have been a sheer mistake.  It appears that 
there was an effort to place what appeared to be the real BEX before 
the minority shareholders while whoever did that knew that this other 
BEX – the second BEX – was the one that they intended to conclude 
the agreement with. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair from – from what we can see in 
the evidence in front of us someone took the time and effort to try and 
create the impression that there was a contract that was being signed 
with – with the real BEX company.  It – it seems to me it is definitely 
deliberate.  It is not an error.  If I was a Director of CNR South Africa 
20 
and I was signing a contract – an agreement – with an entity and I was 
going to be paying them initially a fee of R370 million that went down to 
R67 million and I must just add on the R67 million.  It was R67 million 
plus VAT of 9.4 million.  I doubt whether BEX ever paid the VAT across.  
So we are actually talking about R76 million.  I would have made sure 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 35 of 89 
 
that from – just from a FICA purpose that I was doing the correct work 
on it and it would be very apparent that I was dealing with a shelf 
company which would have concerned me and they had the document in 
front of them.  So they have actually shown us that they had the BEE 
Certificate and they CIPC document.  So they know that they signed an 
agreement with – with an entity that had just been newly formed and 
never traded before. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now what I want to understand 
also which is not - which is not apparent from – you know your 
statement is we are dealing here with – you know – I am now talking 
10 
about your company.  There must be obviously policies pertaining to 
procurement of good and services.  How was this BEX – you know – 
presented to the minority shareholders?  You know what was the 
justification?  How were they appointed in order to provide any service 
for that matter?  I mean you have told the Chair clearly that within your 
entity itself there were resources that could have actually undertaken 
the task but in this regard here is BEX.  Let us assume that you 
required those services.  Ordinarily how would that company be 
engaged? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair that is absolutely correct.  I 
20 
mean one of the reasons why we descented as Directors is we said that 
there were no tender procedures.  Why did they not get quotes from 
other consultancies?  If they really needed someone and they thought 
that within their shareholder base they never had the expertise to 
formulate a claim why did they not get quotes from other consultants 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 36 of 89 
 
and the argument was that no other consultants would do this on a risk 
basis and that BEX was doing it on a risk basis.  They would only be 
paid a success fee and everyone else would charge a fixed fee and 
therefore they thought this was preferable.  We obviously thought that 
this was laughable given that BEX would possibly earn a fee of R370 
million.  We said that – we thought that there were other entities far 
more competent than BEX that would have done the work for far less 
than R370 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And – and if I may just add – I mean – 
10 
there are other examples where for example we insisted as Directors 
that the company implement a transfer pricing policy and for that they 
went out and got quotes from a few of the auditing firms.  So for that – 
you know – for that piece of work they followed these procedures and 
got quotes but for this massive amount paid to BEX they did not get 
quotes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now lastly I want to take you back to the 
meeting between the minority shareholders and Transnet officials.  
Firstly the obvious question was that – was that meeting recorded?  Is 
there a minute to that meeting? 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To the best of your recollection. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I think there would probably have 
been an email from us subsequent to that meeting to the other 
Directors in Endinamix as a report back. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 37 of 89 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  During that meeting did this raise 
any eyebrows or did any of the officials of – you know – Transnet – you 
know – appear to be taking this matter very serious because I mean 
these are serious issues that you are speaking about.  You are even 
taking to the level of being a bribe that was to be entitled by an entity 
and the amounts kept on escalating.  Those are serious.  I mean one 
would have expected that there must – must have been serious steps – 
you know – undertaken in that regard.  What was your sense – you 
know – of that meeting after you have concluded with the officials? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair Mr Gama – the CEO did appear 
10 
to be alarmed at it and he even made a comment that if Transnet paid 
an amount to CNR South Africa there is a possibility that Transnet 
could have paid other amounts to other OEMs and – so he genuinely 
seemed concerned.  I did yesterday give evidence that he had signed 
the acceptance of the variation order.  That was a – a year earlier and 
it is a possibility that he had forgotten that he had signed it.  I mean it 
is a significant amount of R647 million.  So it is a possibility that he 
did.  He seemed - the other Executives did not seem too perturbed 
about it.  I would expected a much bigger stronger reaction from 
Executives when approached by shareholders in – in one of the OEMs 
20 
with so much evidence in front of them. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And – and most will take into account 
the – the money involved? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolutely Chair.  I mean we are talking 
about a massive amount of R647 million and I am not sure whether the 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 38 of 89 
 
OEM – other OEMs are involved.  If they are then maybe that double 
that amount or treble or even four times that amount.  We could be 
talking about a significant amount. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Any other issue that you wish to 
highlight having testified and – you know – furnish the Chair with the 
facts as you did in your statement and also amplified it in your oral 
testimony.  Is there any other thing that you might wish to highlight 
arising from – you know – this transaction and all the parties that were 
involved or engaged in it? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No Chair I think I have – I hopefully 
10 
covered everything.  I have taken a lot of time and effort to put this 
testimony together.  It is over a long period and there are a lot of 
documents involved, and we hope that we’ve done it to the best of our 
ability and I think it was Edmund Burke who said now all it takes in 
order for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing and we hope that 
we’ve done something that will try and address this what appears to be 
a very corrupt transaction. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair that concludes our questions for 
this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Now in terms of the arrangement that 
20 
BEX had made with your consortium in terms of the majority 
shareholders they were to get about half or maybe a little more than 
half of what Transnet was going to pay so do you know whether out of 
the R647million a certain portion came to the consortium in terms of 
that arrangement or whether it – that all went to BEX? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 39 of 89 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No Chair of the R647million it all went to 
the consortium initially but half of it was paid upfront and the other half 
was paid in instalments over a period I think of two years, it’s the 
variation order, the details and the file I can probably find it, I think it’s 
Annexure 12 or 14, it’s got the details on there, perhaps we can turn to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that again? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I will find it now, yes Chair it’s 
page 261. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair under point 2 the proposed 
payment terms 50% of it is payable within ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Within 40 days. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Within 40 days and the other within 24 
equal instalments of 13.4million, because this was signed obviously in 
2015, the full amount has already been received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the whole amount was to be paid to the 
consortium and then in turn the consortium would then pay BEX the 
agreed portion? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct Chair and then they received an 
20 
invoice from BEX for R67million plus VAT and that is on – I will try and 
find it now, Annexure 13 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So you will see Chair Annexure 13 is a 
BEX invoice for an amount of – it actually says R647million minus 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 40 of 89 
 
R580million benchmark, so the fee R67million plus VAT of 9.4 so 
R76.5million was paid to BEX and Chair we did ask the question it also 
seems odd why the agreement spoke about an amount of R100million 
and there was an amount of R67million and what we were told was that 
the BEX fee was then also going to be paid 50% up front and 
instalments and they were going to get R100million that way and they 
rather said can you pay us upfront and we will reduce it R67million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so ultimately BEX could R67million? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Plus VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Plus VAT ja. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Plus VAT Chair ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so therefore we are dealing with a situation – so 
the real entity from which Transnet should recover this R647million if 
indeed there was no lawful cause for it to be paid is your consortium? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that’s absolutely correct so we as 
minority shareholders we have requested that the company we pay the 
full R647million back to Transnet and pursue BEX in respect of the 
R67million plus VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it’s a very strange situation.  Transnet pays a lot 
of money to a company under circumstances which the minority 
20 
shareholders of that company say we are part of the company, we are 
minor shareholders we know of no lawful cause why you should pay this 
amount, please tell us why you should pay this amount to our company.  
They don’t tell you.  You ask the majority shareholders you say please 
tell us we are part of the company, we don’t know of any lawful cause 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 41 of 89 
 
why Transnet should pay our company this amount, tell us why, they 
don’t tell you.   
 
Transnet doesn’t take any action to recover the money, they 
don’t come back to you to say no actually this is the reason, we don’t 
know why the majority shareholders didn’t tell you, there is a lawful 
cause, this is the cause.  You go to the Hawks, you tell them exactly 
the same, you give them affidavits, you say we’re talking about money 
that has been paid to our company, we’re saying there was no reason 
for it to be paid it’s taxpayers money, please take action, there must be 
prosecution, investigate.  The take the affidavits, there is one meeting 
10 
a year and a half later you don’t know what’s happening, you have not 
been told of anything, there’s been no arrest, you have not been told 
that no you are mistaken, we have actually interviewed the majority 
shareholders, they have told us the reason for the payment, there is a 
lawful cause, that hasn’t happened.  It’s quite strange isn’t it? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I think you’ve summarised it very, 
very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How does it take a year and a half to conclude that 
kind of investigation.  Somebody from within says there is no reason for 
this payment and says you can ask the majority shareholders, we have 
20 
asked them, they haven’t told us, we have gone to Transnet, we have 
asked them, they haven’t told us what the reason is for them paying 
this amount, and a year and a half later you sit there, you don’t know 
what’s happening about this issue.  It’s really a matter of great 
concern. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 42 of 89 
 
 
I think Mr Mokoena the legal team should take steps to be in 
touch with the head of the Hawks, I want to know what’s happening 
about this, and why should it take so long to – for the matter to be 
concluded and I think the legal team can itself alert the Chairman of 
Transnet of this evidence that we have had, and you will also take 
steps to bring this to his attention.   
 
It’s all taxpayers money, it’s your monies, my monies, all our 
money, Transnet is a parastatal, it’s a State owned entity, R647million, 
that’s close to a billion Rand.  You said you were done? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair indeed we are done, we will 
10 
definitely pursue the issues that Chair highlighted and in due course we 
will be able to brief you with the outcome, we will also make sure that 
we liaise with Mr Gonsalves, so that he can also point us to the right 
directions of any other information or officials that he might have 
actually engaged with, with the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have not been told – I have not been told what 
happened, what has happened with regard to the communication that I 
said should be made to the Commission of Police with regard to the 
fact that Major General Booysen gave evidence that it seemed that not 
much was happening or had been happening with regard to any 
20 
disciplinary action or I don’t know whether also and prosecution, but 
certainly disciplinary action with regard to Colonel Madoe, I don’t know 
whether communication has been sent to the Commissioner of Police 
and whether there is any response.  Will the legal team look at that and 
update me. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 43 of 89 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair we will consolidate all those 
issues and we will ensure that we do brief you accordingly as to the 
status. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the older ones mustn’t wait for the new ones, 
the older ones I need to year what the latest is sometime today if 
possible 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That will be done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay once again thank you very much for coming 
forward to give evidence, if need be we will ask you to come back but 
thank you for much and you are excused. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair thank you very much, it’s been an 
absolute pleasure, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair I see that we went past the tea 
adjournment, could we adjourn at this time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes will the next witness be immediately available 
when we resume? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  We will take the tea adjournment now 
and resume at twenty to twelve.  We adjourn. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Molefe. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 44 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  I am Chair the next witness that we will be 
calling is Mr Sharla Chetty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And before we start with Ms Chetty’s 
evidence Chair there are just a few preliminary points that we wish to 
bring to the Chair’s attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  In relation to the evidence to be heard today.  
Ms Chetty’s evidence relates to the recommendation of the award of the 
network services agreement to Neotel and there has of course been 
10 
prior evidence given before the Chair relating to this contract and 
which evidence will undoubtedly assist in truncating Ms Chetty’s 
evidence as there is corroboration in this respect.  However there has 
not been any direct evidence from the decision maker who gave the – 
who made the decision in respect of the recommendation of the award 
to Neotel.  And so Chair that really is the pertinence of Ms Chetty’s 
evidence as she will be speaking to those two main issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the two main issues she will be testifying 
on? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Well the first – the first Chair will be her 
20 
involvement as the decision maker in the award of the – in the 
recommendation of the award of the contract to Neotel.  Secondly she 
will touch briefly on the circumstances surrounding the overturning of 
her decision and her view on same as those matters were covered in a 
document that she will be referring to.   
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 45 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course her involvement the first issue we do know 
she was involved, is it not?  She made the decision? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the decision that was overturned by Mr 
Brian Molefe? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What more does she need to say about that? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Insofar as her involvement she gives the 
basis upon which she reached the decision in approving the 
recommendation of the award of the contract. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Because this was one of the basis upon 
which Mr Molefe sought to overturn the award of the Neotel contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well we can look at that and maybe she should 
give evidence but one of the witnesses I think it may have been Mr 
Volmink. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Testified to whether or not Mr Brian Molefe was 
entitled to revisit that decision and from what I heard it appeared to me 
it was just a question of – seemed to be a question of law. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Well indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether if – if the power is given to somebody who 
holds a certain position and at a certain time you are not there and 
somebody is acting in your position whether you can – when you come 
back you can come back after the person has exercised that power and 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 46 of 89 
 
say no I will reverse that or not.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Indeed so Chair.  However Ms Chetty’s 
evidence does relate what the Chair has referred to as possibly a point 
of legal argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Ms Chetty bridges the gap that currently 
exists in the evidence in respect of Neotel because there has been – 
there has not been given – been any direct evidence from the decision 
maker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Who was involved in the approval of the 
award to Neotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And so it is just that gap that Ms Chetty’s 
evidence would be bridging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm we did have some document that gave the 
reasons did we not?  That is obviously she can give us more meat but 
am I right to say there was a document which indicated … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  There was certainly Chair how... 
CHAIRPERSON:  The basis of the decision. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was in lieu of something. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  There was – there was a report Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  That was prepared in respect of the different 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 47 of 89 
 
evaluations stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  But of course as a decision maker Ms Chetty 
would have to apply her mind to – to that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Otherwise it would be rubber stamping. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So it is that basis upon which she approved 
the recommendation of the award that we will be looking at today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  I think let her testify about the 
10 
basis of her decision but I am not sure other than that whether there is 
really much else that she would be dealing with without repeating what 
other witnesses have said. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Well certainly Chair the second aspect which 
she would have been dealing with in very minor detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Would be her opinion of the basis upon which 
Mr Molefe sought to overturn the decision and she does so because 
those were matters that were covered in the report that was presented 
to her by the respective evaluation teams and she has formed the 
20 
opinion that this has been covered in those reports that she considered 
when she made the decision to recommend the award to Neotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay let us go and let us see. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  As it pleases you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 48 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  May I request the witness to sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Sharla Chetty. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objections to making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly declare that the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth, nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm? 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I truly affirm. 
REGISTRAR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Hm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Ms Chetty please refer to the bundle that is 
before you.  Chair we have marked this bundle as Exhibit BBC – BB6 
rather pardon me Chair and it is – it is before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing Ms Sharla Chetty’s 
statement will be marked as Exhibit BB6. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank yo. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Ms Chetty please refer to page 1 to 7 of the 
statement?  Is that your statement to the commission? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes it is. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 49 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And on page 7 of that bundle is that your 
signature appearing on that page? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes it is. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The dale of the 12 April 2019 is that the date 
on which you signed the statement? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes it is. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Are there are corrections that you wish to 
make on the statement? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I think it was just a spelling error on page 1 and 
the reference to 17.1 the tier report should have actually been the 
10 
memorandum. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay let us start with the first one.  We are 
on page 1 of the bundle. We are at page 1 which paragraph? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Paragraph 2. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the correction? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  It is a chartered accountant it says chartered 
account. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the second correction that you 
wish to … 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is on page 6 paragraph 17.1 should be 
20 
based on paragraph 11 of the memorandum that was submitted with the 
tier report. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Chair we will prepare a 
supplementary in this respect.  Do you now confirm the correctness of 
your statement? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 50 of 89 
 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I do. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Ms Chetty what qualifications do you hold? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I am a chartered accountant. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And when did you qualify as a chartered 
accountant? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  In 2000. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What do you currently do for a living? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I am currently employed in Transnet Port 
Terminals as the Chief Information Officer. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And for how long have you been a Chief 
10 
Information Officer> 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  For one year and four months. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  When did you join Transnet? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  In 2003. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what other positions have you held in 
Transnet? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I have held various positions but the senior 
executive positions that I have held Chief Executive of Transnet 
Pipelines, Chief Financial Officer of Transnet Pipelines and Chief 
Financial Officer of Transnet Port Terminals. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And these various roles that you have played 
in Transnet what portfolios if any have you managed? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I have managed the finance portfolio.  I have 
managed the IT portfolio and the Procurement portfolio. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what would you say your experience in 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 51 of 89 
 
relation to high value tenders is having been with Transnet for – since 
the year 2003 as you have stated? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So I have a substantial amount of experience 
with high value tenders and I have been in directly involved in finalising 
quite a few of the high value tenders in my career at Transnet. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes now from paragraph 5 of your statement 
on page 2 of the bundle you deal with the circumstances relative to the 
involvement – to your involvement in the Neotel matter, is that correct? 
 MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is right. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And this is premised on your acting capacity 
10 
as the group of – the Group Chief Executive of Transnet? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is right. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can you take the Chair through this 
acting appointment insofar as the delegations that you have referred to 
in that paragraph? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So I was acting in the period of – from the – 
sorry from the 28 October to the 1 November 2013 and that delegation 
gave me full authority to act as the Group Chief Executive of Transnet. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So if I understand it correctly and you have 
attached the delegation of authority as an Annexure 1 to your statement 
20 
you had all the powers of authority that were vested in Mr Brian Molefe, 
is that correft? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now you then speak in paragraph 6 of a 
memorandum that you received for the approval of the procurement 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 52 of 89 
 
process which has now become common knowledge and in that 
paragraph you speak of approval being sought from you.  Can you take 
the Chair through this aspect? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So I received documents via an email to 
approve the award of the tender for the network services – services to 
Neotel and I was given the tier report together with the internal audit 
reports and the letters of regret and the letter for award to Neotel to 
sign.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes can we turn to page 11 of the bundle 
please?  Is that the memorandum you have referred to? 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And do you confirm that it is directed to you 
as the acting Group Chief Executive? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And it is dated the 30 October 2013? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The memorandum also states to be from 
Mohammed Mahomedy who is cited as the acting Group Chief Financial 
Officer, Mantsika Matooane who is cited as the Chief Information 
Officer, Garry Pita who is cited as the Group Chief Supply Chain 
20 
Officer, is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  If you go to the page of that memorandum 
which is page 17 of the bundle.  Several signatories appear at the 
bottom of that page 17 just after the topic compiled by. Are these the 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 53 of 89 
 
persons who comprised the CFET? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  These were the heads of the subject matter 
[indistinct) to the various departments.  So they were part of the team 
but not the entire team 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and these persons who are cited as 
signatories can you just for the record state the positions that they 
have held – that they held at that point? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Mandla Dube was the Group Strategic 
Sourcing which is the part of the procurement team.  Fanie Van Der 
Walt was also Group Strategic Sourcing which is part of the 
10 
procurement team and Gerrie Van Der Westhuizen was the Executive 
Manager is the office of the CIO.  Peter Volmink Executive Manager 
Governance and Compliance.  Yusuf Lunat was the Executive Manager 
for the ICT or the EMIS Service Delivery Function.  And then Garry Pita 
the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer, Mantsika Matooane the Chief 
Commission Officer and then Mohammed Mahomedy the acting Group 
Chief Financial Officer. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and all these signatories as appears on 
that page recommended the recommendation made in that specific 
memorandum? 
20 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now let us please turn to page 19 of the 
bundle.  And that is Annexure 3 which starts on the preceding page, 
page 18.  Are you there Ms Chetty? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I am. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 54 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At the very bottom of page 19 appears to be 
an email.  Fropm whom was this email received? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  The email was received from Gerrie Van Der 
Westhuizen. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is the content of that email about? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  The email covered the tender that Mr Pita had 
called me about.  He called me prior to me receiving the tender 
documents.  He – the documents that were emailed to me was the 
covering memorandum, the Tier Report, the three internal audit reports 
and the supporting documents which was the affidavit from T-Systems 
10 
to mitigate the risk, the email from National Treasury to mitigate the 
risk.  The board resolution with the delegated authority to the GCE to 
extend the current contract to Neotel.  Extension letters to Neotel.  
Letter of intent to Neotel and the three – sorry the four regret letters to 
the unsuccessful bidders. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  From paragraph 9 of your statement on 
page 3 of the bundle you then begin to set out the circumstances and 
the basis upon which you considered the submissions that were made 
to you as the acting Chief Group Chief Executive pardon me.  Can you 
please take the Chair through this? 
20 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So in arriving at my decision I had a telecom 
with Mr Pita.  Mr Pita then took me through the documents that had 
been emailed to me.  So we had gone through the Tier Report which is 
the very important Evaluation Report that takes you to the various 
stages of the tender process and whether there was compliance or not 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 55 of 89 
 
to the processes.  We then went through to the internal audit reports.  I 
even noticed the issue around the risks that were highlighted around 
the conflict of interest with T-Systems and the other company that was 
involved in developing the strategy for networking.  And thereafter we 
would have gone through the – the recommendation with the relevant – 
with the other relevant documents that were associated with the – with 
the Tier Report. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Can you then turn to page 23 of the 
bundle and that would be Annexure 4 to your statement.   
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Okay. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is that the Tier Report to which you refer? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes that is the Tender Evaluation and 
Recommendation Report. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now in paragraph 11 and particularly 11.1 
and 11.12 of your statement you speak of this process that you 
engaged in considering the Tier Report? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now in relation to the rounding of scores as 
you have referred to we have heard the evidence for Mr Volmink in this 
respect and we need not repeat that evidence as it has been ventilated 
20 
in detail.  In respect of your reliance on the Gateway Reports you refer 
to page 19 of the Tier Report.  And this appears at paragraph 11.2 of 
your statement.  Page 19 of the report is at our paginated bundle page 
41.   
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes Advocate.

ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please explain the basis of your 
reliance upon the Gateway Report – Gateway Review Report aspect 
that – pardon me – that the Tier Report sets out.  
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So the Gateway Reports are – Gateway Review 
Reports are very important reports that give you confidence or give you 
some sort of a comfort that each stage of the tender process was 
complied with.  So the reports were agreeing except for one aspect that 
addressed the rounding of issue and the conflict of interest with T-
Systems.  And it indicated that the risks were mitigated around those. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and who compiles the Gateway Review 
10 
Reports? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Those are compiled by the internal auditors. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Of Transnet? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Staying on the Tier… 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way is – is it in respect of this tender that 
there is a high court judgment or is that a different tender?  Tender – 
high court judgment relating to T-Systems. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:    Here it is – it is a different – it is a different 
one Chair.  It is a different transaction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you sure? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  As far as I recall.  I will double check but I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if that is the one really in terms of processes 
and all of that has that not been disposed of?  I think it – I think the 
one where there is a high court judgment I think it involves Neotel and 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 57 of 89 
 
or is it Gijima?  Was T-Systems – was T-Systems granted a tender 
where Gijima was also a bidder and subsequently Transnet brought a 
review application that was not opposed and a high court judgment set 
aside the tender to T-Systems and awarded the tender to Gijima. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – that is a different tender? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  It is separate different matter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But really what I am very interested in in terms of this 
10 
witness is why she chose the one and not the other you know.  That is 
what I am very interested in. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes Chair that matter is addressed in the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Why she chose to – to award the tender the way 
she did and – and why she may think that it was wrong for Mr Brian 
Molefe to change that when she has regard to his reasons.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Certainly Chair that is covered in the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So if there is anything that you think I am missing 
20 
you can bring it to my attention but for all intents and purposes I think 
that is really the important part. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course if she has still anything to say about the 
question of authority that does not fall within the legal issue then she 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 58 of 89 
 
can deal with it. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Indeed so Chair and Mr Chetty will be dealing 
with those matters.  The Chair’s microphone is off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine today because it looks like we are not – we 
will not have another witness but there are times when we will be 
needing to go to another witness and we need use our times fruitfully.  
A lot of things that really will not be disputed it is unlike in a court of 
law where one might really have to deal with a lot of things because it 
is the court of law.  So – but that is where my interest is as far as this 
witness is concerned.  If you think there is something else that I am 
10 
missing you must tell me and then we can look at it. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Certainly Chair and we have been mindful of 
that aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Ms Chetty can you please turn to page 28 of 
the bundle.  Still on the Tier Report.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 28? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  28 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Are you there? 
20 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I am. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now on page 28 to 30 of that bundle – of 
those pages in the Tier Report there appears several names of persons 
who were involved in the different four stages of evaluation, is this 
correct? 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 59 of 89 
 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And on my count did a number of over 40 
people who were involved in this process? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And this also includes the internal audit team 
that was involved in this process? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And these would be the number of person 
involved in recommending the award to Neotel? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now in your next topic in your statement you 
deal with the overriding of your decision by Mr Molefe and you touch on 
several issues that Mr Molefe raised in his memorandum which you 
stated to have been addressed in the reports that were provided to you, 
do I have that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  In paragraph 12 of your statement on page 5 
you address yourself to Mr Molefe’s memorandum.   
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please take the Chair through that? 
20 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Chairperson I was made aware of the 
overturning of the decision when I was presented with the evidence by 
the investigators so I was not involved or consulted in any way by Mr 
Molefe in the overturning of the decision.  I want to bring to the 
attention of the Chairperson the fact that Mr Molefe when he had 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 60 of 89 
 
written the memorandum had asked for his decision to be noted.  So he 
did not ask for a revised recommendation or a review of what his risks 
were but he basically had made a decision based on his own – I think 
on his own opinions of what he had thought the risks were at that time 
and awarded it to a bidder even if the price was considered that bidder 
would still have not been the number 1 bidder. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is T-Systems? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What number would they have been? 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  They would still have been number 3 on the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh who would have been number 2? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Dimension Data. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in his reasons did he deal with why he went for 
number 3 and not number 2? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  No he did not.  He basically all he highlighted 
was all the risks around the current service provider which is Neotel 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  But those risks were already well dealt with in 
the Tier Report and in the memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  And also the – I just want to stipulate the 
concentration risk that he refers to if you granted the award to T-
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 61 of 89 
 
Systems which already have the IT data services contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  It would have really increased Transnet’s 
concentration risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes can we then turn to page 88 of the 
bundle which is Mr Molefe’s memorandum to Mr Anoj Singh, Mr 
Mantsika Matooane and Mr Garry Pita.   
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page is it? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Page 88.  And that is Annexure 16.   
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Thank you. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now on page 88 of the bundle in the purpose 
of submission stated by Mr Molefe and perhaps before we even go into 
the memorandum let us go to page 94 which is the last page of that 
memorandum.  And to place it on record that this memorandum was 
drafted by Mr Brian Molefe, do you see that? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And it was signed by him on the 20 November 
2013? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Please speak into the microphone Ma’am? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  And in his purpose of this 
submission he sets out that he seeks to inform the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Group Chief Information Officer and the Group Chief 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 62 of 89 
 
Supply Chain Officer of and I quote: 
“My decisions to award the abovementioned business 
to T-Systems South Africa in terms of your request in 
your memorandum dated 31 October 2013.” 
And going further down to paragraph 2 of his memorandum he sets out 
as his background he says there and I quote: 
“Your previous correspondence addressed to me 
dated 30 October 2013 with subject RFP number 
GSM4/13/04/0722 for provision of network services 
request for approval to approve the process award 
10 
contract and issue a letter of intent inviting Neotel to 
further negotiations as the preferred bidder of this 
RFP.” 
And he states that to be attached as Annexure A and as well attaches 
the Tier Report.  Now in the first opening line Mr Molefe is speaking of 
a memorandum addressed to and I quote “Me” dated October 2013.  Do 
you have any comment to that? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I do.  The memorandum was actually 
addressed to myself in my capacity as Acting GCE at the time.  It was 
not addressed to Mr Brian Molefe. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and that we have seen as you have 
attached as Annexure 2 to your bundle.  Now if we revert back to your 
statement at paragraph 13 on page 5 of the bundle you speak of the 
memorandum reflecting a decision to award the network services 
master, service tender to T-Systems and effectively overturning your 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 63 of 89 
 
decision and you make reference to paragraph 26 and 27 of Mr Molefe’s 
statement. Can you please take the Chair through that - paragraph 13 
on page 5 of the bundle? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So as I did discuss earlier the decision that he 
made was on his own without consulting with any of the people – part 
of the Cross Functioning Evaluation Team or the Recommending 
Officers.  He had made the decision based on his assessment of the 
risk and his assessment of the pricing which was outside – procedurally 
outside the normal procurement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought your statement does say that he appears to 
10 
have met with the recommending of SARS but your concern was that 
what they had to say to him was not reduced to writing? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes.  So there was – there was no indication of 
any discussions that were held to the two parties for or the various 
parties in order to arrive at a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the – to complain that what they discussed 
was not reduced to writing is one thing.  To complain that he did not 
consult them is another thing.  He may have consulted them and had 
their views but their views were not reduced to writing. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which is which? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So it is basically he had not – he had not 
reduced his discussions with them to the writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So is your - is your position therefore that he 
may have consulted but he did not comply with whatever procedure 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 64 of 89 
 
because the procedure requires that their views that they expressed to 
him when he consulted them be reduced to writing? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes Chairperson.  Those – that view is based 
on the fact that per the PPM if there is a decision to overturn or 
overrule a decision made by the Recommending Officers that the 
reasons for that – it is like a dispute being lodged - has to be referred 
back to the Cross Function Sourcing Team or the Evaluation Team to 
then 
to 
review 
those 
reasons 
and 
then 
come 
back 
with 
a 
recommendation.  It is not common practice that one would overturn a 
decision, not have the recommendations in front of your remotivation as 
10 
to why that decision was actually – whether you really consulted with 
all the Recommending Officers in making that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you need to make a distinction – I say that so 
that you can clarify the position to me maybe much more than you may 
have tried to do.  There is a difference between somebody who must 
make a decision being given recommendations by another Body or 
another person and making his or her decision after having regard to 
the recommendation and that person may accept – may make his or her 
decision in accordance with the recommendation or against the 
recommendation.  That is one scenario.  The scenario that we are 
20 
dealing with is a situation where you had made the decision, okay.  Is 
that right? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had made the decision.  When you made the 
decision there was a recommendation or there were recommendations 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 65 of 89 
 
in front of you.  Is that right? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so what you are talking about does it apply to 
the situation we are dealing with the provision that you say says the 
person must go back to the recommending officials?  Does it apply 
when a decision has already been taken by the person who holds the 
power to make the decision? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your understanding of the – of what the 
procedures are at Transnet? 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So my understanding of the proceedings 
Chairperson is that once a decision has been made generally that 
decision is not overturned unless there is something materially that you 
really have not considered and that obviously would have to go back to 
the Recommending Officers that made the decision but in my – in – in 
this particular case the decision had been made by myself and about 20 
days later that decision been overturned but overturned without any 
resubmission to that office.  So you – you – if there is something 
material that happened in that 20 day period that you could say was 
never something that was even considered during the bidding process.  
20 
That was a new material risk that has arisen you are allowed to look at 
whether that award would continue or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so your – your evidence is that there was 
nothing wrong with Mr Brian Molefe overturning your decision as long 
as he followed the procedure that you understand to be applicable?  
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 66 of 89 
 
You say he was allowed in certain circumstances to overturn - he would 
have been allowed in certain circumstances to overturn your decision.  
Is that what you are saying? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Chairperson what I am saying is that if there 
is a material risk - in any award that we do currently – if there is a 
material risk that has arisen after the award has been made that could 
jeopardise the organisation that award has to be relooked at so that 
you could mitigate – see whether that risk can be mitigated or not.  If it 
cannot be mitigated then obviously you will have to go back to that 
Evaluation Team and look at maybe the other bidders. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No but let us not talk in general.  I am talking 
about Mr Brian Molefe and I am talking about the … 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So – so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes) came before you and you made a 
decision. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  
So 
Chairperson 
in 
this particular case 
Mr Molefe the risk that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he have the power have to change your decision? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether he was not justified in changing.  That is a 
20 
different question.  Did he have the power generally speaking to 
change the decision if a certain situation existed? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I believe he would have the power Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He would have the power? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 67 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your understanding? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you know under what circumstances he could 
exercise that power? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Chairperson generally that will only be done in 
cases where there is a material risk to the organisation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That has not been evaluated or even 
considered that arose – a brand new risk that arose directly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Afterwards. 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  After we made the award and if you look at 
Mr Molefe’s memorandum all the risks that he highlighted had already 
been covered and mitigated substantially in the Tier Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So the risk that he had – had and the reasons 
he had given for overturning were not justified in my opinion 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you know whether in a situation where 
somebody has the power to make a decision on a tender and has made 
the decision whether the same person – whether the power to change 
20 
that decision resides with the same person or with the same – with the 
person occupying the same position or whether it can only be changed 
by a higher authority within the organisation?  So if – in other words 
the – the procedure that you have told me about if – let us say it was 
Mr Brian Molefe who had made the original decision in this case not 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 68 of 89 
 
you would he have been entitled to say no I want it back.  I want to 
change my decision under circumstances or would he have needed to 
report to somebody higher like the Board or a certain Committee of the 
Board and say no I made this decision on such and such a day in 
regard to this tender.  It has since been brought to my attention that 
the following has happened or is the position something maybe I did not 
know at the time.  Could you please change it that is now in the Board 
somebody higher or would he be free to change it himself? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So – so Chairperson because the authority was 
delegated to him by the Board and he wants to change a decision that 
10 
he made based on the authority granted to him by the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Ideally he will have to go back to the Board if 
he wanted to revert that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Because that delegation of power was granted 
to him by the Board and was concurred by the – the Board Acquisitions 
and Disposals Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well your – I understand your answer but the 
reason you give I am not sure that it supports it because if the Board 
20 
has delegated the – the power to him it may have been intended that he 
should exercise the power. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Ja, we have had – because - Chair because this 
is an unusual circumstance where you actually overturning a decision 
that you have made based on the power that you were delegated … 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 69 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I would think that because it is such a high 
value tender you may have to go back to the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Maybe from a reporting perspective … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  To say – you know – I need to retract this 
decision and leave out the material risk why I need to retract that 
decision but it is not – it is not governed in any document or in our 
PPM – our Procurement Procedure Manual – or any of the documents 
10 
that I am aware of that one has to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  But I think one has to apply their mind from a 
sound governance perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm but your evidence is that in terms of Transnet 
procedures and rules and so on he was entitled to change the decision 
in certain circumstances … 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say if something arose after the decision had 
been – you – had been made? 
20 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that put the organisation at risk and so on? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Chetty can I please 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 70 of 89 
 
refer you to page 12 of your bundle and that is the memorandum that 
was submitted to you for the approval of the recommendation to appoint 
Neotel.  At paragraph 6 of that memorandum that is the delegation that 
you have just spoken of in terms of which power or rather subject to the 
approval of BADC the power to – the authority to approve the sourcing 
strategy RFP, advert and award was delegated to the Group Chief 
Executive Officer.  Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And at the last line on that paragraph the 
BADC resolution had delegated this authority to the Group Chief 
10 
Executive.  Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can we then turn to page 262 of the bundle 
and that would be the Procurement Procedure Manual?  We will just be 
referring briefly to one aspect in that manual.  Are you there? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I am. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At paragraph 20.5 the heading there is 
“Disagreement Regarding Award of Business”.  Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now at 20.5.1 it states there that: 
20 
“Should a dispute arise between the Recommending 
Officers and the AC - being the Acquisition Council 
- regarding a submission after the AC has referred 
the matter back to the Recommending Officer for 
remotivation the matter must be escalated to the 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 71 of 89 
 
entity CEO for a final decision.” 
Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And it also talks about – it goes further to 
talk about the recommendation of the Evaluation Team: 
“If that is in conflict with the opinion of the end user 
the matter must be referred back to the AC for a 
ruling.” 
Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now if we refer to Mr Molefe’s memorandum 
can we please go to – to page 92 at page – at paragraph 7 rather of his 
– so that would be Annexure 16 in the bundle and we will be referring 
to page 92 at paragraph 7.  Are you there? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I am. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Mr Molefe states there that: 
“I have the following specific concerns with your 
recommendation …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you say we must go to page 16 of the 
bundle? 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  No, no Chair Annexure 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexure 15? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  16 – 1-6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-6, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And we are at page 92 Chair. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 72 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  We will start with paragraph 6 of Mr Molefe’s 
memorandum where he states there: 
“I have given consideration to your recommendation 
as per your previous correspondence mentioned 
earlier.” 
Now if we were to turn back to the first page of that memorandum at 
paragraph 2 and we have already covered this issue.  Mr Molefe refers 
to the memorandum as having been addressed to him.  Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And if we were to – we refer to your Annexure 
2 it is clear that the memorandum is – is directed to you as the Acting 
Group Chief Executive.  Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now when we consider the procedure – the 
Procurement Procedure Manual together with the delegation to the 
Group Chief Executive the result would be that in the result of a 
dispute the matter would be referred by Mr Molefe back to himself.  Is 
that not the case? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes it is.  That is the case because powers 
20 
have been delegated to him by the AC and he is also the CE.  So 
matters are being referred back to him. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and that would be logical insofar as good 
governance is concerned? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I would say that is illogical. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 73 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  In terms of governance. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE: 
 
Now 
going 
back 
to 
paragraph 
6 
of 
Mr Molefe’s memorandum … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What is illogical?  Let me understand 
that. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Chairperson the – this particular paragraph 
in terms of Section 25 of the Procurement Procedure Manual it says 
that if you have a dispute between the Recommending officer and the 
AC that matter must be referred back by the AC and then the final 
10 
decision gets made by the CE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Now in this case all powers from the AC have 
been delegated to Mr Molefe or the GCE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So he basically will be the final decision maker 
because it is illogical that there is no AC involved here now anymore 
because powers have been delegated to Mr Molefe.  So if he is 
disputing it he refers it back to the Recommending Officers and then he 
still makes a final decision.  There is no intermediate party like the AC 
20 
involved here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Which of a high value tender is – it is kind of 
illogical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But assuming that he is in power to deal with it if he 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 74 of 89 
 
did differently would he not be acting outside of the procedures?  Was 
there any other way prescribed in which he could deal with it other than 
dealing with it in that way if he was to comply with the procedures? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words was it his mistake or was it the 
mistake of the procedures because if that is what the procedure 
required then it is not his mistake.  It is the mistake of those who 
drafted the manual. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Chair I would say it is a mistake of maybe – it 
is my opinion – the AC of granting him full authority. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Chair I would say it is in my opinion maybe a 
mistake of the AC for granting him full delegation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Where there is no intermediate party involved 
when there are disputes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Because he is a sole decision maker in this – in 
this aspect and basically there is no intermediate body that can 
evaluate whether the recommending – recommendation from the 
20 
Recommending Officers should be disputed or not disputed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – but – so on the – on – on – as far as you 
know on the procedures that were applicable once the delegation was 
given to him it had to be dealt with in that way? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes.  He complied based on what was 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 75 of 89 
 
delegated to him Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm – but that procedure is it applicable before the 
authority that has power to make the decision has made the decision 
before he or she makes the decision or does it apply after the authority 
or person who has the authority has decided?  I – I have a sense that 
what maybe contemplated but I have not checked.  What may be 
contemplated is that if the power to decide on a tender vests in you and 
you have got recommendations from other people who are making a 
recommendation that you should award the tender to A and you take a 
different view you think the award should be – the tender should be 
10 
awarded to B.  You should go back to them before you make the 
decision so that you ask them what about this what about that.  You tell 
them your concerns and you hear what they have to say.  Maybe they 
will say oh we overlooked that.  You are right or they will say we 
actually did consider that but not – that notwithstanding we came to 
this conclusion because of A, B, C, D but then you must still make – 
make your decision whether having interacted with them like that you 
stick to your view that the tender should be awarded to B or you agree 
with them that it should be awarded to A.  I have a sense or a suspicion 
that maybe that is what it is talking about but I have not checked.  Do 
20 
you know whether it applies to that situation or it applies to the 
situation were a decision has been taken? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So this is before a decision has been taken.  So 
this particular paragraph of the Procurement Procedure Manual refers 
to before you make your decision … 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 76 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  And you have got – still got a recommendation 
at hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY: 
 
That 
if 
you 
are 
not 
happy 
with 
the 
recommendation you do not believe it is covered all the points you can 
send it back to the Recommending Officers for them to come and 
remotivate based on new things that you have highlighted to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  In this case there is no resubmission or 
10 
anything but the award was already made on 31 October by myself 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is after the fact and he does not indicate 
any new material risk that could have resulted in overturning of the 
decision.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  He supplied the paragraph 20.5 but why – why I 
said it was illogical goes to the fact that – you know – he made the 
decision on his own but it is also after the award was made.  So it is … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  It is not exactly what the – the paragraph was 
aimed to do.  It was aimed to finalise your decision before – you know – 
arriving at … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 77 of 89 
 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Before you arrive at that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if you are correct in that then I would understand 
that.  I would understand that but I would not see it as illogical because 
all it would mean is that it recognises that there are people who have 
dealt with the matter before it comes before you.  They have 
considered it.  They have made recommendations and I assume they 
would give reasons for their motivation.  It simply says if you are not 
persuaded to go this - to take their – to accept their recommendation 
just go back to them, put your concerns to them, hear what they have to 
say, then make a decision. 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you make the decision you can go with 
their recommendation or go against it but you have had the – you have 
– you have followed a process where you give them a chance to 
address your concerns.  You have heard what they have to say and you 
make a decision on an informed basis.  So that would not be logical to - 
illogical to me. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes.  Chairperson the part with illogical was the 
EC granting full delegation and not having any element by the PPM 
where you could resort to where a Body can review and -and check that 
20 
– you know – the recommendation from the Officers.  You have taken 
into account all the motivations, all the reasons.  So I think that is the 
part where I refer to as illogical in my opinion Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you.  Ms Molefe. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Can we go back to page 92 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 78 of 89 
 
if you had moved from there – 92 of the bundle?  Are you there? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At paragraph 7 of that memorandum 
Mr Molefe 
lists 
the 
several 
concerns 
that 
he 
had 
with 
the 
recommendation that you had approved – well in his paragraph 7 he 
states there: 
“I have the following specific concerns with your 
recommendation and responses to me including the 
responses to me in the various meetings held with 
the Recommending Officers for remotivation.” 
10 
Which is discussed further in this document and those five issues are 
the issues which you address as having been addressed in the 
respective evaluation reports and as well as by the internal audit 
component of Transnet.  Is that correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please take the Chair through those 
five grounds and your reasons for stating that they were not valid 
reasons provided by Mr Molefe? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Chairperson the counterparty risk and 
(indistinct) of state assets that risk was covered quite substantially in 
20 
the memorandum and in the Tier Report.  Where it spoke of the – the – 
if the Competition Commission approved the – the sale to Vodacom that 
Neotel will still continue with their services.  So that could have been 
dealt with contractually between Vodacom and Transnet should that risk 
have materialised.  The concentration risk as Transnet is Neotel’s 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 79 of 89 
 
largest client I think Chairperson I did state earlier that T-Systems also 
is an IT data services provider to Transnet at the time and by awarding 
the contract to them you also would have increased your concentration 
risk.  The BBBE partners – Chairperson as part of your evaluation 
criteria your BEE accreditation is taken into consideration in your 
evaluation points.  So that was already considered.  The information 
security incident that resulted – Chairperson those risks where covered 
in detail in the Tier Report and in the memorandum where it was 
indicated how those risks were being mitigated both by T-Systems and 
by Neotel and how they have increased the – the security for Transnet 
10 
again which could have been dealt with contractually.  The CCTV 
Network issues – Chairperson those are isolated incidence that were 
brought up that could have been dealt with as part of contract 
management with Neotel at that time.  So they were not new risks that 
Mr Molefe had – had addressed but basically highlighted risks that had 
already been covered for and been mitigated in both the Tier Report 
and in the memorandum. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can we then turn to page 93 of that same 
memorandum?  Are you there? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At paragraph 21 Mr Molefe makes reference 
to strict timelines having been set by Transnet.  He says there: 
“Post the close of the final offers been submitted T-
Systems indicated that they unfortunately due to 
the strict timelines set by Transnet only managed to 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 80 of 89 
 
get confirmation from their shareholder on certain 
pricing elements and that they would be in a 
position to reduce the price submitted the week 
before by a further 248 million.” 
As we have heard and as is now common knowledge T-Systems bid was 
unsuccessful due to pricing amongst many of the other matters that you 
have spoken to? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I then refer you to page 36 of the Tier 
Report - paginated page 36 rather? 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  I am there. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  In paragraph 18 of your statement you deal 
with this pricing element relative to – to the Tier Report? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  As well as the possible price reductions that 
are spoke of by Mr Molefe in his memorandum? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please take the Chair through – 
through your opinion in that respect? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before she does that are you able to say anything 
20 
about Mr Brian Molefe’s decision to overturn your decision other than 
that he took a different view on certain matters to the view that you 
took?  Is there anything more you can say about this other than I took 
this view he took that view?  I disagree with him. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Mr Chairperson if I look at how he took his view 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 81 of 89 
 
I would say that it is - it is not in compliance with governance because 
he evaluated his risk.  His pricing that he considered Chairperson you 
cannot consider pricing – revised pricing after your Best And Final 
Offers have been submitted.  So he made decisions (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just go back a bit.  Just start again.  I 
think I missed something.  Just start again your answer. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Mr Chairperson he – the manner in which he 
overturned the decision I would say was – was procedurally not correct.  
By – by that I mean is that he had – said he had consulted with various 
people and these were the risks that he had highlighted but those risks 
10 
were already mitigated.  Then he further goes on to state that the price 
of - of T-Systems need to be reconsidered and their Best And Final 
Offer would be taken into account the 240 million that he refers to.  
Chairperson those are considered as not been fair and transparent in 
the bidding process because you cannot consider pricing once a bid 
has been – your Best And Final Offer has been submitted.  You cannot 
say I need to entertain the bid of – the pricing of one bidder and not – 
not give the opportunity to the other bidders to review their pricing as 
well.  So all of those things make the decision that he has made to 
overturn procedurally unfair and not transparent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk to me about the – not transparent part.  Why are 
you saying they were not transparent? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So – so Mr Chairperson Neotel – sorry – 
T-Systems when they were asked to submit their Best And Final Offer 
they did submit their Best And Final Offer and then they were asked to 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 82 of 89 
 
confirm that offer when given to all the bidders and asked to confirm.  
T-Systems said yes that is my offer but we have been in discussions 
with our – our partner and they are considering giving a further – you 
know – discounted price of 248 million.  Now that could not be 
considered because your Best And Final Offer was already in like all 
other bidders had been given the time period to submit that offer and 
even considering that offer there is still not – they came out still lower 
than Neotel in the pricing.  So if you look at all the evaluation criteria 
which you consider is our commercial and your technical Neotel still 
needed in terms of being the preferred bidder. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I may have heard evidence about something that 
was brought in about after the best offer, best and final offer.  Ms 
Molefe I continue to be concerned about the significance of this 
witness’s evidence. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair, we are nearing the 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I continue to be concerned, you know what my 
concerns are, maybe you can deal with her, lead her evidence in a way 
that removes my concerns. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair, we will be dealing with the 
20 
lat matter in Ms Chetty’s evidence and that’s in relation to the pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, but you must tell me if I am missing 
something.  Feel free to say if you think I am missing something. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 83 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Ms Chetty can we go to page 94 of the 
bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  94. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  94? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And that is Annexure 16, are you there? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I am. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  At paragraph 22 of his memorandum Mr 
10 
Molefe states, and this evidence that has been given, but it becomes 
material insofar as your analysis on the pricing aspect, he says there: 
“I approved that the R248million be taken into consideration as 
part of T-Systems best and final offer as the commitment was 
made in writing to Transnet and shortly after the best and final 
offers have closed, and I don’t believe that any other bidders 
were prejudiced by this.” 
Do you have any comment on this paragraph? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:   Yes Advocate Molefe, the best and final offer 
was – has already closed and he said it was still acceptable to accept 
20 
an offer thereafter, because he believed it didn’t prejudice any of the 
other bidders, but he didn’t give any of the other bidders a chance then 
to because this is a revised offer that is being considered, ideally he 
would give all the other bidders a chance then to revise their offers as 
well or give them opportunities to resubmit their best and final offers. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 84 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and at paragraph 23 of that memo Mr 
Molefe further goes on to say: 
“I further do not believe it is necessary to request another best 
and final offer from any of the vendors as all three preferred 
bidders were given the opportunity to confirm if the prices 
submitted are accurate and if they have omitted anything.” 
And you have just given evidence that in your view as the other bidders 
would not have been given another opportunity as T-Systems, as would 
have been afforded to T-Systems that this would be unfair? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That’s correct Advocate Molefe because the 
10 
other, T-Systems was afforded a bit more time than the other bidders so 
they could have raised an objection to say that they could have done a 
better offer having been given more time. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  And at paragraph 24 and leading to 25 
it says there: 
“As per the Tier report should this R248million be taken into 
account and business not be awarded to Neotel due to the 
risks stated above T-Systems would be the preferred bidder.” 
What is your comment to that? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  He is – Advocate Molefe he is correct in that T-
20 
Systems does come out to be bidder number two if the R248million is 
considered, and if Transnet decides that those risks are new risks and 
they are material risks then the award to T-Systems he would be then 
correct as bidder number one. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and if this R248million is not taken into 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 85 of 89 
 
account? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  T-Systems wouldn’t be bidder number one, if 
you exclude Neotel it would be Dimension Data. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Second to Neotel? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And at paragraph 25 he states there that 
management must ensure that more favourable prices are agreed with 
T-Systems to at least be at a similar level to the prices submitted by 
Neotel as part of the post-tender negotiations, what is your comment to 
that? 
10 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:   So Chairperson you’re allowed to negotiate to 
market related prices, so there is nothing wrong with negotiating to 
market related prices provided that Neotel was excluded on a proper 
basis. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and insofar as this pricing element the 
Tier Report sets that out in the paginated bundle rather at page 36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 36? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Three six Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  36, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And through to page 37. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the evaluation of the prices was divided 
into four different categories, the first one appears on page 36, do you 
have it there? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Yes I do. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 86 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the first price evaluation for network 
services, RFP, would be the consideration of pre-due diligence, is that 
correct? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please take the Chair through the 
evaluation outcome? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So Chairperson if you look at the evaluation 
outcome after – before the due diligence was done bidder number three 
actually higher than bidder number one and bidder number five, bidder 
number three was Dimension Data at that time but it was not 
10 
considered a like for like comparison. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And why was that the case? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  With pricing you’ve got to reach a common 
basis, and make sure that everybody is using the common basis on 
their templates for pricing, so they had to go back to the teams and 
then ask them to re-price on a common basis. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And insofar as the second aspect of the price 
evaluation that appears on paginated page 37 can you take the Chair 
through this second stage which is entitled the post-due diligence? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So the post-due diligence revealed that bidder 
20 
number one, which is Neotel, scored the highest points and T-Systems 
came out to be the second ranked in terms of pricing.  Thereafter, after 
the normalisation exercise was done it was revealed that T-Systems 
came out as the third preferred and Neotel still the first preferred 
bidder from a pricing and normalisation perspective. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 87 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and the post-normalisation would be the 
third category of the pricing evaluation? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what was the outcome in that respect? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  When Neotel was the number one bidder and T-
System ended up being the third preferred bidder. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who was the second preferred bidder? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  It was Dimension Data. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And lastly in respect of the fourth price 
evaluation aspect that was considered can you please take the Chair 
10 
through that? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  So that was basically just an evaluation done to 
say if the 248 was considered where would T-Systems fall and they 
basically came out to be the second right tenderer, but it clearly says 
there that the price reduction could not be taken into account since the 
final pricing had already been submitted. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and that appears immediately above the  
heading the fourth price evaluation? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  I think the last sentence of that entire 
20 
paragraph. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is there any other matter you wish to bring to 
the Chair’s attention in respect of the pricing? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  No there isn’t Chairperson. 
24 MAY 2019 – DAY 98 
 
Page 88 of 89 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is there any other matter you wish to bring to 
the Chair’s attention insofar as the consideration of Neotel against T-
Systems? 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  No Chairperson. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Chair unless there are any other further 
questions I have no further questions for Ms Chetty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Ms Molefe.  Thank you Ms Chetty for 
having come forward to give evidence, you are excused. 
MS SHARLA CHETTY:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair, Mr Mokoena will address 
you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair that concludes the business of 
the day and we resume on Monday with Mr van der Westhuizen as the 
next witness.   
CHAIRPERSON:  How long is he likely to be, will he take more than a 
day? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It’s one day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s one day? 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should we start early or should we not?  We will 
finish within one day, so we can start at ten o’clock. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  At ten o’clock Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, then we will start at ten.  We will adjourn for 
the day and on Monday we will start at ten o’clock, we adjourn.
