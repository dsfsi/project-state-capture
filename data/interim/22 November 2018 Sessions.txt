PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 22 NOVEMBER 2018  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody.  Good morning 
Mr Fuzile. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chairperson.     
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are we not starting with the application that Ms Norman 
sought to move yesterday?    
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Ms Norman is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But Mr Mokoena would be able to deal with the 
10 
applications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, shall we start with it? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh he tells me that he is not ready.  Yes I hope it is not a 
poison pass.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright when should we deal with it then? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair should we deal with them when Ms Norman 
returns?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  She is coming around 12:00, I am told.  There is a 
pressing matter that she had to attend to.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the brief is with Mr Mokoena now, but it will go back or what?   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair may I ask that we proceed with the evidence and 
when Ms Norman comes back she should take the punishment she deserves for not 
been here on time to deal with that application? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us – I think, you and I let us continue with the evidence. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 2 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us leave the head of the legal team to sort out this issue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As to when this application will be heard and whether it will be 
moved by Mr Mokoena or by Ms Norman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us get out of it for now. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just so that neither Mr Mokoena nor Mr Maleka are 
10 
visited with any – a probation on your part for the present state of affairs.  I received a 
telephone call from Ms Norman this morning who said that she would not be here 
today, she is attending a function in Pretoria, but would be back as soon as that 
function was over.  So we were visited as a legal team with a fait accompli in that 
regard and we apologise for any inconvenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the problem is that I said yesterday we would deal with this 
application this morning, that is what I said and if she was not going to be here, she 
should have made sure there is somebody who is ready with it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or to ask that it be stood down or something. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes she did suggest that the application be dealt with by 
others, but Chair a notice is probably required before the application can be given 
justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So that the papers can begot through and preparation, 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 3 of 141 
 
the notice made for the address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will put it aside for now and I assume somebody will talk to me in 
due course as to when it should be dealt with. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I will deal with it in a shortage moment.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you.  Okay Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you very much Chairperson.  Ms Fuzile yesterday 
we ended up on the events of the 9th December and we are going to resume with the 
events of the 10th December.  You begin by describing those events from paragraph 20 
on page 58 of your statement which is in EXHIBIT P.  Do you still have it before you? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I must confess I do not have it and I did not take it home, 
10 
I left it here.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  It must be in one of those bundles.  I will ask my 
colleagues to ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is not hard for me to – if it is here I will find it.  I think it 
was P1 or ...[intervenes] 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  "P". 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you may as well Mr Fuzile bring the others closer in case they 
are needed in the course of your evidence.  I think somebody wanted to – the place to 
20 
look, organised.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you just flip over to page 58?   
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I am there Chairman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You indicate in paragraph 20 that on that morning you 
went to work fairly early.  The first point you indicate when you arrived at work that 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 4 of 141 
 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the 10th December? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The 10th December indeed.  Chair he describes the 
events of the 10th from paragraph 12 page 58.  There you say that the first notable thing 
that worried you was the pounding, as you put it, the Rand was taking as against other 
foreign currencies, especially the US Dollar.  Do you confirm that? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes Mr Chairman I do.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why was that of concern to you immediately on the 
morning of the 10th December? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  It was a concern because I was aware then as I am now 
10 
that when the currency takes a knock, given the fact that Government raises money.  I 
think at the time we were borrowing anything between R9 million and R11 million a 
week in different instruments on different days of the week.  I also was aware of course 
that there are other entities in the broader economy of South Africa that do the same at 
different intervals and magnitudes relative to Government.   
 
Of course on any given day, the ability to get that money depends on the 
perception of risk by investors or lenders.  If they think that the currency is going fall 
precipitously over a given period of time, then it stands to reason for them to expect 
that a Rand – a Dollar that they invest in SA, today would be worth less a week later if 
the currency has weaken.  Therefore they would hesitate to engage in an action that 
20 
destroys value like that.   
 
Small movements of the currency do not normally bother investors, but sharp 
movements do concern them.  This is applicable, not only to bond investors by the way, 
it is also applicable to investors in equities and of course in Greenfields Projects.  
Because whilst – in once sense it makes it cheap to invest in SA, but the concern an 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 5 of 141 
 
investor has is, when I repatriate that investment out of South Africa, will it be worth 
more or less and if they think that it will be worth less, they may not be prepared to take 
that risk.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  So it would be fair to sum up that your concern 
regarding the poor performance of our currency at that time related to the investor 
confidence? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In our currency and also the burdensome effect of it our 
liability that is denominated in foreign currency, when we borrow in the financial 
markets? 
10 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is very true Mr Chairman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Now Minister Gordhan gave the Chairperson 
some numbers relating to the performance of our currency at that time.  Chair you 
would recall that he did so with reference to EXHIBIT N1 especially on page 30 in 
paragraph 79 of his statement.  Also with reference to EXHIBIT N2 on page 140, which 
are the figures that he ultimately sourced from Bloomberg Indices.   
 
Mr Fuzile, I would like you to confirm, if you could please those numbers as 
the precise indicators of the Rand's performance during the reference period that 
Mr Gordhan talked about.  There is a bundle before you which must be marked N2.   
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes I have it.   
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you go to page 140 of that bundle?   
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I am starting at – I have got the same N2 as you.  
Because my N2 started at 425.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No that is N1 "B" that you have, there should be a file 
which is N2.  Can I ask one of my colleagues to assist you?   
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 6 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we will need him to know which bundle is what for purposes, in 
case later on he is referred to another bundle. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will need him to know which bundle is what and where it is so 
that he can find it with ease.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe for this purpose, I should just take 2 minutes, 3 minutes 
adjournment and let somebody check that he has got everything that he needs to have. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair I would be grateful if we could do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can we also use that moment, or that opportunity to 
indicate to you that there are additional documents that we requested, the legal team of 
Mr Fuzile to bring here.  Those would be a copy of the Cabinet Special Dispensation 
that was made pursuant to Section 12A of the Public Service Act, relating to the 
engagement of Ministerial Advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And also a memo which has to be produced by the 
Minister to request and justify the appointment of advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And especially of the contract. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So we will place those documents appropriately indexed 
in your file and also in the files of Mr Fuzile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, that is fine no thank you.  Let us make it 5 minutes, so 
we will take a 5 minutes adjournment. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 7 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
COMMISSION ADJOURNS  
COMMISSION RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Maleka.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair thank you very much for the indulgence.  We are 
now at page 140 of EXHIBIT N2 and we have now located it for Mr Fuzile.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You said N2, is that the supplementary? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The supplementary bundle of Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The writing on its spine is smaller. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Compared to the writing on the spines of the other lever-arch files. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to identify it is quite a problem if you are looking for "N". 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think during the tea break or lunch break if somebody can put a 
bigger – something with a bigger writing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I can see it from a distance.  The others are not so bad I think it is 
bigger. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair we will attend to that during the tea 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you said it is page? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  140. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 8 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  140? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Right.  Oh ja thank you.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you there Mr Fuzile? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes I am Mr Chairperson. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am not going to take you through the details, I just 
want you to confirm – or let me say this.  Mr Gordhan has gone through the details and 
has confirmed them under oath.  So I am not going to go through that repetitive 
exercise.  But I want you to confirm is that those numbers reflect the performance of the 
Rand as against the Dollar from the 9th December up to Friday the 11th December 2015, 
10 
do you see that? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes they definitely do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the opening was R14.59 as against the Dollar on 
the 9th December 2015 and the closing was R15.90 as against the Dollar on the 
11th December 2015.  So that is the two days of the trading period.   
 
My calculation is that for that two short days, the Rand lost approximately 
$1.31 as against the Dollar. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes R1.31 yes.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and what is the significance of that movement in 
that amount? 
20 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  The significance of that, if you were to just consider an 
individual who was in the process of buying something from a place that uses the Dollar 
for instance and most countries by the way you go via the Dollar when you enter into 
those international transactions.  It means that within that very short space of time, the 
person would have had to pay for every Dollar that they bought with the Rand as much 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 9 of 141 
 
as that difference between R14.59 and R15.90 more.  Now I might look like it is a small 
amount, perhaps it is R1.39, but if you are engaging in a transaction of a billion or 
multiples of billions of Rands, then all of a sudden the picture becomes very different. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  It is not inconceivable, for an example that there may be 
people, you know, those who trade in commodities who would have had to buy, or pay 
for oil or something of that sort for those amounts.  Of course there are other things that 
people do to protect themselves against that.  But if you just take the spot rate. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is the implications. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I mean, for our part is, you have indicated that for 
a week you used to borrow about $9 billion? 
MR O'DONNELL:  Rands. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Sorry R9 billion.  So for that week you would be paying 
R1.31 more because of the performance of the currency, as I had it. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  The arithmetic would work differently Mr Chair.  But let us 
just apply it differently that is as they call it.  If you for instance take a billion Dollar 
worth of our debt. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Right, just without doing anything.  If you had to revalue 
20 
it between those two days, that billion Dollar debt would now have had to increase by 
the multiple of the difference between those two amounts. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Am I making sense?  So in other words, when you 
convert it to Rands, it is no longer now the billion Dollar times 14.59. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 10 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  It is the billion Rand times 15.90.  You have not borrowed 
more, but all of a sudden the amount of debt that you owe ...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Increases. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Has increased. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay thank you for that clarification.  Now in 
paragraph 21 you talk about the meeting you had with Minister Nene at his office and 
yesterday I asked you some questions.  I am going to skip it unless you want to 
comment on it? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  No that is fine.   
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then we go to paragraph 23, I am going to skip 
paragraph 22.  Unless you want to confirm it? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  It is – it will become important just for reflection, because 
I can now recall that the first thing I did as contact with Mr van Rooyen was to send him 
an sms. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Exactly at what time of the evening of his announcement 
as the new Minister of Finance I cannot remember.  I congratulated him and then in 22 
as I say, when that call took place, I congratulated him again in a way I reached out, 
you could say demonstrated acceptance of the fact that he had being made a Minister. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I did not have to choose my bosses.  Of course I could 
choose jobs.  So there I was reaching out. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  And it will become important later on just this point. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 11 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  By the time you sent the sms and by the time 
called him on the morning of the 10th December, he was known to you, he was no 
stranger to you, he was someone that you knew? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You confirm in fact in paragraph 24 that you had worked 
with him and appeared before him in Parliament, because he was a member of the 
Parliamentary Finance Committee, correct? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is correct ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So he was no stranger to you, someone that you knew 
and had worked with. 
10 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  No he was no stranger to me.  I had his telephone 
number which is why I could send him a sms, I did not have to look for it and he had my 
telephone number, because we had had exchanges previously on matters that in fact 
he himself needed which related to his work.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Proper staff. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  In paragraph 22.1 and 22.2 you explain why you 
called you.  Can I ask you to elaborate on those considerations? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes I did that.  If I may Mr Chairman I am on 22.1 as 
Mr Maleka is leading me on page 59 where my statement is.  I said, the first thing that I 
20 
had in mind was to ask him to try and get to the Department earlier that morning, 
because I was aware from the previous night that Minister Nene was going to be in the 
Department early that morning, he would be packing his belongings to clear the office, 
so that his successor could occupy it.  Of course, because it was not the first time that 
we had a change of Minister.  Mr Chairman might recall, we had the change from 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 12 of 141 
 
Minister Manuel to Minister Gordhan after the elections of 2009 and we did a very nice 
similar change from a Minister who had been with the Department for 13 years to the 
new one who was coming.  Who, by the way, was no stranger to us, because he had 
been the Commissioner of SARS.  We could have said, there is no need for 
introductions because everyone knew him.  But we just thought, because of the – 
people tend to develop real chemistry with their bosses, it would be a good thing also to 
just have this thing of showing that the one Minister is leaving, this is Manuel in the first 
instance and the new one is coming, there is no problem, life continues. 
 
So I wanted us to do more or less the similar thing with the outgoing Minister, 
Minister Nene.  At the time of my call, Minister designate Minister Des van Rooyen.   
10 
 
I also wanted to do this in his case in particular, because his appointment had 
come, even though there had been rumours, unexpectedly and I anticipated, in fact not 
anticipated, I already knew from sms'es and just other communication that people had 
been unnerved by the development.  I thought that symbolically having the two of them, 
one saying his goodbyes and the other one saying I am here and whatever other good 
stuff they would have said to try to come to people who would have been vulnerable. 
 
The second ...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I ...[intervenes] 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Sorry. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No go ahead. 
20 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  The second reason was that, I also asked him to 
consider issuing a media statement in light of what I was saying insofar as the currency 
is concerned which we talked about, which was a serious, and if you will, a precipitous 
fall in the currency and of course all the implications that that had for the country.  
Wanted us to consider drafting carelessly where the statement which he would issue, 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 13 of 141 
 
which would in the main respond very directly to some of the issues that concerned the 
people.  But of course, as it would become apparent later, he turned that down. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I understand the soft issues of the outcoming 
Minister meeting with the incoming one and the exchange pleasantries and so on.  But 
there are hard issues relating to any changeover and transitions? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is it.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Those, amongst others you are now in a private sector, 
you know that one of the best practice is "handover". 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Exactly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is the process in National Treasury when there is 
10 
this shift in Ministries? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  When it happens at a time of elections, we spend a lot of 
time to set out in detail, first just the broad work of the Treasury.  I suspect that some of 
what was referred to here as a document that Minister Manuel had prepared, was part 
of that file which Minister Manuel had prepared for his likely successor. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  He did that every time when the elections came, 
needless to say he would return and have to read it himself – until of course 
Minister Gordhan.  So we had this practice of having that, you can call it an induction 
file. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Who would identify the major projects that the 
Department would be working on at any given time, so that the Minister has got this 
document that he can go to, which he receives from his predecessor.   
 
Of course, it may not be easy to do this as perfectly as I have described it 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 14 of 141 
 
now, when the change happens in-between. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  But be that as it may, as you are correctly indicating 
Mr Maleka, there is a need for it, that the outgoing Minister and the new one must meet 
and interact, so that even if the outgoing Minister does not hand a fresh file, maybe 
hands over the old one and then signals the changes that have happened since they 
were in office and of course they can agree that at time "T" plus whatever, they will 
meet again where they can do a proper handover. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  I mean you must know what is in the entry 
which we should include the pressing and priority issues.  But anyway, did that 
10 
handover take place when the changeover happened between Minister van Rooyen 
and outgoing Minister Nene? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  It never did to my knowledge. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why did that not happen? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Because when I asked Mr van Rooyen to come, he said 
he would come at his own time.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  In paragraph 23, you explain the response of 
Minister van Rooyen to the two suggestions you had made in the course of the 
telephone conversation you had with him.  You describe that response as "turning down 
your suggestions".  But then telling you – and I quote you:  
20 
"Stanley that the officials of National Treasury have a tendency 
to issue statements and that must come to an end." 
 
Do you confirm that that was his unmistakable response to your suggestions? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is exactly what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this the first occasion you were speaking to him after his 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 15 of 141 
 
appointment? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Interacting Mr Chairman, but I had sent him an e-mail 
the night before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I mean in terms of, were you not speaking to him now? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes, it was the first time of speaking to him and it is 
probably just about 12, 13 hours after his appointment had been announced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  I am struck by your use of the 
adverb Stanley.  I mean I went to the dictionary to look at what it means but in your 
words what does it convey? 
10 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I mean in this context I would not even say it conveys 
excessive preoccupation with authority; it was though maybe I or we as the officials 
were behaving in a manner that he felt required to be put to an end or a stop had to 
be put to it.  And as I go on to say it just struck me as being prejudicial, full of 
prejudice because I just could not understand, given the processes that we used to 
go through as a department, before a statement will be put out, because even in this 
case I was not saying we are going to issue a statement.  I was saying to him I think 
you should consider issuing a statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And if you are okay with that then we can start to draft 
20 
something, which of course in the normal course of doing our business he would 
have had to okay, he would have had to say I am happy with it.  And if, in the normal 
course of doing business he wished to discuss it with us, to understand deeply why 
we were using the words we were using in certain parts, why we felt it necessary to 
say the things we would have been proposing he should say.  Then we will do it.  
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 16 of 141 
 
That is what we used to do with all his predecessors. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Who by the way, I can say here, not because I – I 
mean I do not want anything from them.  They are no longer my bosses.  What I 
know of them, they would have been able to draft a statement that is – that would 
deal with the kinds of concerns that were there, sufficiently, without deferring to us.  
But just the teamwork culture that had been inculcated in the Treasury and the 
appreciation of the power of teamwork was such that everyone would be pulled in, 
relevant people of course, to make a contribution to thinking about how to carefully 
word one's statement that would achieve the purpose for which is it intended.  So I 
10 
was astounded by the reaction. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and in fact that is what you say in paragraph 14, 
and you indicate there that your immediate view of things from his response what 
that you thought he was prejudiced about or against members of Treasury.  Do you 
confirm that? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes I confirm it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair, that response of Minister van Rooyen and the 
rebuke is going to become important when we deal with Mr Fuzile's evidence about 
the attitude taken by his advisors.  Because as you know from the reading of the 
statement, the advisors took a different view.  They wanted a statement when he did 
20 
not want it.  Yes, but we will get to that point in due course.  Now Mr Fuzile I would 
skip the rest of paragraph 24 because you have dealt with it, you have indicated to 
us the context in which you had prior knowledge and a prior working relationship with 
Minister van Rooyen, and now I turn to page 60 and I am at paragraph 25, and you 
say there that you were disappointed by the attitude taken by your Minister designate 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 17 of 141 
 
at the time.  And you say you were disappointed, why were you disappointed? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I was disappointed Mr Chairman because (1) he was 
breaking tradition and (2) I really thought that it would make for a good start for him 
to be seen with his predecessor addressing staff and also just to hear his 
predecessor, and of course take some sense of the mood of the department, he was 
then soon to be charged with [indistinct], which they would have of course informed 
how he would approach his work going forward.  I was also disappointed because 
insofar as for instance the statement was concerned there was a lot of speculation 
about what had led to the removal of Mr Nene, his appointment, Mr van Rooyen and 
what it would imply for first the institution of the Treasury and how it would approach 
10 
its work from then on. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  So I was hoping that he would use the opportunity 
quite quickly to dispel some of those notions. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Of course he could have come out and said different 
things, that too would have helped because it would have meant that both the 
department and the rest of the country and the world would have known where he 
stood, but it was just important, in my view, for him very early on to come and do that 
stuff. 
20 
 
I was also disappointed because it just seemed, which is what I get to in 
26, that at that time he had not come to terms with what his role was about.  It just 
seemed to me from the reaction that he as oblivious to the fact that the currency was 
for instance depreciating in the manner in which it was doing and that he had a role 
in doing something to stave that off.  Of course he could have worked with others 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 18 of 141 
 
and so on and so forth but it was important because the questions that people were 
asking, the speculation was a lot around him and only Mr van Rooyen was in a 
position to dispel some of that speculation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I mean you come across as someone who is 
explaining a moment of crisis which required intervention by the leadership of 
Treasury, and you indicate that the leadership at the time was the incoming Minister, 
who you required him to do something.  Now can I ask you this, in the absence of 
the leadership intervention from the head of Treasury, which you identified as the 
Minister, who else would be able to play that roll?  Who else will come and assure 
the markets and assure the country that it is not as bad as the market may reflect in 
10 
terms of the performance of the currency? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I think it would be correct to expect that it will be the 
President or the presidency. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Chair, in this case there was a statement issued by 
the presidency, in fact I suspect a few of them in one day. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Mahayana would explain how the 
presidency, in conjunction with Treasury filled the void which was taking place at the 
time.  And then you conclude that part of your disappointment by indicating in 
paragraph 27 that you know how have expressed your disappointment to some of 
20 
your colleagues.  As you sit here today are you able to indicate who whose 
colleagues could be? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I am sure, as I indicated in the statement that 
Ms Maxanda, who was the head of communication, knows about this, In fact at one 
stage I recall that she was with me when I was taking to Mr van Rooyen, and I put 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 19 of 141 
 
the phone on speaker so that she would hear, because I had anticipated that in fact 
the call was going to be to switch quickly from the suggestion I was making to 
auctioning it, which is to say maybe we should draft a statement.  We should say A, 
B, C to it and then she was going to get started with that, and of course I and other 
colleagues would have had to just take a look at it and make inputs.  Ultimately have 
the Minister approve it and release it later on after he is sworn in. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just as a matter interest the swearing in, his swearing in was to 
happen later in the day is it not? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think I must have seen something to the effect that it 
happened around midday or thereabout is that correct? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would a Minister designate as you have said, would have, 
would that mean the designate be able to perform any duties of Minister before he or 
she is sworn in? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  No really, and it is a good question you area asking 
chairman, I would have maybe clarified this.  The idea was not to say to him come 
and consider issuing a statement right now, we anticipated that after he is sworn in 
there would be media people because we have done the thing before, and we knew 
20 
that the media would be asking him the questions that were in fact floating, and we – 
our preference was that he should read a statement.  And in fact not only were we 
going to have him read a statement, if he wished, which is something we used to do 
diligently, is to anticipate the questions that might be asked, and we do a question 
and answer document for him so that – the idea with these things, it is not about the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 20 of 141 
 
individual, it is about saying you want to preserve the institution, the office of the 
Minister of Finance, head of Treasury and Treasury and South Africa. 
 
So what we were thinking about essentially, not just me, including my 
colleagues, was we now have Minister van Rooyen.  We may not have been 
expecting him but now let us see if we can make it work.  Let us see if we can help 
him project a picture a good as his predecessor or predecessors first time, but of 
course he turned down the opportunity. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I mean he made ...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you had in mind was that if, when you spoke to him in the 
morning on the 10th, and made this suggestion, if he was favour of the suggestion 
10 
possibly the work of drafting the statement could start even before the swearing in, 
and it would be ready for – by the time he was sworn in, and he could use it 
immediately after the swearing in ceremony to dispel any perceptions? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Precisely Mr Chairman, including familiarise yourself 
with the statement because you need that late time.  It is one thing to read a 
statement that has just been passed to you, and once you have folded it and put it 
aside, people ask you questions about it, and some of them, they can just even pick 
a work and say exactly why have you chosen to use this word.  And if you have not 
internalised it yourself, you could come out badly.  So the idea was let him prepare 
so that by the time he needs to issue a statement he has it.  By the time he needs to 
20 
respond to questions from the people from the media, he is able to respond to them 
coherently and convincingly, which is something we all do or used to do, and I am 
sure it continues to this day.  I used to joke to people that when I would be asking my 
direct report, some of whom are here, I say look this time you have to go and say the 
things that you normally go – ask me to go and say, you say them yourself, which 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 21 of 141 
 
was true because I was not producing all the stuff that came out the Treasury, it was 
produced by the team under me, with me.  I just happened to occupy a particular 
position where I was the face of the department at a particular level below the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ideally in terms of what you had wished for, what you had 
wished for would probably have been something like that he might have had a 
meeting with you, either alone or with such other members of your team as you 
might have wished to put together.  You might have had a session with him and that 
opportunity could have been used for him to just make sure that his understanding of 
the issues that were quite important for the day, were the same – was the same as 
10 
yours, and the teams, and then how this should be handled in terms of any media 
conference later in the day. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I was waiting for Mr Chairman, and there was method 
in how I was thinking about it, because had he come at the time when he was going 
to be talking to Mr Mann, he would even have had the opportunity, let us say 
potentially to just hear from [indistinct] because Mr Nene had been a Deputy Minister 
for six years before he became Minister.  And during part of that time, I my memory 
serves me well, there had been a turmoil of sorts and we dealt with those, including 
for instance even having the sub work with us to issue a statement just to reassure 
the market and stuff.  So that is what I had in mind. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And of course the foundational point you make is not 
that you were trying to follow the tradition and processes for the sake of it but you 
were doing so in order to protect the institution of Treasury.  People come and go 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 22 of 141 
 
and institutions are perennial and they have to survive strongly or weakly as it may 
be.  Now the next chapter that you deal with of that morning the 10 th of December, is 
the swearing in, and I would like you to move quite quickly.  The Chairperson as 
asked you some issues around it but the first issue you reference in regard to that 
part on the morning, is that you were invited to attend the swearing in of 
Minister van Rooyen and there is nothing eventful about paragraph 28 in relation to 
that invitation, unless you want to tell us who invited you. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  It is a pity because I do not remember the person's 
name.  I even suspect that I never bothered to ask the person's name. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, but we know that the venue that you reference 
10 
is the place for the ceremony of swearing in Chairperson, is, at that time the Union 
Building correct? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the first even you identify about that venue is that 
the first person you met is some person who introduced himself as 
Mr Mohamed Bhobat, correct? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who were not there, and some of us may not be in 
the hallowed place of the Union Building, can you give us a sense of the setting?  
How you met him?  How the introduction took place and who said to who? 
20 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Thank you very much.  I got there Mr Chairperson, I 
think it was after 11:00 and of course I am walking on this kind of very long, I would 
call it a veranda for simplicity, and there was a person standing right in front of the 
door which I knew was the place I had been directed to go to.  Of course I did not 
know the person so as I got quite close with him, he assured he looks towards me 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 23 of 141 
 
and he greets me, good morning or good day Mr Fuzile.  I responded and then he 
told me immediately that – in fact as part of introducing himself, that he is the advisor 
to Mr van Rooyen and I was taken aback.  I was taken aback because all the 
advisors the department had had during my tenure, which were not many, had 
signed contracts with me.  Perhaps to use the context of here, it is like you meeting a 
person who is your subordinate, that you are supposed to appoint, maybe leave the 
subordinate part because it is inaccurate.  A person on whose appointment you were 
supposed to be the signatory and you know you have not signed any piece of paper, 
and the person tells you that I am employed here, essentially that is what it meant. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  That was the first astonishing thing.  The second 
astonishing thing was the fact that ...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before this second, is it astonishment or what?  Before this 
second one, why were you taken aback because Mr Godongwana had told you the 
previous day? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is good you say that Chair, we will come to it do not 
worry.  Can I, with your leave my apologies, he is going to talk to that issue fairly 
soon, can I ask you, with your permission, to ask him to conclude the first part 
because the second part is coming and you will see that it is in paragraph 30.2 on 
page ...[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  With your leave Chair.  So in a way Mr Chairman and 
Mr Maleka, whilst theoretically a Minister can just bring anyone to be their advisor, 
so they have got discretion. It helps if they get a good feeling, I might add, but – and 
I do touch on that but as I say I was the only person with the authority.  I could 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 24 of 141 
 
delegate to someone if for instance I am traveling, but usually at the Treasury 
appointments, we would do the delegation under exception circumstances, precisely 
to avoid this situation where a person gets appointed by a person in a – you know in 
an acting capacity or you know for a day.  Because if it happens to be a wrong 
person the process to remove the person can be cumbersome. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  So I had not signed any person for him, there he was, 
he was telling me is the advisor.  He was not saying I am going to be the advisor to 
Mr Van Rooyen, which I perhaps would have kind of reluctantly brushed aside.  He 
was saying strongly I am the advisor at the time [indistinct]. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and I would like you to deal with the second 
element of your surprise by reading paragraph 30.2 on page 61. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  So the second element of my surprise gets to the point 
then that yesterday we did touch on, which was that all of sudden what I heard, and 
If will kind of partially believed but I did not dismiss it but I sort of hastily kind of said 
it cannot be that a person would be given advice and stuff like that. 
 
So it turned out that when I saw this guy, and you would remember that I 
said that the point that almost got me into trouble, I said I was hesitating to just talk 
about his race but there he was and he happened to be of Indian decent.  So I said 
so obviously there must be truth in everything that Mr Godongwana had said the 
20 
previous evening.  I was really surprised, perturbed actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How soon after meeting him and hearing him saying he is the 
advisor to the new Minister how soon did you realise that it meant that 
Mr Godongwana was right?  Was it something that happened ...[intervenes]. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Immediately. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 25 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Immediately. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Immediately because perhaps let me just make this 
point, I know Mr Godongwana quite well.  He is a serious person.  He can even say 
serious stuff you know with [indistinct] he is a very serious person and a lot of the 
time when we talk it is clear when we are joking, it is clear when we were serious.  I 
had understood him to be serious, but it was like a fairy-tale that – I do not know, just 
the story as I told it yes.  But now when this point happened it just – this was the real 
first point where this connecting of the dots was occurring because here was  person 
standing in front of me, and here was a person by the way who almost disdainfully 
tell me tells me, as the accounting officer, who is supposed to sign a contract with 
10 
him on behalf of the government, he is telling me that I am working for government. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Later we might talk about the importance of a contract, 
and talking to lawyers I am sure you would understand. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes we will get there but for now we went to bed the 
previous night with this shocking prediction by Mr Godongwana, and the next 
morning that nightmare is now unfolding in reality before you when you meet the 
person who says things that in your view are not consistent with her functions and 
duties.  In paragraph 30 you make the point that you were surprised that by that 
stage you had met Mr Bhobat, being Minister designate, had just been announced 
20 
about 15 to 17 hours and yet he had an advisor already.  And you say that you had 
never seen something like this in two decades that you have been in the public 
service is that correct? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes nearly two decades.  I had not seen it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is this the first of its kind that you had to confront on 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 26 of 141 
 
that day? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Essentially it was the first of this kind.  The Minister 
had not been to the department what he had already figured out is you want to be 
charitable, that he would need an advisor.  What gap was the advisor filling? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yourself. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  What need was he filling? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because the Minister had not been to the department, 
he had not spoken, to my knowledge, to anyone I the department, not Mr Manuel, 
sorry Nene, certainly not me but he had already determined he would heed an 
advisor. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may or may not be able to say this but based on what I know 
you say in your statement it is unlikely that – you are likely to say it is unlikely that 
they knew each other well, that is Minister van Rooyen and Mr Bhobat or Bobbitt, do 
you know? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to pronounce it correctly. 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  But I think I am correct when I say it is Mr Bhobat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Do you know whether he might have been an advisor 
that Minster van Rooyen might have had at some stage in the past, well I do not 
know if you are in a portfolio committee, and member of Parliament, I doubt that you 
20 
would have an advisor.  Is it somebody that he may have been using in some when 
he was occupying some position before? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Factually Mr Chairman I not know but what I can say is 
that committees in Parliament would have researchers and the committee he 
happened to be in, I know reasonably well and I knew the researchers for that 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 27 of 141 
 
committee and Mr Bhobat was not one of them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So the appointment had been announced a some 
stage in the evening the previous day, was it round about, did you say yesterday it 
was around about 20:00? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you were now meeting Mr Bhobat around midday 
on the 10th? 
MINISTER LUGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So he was – he would have been, I do not know 
whether appointed is the correct word since you had not signed any papers, but he 
10 
would have been told by whoever told him that he was going to be 
Minister van Rooyen's advisor, he would have been told either that evening or that 
morning of the 10th within 24 hours after the announcement, actually within much less 
than that. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  15 to 17 hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within 17 hours he was already for all intents and purposes as far as 
he was concerned in the job? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, Mr Chairman, but of course it would be remiss of me to 
just leave that point like that, because as I indicated yesterday the process of 
approaching a person for the possibility of becoming a Minister could start a day earlier, 
20 
it is not inconceivable that it could start much longer before the person is announced.  
We do not know that part. 
 
But of course be that as it may it can never detract from the fact that if I am 
given a role and I have the option of asking to have an advisor the first thing I think 
about is to have an advisor rather than, and of course determining that the right advisor 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 28 of 141 
 
is this one before I have learned that in the department and made a proper assessment 
that this department has got economies, it has got accountants, it has got financial 
analyst, but it lacks this part.  So to compliment my capacity let me get an advisor to 
perform this role. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Of course that is my way of thinking about it.  I do not know if 
political principles think about it this way, they may be using a different process 
altogether. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, well they will appear before the Chairperson, and they will 
have to explain themselves about the way they think when they go through these 
10 
processes and in paragraph 13 you say that Mr Bhobat wasted no time and he started 
to issue instructions to you.  Do you confirm that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, I can confirm it. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  What did he say to you? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  He said to me, if I quote him verbatim "I would require a 
statement from you to be issued by the Minister." 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Do you confirm that those are his instructions to you as far as you 
can recall? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, and it is not inconceivable that Ms Mtanda who was close 
by might have heard this, but I am not sure, I have never test with her whether she did 
20 
hear. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Here is the thing, you tried to get Minister Designate van Rooyen 
earlier on to consider preparing a statement that you would issue once the formalities 
have been done and he rebuked you for that suggestion and yet when moments later 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 29 of 141 
 
you meet a person who describes himself as the advisor he requires you by way of an 
instruction to prepare that statement. 
 
The two as far as I see cannot sit side by side.  Why would there be any 
inconsistency of that sort from your perspective between a Minister designate at the 
time and his supposed advisor at the time? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The sharpest way to put this is it was clear then that Mr Bhobat 
had not cared to check with his principal what he would want to do and how.  I mean it 
is obvious, it is here for everyone to see it, because it just so happened that the first 
instruction he issued to me, unfortunately for the guy it is in direct contravention with 
what the person on whose behalf he was purporting to be acting had indicated, you 
10 
know, I make the offer that we should consider issuing a statement, he puts me down 
quite sternly and moments later the person who is the advisor who is supposed to help 
the Minister, not the other way around feels that he should demand a statement from 
me. 
 
We will come of course to the other issues which is exceedingly important as 
far as I am concerned, and is a learning point for everyone and the nation, advisors do 
not issue instructions to DG's and any other official for that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was about to ask whether it is normal for a Minister's advisor to 
issue an instruction to a Director General? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is abnormal, Mr Chairman, but let me apologise for even 
20 
hinting at it, I am sure Mr Maleka is coming, because it is part of the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, but for now, ja. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is abnormal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is illegal. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 30 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Let me put it straightforward, it is illegal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course you speak about, you suggest that it seems that Mr 
Bhobat did not care to speak to his principal about the issue of a statement, because if 
he had maybe his principal, maybe he would have known that his principal was against 
the idea, but also it seems that when the principal had to respond to your suggestion 
the morning he too did not check with his advisor what he thought about this idea. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I cannot agree with you more. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Chair, just before we take the tea adjournment can I ask Mr Fuzile 
to round up his view of the instructions by Mr Bhobat and the conclusions that he drew 
10 
from the attempts to issue instructions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And you make some conclusions from paragraph 34.1.  May I ask 
you and I invite you to reflect those conclusions as accurately as you can by reading 
into the record those subparagraphs. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Thank you very much.  Mr Chairman, 34.1: 
"Mr Bhobat did not care about, it became clear to me given just 
how he conducted himself that he did not care about protocol 
or civilities.  And he appeared determined to assert his 
authority over me.  He was not bothered that he was not an 
20 
employee of the department at that time and that his role has 
never been explained to me by anyone else other than him or 
himself." 
 
34.2: 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 31 of 141 
 
"Mr Bhobat felt such a sense of authority and empowerment 
that he could issue instructions to anyone without first checking 
with the person that is the Minister designate on whose behalf 
he purported to act.  He gave me the impression of being a law 
onto himself." 
 
Lastly, 34.3: 
"As it happened on that occasion…" 
 
Which was your point, Mr Chairman. 
"…he issued an instruction that was the direct opposite of what 
the Minister, his principal wanted." 
10 
 
And I state this as a matter of fact, because a Minister designate had 
indicated to me earlier that he did not want a statement from me or us as the officials of 
the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had actually, from what you had said already before the Minister 
had actually indicated to you that you people at Treasury must stop this tendency of 
yours of issuing statements, which seem to indicate the dim like media statements? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Certainly the ones prepared by us. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, okay Mr Fuzile, I hate to be in your position at that time, 
because two persons are asserting authority over you, trying to put you in a situation 
where you do not understand truly what the instructions to you are.  Chair, is this a 
20 
convenient moment to take the tea adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we will take the short adjournment and resume at 11:35. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
MEETING ADJOURNS 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 32 of 141 
 
MEETING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Maleka? 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Fuzile, you in paragraph 5 you talk about a 
further instruction which Mr Bhobat issued to Ms Matanda in your presence, do you 
recall that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, I do, Mr Chair. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  In paragraph 36 you indicate that that instructions reflected his 
failure to understand the communication policy and protocol of National Treasury at the 
time, correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Ms Matanda will elaborate on these things, but for your purposes 
you can confirm that National Treasury had its own communication policy? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And that is you as the head of National Treasury at the time 
authorised that policy in terms of the public service regulations? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, that is correct 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 37 you indicate that at some point as the flow of 
instructions was taking place from Mr Bhobat, Minister van Rooyen arrived, is that 
correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman. 
20 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I ask you to tell us, because we were not there, what 
happened when he arrived at the time you were with Mr Bhobat and others? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Mr van Rooyen on arriving at the Union Building, he and Mr 
Bhobat greeted and I could of sort pick that amongst the things that they were 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 33 of 141 
 
discussing were the fact that Mr Bhobat had tried to call Mr van Rooyen earlier and Mr 
van Rooyen had not answered the call. 
 
And of course it was obvious that there was a bit of agitation in Mr Bhobat, 
but quite importantly I picked the comment from Mr van Rooyen to the effect that he did 
not recognise the number, which would suggest that it is not a number which would 
appear with a person's name, that is saved on the phone, so, and because he was 
appointed probably, knowing myself, at the time, you get to many calls from people you 
know and you can identify the names and sometimes from people you know calling you 
from new phones, but also people you do not necessarily know, and therefore you do 
not have their phone numbers on your phone. 
10 
 
So I could pick that up, which would suggest to me that either they did not 
know each other or they had not known each other for too long to have exchanged 
telephone numbers. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Before that time. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Well can I try and press for some further detail from you on that 
point.  This is a two way communication taking place between Minister van Rooyen and 
Mr Bhobat at the time and you say you heard what that communication was all about 
and from what you heard you drew some conclusions.  One of which is that you could 
pick up that there was not a level of familiarity between the two of them. 
20 
 
Why did you come to that conclusion? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The first is this issue of the phones, phone numbers that they 
did not have of each other, and of course there was also, I mean the body language 
was not great actually, because I had been used to seeing advisors who would 
approach the Ministers with a lot of difference as their bosses, essentially, and the just 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 34 of 141 
 
degree of call it agitation and stuff and the tone to a certain degree of Mr 
Bhobat…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the first day of being advisor to the Minister? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, the first hours of being advisor to Minister designate to be 
precise, Mr Chairman, advisor without a contract for that matter.  So there was just a 
sense of this lack of good chemistry of what you would know of a normal relationship 
between advisor and a Minister. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, I mean when you met Mr Bhobat, there were introductions, I 
mean you said so. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  There were. 
10 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Well you said he knew you, Fuzile. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  What happened when the two of them met in your presence at that 
point in time? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Look I do not recall that they really introduced each other, but it 
is not inconceivable, but the bit that is very clear to me is this phone stuff and also just 
the relationship was not the normal one that I have witnessed of Minister and advisor 
before and also really not of people who have known each other for too long, and as I 
say the Minister said I did not recognise the number, the other one will say, but why did 
you not answer my calls, I have been trying to call you, kind of thing as well. 
20 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Was there no explanation as between them why the one or the 
other were there? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, why the other one were there? 
ADV MALEKA SC:  This is a swearing in ceremony. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 35 of 141 
 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And people get invited to be there, as you were. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  I could not arrive as a stranger to attend this swear in of a Minister.  
I mean I suppose that people who are there have a business to be there, and there 
would be introductions, there would be explanations why people are there, in the 
normal course of business.  Holding those variables constant do you or do you not 
recall that there was an explanation as between the two of them? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that from what Mr Bhobat said to Mr van Rooyen on that 
occasion that you could hear and the tone in which he said it, you formed the view that 
10 
Mr Bhobat seemed to be maybe upset, maybe irritated that Mr van Rooyen had not 
answered his call or returned his call or something like that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, I did say that, Chairman, and I stated it as a matter of fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was Mr van Rooyen's response to what appeared to you to 
be a very strange thing as I see it that here is an advisor that shows irritation or of 
being upset at the Minister that the Minister did not answer his call?  What was his 
reaction to this? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  His reaction was that look I did not recognise that it is you 
calling, you know, in a way, because he only saw, I would presume this, a number, 
because if person A calls me and their number is saved against person A then I see it is 
20 
A calling and I take the call.  Then I can explain why I could not take it if I do not take it, 
but the explanation cannot be I did not know it is you who is calling, because that 
suggests that he did not have the number saved, unless of course he called him with a 
private number, in which case he would have said it is a private number that I saw. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 36 of 141 
 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, Chair, Minister van Rooyen may or may not testify and I would 
like Mr Fuzile's evidence on this issue, because…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  If everyone who is seriously implicated will testify, they may decide to 
come forward themselves or I will call them. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, and that is why I said may or may not, Chair, and – but I 
would like to with your leave test more on this evidence, with your permission.  You see 
Mr Fuzile, what you indicated already is that when you had the earlier telephonic 
conversation with Mr van Rooyen it was quite clear to you that he was asserting 
authority to you. 
 
What I want to know from you…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember about the nods, Mr Fuzile.  Remember the nods do not 
get recorded, okay, alright. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, that is true, that is correct, thank you very much for the 
reminder, Chairman. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And that stand rebuke was unmistakable, because it led you to 
conceive that he had some prejudice against officials of Treasury.  But here you are 
with someone who complains to him that he did not answer his call and you indicate 
how he responded.  What I am interested in is whether you can recall the mood of his 
response to Mr Bhobat’s complaint that he did not return the call? 
 
How was he?  How did he comport himself as he was responding? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  To be honest with you he looked a bit sheepish in a way that is 
– if I think about it, he was getting close to getting under one's skin, because if you 
think about the story I had been told and I was thinking about it that he will arrive with 
advisors and there he arrived with one, or he arrived to find the advisor there waiting for 
him, it does not make a difference, they were now there, the two of them. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 37 of 141 
 
 
And here is a person who has known me for a very long time.  We have 
interacted with each other with a lot of difference and respect even occasionally calling 
each other comrade and now I am – he is going to be my Minister, he is going to be my 
boss in a matter of minutes, in fact he was my Minister, leave the formality that he just 
had to be sworn in, and I am watching him, one level he puts me down like I deserve to 
be put in my place.  Fine he had made that choice on the day. 
 
And now here comes this person I was seeing for the very first time, by the 
way, who had behaved rather rudely towards me, impolitely.  Dare I say, by the way, in 
front of my subordinates and now again in front of all of us you have this gentleman Mr 
Bhobat talking to the Minister as if the roles have been reversed. 
10 
 
It was not…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  As if he was the boss to the Minister? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Precisely it just was not a nice thing to see. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  To see.  Alright, now can I reflect on the conclusion that you draw 
in paragraph 37?  Because it resonates with what Mr Godongwana had told you earlier 
on.  You come to the conclusion that there appears an impression that the two did not 
know each other? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  On that score. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MALEKA SC:  At that moment. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  They did not know each other, they looked to me not to know 
each other very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not know each other very well. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Very well, yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 38 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Ja, so I hope I say here that they either must have not known 
each other at all or they had just gotten to know each other. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, and you remember what Mr Godongwana said to you earlier 
on and if you do not mind, you hold page 62 with one hand and turn back to page 58.  
Chair, I am at paragraph 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18? 
ADV MALEKA SC:  18, yes.  And you recall there you said on the previous day Mr 
Godongwana said to you that your new Minister is likely to come with advisors he does 
not know?  I mean that again is the second real indicator of the nightmarish prediction 
he laid out before you the previous moment, is that correct? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Maleka, did you say paragraph 18? 
ADV MALEKA SC:  18, Chair, page 58. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I am sorry, okay. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Page 58, Chair, you would recall the previous night Mr 
Godongwana, not only did he say there would be a Gupta Minister, that Minister will 
arrive with advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would be of Indian descent. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Of Indian descent and they would be known in all likelihood to that 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, so Mr Fuzile you must have said Mr Godongwana knew what he 
20 
was talking about. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The story is here, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I mean he even knew that, you know, Mr van Rooyen and the 
advisors that he would have would not be knowing each other and up to the point that 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 39 of 141 
 
you had the conversation between Mr Bhobat and Mr van Rooyen everything was 
suggesting that they might not really be knowing each other, at least not well? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Exactly, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, and maybe they did not know each other at all, we do not 
know. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is not out of the realm of probabilities. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And, Chair, there is a picture of a nightmare which the next 
day unfolds into reality, but we will test this with Mr Godongwana when he comes in.  
Mr Fuzile has given you a broad stroke of the picture.  In paragraph 38 you indicate that 
10 
the ceremony took place, but it was not that long.  Of interest to me is what you say 
about the conduct of Mr van Rooyen, immediately after the swearing in. 
 
I am now at paragraph 38 page 63, you say that he took out a paper from 
which there was a statement which he made, is that the first summary of what you say 
in paragraph 38? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, it is. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And then you indicate that, that statement did not cover certain 
topics of concern to you, given the environment of the crisis that was unfolding at the 
time.  Can I ask you to in broad summary to just highlight those factors of concern to 
you which were not covered by the statement? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The first of those is at the heart of the work of the Treasury.  
You may recall from Minister Gordhan, but definitely from what I said yesterday, Mr 
Chairman, which was that the biggest job of the Treasury, not to downplay the other 
functions, they are just as important, but the biggest role that the Treasury performs is 
to produce a budget every year, annual budget. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 40 of 141 
 
 
So it is important, because it in some senses it determines the impact if you 
will government has on economic activity in the country and therefore the prospects for 
the country.  So whenever a budget is to be tabled the curiosity that South Africans 
have, investors have, that rating agencies have, all of them looking at the world from 
their vintage points is what will be the fiscal stance? 
 
What will be the attitude of this government towards fiscal policy?  Are they 
going to be reckless or are they going to be prudent?  Are they going to do things that 
would indebt the country to a point where it ends at the door of the IMF on some 
program of sorts with policy being dictated from outside South Africa for good reason? 
 
So in essence equally when there is a change of Minister the curiosity is, is 
10 
there going to be policy continuity or is the direction of fiscal policy going to change, 
and so that was the speculation that was in the media and Minister van Rooyen said a 
couple of, what I could call benign things. 
 
It is not reckless things, it is not rude things, but in the context where you see 
the currency is taking a pounding you see the articles that are written in not only that 
time the electronic media, but also the print media, saying that the reason Nene was 
removed is because he said no to things that would amount to fiscal recklessness. 
 
Fiscal policy is going to be loosened, in other words spending is going to be 
happening willingly.  So there was a need, I would imagine, in fact not imagine, I 
thought, to respond directly to that, to say there is going to be policy continuity if you 
20 
think that it matters, or also come clean and say I do not care about this thing, these 
people have been conservative I am going to change and I will let people deal with you 
in that context. 
 
Similarly there was speculation that Minister Nene was fired for nuclear.  A 
new Minister of Finance did not have to come and say something possibly that 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 41 of 141 
 
contradicts cabinet and we can talk about that in detail if you wish, but he could say 
something sufficiently carefully worded to allay the fears of the people so that it is 
understood that even if there is a commitment nuclear, but I exist as a Minister of 
Finance, I am not about to allow South Africa to commit itself to something it cannot 
afford. 
 
And of course there had been the issue of fees for higher education that had 
been curbed, which is the reason why the budget allocations could not be finalised, and 
again it was in the media and topical at the time it would have been good for him to say 
something on it, and ultimately of course something got said by Minister Gordhan, the 
Monday thereafter, but ultimately in the budget, which was constructive enough without 
10 
putting him at least in conflict with reasonable people. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Both in government, his party and the nation. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And then you say that the statement he made did not calm the 
market or the fears of the investors.  I am reading what you say in the unnumbered 
paragraph following the bullet points.  And of course we know that the performance of 
the Rand on the 10th fell sharper the next day on the 11th compared to his performance 
between the 9th and the 10th, we do not need to go to those figures. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I confirm that Mr Maleka. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, and then you tell us where we can get the statement issues by 
20 
Minister van Rooyen.  I looked at it, it is for no moment for the present purposes, unless 
you want to comment on it, but I do not think it will help the, Chairperson, one way or 
the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may not be able to answer this, but answer it if you are able to.  
What do you or what did you ascribe Mr van Rooyen's failure in his statement to deal 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 42 of 141 
 
with what you considered to be very important issues that a Minister of Finance should 
have dealt with on that occasion? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The first problem for me was that he deprived, and I say this 
with humility, he deprived himself the opportunity to draw on the experience of many 
people who have been doing the job that he was about to take and what it means.  
When you walk into a new role, unless you have performed it elsewhere it makes a lot 
of sense to humble yourself without humiliating yourself, but to humble yourself to 
interact with the people you have. 
 
They are in effect members of your team.  It does not matter at what level 
you come into an organisation, but definitely as you are coming in as a Minister you 
10 
inherit the people.  You can decide of course later on that some of them do not fit your 
plans and stuff like that, but of course if you come in at the risk of being verbose and 
you have been told that, that one and that one and that one, there were four of us, they 
are bad, they must go. 
 
You cannot then listen to them telling you what you must say, because it is a 
contradiction, right?  And of course I did not know that at the time.  I got to know it in 
the evening by talking to Mr Jonas and then I put, you know, connected the dots. 
 
So that is the one things, and of course talking to the people who have been 
there who are members of your team, even if you had had good proximity to their work 
as Mr van Rooyen was, to allows you to really understand what is said in the media 
20 
carries a totally different meaning to you, you know, because they can tell you, when 
they say this, when the media people are saying this, when investors are asking this, 
when rating agencies are asking about this, not only are they asking what seems 
obvious, but they also want to know ABC. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 43 of 141 
 
 
So I am saying that he deprived himself to understand the staff, and I could 
say here without fear of contradiction he had different priorities.  I mean, you know if 
you are coming and you have been told one of your first tasks is to get rid of these 
people you would – it is a distraction that there is an economy that is bleeding.  Your 
financial institutions, your – a whole lot of parts of your economy are in pain, figuratively 
speaking, because of this development. 
 
And of course it may well be that he had this dilemma that the media was not 
describing him in positive terms, they were using the term back bencher, unknown and 
stuff like that, so he just, he may have had those dilemmas too, but if I may say this and 
I say this, you know it sounds a bit, I do not know how to say, he had not come to terms 
10 
with the role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would you say he might not have had or he did not have a true 
appreciation of the enormity of the issues involved in being Minister of Finance in that 
kind of environment that had developed since the announcement of the removal of Mr 
Nene and his own appointment?  Or you would say he did have the appreciation, but he 
may have had other priorities as you say? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I think he had a broad sense of appreciating it, but I will say 
this and again I say it with the greatest of respect, if you just think about what then 
flowed in terms of news, how the decision was changed, it took several business 
people among others, I am not saying only, and some key politicians it would seem 
20 
from what I heard from Mr Gordhan here, being able to explain in clear terms the crisis 
that was unfolding before everyone. 
 
And the problem with crisis like those is that a person who just goes into Pick 
n Pay to buy bread does not associate the effect that the Rand is collapsing to the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 44 of 141 
 
effect that life tomorrow is going to be harder.  Some people realise it when life is 
actually becoming hard and this is not an insult to them. 
 
I know it myself before I started economics, I used to just see these 
economic indicators at the end of the news, that would be the time when I switched 
channels, because I though this thing had nothing to do with me.  And some of this and 
one has to watch how he says it, comes out of the commentary that came from some of 
the leaders about the Rand, which demonstrated lack of appreciation that it affects 
everyone. 
 
People thought that, because it is published, you know you get an index that 
is in the JSE published Dollar, Rand exchange rate and my people in the village do not 
10 
trade currencies, but for heaven’s sake, they ride a taxi that has got to have fuel in it 
and we do not produce oil we import it. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So all to quickly what appears to be a very distant event, and 
event that I might think should not interest me, does not impact me. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So I am saying that he may have been amongst those who 
were on the border line of not appreciating fully the crisis that was unfolding. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  I think Minister Gordhan did explain to us the 
flow through effect of this weakening Rand and its multi-fold consequences on ordinary 
people such as you and me and the inflationary effect of it.  I do not want you to get 
there, but you conclude that phase of the swearing in ceremony by saying to the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 45 of 141 
 
Chairperson that after the swearing in, Minister van Rooyen left with the President and 
did not say anything to you, and you seem to feel affronted by that fact? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Here is time for confession again.  This is one of those lines 
that I put in very last, after thinking about it a lot, because I thought it could be subject 
to different interpretation that I was offended personally.  Personally I did not care about 
maybe let me rephrase that – it is a lot like I would kill myself for having Mr van Rooyen 
refusing to shake my hand, but I was just concerned that I did not know who else 
observed it, who might write about it in ways that suggest that then the relationship 
between him and a Minister and I as DG was not going to work. 
 
And inferences that people would draw from that, because for some reason 
10 
what you find is that in many instances when people in the media, rating agencies, 
investors get to know that Mr X has grown within the Treasury, they have been 
interacting with him/her then he becomes a DG, they get to have confidence in the 
person. 
 
A little to do with the shape of his forehead or something like that.  They 
know that this person probably knows what the Treasury is about.  So now when he did 
not shake my hand I thought that this might have been spotted by the media and if they 
did spot this they would infer that I am not going to stay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I am sorry, I know I am interrupting you, but because I did not 
hear it so well, maybe somebody else also did not hear it so well, but I am now looking 
20 
at the statement, I can pick it up.  The point you are making is that after Mr van Rooyen 
had been sworn in, he walked out with the President and when he came back to all of 
you who were waiting outside, Mr Bhobat was in front of you, he shook his hand? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, to congratulate him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 46 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  He congratulated him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and congratulated him. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You followed and put out your hand to congratulate him, but you 
were surprised that he ignored you and walked away instead, that is the point that you 
are dealing with? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, that is the point I am dealing with, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And I make a couple of points, but I will not repeat all of them.  
I say, it did not offend me personally, but I cared about the optics of it, for what the 
10 
people around would interpret it to mean, that if the media sees that my new Minister 
has got no time to shake my hand to congratulate him, then they would infer that 
actually he hates me, he does not like me, he does not want to work with me. 
 
And therefore they would infer that I am likely to leave and I suspect they 
would not have been wrong and of course they could have inferred that there may be 
people who feel that if he does not like me, because they have worked with me for long, 
then they have got no reason to stay with him. 
 
And at this time I did not know of course that he had a list of people, but I 
was concerned about the message it would convey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That must have been quite strange, because as you have said you 
20 
have interacted with him on many occasions in his capacity as a member of the finance 
portfolio committee, is that how it is called? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Finance portfolio standing committee. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Standing committee on finance. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 47 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  On finance, ja, and you knew each other so well that you actually 
had his number and he had your number, he at some stage, occasionally you would call 
each other comrade, so this must have been quite strange? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I am not even sure the word strange captures it.  I mean, it was 
absurd in the extreme, because if I think about the last interaction we had with Mr van 
Rooyen it was in a boardroom in the Treasury, that is before the call that morning. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  We met him in the context of discussing a piece of legislation 
that we were having difficulties implementing and on the occasion he was very good, he 
played, he came as the whip of the governing party in that committee and to mediate 
10 
and to have this conversation, because the legislation was coming from Treasury, the 
Minister of Finance that is – and of course there were sections of the population that 
had issues with it. 
 
So he came to mediate and he played that role so well.  I would not take that 
away from him.  So that was the last interaction I had with him proper and then there is 
this evening/morning stuff that we had already been through and then at that moment.  
Of course if you then put that in the context of Mr Jonas' revelation that evening, you 
now understand that he had cause to do this, because it was the beginning of executing 
that first task, which is to communicate the message to me that I do not want you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as at the time that he ignored you and did not shake your hand, 
20 
you had as far as you, you had never done anything to upset him? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Except to do my job to the best of my ability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course at that time you would not have thought that, that would 
upset him? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 48 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, I was not naïve, Chairman.  The job of the Treasury was 
described very nicely here by Mr Gordhan reading a lot from Mr Manuel's – if you do it 
well you do not make many friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I understand that, but I would think that first and foremost the 
people with whom you might not make friends might be Ministers in other departments 
who want certain projects – I mean funding for certain projects and their DG's and then 
maybe some stakeholders and so on, but I am not sure about a member of portfolio 
committee whether he would immediately come into that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct, except that members of portfolio committees 
live in the society that we live in, so some of the views that are held by people in 
10 
society filter into how members of portfolio committees think, but I am just – in this case 
I am not even suggesting, because imagine this picture that I painted of my interaction, 
very healthy, proper with him a few weeks earlier, it could have been a month or so and 
then all of a sudden there was this kind of interaction. 
 
I cannot imagine at the risk of spoiling how – but of course this is something 
we covered yesterday, so there is no problem with it.  I think that other than the fact that 
he came with this agenda that was given to him by the Guptas if you will take Mr Jonas' 
story to be true, which I have got no reason not to believe, if you take that he came with 
that agenda it is not inconceivable that he had a real preoccupation to show Mr Bhobat 
who we know was connected to the Guptas for longer, that I am actually showing this 
20 
guy that I do not want him, so that he would have something good to report. 
 
Because if we would have hugged and said hallo comrade, welcome and 
stuff, the report could have been, I doubt if this guy is going to do what you have told 
him to do.  I mean if you stretch it and by the way it is not illogical. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 49 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It just seems really quite an unusual thing, because I am sure in your 
many years as DG there would be lots of South Africans who might have been unhappy 
about Treasury not approving that or that, but I do not know how many, you know did 
not want to shake your hand.  So, in anyway Mr Maleka you may proceed. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  No, Chair, can I follow on that, because it is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you.  I am just saying that it seems to me that whatever it 
is, it must have been something very important to him that made him do something so 
unusual and doing it to the DG of the department he was joining.  Somebody that he 
would need to work very closely with and of course you told us yesterday that the DG of 
Treasury is like a chief advisor to the Minister of Finance if I recall correctly.  Ja, okay, 
10 
alright, thank you. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Chair, you have captured it, I will leave it, I think I am adequately 
covered now on that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes, the next topic begins from paragraph 41 and you squarely 
deal with the legislative framework for appointment of advisors.  You referred to the 
provisions of Section 12(A) of the Public Service Act and, Chair, for your 
notes…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I did not want you to hear that, I wanted you to proceed, 
but the Registrar could not hear, I think my voice was to soft, you may proceed. 
20 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, Mr Maleka? 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Fuzile you set out the relevant provisions of 
Section 12(A) from paragraph 42.3 of your statement on page 64, and, Chair, for your 
notes we would ask you to cross-reference that paragraph 42.3 with EXHIBIT F1 which 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 50 of 141 
 
is the – you do not have to go there, if you could make it on your note, it is EXHIBIT F1 
page 76 and 77 which is the text of the Section including in the Williams bundle. 
 
We will debate later on, Chair, what that Section means, but your purposes 
Mr Fuzile, you have worked with that section and it lists a number of requirements.  
One of them is that there has to be a determination by a cabinet relating to the 
appointment of advisors.  We have asked your lawyers and they have now given us that 
determination made by cabinet set out in the special dispensation, a copy whereof we 
have included it in your bundle and that of the Chairperson. 
 
It begins at page 112J.  Can I ask you to go to page 112J?  Are you there? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I think so, the dispensation for the appointment 
10 
of…[intervenes] 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And I am going to highlight quickly some of the elements of it and if 
you go to page 112K you will see that after the introductory part of it in paragraph 1 
there is identification of the scope of that special dispensation from paragraph 2.  And 
the key thing is that it identifies in paragraph 2 the number or upper limits of the special 
advisors a Minister could appoint. 
 
Can you confirm to us what is the upper limit? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The upper limit is two, but it can be determined otherwise by 
20 
cabinet. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 5 we are told what are the 
requirements of the special advisors who could be appointed, pursuant to this special 
dispensation.  Can you tell us what is the key requirement that is referred to in 
paragraph 5? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 51 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is that they must be citizens of South Africa.  They must be 
subjected to security clearance.  Ja. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Alright, and then in paragraph 6, 7, 8 and 9 we are told what the 
role of the special advisor would be, do you see that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And my reading of it is that the role of the special advisor cannot 
include the take over power of the functions and duties that are conferred upon 
employees of a department such as National Treasury, correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Now there is part of the special dispensation and perhaps you can 
10 
identify it for me now, which says that a special advisor cannot assume the functions 
and duties of a Director General? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Towards the end of paragraph 7 of that – I do not know if you 
call it exhibit or what, the last line, the very last line…[intervenes] 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Can you read it out for us? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It says: 
"The special advisor shall direct his/her inputs to the executive 
authority and emphasis refrain from interfering in the 
administration and management of the department, which in 
law is the function and responsibility of the Director General." 
20 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It was for this reason that I said the things he did were illegal, 
because this builds on the Public Service Act. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  As you were directing me. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 52 of 141 
 
ADV MALEKA SC:  So in context and applying characters at play at that time you are 
the DG, you are the accounting authority, the Minister has now been sworn in and 
someone introduces himself to you as the special advisor of the Minister.  Those are 
the three characters at play. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And one of them purports to give you instructions and that would 
be in breach of this part of the special dispensation? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And as the statement shows he also went ahead to issue 
10 
instructions to Ms Matanda. 
ADV MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 8 there is an exclusion of things 
special advisors cannot do once appointed, lawfully in terms of this special 
dispensation.  Can I ask you to read it out for us please? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
"The serving of special advisors on statutory boards or councils 
for which the executive authorities individual are correctively 
accountable would be inappropriate since it could give rise to a 
direct or indirect conflict of interest or advice which could be 
bias or perceived to be bias, therefore, a person who is to be 
20 
appointed as a special advisor serves on a statutory board or 
council or similar bodies for which the relevant executive 
authority 
individual 
are 
correctly 
accountable, 
his/her 
appointment to such boards or council must be terminated with 
effect from date of appointment as special advisor to the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 53 of 141 
 
relevant executive authority." 
ADV MALEKA SC:  And finally the general provisions of the special dispensation 
beginning from paragraph 10 stipulate that there has to be a contract of the kind that is 
approved by Cabinet that has to be concluded between the special advisor and the 
executive authority.  You see that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it identifies components of the contract. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then it makes it quite clear what the benefits, I am 
talking about the financial benefits of the special advisor would be.  We do not have to 
10 
go there for the purposes of our discussion. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thus far the special dispensation sets out several 
requirements which must be complied with before someone can lawfully call himself or 
herself a special advisor of an executive authority such as Minister Van Rooyen, 
correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair we have included in the bundle specimen 
documents of the type of contract which had been approved by cabinet which has to be 
concluded by a special advisor and his or her Minister.  If I can ask you to reverse back 
20 
to page 112A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  11? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  2A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That document is an example of a contract of 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 54 of 141 
 
employment executed by a Minister and we have redacted the names so that they 
should not disclose confidential matters, but you will see that the first part of the 
document indicates that the contract is entered into by and between the government of 
the Republic of South Africa and its National Treasury and herein represented by 
Lungisa Fuzile in his capacity as the DG and as such duly authorised and then it 
indicates who else would be the special advisor to conclude that contract.  In National 
Treasury this will be the format of the type of contract that will be concluded by a 
special advisor and National Treasury for and on behalf of the Minister, correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and you would sign that contract. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes I would sign that contract. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As appears...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  On a rare occasion it might be someone to whom I would have 
delegated that authority. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Very rare. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this person who was issuing instructions to you on the first day 
that you met actually at a formal level to say the least is a person to whom you would 
stand as employer, because you would represent the government in the contract that 
20 
he would ordinarily be required to conclude. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  We wanted to hold back on that 
proposition until later, but it is self-evident and then Chair the next document we have 
included begins at page 112E.  You will see that that is a memorandum which the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 55 of 141 
 
Minister concerned has to prepare and motivate for the appointment of a special 
advisor consistent with the requirements of the special dispensation and you will see 
that in this case the memo concerned is from Minister Gordhan who is motivating the 
purpose, the reason and requirements for the appointment of a special advisor that he 
sought at the time and Chair we have blocked out the names for the purposes of 
protecting confidentiality, but the rest of the motivation and elements of the 
requirements are set out Mr Fuzile from paragraph two.  I am not going to ask you to go 
through it unless you want to do so, but you will see that it indicates all sorts of 
requirements including the duration and thereafter a recommendation and someone will 
have to decide on this rather than the Minister himself who is making the request and 
10 
recommendation.  From your knowledge once the Minister prepares this memorandum 
who then decides on it? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is an interesting question because it is almost like the 
Minister would have made up his mind in this case that he wants the advisor, but quite 
importantly the Minister would not simply go ahead and appoint the advisor for the 
following reason which I capture in my memorandum and you will see it in this 
memorandum why it is important, because the Director General of a department who is 
the accounting officer is the person who as I was describing yesterday led by Mr 
Maleka has got the duty and responsibility to ensure that every contract that gives rise 
to an expenditure from a department there is money in the department to meet that 
20 
financial commitment.  So the Minister may from his heart and head feel he needs an 
advisor but if the department does not have a resource and the Director General or 
accounting officer says there is no resource then the Minister will not appoint.  The 
same would apply in the unlikely event that the Minister wants to exceed the threshold 
that is allowed in the dispensation, special dispensation we are discussing then the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 56 of 141 
 
Director General would have to politely remind the Minister that no, no, no you have 
exhausted your quota now and similarly if there is any inconsistency between what the 
Minister wants and any of the relevant rules the Director General or the accounting 
officer has got a duty and responsibility to make sure that he or she tells the Minister 
and as we say it in government if the Minister insist the law is very good with this all 
you do is to ask him or her to put it in writing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And then you have absolved yourself. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is the reason why I ask you this question 
because here it seems to be that the roles of approval and the location of the authority 
10 
to approve is reversed, because there are PFMA implications here.  It is not the 
Minister who is responsible for unauthorised expenditure of the kind.  It is you as the 
Director General. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that you must express that approval that there is 
indeed a budget allocation for the advisor the Minister seeks and you must say yay or 
nay and if the Minister insists then questions of absolutions from your part will follow by 
asking him to put it in writing. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the Auditor General will then take over. 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When the time for audit comes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Exactly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Now...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Maleka.  You said that you people blocked out the names, 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 57 of 141 
 
but whatever you used is not, was not very effective.  So I think you must at the earliest 
opportunity find something that will be effective.  If you stand at a certain angle you can 
see the names.  You can read the names. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair mea culpa it is the lawyers of Mr Fuzile that did 
the exercise and I...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I show you that they hear you on this score?  I 
would like to round up all of these requirements in the context of the facts because they 
mean nothing unless you apply them to the facts that we are dealing with during the 
reference period.  We have gone through the law, we have gone through the 
10 
requirements of the processes.  We have gone through the powers and duties.  On the 
facts here you are, you are sitting with Mr Bhobat who told you that he is the advisor.  
Did he or the Minister at the time show you any contract that he may have had to justify 
his status as an advisor? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No Mr Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As far as you are aware given that interposing 15 to 17 
hours would he have gone through any security clearance as is required under the 
special dispensation? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I doubt if he would have, but even if there were to be an 
attempt the letter would have had to come from or under the letterhead of the Treasury 
20 
to the relevant authorities that undertake security clearance.  So unless of course he 
was migrating as an advisor from another department which happens a lot.  If a Minister 
transfers to another department the law is written in such a way that at least there is a 
month in which the Minister can move that advisor or leave the advisor in the one 
department and then processes to regularise what happens beyond that can be 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 58 of 141 
 
followed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You have already told the Chairperson that you did 
not sign any contract. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What then remains is to find out whether you yourself 
had explored the question that there was or there was no money within the budget of 
treasury to accommodate the costs of whatever advisor or advisors Minster Van 
Rooyen would have wanted to appoint?  Had you explored that issue at that point in 
time? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Not when I met Mr Bhobat and not when I met Mr Van Rooyen.  
10 
Even if we were to hypothesise that I had explored it at one point where Minister 
Gordhan would have wanted to appoint advisors I would have explored it for a different 
reason under a different context.  So the facts would have changed.  So the process 
needed to be restarted and rerun even if it comes to the same conclusion. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All right and then in paragraph 46 on page 67 of your 
statement you emphasise a point about the probity and integrity of persons who must 
be appointed as special advisors, correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say that it must be persons of utmost integrity 
and it must be a person who would not leak information to persons outside the 
20 
department in order to influence policy for nefarious purposes.  We will get back to the 
facts on this issue, but Chair these are not new standards.  They apply across the 
board in all employees of the State and they are usefully set out in the Treasury, not 
Treasury the Public Service Regulations and they have been canvassed by Ms Hofmeyr 
with Ms Williams. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 59 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I remember. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I do not have to take you through them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that these standards apply across the board as 
between advisors and also the employees of the State.  I would like to move now to the 
next topic of your statement which is the one that begins from Friday of the 11 th and you 
deal with that topic from paragraph 47 on page 67 and I want you to be as quickly as 
you can in that regard and can I ask you to tell us about the morning conversation you 
had with Mr Van Rooyen on the 11th of December 2015? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  As 47 indicated Mr Chair the first part was about a telephone 
10 
call.  I cannot recall quite who called whom but the essence of it is that the 
conversation was that I should be at the, we should meet at 11:00, that is Mr Van 
Rooyen and I in his office at 40 Church Square and he also asked that on the same day 
at 11:15 I should arrange to, for him to be able to meet the whole executive that he 
might direct reports.  Of course I duly availed myself for the meeting and as I was 
walking into the office Mr Jonas was walking out.  He looked quite tense.  I asked him if 
he was going to join us which was just the usual thing unless of course diaries were not 
permitting that the Deputy Minister, Minister and I would meet together and then meet 
the executive together and he shook his head in disagreement and walked towards his 
office.  Of course I walked into the office, found Mr Van Rooyen with three gentleman.  
20 
Mr Bhobat that I have already mentioned, Mr Whitley and Mr Malcolm Mabaso. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Then are you able to indicate why Mr Jonas 
decided not to join the meeting that you, your direct reports and Mr Van Rooyen and his 
– those who accompanied him would be part of that meeting?  I mean is there anything 
that you would like to share with us on that score? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 60 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I can make an inference. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well then let us not go there. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Jonas will speak for himself. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  There was no specific reason that we talked about. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No he will speak for himself. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But as a fact you say he decided not to become part of 
that meeting? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And I had asked him in my case. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Then please continue about what happened after 
you met the four gentlemen. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Then when we were meeting Mr Van Rooyen instructed me to 
expedite the process of formalising the appointment of Mr Bhobat and Mr Ian Whitley 
as advisor and as Chief of Staff respectively albeit by the way with some sort of 
stumbling in terms of who is Chief Advisor, who is Chief of Staff and who is advisor. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no it is important and I would like you 
to...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is important.  Deal with it properly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay because at one stage he pointed to Mohamed Bhobat as 
Chief of Staff and then he said no I will be advisor.  Chief of Staff is this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That part just say it – narrate it as it happened.  It is quite 
important. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then take your time please. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 61 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Unless you have other pressing engagements 
elsewhere. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  He walked in, we sat.  Could you appoint these two gentlemen 
and then pointing towards Mr Bhobat he said this one is Chief of Staff and then the 
reaction was no, no, no I will be advisor, this one will...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who is saying...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  This is Mr Bhobat. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Saying that he is going to be advisor and the other one is 
10 
going to be the Chief of Staff which is Mr Ian Whitley. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you saying that Mr Bhobat is correcting the Minister? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On the status that he is going to and the role that he is 
going to play? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  How is that possible? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It happened. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I know that it happened but what explains it as far as 
you are concerned? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I suspect that the title Chief of Staff sometimes sounds like the 
Chief of Staff in the White House for some people because if you think about a Chief of 
Staff in the White House that is the only example that comes to mind it is I suspect it 
would be the most senior role in the office of the President.  I might be wrong. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is an official appointment. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 62 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By the President of the US. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In his administration. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact in some regard that person as a de facto 
president.  So let us not go there. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So I suspect...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes.  So I suspect that in just saying the words Mr Van Rooyen 
10 
you will remember that there are these two roles advisor and Chief of Staff and the one 
that sounded senior was Chief of Staff to advisor and I mean it sincerely because of 
this Chief of Staff advisor and then he corrected him in that way. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Right then we know from your explanation that it is 
Mr Bhobat who immediately corrected the Minister.  What did Mr Ian Whitley say if ever 
he had to say something about the confusion of the roles? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No he was – he was quiet and smiled a bit. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and there was a third person that you identify as 
Mr Malcolm Mabaso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to Mr Mabaso as Mr Van Rooyen was telling you who 
20 
was going to be Chief of Staff and who was going to be Minister the two men were in 
front of him? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if he knew exactly which one was to be his advisor and which one 
was to be Chief of Staff if he had appointed them himself he could not make a mistake 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 63 of 141 
 
because he would know which one he had appointed, is it not? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is a reasonable observation, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be different and you must just make comment on this, it 
might be different if they were not in front of him and he was giving you names and then 
maybe if you said Mr Bhobat, well as he did say Mr Bhobat would be Chief of Staff and 
Mr Whitley would be advisor he might be having the right face in mind but the wrong 
name but here they are in front of him.  How does one make that mistake? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I would make it, Mr Chairman if I am overwhelmed.  You have 
got people you do not know very well, you have not known for long which is why I used 
the phrase I do not want to suggest he does not know them very well and then but it 
10 
just looked like the way things were unfolding in front of my eyes it did not look like they 
had known each other for too long and it also did not look to me that most of what Mr 
Van Rooyen was saying was original to your point which is that if you, I even think that 
Mr Chairman you are being too accommodating if I know two people very well and I 
know two roles that I want to assign them.  I do not need to see their faces to say that 
person A is going to be this and person B is going to be this. 
 
If you know the people very well and know the roles very well you will correct 
yourself if you have got a Freudian slip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just trying to understand how it could happen.  Maybe – maybe 
there is some explanation and I am trying to understand but you did try to offer some 
20 
explanation. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I can see now, Mr Chairman you are getting close to where I 
was.  I could sense yesterday that Mr Maleka was feeling that I should be able to just 
say that when things were said by Mr Godongwana and then I should just make sense 
of these things. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 64 of 141 
 
 
The problem with these things is that normal human beings in my book 
operate within a frame of what you expect to be normal.  We do not expect that while 
we are sitting here someone can just walk in naked because it is antisocial.  It is not 
how we have been socialised. 
 
We understand that before you walk out of your home you must ready 
yourself to be presentable.  So that is why a lot of what we talk about here we sound 
like we have lost our senses because some of the things just do not make sense 
including this next point that if you are happy I can get into. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before you get these...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before even Mr Maleka you see part of the reason why I put this 
10 
to you I ask this question, Mr Fuzile, is that part of the Judge's job or anybody who is 
called upon to listen to evidence from different witnesses and make up his or her mind 
is that you always have to leave room that what might seem inexplicable may well be 
explicable or may well be explained by somebody else and then when that person 
explains it you say oh, okay he does make sense.  At that time I did not see it so. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is part of my job to try and say when something appears to 
other people not to make sense or maybe even to me I try and see if there might be 
some sense.  So okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair and you can see that the training of 
20 
lawyers is to keep an open mind.  Chair, Mr Van Rooyen and the three persons will 
speak for themselves but you, Mr Fuzile have to assist us to the extent possible on this 
issue and where I was going to test your version on this issue is this. 
 
I wanted to do it before I get – I wanted to do it after I had explored with you 
the question of Mr Mabaso. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 65 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But let me do it now because the difficulty as the 
Chairperson has put to you are still fresh in your mind.  You recall that you have dealt 
with the question of conflict of or inconsistency of instructions the previous day as 
between the Minister and Mr Bhobat? 
 
We have gone through that territory.  We do not have to rerun again and 
here you are second time around.  You are now being given something which on the 
face of it is an instruction repeating or reflecting to some degree that inconsistency. 
 
You were asked to facilitate and to do it quickly the execution of the contracts 
of the DG for the advisors.  You are told by the Minister that hey for this one is Chief of 
10 
Staff.  On the face of it and absence any further comment you would have to do what 
the Minister tells you, correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now there is an interruption by someone who corrects 
the Minister that by the way I am the advisor not the Chief of Staff.  There is conflict at 
that point in time.  At worse there is an inconsistency.  
 
How do you go about implementing that ministerial agent instruction?  What 
line do you take in between and what line did you intend to take at that point in time? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The problem did solve itself on the spot in a way or albeit 
intelligently because then Mr Van Rooyen accepted the assignment of roles. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The correction. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The correction yes, accepted the correction.  So because it 
had come out of his mouth that is what I was going to explore doing.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well realise the difficulty which I have and I put it to you 
so that you can comment on it.  It is now Mr Bhobat who reflect the true nature of the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 66 of 141 
 
instructions and not the Minister. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  You are correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well can we get to Mr Mabaso if you have nothing 
further to say on this second round of a conflict of instructions? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, no suffice to just make the point that from the difference of 
views the previous day and that little bit but it was clear even from the previous day that 
we were actually set for a very difficult time as a team because you – it was clear that 
there were times where the advisor and the Minister would differ.  The advisor is quite 
assertive or was quite assertive. 
 
Then the Minister went on to point in the direction of Mr Mabaso to say I 
10 
should not worry about him insofar as the formalisation of the paperwork.  He was just 
going to be around. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What does that mean or how did you understand him to 
convey? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I understood him to be saying that we should not have a 
contract like that sample contract that you saw, Mr Chairman want to that then would 
imply that – in fact his name would not have appeared on any memorandum like the 
one you saw again in the sample or if it were to appear it would have been an odd thing 
because you would have said there is going to be someone but his role is not that clear 
and there is no salary and there is not going to be a contract.  I would not have signed 
20 
such a...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess there would have been no office either. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I do not know about that because he said he was going to be 
around.  I do not think he was going to be walking up and down passages but I am 
saying as he said it to me honestly. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 67 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So in essence I understood him to be saying you must not put 
therefore if you do not have that contract you cannot capture the person's details on the 
electronic system that government uses to keep a person's details to run a person's 
salary, leave and everything on a regular basis.  I objected to that.  Actually very firmly.  
I said I do not think it is going to happen to which Minister Van Rooyen responded in a 
way that shocked me.  In fact I must say it annoyed me because he said "no, you must 
just facilitate this thing, you are just a DG."  Now at that point I had to remind him that 
the role of a DG is, carries more weight than what he was insinuating.  In fact the 
Director General is the accounting officer of the department.  I underlined this here and 
10 
I found that very disturbing coming from someone who had been a member of 
Parliament.  Someone I had interacted with.  Who held me accountable. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And now all of a sudden he is reducing the importance of the 
position. I do not care about what you call me as long as you do not swear at me in 
ways that get me to feel that it warrants a response or reaction, but you know, but the 
whole notion that the law, the law says this person is the accounting officer.  It sets out 
the duties and responsibilities of the person and here I have a Minister who the first 
conversation suggest that when it suits him he will reduce or diminish this role, which 
then means he is likely to run roughshod what the responsibilities it carries.  Then I 
20 
could foresee a situation where we were going to disagree every day and it was at that 
point that for the first time I suggested to all of them that they should familiarise 
themselves with the Ministerial handbook and all the relevant laws so that from that 
point onwards we would interact from an understanding of the same rules of the same 
system that we were serving, but I also encouraged Mr Van Rooyen to fill out as he 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 68 of 141 
 
goes through the Ministerial handbook what is allowed in it and whether there would be 
a role that he thinks Mr Mabaso could fit in which would fit within the rules, but the just 
being around bit I said to him was unacceptable.  In fact I emphasised to him and said 
"you may want to think about this before we go to the other meeting with the rest of the 
colleagues."  Parts of what concerned me had less to do with me as a person Lungisa 
Fuzile but the role that I was supposed to play and if I had gone to the meeting with all 
my reports where the Minister says we have just had a discussion with the DG, we are 
agreeing that Mr Mabaso is just going to be around.  My colleagues would have thought 
that from the last time they saw me I had gone insane. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is the sense I get that you are now longer a Mr 
10 
Nice Guy who you were the day before and now you are setting your own authority of 
the office of the DG at that point in time.  So there has been a swung in the perspective 
and the conversation between you and the Minister at that point in time.  Can I just ask 
you a last question before I ask for the lunch adjournment?  You indicated when and 
how you met Mr Bhobat so that by the time he arrives on the 11th at the office of 
Treasury he is no longer a stranger.  What about Mr Whitley?  When did you meet him 
for the first time? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The occasion in the Minister's office was the very first time I 
ever saw him, I ever saw him. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Had you heard about his name before? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Not at all. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What about Mr Mabaso? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I do not know if I had heard about his name or I checked 
afterwards, but I checked all of them by the way in the, on the internet just to connect 
them and at some point I picked that Mr Mabaso may have been a business partner 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 69 of 141 
 
with the Guptas or something. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But that is after the fact of your meeting? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I think so, I think so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I did not know him before that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair I see that it is past 13:00.  I wonder 
whether it is that moment for a traditional long break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at 14:00. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Maleka? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair thank you.  It is that time of the day when one's 
brain works less efficient than other vital organs.  We will try as best as we can to 
maintain the desired level of concentration.  Mr Fuzile we were at page 68 of your 
statement and we had just finished your view of things when you were told that you 
were just a DG.  I would like now to talk about the next instruction that flows from 
Minister Van Rooyen which you deal with from paragraph 54.  Are you able to canvas 
that part of the instruction?  I think you used the verb demand.  Can you just explain 
20 
what he said to you first of all? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes thank you very much.  At that point Mr Van Rooyen when 
we were still in his office asked that I should work to ensure that by Monday the 14 th I 
could furnish him with a handover report and I go on to explain here that I think in fact 
that that request was unreasonable and I list the reasons that I can go through fairly 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 70 of 141 
 
quickly.  One, because I have already touched on it Mr Chairman at the beginning I had 
received for instance my own handover report from my predecessor Mr Kganyago who 
was the DG. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Mr Nene who was Mr Van Rooyen's predecessor I had 
received his handover report from Minister Gordhan.  So Minister Van Rooyen had in 
fact refused earlier on, in fact a day or so earlier the opportunity to meet Mr Nene which 
would have allowed him to make arrangements either to start the process of handing 
over as Mr Maleka was relating me earlier on in that direction correctly so and of course 
to the extent that time might have been a constraint he would have had the opportunity 
10 
to, the two of them would have had an opportunity to agree an appropriate time to do it.  
So for all of those reasons and in fact of course the fact that it was middle of December 
and I knew and then told him at that point and later on it became obvious I suppose 
even to him when we met the executive that most people who would assist the Minister 
by sort of indicating or doing write ups on the important projects in relation to their 
areas of work had already left for holidays.  So then the timeline of requiring a report 
from me by Monday was actually very unreasonable. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I communicated that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before you talk about the unreasonableness of the 
20 
timeline you reference an event in prospects at that point in time.  In other words an 
event which took place after the instruction by Minister Van Rooyen to you on the 11 th, 
but also to make the point that when both Minister Gordhan and his deputy Mr Jonas 
were removed there was a moment when they did hand over the ministries and they did 
so to their successors who were both Minister Gigaba and Deputy Minister Buthelezi.  
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 71 of 141 
 
You made that point in paragraph 54.2.  Do you see that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes I do.  I do and really the point to emphasise, thank you Mr 
Maleka for pointing me to that, is that even though as the Commission knows now Mr 
Chairman Minister Gordhan and his deputy Mr Jonas had been removed in the most 
unceremonious of manners.  They still saw it fit to respect the practice, normal practice 
I might add of making sure that they do not just walk away in disappointment, in anger 
and not do what is proper, which is to hand over yet Minister Van Rooyen saw it fit not 
to agree to a similar process. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair you will see that he makes that point on 
page 68 of EXHIBIT P, at page 54.2 when he talks about that well known event which 
10 
the media describes it as the night of the long knives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry Mr Maleka you will have to repeat that.  My mind 
was on something else. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will the legal team please make sure that in this bundle such as this 
one which has got Mr Fuzile's statement...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has got other witnesses' statement that there are markers or 
something that immediately tells me where to go...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I look for a particular statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I have had to page through for some time trying to see where, 
where his statement as. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 72 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that would be very helpful. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair I apologise.  I see that your Registrar has 
one immediately available for the present purposes.  Can I ask that it be...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be done later for now because I found it.  That is fine.  It can 
be made with other bundles as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, all right.  Yes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I really apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  There was something you were saying? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  While my mind was on how to find the statement.  Do you want to 
repeat that? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Page 68 Chair paragraph 54.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You would recall that Mr Fuzile is now talking about the 
instruction that he must produce a handover report by Monday of the preceding Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So they are talking with Minister Van Rooyen on Friday 
and he has given...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that would be, was Friday the 11th? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the report must come on Monday the 14th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he gives reasons. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 73 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why he cannot do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And one of the reasons he gives in 54.2 that he has 
already canvassed is, "but I had previously invited you Minister Van Rooyen to meet 
with your predecessor Minister Nene who was available to meet you to get a handover 
report from him because he is your colleague at an executive functionary level" and he 
was dealing with that fact by illustrating why that ought to have been the process by 
referring to something that happened thereafter and that was the dismissal of Minister 
Gordhan and Minister or Deputy Minister Jonas. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I heard everything that Mr Fuzile said in regard to that evidence.  It is 
just what you were saying that last bit that I did not hear. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I heard all his evidence...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the reasons why he thought that Minister Van Rooyen's 
request was unreasonable. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually what I wanted to ask him Mr Fuzile in regard to one of your 
reasons is whether when you had suggested to Mr Van Rooyen on, I do not know if it 
20 
was on the 9th, but that he should come early, it must have been on the, to come early 
on the 10th. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you knew that Minister Nene either was going to be or was 
likely to be in the office so they could meet.  When you made that suggestion did you 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 74 of 141 
 
do anything more than simply say well it might be a good idea that you come early and 
meet Mr Nene before he leaves or did you specifically talk about handover? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I do not recall if I spoke about the handover but I did speak 
about the opportunity for him to meet Mr Nene and the opportunity for both of them 
together to address staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And in a way, look I might have...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may have had it in mind. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  For sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might...[intervenes] 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No I definitely had it in mind, but I mean without appearing like 
I am leading them...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And handholding them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  But at least the opportunity to meet would have presented 
opportunity for a whole host of other things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that if you had mentioned specifically there might have been 
a certain angle in which I would have been interested in the fact that he was now 
asking you to give him...[intervenes] 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  A handover report, but in fact you are saying that if he had taken up 
your suggestion, if he had accepted, if you would have had a chance to speak to 
Mr Nene and in all probability their conversation might have included things like what 
are the most important issues that need attention. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 75 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No it definitely would have Mr Chairman.  I mean one of the 
things in fact I had in mind was that I would sort of prepare Mr Nene and say to him one 
of the things you have got to talk to Mr Van Rooyen about is the fact that we have a 
budget process that is running a month behind because normally we would get to 
November, the meeting that we went to that December 9th that is used to be November, 
but now it was maybe the second or third year in the running where it was migrating 
and going into December and in fact previously it would get into December and things 
would be concluded, but in that particular year it got into December and things did not 
get concluded because of the higher education problem that I referred to, which then 
was taking the budget process into the following year and South Africans go on holiday 
10 
or leave most of them between the 16th of December roughly, mid-December to the, you 
know end of the first week of January usually people return on the second week.  So 
you know I wanted him to impress it upon him that there was some heavy lifting to be 
done even before we went home so that we would give direction to the leadership of 
the department about the difficult task that remained and even implore people to return 
a bit earlier than normal given that there was still a lot to do.  So I had in mind that that 
stuff, that bit must be on the table among other things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you very much.  Then we can talk about the 
timeframe relating to the demand for the handover.  Minister Van Rooyen was quite 
20 
clear that he wanted it by Monday. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you took a different view as I understand your 
statement.  You took the view that Monday was unreasonable. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes I did. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 76 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you tell him that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No I did.  I did.  In fact in a way because I was realising that we 
were headed for a difficult time at my age I realised that it is going to be very important 
that we understand the boundaries here so that we can settle some of those problems 
and then I decide if I leave, but what I was not going to accept or allow is that I get 
bullied around, because, less because I wanted to be a hero but a lot because if that 
had started with me and if it succeeded with me then it would have meant that it is 
going to be a bit difficult for the people under me and I am not suggesting that I was 
stronger than them but I was definitely their leader. 
 
Now if I get humiliated and just get told you know you cannot have a 
10 
weekend now you know when a person has failed to do his part notwithstanding what I 
considered to be reasonable advice and then expect that you pass that problem to me I 
thought no, no, no we should define a way of working that is professional, that 
demonstrates respect for one another which I why then I still said to him I will make an 
effort to make sure that you have got something but at a reasonable time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then what was your response because it seems to me 
that there is not a common understanding as between you and him.  You insist 
reasonableness, he insists Monday.  What was the ultimate conclusion of that shall I 
say a difference of view?  How was that issue settled? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No we had to settle for my time bearing in mind that it was not 
20 
even my duty.  You know in essence strictly speaking he was asking me to do him a 
favour.  Now you do not say do me a favour on my terms. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All right but ultimately did you get around to giving him a 
handover report. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  We did not have time to get to that because the weekend's 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 77 of 141 
 
events happened. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All right.  So what began as an instruction ended up 
being a [indistinct] squib. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I would not disagree with what you are saying. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right we are still there on the discussion between you 
and Minister Van Rooyen about the demand for a handover report and then you deal 
with a further interaction that took place about accommodation for him and you do so at 
paragraph 55 and I ask you to deal with that interaction in your own words. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes Mr Chairman.  At 55 I make the point that Mr Bhobat did 
ask that we should accelerate the process of finding accommodation for Mr Van 
10 
Rooyen, suitable accommodation which I add towards the end of that sentence a 
quotation – in quotation marks so that he would not be accessible to people. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why not? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  A charitable interpretation of this would be that if I return, if a 
person not you or myself if a person returns to let us say a neighbourhood where 
people know him and they know that he has been appointed or he has won a Lotto 
everybody would want to befriend the person. 
 
I mean there is a kind of a charitable interpretation that is done. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no, no. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  But there could be another one here in this context which is 
20 
that he, they must have access to him and by they, I mean him, Mr Bhobat and that lot 
of people without the people where he used to live having evidence of who comes and 
who goes because when he is in a place where he is not known that is easy to do 
relative to where he is known and my neighbours would know if the pattern around my 
house is changing from what it normally is whereas strangers do not know if I have got 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 78 of 141 
 
a particular pattern.  They do not know who my friends are and they may not even care 
to know who I am until of course they have got reason to. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you ask...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Maleka.  This is quite an unusual kind of statement so that 
he would not be easily accessible to people.  You are quite clear in your mind that that 
was said? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  This is what was said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  But I do want to because one does not want to create stories 
out of nothing.  Ministers are entitled to accommodation temporary or transitory 
10 
accommodation from the time of appointment because usually the predecessor is 
allowed a certain amount of time to vacate the official residence. 
 
So in that time temporary accommodations is not a problem.  So there is 
nothing to write home about.  Of course it is an aspect that has embarrassed many 
Ministers.  I mean it is common cause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I was more interested – what I was focussing on 
was...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The access yes I understand. I understand Mr Chair but I 
thought let me just get this out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So that people do not say there he goes.  He ought to know 
that people are allowed accommodation.  Let us just put that one aside.  I did not 
emphasise it here but this bit is strange and this is why one puts it here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And I have put my own interpretation to it. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 79 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And I guess the Commission can put its own interpretation too. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes but for as long as you are there the Chairperson 
would ask of you two things.  One is did you ask Mr Bhobat as he is speaking for the 
Minister why does he want the Minister not to be accessible to people? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, no I did not.  I did not.  I did not and I cannot make 
excuses for it but I was actually tired of the situation we were having unfolding. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes because I do not put it here but he had talked about 
a car.  Of course Ministers have got to have cars but it was as though he expected that 
there would have been a car ready on at the swearing in kind of a thing I mean. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  When it is just hours after the thing had happened.  Of course 
we had started the process but we did not have the car.  So there is also a sense in 
which he did not know a lot of what he was talking about but which is why I was talking 
about his lack of ability to restrain himself and observe protocol and just sometimes ask 
you know what is normally done in the circumstances? 
 
You know he comes highhandedly knowing making this demand.  Some of them 
– in fact all of them were inappropriate coming from him. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It just seems to me that it is an issue or a topic that must 
in fairness be dealt with through Mr Bhobat's evidence when he testifies because I do 
20 
not think that Mr Fuzile would help us further on that issue strange as this request might 
be...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no he will not help us further but I think he has been helpful 
enough to remember that this was a condition. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 80 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That where accommodation was to be found for Mr Van Rooyen it 
should be a place where he would not be easily accessible to people. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is important that he has told us that then the rest we 
can...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and when he comes Mr Bhobat we will ask him 
because he is a public representative.  On the contrary he must be accessible to 
people and that is what we do and we will do it and all of them will be accessible to the 
people beginning with the electoral campaign beginning early next year if it has not 
begun already. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And of course there is a contradiction here if I may?  The 
statement says you want to take the Treasury to rural people and make it accessible 
and then you a are drifting to a place where you will not be accessible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  But that was the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And something comes to mind in fact as we locate 
accessibility of Treasury to people.  My recollection is that you as Treasury also had 
that interesting but important public relations campaign on the budget on the road 
shows. 
20 
 
I am not too sure if that still is happening where you go about and engage the 
public on a widespread basis about the budget.  
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is still done Mr Chairman.  In fact a variation of it that came 
towards the tail end of my tenure was to even include institutions of higher learning.  
We would go to almost all universities.  In fact to most universities let me say to just 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 81 of 141 
 
interact with students and academics on the budget.  Yes you are correct, Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And many others – Ministers that I do recall they also 
invite the public to explain or send their wish list about what the budget should deal with 
and so on. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes it started under the Tips for Trevor I do not know whether 
to call it hash tag. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and Chair those campaigns are so widespread in 
terms of public engagement that the ceremony that might well come close to it as far as 
one could recall it will be equal or equivalent to the Rio Carnival but less frills than the 
carnival of that sort. 
10 
 
Anyway but the point is that all of those things engage the public and Minister 
who is the head of Treasury is accessible to the public and cannot be less accessible to 
the public. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is – I will agree with that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you indicate in paragraph 56 how you 
ultimately delegated the functions of [indistinct] Mr Van Rooyen to one of your staff 
members.  I think you call him Mr Study Mngomezulu, correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I have nothing further to deal with you on that 
issue unless you have further things to raise? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The only thing I would say in passing, Chair and perhaps on a 
lighter note if it is allowed here?  The actions of Mr Bhobat by the way were those of a 
Chief of Staff.  The roles that he was performing here are what you would expect a 
Chief of Staff to do which is to look after the wellbeing of the Minister, does he have – 
so it is quite an interesting thing which I thought I should just drop with the Commission. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 82 of 141 
 
 
So he was not quite too far off when he was introduced.  Forgive me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you think that in terms of the actual work that he seemed to like 
doing that was closer to a Chief of Staff than but he did not want the title? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It looks like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then we – the next chapter you deal with is the real 
business of Minister Van Rooyen's visit to Treasury on that day and that is to meet and 
greet the leadership of Treasury. 
 
You talk about that issue from paragraph 59 and I would like you to be fairly 
quick and brief if you can.  There are some highlights of that meet and greet session 
10 
that I would like to raise with you but in your own words can you sum up what 
happened when you went to is it the DG's boardroom to meet the leadership of 
Treasury? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Thank you very much.  Mr Chairman, the first thing perhaps 
that is maybe material of interest to the Commission Mr Van Rooyen did not bring Mr 
Mabaso to that meeting.  We can read what we make of that but he did not bring him 
and Mr Jonas also did not attend that meeting which was not the normal case.  I mean 
in most instances people would attend and of the people who attended when you get to 
61 I list some of them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Roughly now I have been talking to my colleagues to try and 
recollect.  We can give the names to the Commission, the complete list, but many 
people were in acting capacities because the persons who were heads of those 
divisions were on leave some of them.  The one person that is worth mentioning 
perhaps in passing here is Mr Mononiat.  You might remember that he was one of the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 83 of 141 
 
four people who were to be removed.  In his case because he was, although he was on 
leave he was still in Gauteng.  He took the trouble to come to the meeting and arrived a 
little late, but just as the meeting started.  Mr Van Rooyen we sat in the room and said it 
was going to be a very short meeting because he thinks that everyone knew everyone.  
So he it is going to be a meet and greet and of course, and he said hello or something 
along those lines and then I said to him "I think Minster we should just do kind of a 
proper introduction, because I think that the people you are have brought which is Mr 
Bhobat and Mr Whitley do not know the people and equally the people do not know 
them."  Of course it helped that one of the guys at the Treasury Mr Monale Ratsoma, I 
mention this I think in paragraph 62. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  61 I think. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  61, yes 61 or 60 somewhere there but I mention it that he very 
helpfully actually said "Minister I think you do not know me and I do not know you" and 
the Minister had a difficulty at that point because through and through he did not know 
him.  So because if he said he knew him he would have said "okay tell me who I am."  
So I did then insist I said "look Minister I think we should have a proper introduction." 
 
I was a bit, I did not like what was happening actually because if you just think 
about it just take the case of Mr Mononiat he is a senior official.  He takes the trouble to 
come and you say "I just want to say hello to you.  Go back home and continue with 
your holiday" and of course it is in the context that we have discussed this morning and 
20 
yesterday of what was happening in the economy.  It is in the context where two days 
or so earlier the budget process was clearly as I indicated running behind schedule.  So 
at least you needed the proper conversation.  So I insisted on the introductions and of 
course at that time something extraordinary happened in my view which is that he then 
tried, Mr Van Rooyen, to introduce the two gentlemen.  This had not, this did not need 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 84 of 141 
 
to happen in his office.  It occurs to me now, because he knew that we had met with 
Mr Bhobat.  It was only Ian Whitley that, Mr Ian Whitley that I had not met.  If you 
remember we had met with Mr Bhobat and Mr Van Rooyen on Thursday.  So the 
introduction in terms of names was not an issue.  What was an issue was introduction 
in terms of roles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Mr Whitley not also present...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No he was not...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the Union buildings...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No he was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  To my recollection he was not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you not say when I asked you whether when Mr Van Rooyen 
mixed up the titles I asked you the question whether Mr Whitley and Mr Bhobat were 
not in front of him and you answered yes? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes it was in his office Mr Chairman.  Let us just separate the 
days quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  There is Thursday the swearing in.  Only two people are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 10th was it Thursday? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The 10th was a Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is Mr Bhobat and Mr Van Rooyen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And myself.  It is now Friday.  On Friday I walk into Mr Van 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 85 of 141 
 
Rooyen's office...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the 11th? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I find him with three gentlemen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The one I had met the day before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Mr Bhobat.  Now he is with two other gentlemen Mr Mabaso 
and Mr Ian Whitley.  Of course naturally when I walk in they stand and we greet and we 
say each other's names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  We sit.  So there is no formal names again.  We talk about the 
appointment and so on.  Now move to Friday, sorry not to Friday.  It is still Friday, we 
walk out of the office to the meeting now...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the mix up with the positions on which date does it happen? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  On Friday the 11th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At his office? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  First at his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It happened more than once? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now I understand. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So then this is the second encounter for me with them.  The 
first with the rest of the executive.  We are together now.  So at that point then he then 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 86 of 141 
 
says "okay let us do the introductions" and he points at Mr Bhobat and you can see 
there is a bit of an awkward moment because the name does not come out and the guy 
helps him and he says "no I am Mohamed Bhobat" and he says "I call him Mo."  So, so 
afterwards he says "yes, no", the chief of staff says "no, no advisor."  So he continues 
then, it is easy then with Ian Whitley because now it is only the chief of staff. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you mean he makes this shall we call it a mistake for the second 
time. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in terms of Mr Bhobat? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes and just to be clear Mr Chairman the mistake of names did 
not occur in his office, because the names were not said.  The mistake in the office was 
the titles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay, okay, yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Now here he starts with the name.  He says, and then the 
person says "Mohamed Bhobat" and he says "yes I just call him Mo" and then, and then 
he continues to repeat the mistake he had made about title one more time and the guy 
corrects him and of course it was quiet so I decided to really make the point to show 
that I knew the people I was with and I took my time to introduce everyone.  Myself and 
20 
to say "look, this is person A, surname B", not the person who normally occupies the 
role, acting this one, the person who normally occupies the role you might know or not 
know it is so and so, he is on leave and this one and this one and they went around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was many people on your part that you had introduced? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It was many people.  I could say as I say we were about 13, 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 87 of 141 
 
14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  All of us including myself excluding the new people.  So I, 
then...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before you go further I understand the hilarity of that 
confusion as it is entertaining, but the consequences of it are far reaching and I would 
like you to deal with those consequences as you canvas them in paragraph 65 and 
perhaps a good starting point for it in order to illustrate those consequences of the 
second mistake is to read for us paragraph 65 in its entirety. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay.  During the introductions it became apparent that Mr Van 
10 
Rooyen was not fully familiar with neither of the two gentleman nor the specific roles he 
wanted them to play as they had to correct him on their names and new positions.  I 
recall that he said Mr Bhobat was going to be chief of staff and Mr Bhobat had to 
correct him that he was going to be the advisor.  At that point I again remembered the 
telephone conversation with Mr Gordhan.  Several of my colleagues who were in the 
room during the meeting had observed the same thing and I know this because we 
talked about it a lot from that point onwards. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  At that point in time the mental process that had 
engaged with you or you had been engaged in with was a repetition of a confusion on 
the part of Mr Van Rooyen, but at the same time replaying in your mind-set what Mr 
20 
Gordhan had been telling you on the 9th and taking the two together there is some 
reinforced conclusion you must have come to about the far reaching implication of the 
act of capturing Treasury as it was unfolding right in front of your eyes in your presence 
and the presence of your direct rapporteurs? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is correct.  I mean I at that point it had become very clear 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 88 of 141 
 
to me that a lot of what Mr Gordhan had said had been confirmed actually.  It is not like 
I was not making inferences.  He said he would come with advices given to him.  There 
were points as I have illustrated in the evidence that I have led where it was confirmed 
that he did not know the people.  So it stands to reason that they were given to him and 
it was clear also that certainly in relation to Mr Bhobat I want to make this quite clear he 
was asserting this kind of authority of almost like he is actually the guy in charge and 
you can say the instructions he was giving everything he was or many things he was 
saying, but of course by his own actions Mr Van Rooyen had shown unwittingly, 
inadvertently that he was not sufficiently familiar with them and the fact that he was 
making the mistakes about the roles would seem to suggest that it is not like his own 
10 
idea as the Chairman was indicating earlier on.  If I have decided that I am going to put 
person A and I have determined that I need person A for this role person A does not 
have to keep reminding me that no, no, no you said I am going to be this kind of thing 
reminding him about his name or her name and also the role.  So I am saying in that 
context there was no doubt that a lot of what he had said was correct.  The one bit that 
I still it was there but, you know, it was to be confirmed as it became later on clear was 
this connection to the Guptas. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes.  Chair Mr Mokoena asked me to say to you 
that Mr Mogajane will take this topic further when he testifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay thank you. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because he is able to give even more detail than Mr 
Fuzile is able to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to whether Mr Van Rooyen knew his advisors or not? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 89 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair of course he will come and tell you what he 
observed, but at page 48 of the bundle paragraph 10 you will see what Mr Mogajane 
say on his recollection and reference to what took place at that meeting and whilst Mr 
Mokoena is desirous that I should deal with it now I would leave it for Mr Mogajane to 
deal with it when he comes in.  I do not think that it will help you for Mr Fuzile to 
reference other witness' recollection of the issue.  Then you go on and introduce your 
team members and you say that at some point you reflect upon the Gupta leaks insofar 
as they refer to Mr Mabaso and his involvement at the Department of Mineral and 
Resources.  Again that is a mental process that you are engaged with in the light of the 
events that are unfolding at that meeting or shortly thereafter and it is that process of 
10 
trying to connect the dots as you say and I would like you to deal with how you now get 
lifted over mentally to what the Gupta leaks are saying about Mr Mabaso. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  If you do not mind Mr Maleka through you Mr Chairman I think 
paragraph 66 contains something very-very fundamental.  I just want to...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Make the point and then we cruise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Because in the meeting if there was anything profound that 
was said which I took away with a lot of discomfort was the point that Mr Van Rooyen 
made that Mr Van Rooyen made that these are the guys we would be working through.  
20 
In other words staff that goes to him would go through these guys.  Now I had no 
problem with the chief of staff by the way because that is the role that he is a sort of 
connection between the department and the Minister in terms of just even instructions 
and all that kind of stuff as I was saying which is a job that Mr Bhobat seemed to like 
but did not like the title but that was something quite profound to say that we would 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 90 of 141 
 
work through an advisor, Mr Bhobat, because if you think about the sections that Mr 
Maleka was leading us through of the law and the reference to the fact that the job of 
the Director General and that of a special advisor are totally separate. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So he was making an egregious mistake by making that 
reference.  I thought I should just make that point...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  No, no it is important because if I sought to 
suggest that I was skimming over it that is the wrong impression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not imply, did he, that his advisors would also be between you 
and him?  In other words that you two had to reach him through the advisors he was 
10 
talking about other members of staff or you are not sure? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I am very sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  There is no reason why there should be another person 
between the Minister and my report unless the Minister has come to the conclusion that 
I cannot do my job in which case he or she, it was he in this case, would have to find 
another Director General.  What he cannot do is to do something that either borders on 
the illegal or that is decidedly illegal as that section that Mr Maleka had led us through 
says.  So he was essentially saying, let me just put this very clearly Mr Chairman, 
advisors do not have a business whatsoever issuing instructions to officials. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that I understand.  You made it clear. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am more interested in whether he, when he said these are the 
people through which people had to work or we had to work whether what your 
understanding was whether he meant that you too would have to go through advisors to 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 91 of 141 
 
him.  That is what I am trying to understand. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay.  I...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in terms of what was your own understanding of what he was 
saying whether it included that he meant you too would have to go through advisors to 
reach him.  Not that that is the role for special advisors, it is not, but I am wondering 
whether that is what he meant, whether that is what you understood or whether that is 
not what you understood in respect of what he meant. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  What I understood was that he was saying all of us me 
included would work through those people Mr Bhobat and Mr Ian Whitley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this working through them did it mean what I have just indicated 
10 
my understanding is namely whatever work is to be done that requires, that would 
require him people must not just go straight to him they must through the advisors and 
the advisors might say yes, no, yes, no or whatever.  Is that what he meant as far as 
you understood? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  My interpretation was exactly like you put it Mr Chairman.  In 
essence they were going to be the filter through which what we propose, what we 
recommend goes through, which by the way is not even the role of a chief of staff.  The 
role of the chief of staff is more administrative.  Of course you can have a different chief 
of staff who has been around the block who might have the capacity to in a collegial 
polite way say maybe you did not understand what the Minister asked for.  It is not what 
20 
you are giving, but of course in a, a DDG could conceivably say let the Minister tell me 
that not you if you understand what I am saying.  So I understood it in exactly the terms 
you are making which is also that the instructions that come from the Minister would go 
through them and that is not a big problem in relation to the Chief of staff as long as it 
does not create a gulf between the Minister and the officials because as you know if 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 92 of 141 
 
things go through people then before you realise it when what gets to the Minister is not 
what he wanted then the Chief of Staff can say he or she did not understand the 
instruction.  So it is always advisable, it is not written in the rules, but the Minister 
should get to have a working relationship with the officials.  Definitely the DG and the 
DDG's.  It can even go lower than that for that matter as it happens at the Treasury or 
used to happen.  I think it still does and, but what is not right is to plug between the 
administration and the Minister an advisor because as we spoke about it this morning 
the law is very clear on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair it is a pattern that fits in within the theory you 
10 
had of state capture, but where the law is quite clear it requires a relationship of 
cooperation between specified public officials, in this case the DG and his or her 
Minister.  You then get an intercession of a third party to break up that relationship and 
create a new link of reporting and that is what Doctor Kaufmann said to you before. 
 
You were now receiving live evidence to support that theory in the context of 
a model of state capture.  Now unless you have anything further to say about the 
profoundness of paragraph 66 I would quickly want you to deal with paragraph 67. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Thank you very much.  Then...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I just want to make sure that we are – I have a correct 
understanding of your attitude towards this suggestion or instruction or rule that there 
20 
would be advisors who would be the people through which the Minister and everybody 
would work. 
 
Your initial statement to me when I put this to you to suggest that it seems 
really it would be very strange if it included you your reaction seem to suggest to me 
that you really find this very unacceptable because I think you said unless the Minister 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 93 of 141 
 
does not want you – you know you do not expect that.  
 
That was my understanding of what you said but you later on say well maybe 
it might not be a big issue as long as the interposition of those advisors between the 
Minister and the rest of officials does not create I do not know I cannot remember what 
word you used but I think what you meant is it does not create misunderstandings or 
walls that result in misunderstandings. 
 
So the second statement you made this one that it might not be a big 
problem as long as it does not create that suggest to me that it would be – it might not 
be acceptable but it might be tolerable provided it did not create misunderstandings but 
your initial reaction seem to suggest to me that you would have interpreted that kind of 
10 
instruction or rule to say this Minister does not want to work with me as DG. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay, thanks Chair.  Let us come at it this way.  We are talking 
about two roles and maybe let me take one so that I am clear.  Take the role of advisor.  
It is even written in law and there are things that the law prohibits insofar – in fact says 
the advisor must do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must do. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And there are also things that the law says an advisor must do 
and cannot do.  So there are do's and don'ts for the advisor written in law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They cannot do yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And the law very wisely even uses a strong word which is that 
20 
the advisor should refrain...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You read it here? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And it goes on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So the law does not leave a discretion for me to like that.  It 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 94 of 141 
 
just says it is not done and I am not in the habit and the Treasury is not which is 
something I must come to just now because of something that happened on that day as 
well. 
 
I am not in the habit of saying the law says this but let us just have a deal 
that even if that deal is inconsistent with the law.  So insofar as the advisor is 
concerned I am saying I was affronted by the fact that the statement that Mr Van 
Rooyen had made in addition to the actions of the advisor already seemed to be taking 
us on this course where or path where in fact we were edging towards breaking the law. 
 
In fact the law was broken on their side but now here he was saying our 
arrangement here if you use my interpretation which you are articulating yourself Mr 
10 
Chairman he seemed to be saying that we should live outside of the framework of the 
law insofar as the advisor is concerned.  Then come to the Chief of Staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to the Chief of Staff complete your attitude in relation 
to the advisor. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your attitude therefore that insofar as Mr Van Rooyen meant to 
interpose an advisor between himself and the staff including yourself are you saying 
that that was totally unacceptable to you and would not be tolerable or are you saying 
well he would be in breach of the law but maybe I would have a way of – I would leave 
it...[intervenes] 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, no yes let me say I recall saying to him for the second 
time, in fact to them for the second time that it looks like they are going to have to 
familiarise themselves with the law and with the ministerial handbook and I said 
because from Monday I do not know if I said this as it is going to come out now but the 
effect was from Monday onwards we must all know the rules and play by the rules and 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 95 of 141 
 
[indistinct] said something to the effect that you know as the Treasury we pride 
ourselves for doing everything in terms of the law and that is how we would socialise 
and so I said you know we are not going to do anything that is illegal here. 
 
I was not saying it because I was arrogant.  I was just saying to him there is 
the law and it is meant for a purpose.  So let us abide by it and I am clear then there is 
no room for any tolerance for...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  For an advisor to be...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  There is no accommodation for illegality in the way in which we 
would work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It does not matter that Mr Bhobat was behaving in a manner 
that it was clear that he did not deserve to be given a little bit of authority in a place as 
important as the Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the Chief of Staff. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Then the Chief of Staff it is a matter of then interpretation.  The 
Chief of Staff has got a valuable role to play in being the link between the department 
and the Minister but the Chief of Staff cannot be the substitute for a Director General 
and DGDs neither can he be or she be a substitute for the Minister having a direct 
relationship with his DG and [indistinct] and his DDGs. 
 
The Minister must be able to talk to the people and get stuff first-hand.  That 
20 
is where then I was talking about it is not inconceivable that a dynamic Chief of Staff 
can play a role far bigger than the narrow one of I have put the file together, I have 
arranged that the Minister must be there at the time you wish to see him. 
 
He can also make sure that because he would sit in the meetings with the 
Minister he can interpret, he can translate what transpired and be able to marry these 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 96 of 141 
 
things usefully but which is where then I was maybe muddling the thing when I was 
explaining it. 
 
He or she is not the mini Minister because once they do that then they create 
this problem that you break the connection between the Minister and the department 
because it is intermediated through this Chief of Staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So with regard to the Chief of Staff your attitude may have been let 
us see how it works out in terms of whether the Chief of Staff might be the one that you 
said could be quite – could play a bigger role than the smaller role and you would 
handle it as you saw how it was evolving. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is precisely the situation, Mr Chairman and I have got no 
10 
reason in that short – very short period I say to say this which Mr Ian Whitley said or did 
I found offensive and to be outside of as far as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Fuzile even on your charitable 
interpretation of the law the type of distinction you seek to draw between the Chief of 
Staff and an advisor is not tolerable under the law as we read it but it will be debated 
with others when the moment comes for that debate because paragraph seven of the 
special dispensation we have talked about this morning at page 112K does not 
accommodate that type of distinction.  We do not have to go there. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You have expressed your views.  Now we have dealt 
with that question of how the Minister conceived should be the people that you must 
work through and I had invited you to tell us more about Mr Mabaso in relation to the 
Gupta Leaks.  Is there anything that you wish to draw to our attention in that regard? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes for sure, Mr Chairman.  In 67 I make the point that I 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 97 of 141 
 
learned later and I do not know exactly when but soon after I had seen Mr Mabaso.  As 
I said I checked on the internet and any other source I could lay my hands on that in 
fact he had been at the Department of Mineral Resources at that time actually. 
 
What then that suggested to me was that in fact one of the reasons why Mr 
Van Rooyen had emphasised that there was no need to capture his details on Persal 
because Persal is one system for the rest of government so if you type my ID number 
you have got access, rights and stuff like that you would see who I am, where I am and 
what role do I play, am I full time, part time and so on and so forth. 
 
So in a way I can say now – in fact I figured this out then that it was not 
possible that we could as Treasury also appoint him at Treasury when he was also at 
10 
DMR.  That is the first thing.  The second point to make is that in fact it occurred to me 
now when I connect the many things that if you go back to the conversation with Mr 
Godongwana who asked me to talk to Doctor Tsibedi Ramuntsha who was the DG at 
DMR that he was suggesting that maybe –not maybe, what was going to happen at 
Treasury or was starting to happen at Treasury had happened already at DMR. 
 
So Doctor Ramuntsha was probably in Enoch's view going to share with me 
what transpires when a department is being captured.  So I drew the conclusion that in 
fact Mr Mabaso must have been there to handhold these other guys on how this thing is 
done because it had been done at DMR with him as advisor there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You know what I find interesting...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  DMR is of course Department of Mineral Resources? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Department of Mineral Resources.  Pardon me. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why would Mr Mabaso be at National Treasury as far as 
you are concerned on that day when he had no role whatsoever to play in the meet and 
greet session that the Minister identified as the first baseline of his business with the 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 98 of 141 
 
National, with the leadership of National Treasury?  Why would he be there if he has 
got no role to play? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I think that he must have been there to if you will study the 
situation with them, for them and two, to advise them on how it is done but also clearly 
if he is connected to the Guptas and in fact given his connection to the Guptas, let me 
not say if – given his connection to the Guptas and given the logic that Mr Godongwana 
was giving me he was – he had participated in the capturing of a department and 
probably had experience now in how it is done and knew how quickly to do it and you 
can imagine that a person who has been in a department knows how things happen in 
a department as opposed to someone who comes cold from outside. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and in fairness to Mr Mabaso I mean you did not 
have any direct evidence that he was assisting in the capturing of Treasury at that point 
in time.  These are the things that you tried to draw together from your subsequent 
study of his relationship with the Gupta family and also from reading the Gupta Leaks. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But you did not have any direct evidence at that point in 
time? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Not of participating in capture but as I say I used the logic that 
there he was coming from a department that in the logic of what the conversation 
between Mr Godongwana and I had suggested was either capture or in the process of 
20 
being captured itself and there he was with a role that brought by the Minister to play a 
role that the Minister could not just easily to his DG say I have got this guy, he is going 
to do a, b, c. 
 
So clearly his role was not easily explainable even from the Minister which then 
leads me to the conclusion connecting everything that it was in the role that the Minister 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 99 of 141 
 
found it easy to explain.  He never did and of course after the exchange that we had in 
his office he did not bring him to be seen by other officials in the department. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and Mr Fuzile I mean do not misunderstand me as 
expressing a tacit criticism on you when I suggest that you did not have direct 
evidence. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That Mr Mabaso was trying to help capture National 
Treasury. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because it is quite clear that state capturers like 
10 
someone said they are not like drum measurers who announce themselves when they 
arrive.  It is, nothing is written on the forehead.  You have to connect the dots as you 
tried to do.  Can I ask you now to deal with paragraph 69? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Should I proceed? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Right away?  Mr Chairman in paragraph 69 I then deal with 
some details in relation to Mr Bhobat whom I learned later that was connected to either 
Regiment or Trillian or both at different points in time and in fact after he had been in 
the department, he got to the department that Friday.  We were busy working on a 
presentation that we were preparing for a meeting of Cabinet on the state of the 
20 
economy and some of the actions that government was considering in order to spare 
growth and we interacted a lot over the period from the meeting we had with the 
Minister and the advisor and the Chief of Staff and say Sunday sometime and during 
those interactions one of the things we were talking about was this presentation 
because we were trying to help prepare Mr Van Rooyen for the presentation because 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 100 of 141 
 
now he was going to be the Minister presenting the presentation.  Of course I learnt 
that once the presentation was sent to Mr Whitley either by myself or Mr Marlon who 
was the chief of staff of the former Minister then Mr Bhobat immediately forwarded that 
presentation to people connected to the businesses I have just mentioned Mr Eric 
Wood in particular.  His name appeared on the people on the circulation list. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  We will get to how you established that Mr Bhobat 
had shared this information with third parties such as Mr Wood.  First thing first though 
the Chairperson may have gathered anecdotally outside the evidence presented before 
him who Regiment and Trillian would be, but from your side now that you have 
mentioned their names can I ask you to tell us what at that point in time and I am 
10 
talking about December 2015 what did you know about Regiment? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The company's name had been mentioned a few times in 
connection with irregularities that had happened at some of the state owned 
companies. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which are? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I recall Transnet for sure.  I think later on some evidence came 
in relation to Eskom as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And did you have that information in 2015 about 
allegations of irregularities involving Regiment? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I think I knew it in 2015. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What about Trillian?  Trillian? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I mean I know this is not necessarily the correct way to think 
about it.  In law companies are separate and stuff, but Trillian just splintered off 
Regiment so you would notice that the personalities they overlap in certain respects.  In 
other words the directors who ended up at Trillian came out of Regiment.  So some of 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 101 of 141 
 
what Regiment did they were somehow by association close or associated with it and 
therefore Trillian then got formed later on and clearly with one of the key persons in it 
being if I am correct Eric Wood and he received this information as I say which is a 
matter of interest for me from Mr Bhobat. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair that is one of the reasons why we have 
placed before you EXHIBIT R.  You recall it is that statement of the whistleblower 
together with fairly sizeable annexures and you will see that on...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to look for EXHIBIT R.  Is it on this bundle or in a different 
bundle? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In a different bundle Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do I need to have a look at it? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no Chair I just wanted to note that Mr Fuzile 
introduces the two names of Regiment Capital and Trillian whose full names and 
business activities are dealt with fully by the whistleblower in EXHIBIT R from page 2 
onwards and she gives a chapter in this about who these entities are and the role Mr 
Wood played in those entities.  Now that we have identified what allegations were made 
about Trillian and Regiment at that time and now that you have told the Chairperson 
that you had prepared a submission for Minister Van Rooyen Mr Bhobat took it and 
shared it with third parties.  We would get to the submission in due course.  What I wish 
to establish from you now is what was that status of that submission as far as National 
20 
Treasury and the Minister were concerned? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The, like most of what we deal with in the department the 
information contained in that document was about the strategic thinking or at least 
shaping the strategic thinking of Cabinet on how first to understand the sluggishness of 
the South African economy, the causes thereof and also the thinking on what 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 102 of 141 
 
opportunities were there to exploit and how to exploit them to therefore spur growth to 
accelerate the growth of the South African economy and such similar things and the 
presentations attached here, but quite importantly which is what I understand your 
question to be about it was not meant for anyone other than people employed by the 
department who have the right level of clearance and therefore it was never meant to 
be reproduced or sent outside.  I am not sure if I would be helping if I then just make 
reference to for instance the contract that advisors sign. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Which says something about information if you 
think...[intervenes] 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would want to get there...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Later...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Just later on. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But if you feel so compelled and urged to deal with it we 
can go there. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, no, no I will take your guidance. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no it is your evidence and you can present it. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No I will take your guidance. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Maybe we should go to that contract/ 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is EXHIBIT P Chair and it starts on 112A.  It is the very 
bundle that was before you Chair.  It is that one in front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is it? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  112A. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 103 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But I know that Mr Fuzile would like to refer to clause 
15. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Exactly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which is on page 112B. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes.  No, thank you very much for all this wait for me. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you can deal with that clause in your own words 
about...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The nature of confidential information such as the one 
10 
you are dealing with now that is the presentation...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So in a way...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let us take the Chairperson along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it.  You said...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes you said I should proceed...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Clause 15? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes on page 112B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  You said I should proceed.  So if...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you read out that clause first? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Let us just read the clause, yes.  Thank you very much Mr 
Maleka.  The clause reads Mr Chairman; 
"The employer shall have copyright on all documents, 
programs and reports compiled by the advisor and the advisor 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 104 of 141 
 
may not reproduce or distribute them without the consent of the 
employer." 
 
So in a way just to start if you pause and think Mr Chairman about the 
information that the Treasury handles it is information that present opportunities for 
business for people.  If you can have it before everyone else you have – you are in pole 
position to use a phrase that is used in motor car racing.  You have an advantage albeit 
it an unfair one over competition. 
 
Similarly some of that information insofar as it relates to the or has the 
potential to move the market one way or the other in other words calls share prices, the 
currency to move one way or another.  If you get access to the information early you do 
10 
not have to speculate now. 
 
The only thing you do not know is the exact magnitudes of the movements 
but you know which directions things will move using past trends of how things would 
have evolved. 
 
So the point one is making here if a person is in the Treasury and they have 
the proclivity to steal information, to distribute it to people other than the people who 
use it for purposes of giving advice and or doing the work of government then you have 
a serious problem. 
 
You have a serious problem so the so the point one wants to emphasise with 
this is that it was a very egregious problem that Mr Bhobat saw it fit to distribute the 
20 
information and part of the problem whilst people might think that one is just being 
dogmatic by emphasising the need for a contract but where you have a person not 
having a contract which they ought to have read which tells them that these are the do's 
and don'ts you run this kind of a risk as some former colleagues would comment and 
say look this was like turning the Treasury into a spaza shop and I suspect that people 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 105 of 141 
 
who run spaza shops will find this offensive because they do keep records. 
 
So there is a sense in which this was a very, very serious problem.  I am 
sure...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Words might not be communicating this properly but I am sure 
in the company of lawyers you would understand it, Mr Chairman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It comes to mind that even you as the DG or any of your 
subordinates would not be entitled to distribute confidential information of this nature to 
anyone and Chair if I may illustrate the point by asking you to note that in EXHIBIT F1, 
you do not have to go there I will read it out for the record, it is EXHIBIT F1 which is the 
10 
Williams bundle. 
 
There is a set of public service regulations which deals with code of conduct 
which is applicable to employee of the state from page 111 and then the key part of that 
code of conduct from clause 13 provides for ethical conduct that the state officials must 
engage in and at page 113 clause 13G says this: 
"State officials shall not use or disclose any official information 
for personal gain or the gain of others." 
 
So that is the ethical yardstick that is reflected on clause 15 of the contract 
with special advisors also applies to officials of National Treasury.  I draw your attention 
to that part of the code of conduct because the information which we now know was 
20 
given to Mr Bhobat comes from officials of National Treasury and they will have 
disclosed this as confidential information not for gain by any third party. 
 
Now we can go to the information itself and it begins as I have it from page 
78. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you go there Mr Maleka just for the sake of 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 106 of 141 
 
completeness Mr Fuzile, in the case of Mr Bhobat he probably still was not an 
employee of the department at the time that he distributed this information. 
 
He was not yet an employee of the department or had you signed? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No he did not have a contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but if he had already signed it would have been you from him 
whom he would have needed permission such as is contemplated in that clause of the 
contract that you referred us to that says without, I think it says without the permission 
of the employer. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not the permission of the Minister that you would have needed. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is a very interesting question.  I suspect that if he asked for 
the permission of the Minister the Minister would have been entitled to give it to him.  
The same if he asked it from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well except that...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Remember I signed that kind of a contract on behalf of 
government/ on behalf of the Minister to be fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but would it not mean, let us go back – cast your mind back to 
the contract that you referred us to.  The representative of government in terms of that 
contract would have been the Director General, is it not? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The contract says that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the contract says so in terms of the contract if it said he needed 
the permission of the employer and in terms of the contract you are the representative 
of the government you might think differently but it just seems to me that probably he 
would have talked to you although at a practical level everything being equal in a 
normal environment the Minister would have known what he could say yes to and what 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 107 of 141 
 
maybe he might say just talk to the DG about that or something. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am just thinking that in terms of the contract I would have 
expected that technically you would be the person whom he would have needed to get 
permission from.  You are not able to say whether that is your understanding or not? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I would say Mr Chairman in the absence of my legal 
advisors...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That would have been my interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Because I have got documents...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That say that I represent government.  Of course if I had then 
time I would have had access to the legal advisors...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And say is my interpretation correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That although I am the signatory to the contract I do so on 
behalf of government and in this case the representative of government in this 
institution is actually the Minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So if he asks...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And I think that it is within the law...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 108 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Then I would do it except that in this case the point is I do not 
know if it is in law or whether you say it is moot because I would not have agreed so it 
is academic whether I was asked or not because I would not have agreed to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I am just wondering whether the Minister knew about that 
activity on the part of Mr Bhobat and whether Mr Bhobat might say no I discussed with 
the Minister so I do not think I did anything unlawful. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  They would have accepted that this one I do not need a lawyer.  
I can tell you that there is no reason why even a Minister, not even the President I can 
10 
say this can take information let us say for instance or classify information and give it to 
people who do not have the proper clearance.  It is as simple as that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now we know that the President cannot do 
so...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because section 96...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of the Constitution prohibits him or her from doing so. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And so is the case with the Executive Ethics Act, Chair 
20 
which makes it quite clear without doubt that no member of the National Executive 
would be entitled to share confidential information with others for their gain or the gain 
of others but here you are, Chair.  You make the point which is quite important because 
it reflects a possible tension and I am suggesting a possible tension by looking at what 
page 112A indicates. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 109 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The preamble of it makes it quite clear that the employer 
in this case is National Treasury representing government and yet the signatory and the 
representative of National Treasury who signs the contract is the DG without any 
express reference to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So the key question you raised is that there is some 
level of tension.  That it will be under this contract Mr Fuzile who has to give permission 
for sharing of confidential information. 
 
Whilst he makes it quite clear to you that he himself was quite clear as the 
10 
DG at the time there is a systemic issue which we think ought to be explored and if 
necessary you should deal with the removal of that tension by way of recommendations 
on how contracts such as these should be formulated and reflected to remove some 
unavoidable consequence because you might have a Minister who gives permission 
and yet the DG who is supposed to sign says no he is not giving permission and a 
tension arises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I had invited you to look at the information which you say 
Mr Bhobat unlawfully shared with others including Mr Wood and I had indicated to you 
that that information begin with an email from page 78. 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I am there, Mr Chairman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair people who know how emails work tell me 
that you have to read them from the bottom working yourself upward because you will 
see in the middle it says begin forwarding the message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I thought you were going back to the statement.  Where 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 110 of 141 
 
are you? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  On [indistinct]? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes at the moment I am at page 78, Chair.  Page 78. 
CHAIRPERSON:  78? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes I am there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that that is Annexure LF2 to Mr Fuzile's 
statement and what has drawn me to page 78 is what he had already said to you on 
paragraph 69 of his statement.  So in paragraph 69 he introduces this annexure. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And you will recall Chair that in paragraph 69 he said the 
following and I quote in the interest of time; 
"I, Mr Fuzile, also subsequently learned from former colleagues 
and media reports that Mr Bhobat had, was connected to 
Regiment Capital and Trillian and that in the short period that 
Mr Bhobat was in the department he shared some classified 
information, a presentation intended for Cabinet with people 
outside government like Mr Eric Wood.  I can only infer that 
these are people who sought to profit personally from such 
20 
information." 
 
A copy of the email attached SLF2, of course we do not know who else got 
the information once it had landed in Mr Whitley and Mr Bhobat's hands.  So that is how 
I get to page 78 and Chair you will see on page 78 that right from top...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are getting to page 78 confuses me because the annexure 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 111 of 141 
 
a copy of which is referred to in paragraph 69 is said to be marked LF2. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are referring me to an annexure that is at page 78 on the 
page and it is marked AA107 and not LF2. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, Chair, again there is another confusion, because that 
AA107 on my document is also marked LF2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you want to see for yourself mine is not marked LF2. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the problem with that is that later on when somebody reads the 
transcript and wants to go and see the annexure they get confused.  The annexures 
10 
that we all have should be marked exactly the same. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair can I hand up a marker to your Registrar and ask 
her to mark it LF2 so that...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And make sure that the most important person for the 
purposes of this conversation has the same document.  It is page 78 annexure LF2. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I am on that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how is your one marked LF2 or AA107? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is AA107.  I have an advantage over you Chair because 
either way these are my documents so I can swim backwards. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see if both of us have got AA107 it looks like it is Mr Maleka 
who has LF2.  Okay, all right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let me just dextrously hand two markers to you and 
mark LF2 using the black pen on the Chairperson and LF2 using the blue pen on Mr 
Fuzile's document.  Please. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 112 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Registrar Mr Fuzile is no longer DG of Treasury.  So you are not 
going to get a job at Treasury.  You see I see he starts with you. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  At least you should take some consolation Mr Chair that the 
fact that she got told as to where to start, but logically I think she figured out that it is 
closer to me and that it is better to start this way in her defence. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Registrar.  I think we are now on the same 
page Mr Fuzile. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes sir Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Look just take us through the e-mail.  As I indicated to 
you that someone told me that it is meaningful to read the e-mails by beginning from 
10 
the messages, the addresses and the timelines from the bottom working yourself 
upwards, but you read it for us, you interpret it for us the way it is convenient to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess that whatever happens to the extent that one page 
might have two, maybe two or more e-mails preferably the one that came first should 
be read first and then the sequence then makes sense to the extent that that might be 
the case. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In case what is replied, is a response to another. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you will see to make the Chairperson's point that 
the timelines are identified on each of the sections of the e-mail.  The bottom one is the 
20 
earlier of the top one purely out of time sequencing only. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I would perhaps leave the report on which is between Yolanda 
and I because there is no contention there.  The one, the bottom of page 78 of EXHIBIT 
LF2 it is an e-mail that I sent to Ian Whitley on the new e-mail address that he had been 
assigned on Friday and I am copying on it Mr Marlon Geswint who was the Chief of 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 113 of 141 
 
Staff of Mr Nene and that here really is that he would have known if Minister Van 
Rooyen at some point said he is okay with the presentation Marlon would have known 
what to do with it, how to reproduce it and to take care of all manner of things 
logistically to make sure that that presentation is available.  The e-mail the essence of it 
just says "look, it is still early days, look at it, let the Minister look at it, we can shape it 
as the Minister wishes, but you know it is time for him to help himself, familiarise 
himself with it."  So Marlon Geswint sends it to him.  I suspect that what might have 
happened here is that the address because it was new, I suspect this I do not know for 
sure, maybe it had not gone because Marlon would have seen that Ian was copied but 
Ian must have phoned Marlon to ask for it, but he then sends it to him and of course if 
10 
you look above that Ian sends it and he says "gents finally" and you can see although 
the perforation has taken his name out, but the surname is there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Then the person who...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that finally, dot-dot-dot? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes "gents finally", yes, dot-dot-dot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, well you might not attach, you might not attach any meaning to 
20 
the dot-dot-dot but I tend to think that it has got a meaning. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No clearly it has got meaning.  For me it suggest that there had 
been communication which says something is coming, you know, I am going to get it or 
other saying get it because you cannot say finally.  If I send you something first time I 
cannot say finally there must have been iterations or some interaction prior to that. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 114 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like at long last. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Exactly Mr Chairman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But just in terms of the timeframe before you 
proceed...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that it comes from Mr Marlon Geswint. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes we understood, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On 12 December 2015 at about 16:38...[intervenes] 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  PM. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right, and we know that the 12th of December was a 
Saturday, right? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he sends it to Mr Whitley on that Gmail 
account. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he identifies the subject which is the feedback from 
20 
Minister Nkwinti meeting. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he seem to have sent it to Mr Whitley at that 
time 16:38. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 115 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then the next recipient of that e-mail is 
Mr Ian Whitley at the Gmail account on the same date . 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he forwards it to a number of people at 17:36. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you see that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So more or less a period of an hour...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Elapses between the receipt by Mr Malcolm and the 
10 
sending to him that is 17:36. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he sends it under the same subject matter the 
feedback from the meeting with Minister Nkwinti and a number of people that he sends 
to include Mr Mohamed Bhobat at the Gmail account, do you see that? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It also includes Mr Malcolm Mabaso. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At some account I cannot identify.  Are you able to 
identify that account? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I see it is malcolm@open something-something. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Opensbs. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes it look like 8 some of them, but...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is afternoon. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 116 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Mr Bhobat if the e-mail trail has anything to do with 
this he would have received this forwarded presentation at 17:35, 17:36. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV 
VINCENT 
MALEKA 
SC: 
 
From 
Mr 
Whitley. 
 
Is 
that 
correct? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That is spot on Mr Maleka and Mr Chairman. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then once he receives it on the same date almost 
three minutes later he forwards it to a number of people and you can tell us who those 
individuals are. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes the most obvious one to me is Mr Eric Wood and then 
there is another e-mail that seems to be kind of fake-ish because it is 
10 
infoportal@soho.com.  I do not know if you will see the same thing, but you are correct 
it is astounding that within those three minutes it had gone to those people. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and that would explain the Chairperson's interest in 
the intro line in Mr Whitley's e-mail that "gents, whether it might be finally dot-dot-dot." 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In other words what they have been waiting for 
is...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The waiting is over. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I ask you to identify for us the key features of 
that presentation, which leads you to the conclusion that once you have it when it was 
20 
not designed or intended for your eyes and ears you will gain an unfair advantage 
ahead of many. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Much later on what you would see if you just take a page like 
page 95 it talks about initiatives to promote trade and growth.  Immediately you see that 
you would see that there is a bullet that talks to state owned enterprises at Champion 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 117 of 141 
 
and Development and so on and you just have to think about the connection with state 
capture and so on, but bearing in mind that this is not a kind of a budget thing, but as I 
was saying it is a document that points in the direction of where government is going 
over the next while.  You can continue then later on...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you to just on that page 95 deal with two 
because one of them has become a subject matter of investigation by our investigators 
Chairperson and that is the third bullet point. If you could look at it and tell us what does 
it deal with? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry where are you?  You have moved away from the 
presentation? 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No I am at the presentation it is on page 95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  You found it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  I found it. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So if you look at page 95, Mr Chairman as Mr Maleka is sort of 
leading us there you would see that the third bullet there signals the key role that a 
state owned entity for an example like Transnet will or is playing in the Maputo corridor 
and you can see – well in a way towards the end there is also reference to other 
initiatives that the state owned enterprises were either involved in or likely to be 
involved in, in the period I had. 
20 
 
Now when you know this kind of information later on when it becomes 
projects and of course a mixture here of projects and just sort of directionally this is 
where the focus should be you can quite quickly if you are an astute business person 
position yourself, start an engagement with Transnet or any other entity that you think 
would have a role to play to shape things as projects or as they become projects be 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 118 of 141 
 
involved in executing them. 
 
You would have what we call in economics a first mover advantage so to 
speak. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All right.  I had invited you to just read for us the third 
bullet point on page 95 the second last bullet point. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The one that is state owned enterprise championing African 
infrastructure development such as Transnet Maputo corridor JOC launched in 
September 2014 to streamline cargo logistics between South Africa, Swaziland and 
Maputo as well as the on-going development of prototype Trans African locomotive 
suited for the conditions of Africa's railways. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and Chair you will hear something in due course 
about the connection of the rail line between Swaziland, well between South Africa, 
Swaziland and Maputo in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well while you are looking at your next issue, excuse me I would 
very much like us to finish with Mr Fuzile's evidence today. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope that Mr Fuzile's position about moving, working beyond 16:00 
is the same as yesterday's position.  Mr Fuzile if we have to go beyond 16:00 just to 
finish your evidence I am hoping we would finish within 30 minutes after 16:00.  If we 
were to do that would that be convenient to you? 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I would certainly be willing to assist the Commission in that 
regard. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I am almost at the end. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 119 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  All right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I will just...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must – I must say that your estimation yesterday was horrible. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you would finish easily within the time available. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And even when I thought of starting early this morning you said no, 
no, no we will be fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Maleka we all sometimes underestimate. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What needs to be done in the time.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you.  The importance of the issues Chair made 
me to pace myself like a tortoise and I really apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But what I wanted to do Mr Fuzile I mean to illustrate the 
point that remained is to go to the whistleblower's bundle which is EXHIBIT R before 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay which bundle are we going into now? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  R, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  R? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  R yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what page? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  237. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Did you say 2037? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 120 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  237. 
CHAIRPERSON:  237 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you there, Mr Fuzile? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes.  Yes I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And this is a document introduced by the whistleblower 
in her statement.  You do not have to go there, Chair, where she introduces it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  She introduces it from page 14 and page 15 of her 
10 
statement but what the document reflects are several major government economic 
transactions.  For instance if you look at the first one, Mr Fuzile on page 237 it deals 
with the collateralisation of municipal debt and you will see there it says if you 
assessed, Chair, two municipal entities to efficiently tap debt capital markets through 
facilitating collateralization of a debt with the financial assistance of DBSA and PSA 
through the support of the mezzanine portion of this collateralized debt this will assist in 
the infrastructure rollout required of a country and with National Treasury oversight and 
assistance begin to instil financial discipline currently lacking in the two municipalities 
approximately 20 billion per month, per annum sorry at 30 basis point. 
 
You see anyone who has confidential information knowing how you are going 
20 
to create financial instruments around a debt of municipality will have knowledge of how 
much you could achieve in terms of savings and if you are a service provider to do that 
you will certainly earn some income by way of fees and that is what this document tells 
us because if you go to number five you will see that again it is a collateralization of 
property owned by various state entities and there whoever does that job will earn a fee 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 121 of 141 
 
based on 25 percent development of the upside and that is a huge amount. 
 
So what this document say and hopefully the whistleblower will come to tell 
us more about it is that if you have this type of confidential information which you talk 
about you are able to enter as a service provider into government transaction space 
and begin to provide services for which you earn handsome fees and that after all is 
what Trillian has been doing. 
 
That after all it is what Regiment Capital has been doing and we know that 
that after all is what McKinsey has been doing.   
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I can confirm, Mr Chairman that the logic of what Mr Maleka is 
making makes perfect sense.  As to the specific entities of course they do feature here 
10 
and the extent I have not investigated and studied but as I say myself the people who 
are connected to them there is no reason why anyone would want this kind of 
information that was shared here for fun. 
 
It is about placing you or an individual or his or her business in a position of 
advantage vis a vis competition insofar as the opportunities to compete for business 
are concerned assuming there will be competition but it may even be about 
circumventing that competition. 
 
Needless to say I may repeat the point that the sharing of the information 
itself even before you talk about the reasons for sharing it and the consequences of 
sharing it was illegal. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Fuzile we are now going to round up and 
conclude.  I am now at page 72 and you have talked about that chapter of your 
statement when you canvassed the conversation you had with...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Maleka, we are going back to the bundle that has his 
statement now? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 122 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes that is EXHIBIT P, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You have talked about the conversation you had with 
Deputy Minister Jonas yesterday.  I wonder whether you have more to say or what you 
said yesterday was enough for the purposes of your evidence. 
 
You can go through it quietly.  It begins at paragraph 71. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes.  No unless the Chairman and you, Mr Maleka feel that 
there is something to amplify.  We have covered it quite extensively.  Perhaps the point 
that it just cements...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you could just repeat the main features of that conversation. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Okay.  No, thank you very much, Mr Chairman.  In a way what 
the conversation with Mr Jonas did for me really is what I capture in these bullets was 
to just now complete the picture insofar as one, the role that perhaps I should use the 
singular here, a particular Gupta person played where in the meeting with Mr Jonas he 
in addition to offering him money...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry I am going to just...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  How the – so it was not a meeting it was a telephone conversation or 
it was not? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It was a meeting, Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  On 71. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Paragraph 71 of page 72. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 123 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I start with this...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just say how the meeting came about. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes.  Yes.  No, essentially I had – one of us called and I cannot 
remember which one but the essence of it was you know it is what a day and then the 
Deputy Minister said I think that we should talk and in fact...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now on 11 December? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  This is on the 11th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  In the afternoon like 16:00 or 17:00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So and I went.  I drove to where he was or he may have been 
heading to himself but I found him there and then he told me that around October and 
this for me was the first time he had told me this or I even heard about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you say you had? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  In October...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  For me on that day it was the first time in 
December...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were hearing about...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  That I was hearing about the approach that was made by a 
20 
Gupta person to Mr Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Yes? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair just to interrupt you will see that there is a gap 
of a full two months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 124 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Between what the experience of Mr Jonas has been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And how he now begins to feel comfortable to disclose it 
to Mr Fuzile.  We know that he told you about who else he disclosed that experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But for now we deal...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  He disclosed to somebody else. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So thank you very much, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  For the stuff on paragraph 72 is what is known I mean how he 
ended up there and of course he said that he found this conversation quite disturbing 
that he had with the Gupta person because you know he was insinuating that he had 
control over many things or everything that happened in government almost suggesting 
that if he wants something and it requires the authority of the President he can get it to 
happen.  Signal to Mr Jonas that he would like, in fact Mr Jonas did tell me that they 
claimed two other things that they had information on him in a way trying to blackmail 
him, but they did not say what information.  They knew who his friends were.  All the 
stuff that has now been alluded he told me on that day.  He said they wanted, they 
claimed that many people worked for them, many people who are in government.  Let 
20 
me not use they, he.  The Gupta person claimed that there were many people, 
important people in government and key positions and in SOCs for that matter who 
were working for their interest and they wanted him to take the job and the President 
was happy, would be happy if he took the job and then in his case he wanted 
that...[intervenes] 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 125 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is of course the job of Minister of Finance? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The job of Minister of Finance, thank you, to be precise and 
said "look, if you were to take the job it would be good to help them to expand their 
business interests with government."  There were numbers mentioned I think he said at 
the time it was three or four billion, they wanted to take it to six or eight, some number, 
big number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually I was going to ask you the question whether as far as you 
know at Treasury it might have been possible or it would be possible to establish 
whether there was any connection between those figures that according to Mr Jonas he 
was told about in terms of what they were making from government.  I think he said 
10 
they said six billion and they wanted to increase it to eight billion. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Something, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be easy to, for Treasury to check if anybody, how much any 
particular company may be making from all government departments and parastatals 
maybe or not really? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I think I would take out easily, but it can be done Mr Chairman 
and I am saying I taking easily out of it because let me just say it can be done, but it is 
an exercise that would entail that the Treasury would have to ask for the information.  
You cannot just do it...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes...[intervenes] 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  From a systems point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Treasury can go quite far to get that information from national 
government departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 126 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  But the entities because those departments are on the same 
system, IT system so to speak that is why it is possible to pull reports and collate them 
relatively easily, but the entities are kind of independent states of sorts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  But the Treasury has got the authority in law which I think can 
be stretched to allow it to ask for that information, but I mean my successor would be in 
a position to answer that question better than me.  I do not want to set him up 
for...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no but what you have said is helpful. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and Chair I mean we asked the investigators to get 
that sort of information from the auditors of Oakbay and associated companies which is 
the almost full picture of the Gupta empire. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we know that the auditors have been begun to 
disclose the financial information under a subpoena of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But if we could get information from Treasury along 
those lines it will provide...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Important corroborative evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 127 of 141 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So we will take that issue with Mr Mogajane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact that will be installment number one before he 
testifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So should I continue? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  So quite critically and this is I think why Mr Maleka is also 
suggesting correctly that we could go through this fast.  If you look at 75 then Mr 
Godongwana, sorry...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Jonas. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Mr Jonas, thank you, dropped this bombshell.  This is now the 
afternoon.  I call it a bombshell where he said they said one of the tasks he would have 
to perform when he first gets there would be to dismiss the four of us that I list there 
and we ventilated the issue Mr Chairman yesterday as to what...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you mentioned them yesterday but we just...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  It is Mr Ismael Mononiat, it is Mr Kenneth Brown, it is Mr 
Andrew Donaldson and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I suspect that our experience just at the Treasury the four of us 
20 
would add up to a number upwards of eight years.  Of course they overlap those years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr Kenneth Brown was Chief Procurement Officer. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  He was Chief Procurement Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was one of those that they did not want? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  The role...[intervenes] 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 128 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  According to Mr Jonas...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Was dropping him sadly in the line of fire because he was 
writing rules for procurement, sort of amending them for us, for government so to speak 
with the view to making the process more transparent so that it would be less easy to 
manipulate procurement processes or it would be easier to get caught when you have 
actually done so for instance the publications of who has one which tender and who are 
the directors and-and-and, but at the same time there was a stepping up of 
enforcement for instance we initiated a process to review contracts beyond a certain 
threshold just to see if there was malfeasance in those and of course there was 
suspicion of a strong and then the reports on those some of them ...[indistinct] Treasury 
10 
and I would presume that some of them are still work underway, but just that kind of 
work had meant that he had become a problem by wanting to insist that there should 
not be stealing, there should not be manipulation of tender processes and stuff like that.  
I cannot imagine any other reason why because his role of that position was not 
brought and I said Mr Mononiat was, he is, you know he does tax stuff.  Sometimes 
people think that what SARS does administratively and in terms of enforcement is he 
has asked them to do, but he does not, but not in the sense of directing them 
necessarily he is instrumental in terms of shaping tax legislation including the 
administration of tax for that matter, but one of the important roles that he plays and I 
said this yesterday is advising the Minister and the DG of financial regulation including 
20 
tightening the laws on anti-money laundering, the issues of reporting on suspicious 
transactions.  I mention this because there is enough evidence in the public domain 
that these kinds of legislation were resented.  People did not resent them simply 
because they were there because they knew that they would make it harder to engage 
in those kinds of activities which entail the ability to move and to enjoy proceeds of 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 129 of 141 
 
crime.  So this kind of shocked me, but I quickly connected it to the fact that, and the 
fact that he was going to be given replacements for us including advisors.  So if you go 
back to the story of Wednesday night with Mr Gordhan who said you will get a Gupta 
Minister, he will be given advisors, he might not even know them very well, they would 
be of Indian descent.  So I said okay, so this stuff was planned as far back as October.  
I had no reason whatsoever to doubt Mr Jonas' version of these events.  So I then 
came to the conclusion quite firmly that the gentleman that Mr Van Rooyen showed up 
with whom he did not seem to know well must in fact have been given to him by the 
Gupta person that or the Mr Gupta that Mr Jonas spoke to hence he did not know them 
all too well including the roles that he was going to assign them and indeed if you just 
10 
look, perhaps jumping now, I hope I do not muddy the water, it is clear that Mr Bhobat 
was, the way he was just approaching me, the way he was abrasive, impolite, throwing 
his weight around had the hallmarks of making sure that right from the word go it was 
untenable for me to or unbearable for me to stay in the department and hopefully leave.  
I mean I can say today it is known factually that he was wrong I was not going to go 
anywhere.  Certainly not pushed away by him.  Of course I am saying that it was then 
clear to me because the Gupta persons said it to Mr Jonas and Mr Jonas said the 
President's son was there.  That in fact there was a connection of most of what we were 
going through as an institution and as individuals to the person of the President just 
given how this was unfolding.  So I think that is, that is enough to say.  In fact I just 
20 
make this last line where I, which is partly the reason I at some point just felt I should 
actually leave the Treasury without saying much and it became obvious that there 
where we were we had heard Minister Manuel, you could say he had been tired of the 
job.  He had been there for too long but he was replaced by a competent person Mr 
Pravin Gordhan who after just one term was replaced by yet another competent person.  
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 130 of 141 
 
You could say he was a committee member for years, Deputy Minister for many years, 
easy chemistry, he knew the job in Mr Nene.  Now you come from having a Minister for 
13 years without a change in the department and all the benefits that went with that.  
You have a Minister for just one term and then next time just 18 months.  I actually just 
thought, look, it is obvious to me and this I can say at least in my mind without fear of 
contradiction it can be denied by others it was obvious to me that there was a mission 
to make sure that we end up ultimately with a Minister who would be pliable, a Minister 
who would be weak and therefore weaken the Treasury and after having been in the 
department for the length of time that I was there for I was not going to be there and be 
party to decimating an institution that I inherited being very strong, being recognised 
10 
worldwide for its strength.  I used to even sometimes say it jokingly Mr Chairman to 
people and say let us say that people who talk this ill about Treasury sometimes even 
in my presence I would say you know let us say you think that people the world over 
are wrong in thinking that the Treasury does its job well, but it benefits South Africa and 
South Africans because then it gets people to invest in government bonds and therefore 
enables government to finance its programs and whatever it does.  So would it annoy 
you so much as a South African that you would want to tell the world that you are wrong 
in thinking that this Treasury of ours it is good.  It is actually bad.  It is weak.  Of what 
good would it be?  So anyway I am saying that it became clear from that conversation 
that I had with Mr Jonas that what we were going through was actually very bad.  Was 
20 
terrible. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  And it was orchestrated with the President certainly at the 
centre of it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you conclude that after that conversation with 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 131 of 141 
 
Deputy Minister Jonas you were deeply disappointed and demoralised and I can 
understand that you had taken so much in that two days and you were thinking about 
your future, but as we have it fate intervened and you outlasted those who thought they 
would replace you.  Can I ask you now to just by way of concluding remarks share with 
us the lessons that we can learn and around which we can make recommendations to 
the Chairperson about how to even strengthen further National Treasury if it is not 
strong or stronger or ready. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  I would say Mr Chairman what we went through around that 
time taught me several things.  The one, one of the things that placed us in good stead 
that ensured that we were able to weather the storm, to withstand a lot of the, the 
10 
negative stuff that was buffeting us from all sorts of angles including from the highest 
office was the fact that we were led and when I say we were led I would just first take 
the politicians or the political office bearers we had in Mr Gordhan and Mr Jonas by 
people who, who hold our constitution very dear and all the laws of the country.  I said 
this several times in the department on the occasion that we would celebrate one or 
some other event and have the Minister and the Deputy Minister around, that I was very 
proud to work with two people with Mr Gordhan and Mr Jonas and of course you can 
add Mr Nene to that list.  You can even add Mr Manuel to that list and Mr Moleketi 
Jabu.  We were led over this period of time by people who never sought to do anything 
themselves or ask us to do things that were aimed at helping them or people connected 
20 
to them to gain, you know, personally or for themselves.  I used to say that not once if I 
had to face a dilemma where I am faced with a Minister or a Deputy Minister who is 
trying to do something that I feel uncomfortable with because it is incongruent or in 
contravention of the law.  That was very powerful and the lesson from that if I were to 
be direct with what Mr Maleka has asked me is that anyone who happens to find 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 132 of 141 
 
themselves in a position let us say of a Director General for that matter of a DDG in a 
department or in a department the managerial position.  If you know the rules you know 
the law.  It helps to make sure that first time when a person tries to ask you to do 
something that is illegal to let them know and let them know in no uncertain terms that 
you are not going to be party to doing a crime.  There are many people some of them 
now tell untruths they say they liked me when I was in government, because they say, 
you know, we always knew where we stood with you.  I do not like talking about myself 
in those terms, but in my case it is either something is legal, it is worth considering, it is 
either something is in the national interest and therefore we can debate it.  Once it is 
illegal or it is not in the national interest then it is off the table and you would not leave it 
10 
any doubt.  So it is important to be law abiding and the issue of playing by the rules is 
important because at every point if you look at my interactions with Mr Van Rooyen, Mr 
Bhobat over that short period I kept making reference to the rules.  I was not making 
the rules for them.  The rules had been made for all of us.  All I was doing was to draw 
their attention to the rules, but I would say the bigger issue for me which one has got to 
say carefully just having heard the question that the Chairman was putting to 
Mr Gordhan yesterday is it just seems to me that even at points when there were signs 
that state capture was happening, corruption happening or whatever you choose to call 
it there are many people who opted I think chose not to seek it.  I do not think that with 
all that we were watching playing itself in front of us, many of us as South Africans 
20 
especially those who happen to be close to things like ourselves can say that we were 
shocked by the very last events that came, let us say, for instance on the Gupta leaks 
or whatever other event people remember as the big event that makes it very hard for 
them to deny that they see that state capture is happening or corruption is happening.  
What do I say by this?  You asked me for lessons  When you see something when it 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 133 of 141 
 
smells fishy then it is fishy.  You have got no excuse to say I thought it was smelling 
good and I like the quote that Mr Maleka started with which was the one that Mr 
Gordhan concluded with.  The reason these terrible things happened is because many 
good people kept quiet.  I do not buy the excuse that is convenient that people make 
that they did not notice.  Of course you may not notice from the first event but the thing 
is that too many events were happening here. 
 
Too many events were happening here and what is said about it is that you 
will need people.  We may still like it when people commend us and say we did well by 
stopping this or stopping that or you know but I take no comfort from that because it 
was not easy. 
10 
 
I say this because there were moments when some of my direct reports 
would walk into my office, some of the verge of breaking down and they would say to 
me listen this department is actually under attack and I would sometimes myself played 
to the gallery if I may call it that. 
 
I said look I do not think we are under attack but there are just too many 
things happening A, B, C.  Things are going to get better but the reality is that bad stuff 
was happening.  Bad stuff was happening and I am sure the picture, I hope the picture 
of – the picture I have painted here with this very short submission that has taken a 
little long to go through does help to fit a few pieces of this jigsaw puzzle such that 
South Africans can form a picture of their own. 
20 
 
I say to people as I end my reason for coming to help the Commission now 
and in future if I do come is less and I say it is not...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You thought it was when not with? 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  When yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought it was when. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 134 of 141 
 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Sorry, sorry.  I am saying my reason for coming 
here...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say and in the future if you come...[intervenes] 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Based on the fact that you clearly said there is a lot that you 
would like to share with the Commission. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Yes, yes.  Let me say when I come back the reason for doing 
what we do and taking whatever risk it would entail is less about being heroes certainly 
not for me and I suspect for all of us who came here. 
 
It is also less certainly for me about being vindicated or being vindictive 
10 
insofar as those people who did things that are bad.  When I say for instance if I use 
the example of my own submission Mr Bhobat broke the law it is not because I just 
heard the guy and I wished he would be jailed tomorrow and that will be fine too 
because if he pays for his own sins who else should pay for them? 
 
But the most important thing about it is the lesson for every South African.  It 
is the lesson for every South African that it carries that this is a country governed by a 
constitution and law.  Your first point of reference ought to be that if you are coming into 
the civil service, in fact every sphere of life. 
 
So one would hope that as we come here present evidence it helps South 
Africans for a picture of what happened but not only that it also then helps the South 
20 
Africans learn so that in future if something similar starts to happen it can be stopped 
much earlier than what this one has done. 
 
You only need to look at what for instance some of the state owned 
companies the state in which they are in to see the egregiousness of what we went 
through.  Thank you very much. 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 135 of 141 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you done...[intervenes] 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair, just for me to thank Mr Fuzile and through him to 
appeal to many others to heed the very important call of Professor Niemöller that we 
are here and we are at this stage of our [indistinct] democracy affected by these acts of 
state capture simply because good men and women chose to keep quiet when there 
was a time, a moment for them to speak and through you we would definitely keep on 
asking those questions why they remained quiet at that moment when they were 
supposed to speak? 
 
I mean a certain part of the conversation you have heard from Mr Fuzile's 
evidence is that there was a moment of quiet attitude for two months in relation to 
10 
crucial, crucial information which affected him in such a way that he was not only 
demoralised but thought of leaving Treasury and so as much as we may be thought to 
be nonsensically critical of the silence we would appeal in advance and ask for your 
forbearance to keep on asking these questions from every other person who would 
come to appear before you and testify why was that moment of silence and we will put 
those questions to anyone who would come to testify before you. 
 
Other than that let me apologise for you for taking so long and making 
mistake in estimations of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, Mr Maleka.  Well Mr Fuzile thank you very much for 
coming to give evidence and my understanding is that like Minister Gordhan and 
20 
Minister Nene and former Deputy Minister Jonas you came voluntarily because you 
appreciated the need for you to come and assist the Commission. 
 
I have before specifically appealed to current Directors General of 
departments and former Directors General quite apart from Cabinet Ministers past and 
present to come forward and give the Commission information and evidence about 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 136 of 141 
 
what they knew and I have said that when I make these appeals it is not because we 
depend completely on people coming forward on their own to give us evidence. 
 
We have an investigation team.  They are investigating.  Some of the things 
we will find ourselves but it would be very good if people who know information that is 
relevant came forward because to the extent that at the end of this process I may find 
that there was state capture the question will arise as to who had the duty to do what 
when they realised and I have said that question will arise in regard to the governing 
party to say as the governing party that was given power over these years by the 
electorate when did they realise that there was state capture and what did they do 
about it. 
10 
 
The same will arise with regard to the executive.  When did members, 
different members of the executive realise what was happening and what did they do 
about it and to the extent that whether it is the governing party or it is members of the 
executive to the extent that they may not have done what they ought to have done.  Is it 
because there was an environment or a framework that made it difficult for people to do 
what they were supposed to do and if so what is that environment? 
 
We must identify it so that the Commission can then address, deal with that 
environment in recommendations to say we should not have this kind of framework or 
this environment going forward because this kind of environment if it is, if it continues to 
exist will facilitate another state capture in the future. 
20 
 
We need to look at this but we need people in the governing party, in the 
executive and government everywhere and outside of that of people who can observe 
or observed things, who participated in things and activities to say this environment 
provided fertile ground for state capture.   
 
It needs to be changed if we are serious about wanting to make sure that 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 137 of 141 
 
state capture does not happen again but to be able to do that effectively and to get to 
the truth and the real depth and extent of these things we need people to be able to 
come forward and speak without fear of any physical harm to them, fear of being 
prejudiced in any other way or being marginalised. 
 
People must be allowed to say I want to make a contribution in the rebuilding 
that needs to take place to the extent that there may have been state capture and the 
state capture may have involved a certain amount of destruction of our country. 
 
So people who take the trouble to come to the Commission and say I want to 
make my own contribution.  I want to say what I knew, what I saw and help the 
Commission, to help the country they must be able to come forward and say so without 
10 
fearing that they may be marginalised by whoever. 
 
So I hope that your coming here like that of Mr Themba Maseko right at the 
beginning of our proceedings will encourage both current Directors General and former 
Directors General who knew things, who knew what happened to come forward and say 
I will not stand on the side.  I will join those who are trying to rebuild, who are trying to 
help the Commission to make sure that the future of the country will be better than the 
times when there was state capture if indeed in the end I find that there was state 
capture. 
 
But once again thank you very much for coming forward and I have no doubt 
that you will return.  Thank you very much.  You are excused. 
20 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE:  Thank you very much, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR LUNGISA FUZILE EXCUSED 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I see you standing up.  Is that for the condonation 
application? 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 138 of 141 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, it is simply to request you to direct whether you 
wish to hear it now or would prefer to hear it tomorrow.  It will not take long but perhaps 
you could give that some thought.  Also to state that as a result of the length of time 
that Mr Fuzile has taken there has to be some amendment to the program. 
 
It was planned that and I might say that counsel's prediction of time is a 
feature comment to all counsel.  It is not unique to Mr Maleka.  The plan was that 
tomorrow Mr Manyi would return to the witness box but as you stated in chambers it is 
preferable that the trio of Treasury witnesses complete their evidence on term of 
reference 1.8 before Mr Manyi comes. 
 
Arrangements have been initiated through the Commission attorney to delay 
10 
Mr Manyi's arrival until Monday if that is appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I think that Mr Manyi was going to give evidence after certain 
witnesses had given evidence before him.  Those witnesses have not or some have but 
there are still others that we are supposed, that were ahead of him in terms of the 
arrangements. 
 
I think we should hear those first more so because what they will be 
testifying about is linked to the evidence of Mr Fuzile and Mr Gordhan.  So what I do 
not know as I understand it is two witnesses, is that right? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I do not know is whether we would finish them within the two 
20 
hours that we will have tomorrow afternoon but if we do not finish we should finish them 
first even if on Monday then Mr Manyi can come in. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Any answer that the three of us give is subject to the 
same questions that have already arisen due to the length of Mr Fuzile's evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is a reluctance to...[intervenes] 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 139 of 141 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We can attempt to answer that.  We take your counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no what we will do is one) tomorrow let me just make it we are 
only going to resume at 14:00 in the afternoon and so we will not be sitting in the 
morning.  That is because in my other job I have to attend some other business at the 
Constitutional Court. 
 
So once I am done there I will have to, I will come here.  It is something 
important that will be happening for the first time in the country.  So we will resume at 
14:00 tomorrow.  So we will then hear one or both of the witnesses depending on 
whether we finish the one who will start and then once we have finished with the 
second one whether it is tomorrow or it is on Monday then Mr Manyi can then come in.  
10 
So I would leave it to the legal team to be in touch with him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I understand he has been informed already about tomorrow. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That leaves your direction about the condonation 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I should deal with it now then we know it is – I was told at 
some stage there was counsel who was ready but if there are challenges I can hear it 
tomorrow at 14:00.  Okay it looks like it is better tomorrow at 14:00. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it better at 14:00 tomorrow? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That condonation application will be dealt with tomorrow at 
14:00.  We therefore adjourn for the day and once again we will resume at 14:00 
22 NOVEMBER 2018 – DAY 28 
 
Page 140 of 141 
 
tomorrow. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.
