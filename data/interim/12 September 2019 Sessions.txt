PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 12 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good morning Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you – we ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes we are Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair counsel for Mr 
Motsoeneng would like to address you on an aspect – on an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay that is fine. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Good morning Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  I will be very brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Because I want to ensure that we continue 
with the proceedings in – with due haste. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Chair there is the misleadings that coming 
from media again that keep on be [indistinct].  I do not know as the 
commission I am aware that you have powers to ensure that such a 
responsible reporting can be curtailed in the interest of the commission 
20 
because the more they are perpetuated the more Mr Motsoeneng feels 
inclined to respond to those issues.  So remember and I have noted 
with concern also that a number of judgments they do make 
consideration of media reports and you have heard it yourself before 
this commission how Sunday Times reporters were allegedly paid to 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 3 of 169 
 
write negative stories about certain individuals.  And we would like to 
believe it is the same narrative with Mr Motsoeneng.  If that – is there 
is some form of order that can be made to cure such adverse reporting 
until perhaps when the commission has been its findings then the 
media can then make their own findings as well 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe what you can do while everything is 
proceeding is to just draft something that tells me what it is that the 
media has said that is misleading so that – and if possible which media 
houses and so on so that I can look at it properly and if I want to say 
something I can say it from an informed bases.   
10 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then during – if during the tea break it is ready I can 
have a look at it or if it is ready later on I can have a look at it. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  We will certainly do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is that fine? 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Mr Motsoeneng 
20 
yesterday we left off whilst you were explaining to the Chairperson how 
the MultiChoice agreement came about.  Yes you were at a point when 
you were – the Chair had asked why MultiChoice and you were 
explaining that when we parted.  Yes could you continue explaining how 
that agreement was reached? 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 4 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or he might have passed that point. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You think so Chair?  Oh 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am not mistaken I think he was at a point where 
he was negotiating with MultiChoice after Doctor Ngubane and then 
GCEO  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Had failed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had failed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was I think at the point where they left him 
alone in the room or something and that is at MultiChoice and I think he 
10 
was going to continue from there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may be mistaken. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes you are quite right.  When the tempers 
had gone down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the tempers had gone. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I think that is what he said yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct Mr Motsoeneng?  Is that where you 
were? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But Chair maybe before we 
proceed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 5 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think you will also appreciate 
Chair that the issues are so serious and they affect my children 
especially when people spread lies when my children are still at school.  
You know this issues Chair are serious because the media is still 
pursuing the issues to portray me as a bad person even in this 
commission Chairperson.  I am aware Chair you just addressed the 
issue with my counsel Chairperson but I think Chairperson because 
media talk about these issues even the children they talk about these 
issues Chairperson.  These are serious issues Chairperson.  They may 
not affect me because I am used to this kind of issues but when it 
10 
comes to my family, when it comes to my children at school these are 
very serious Chairperson that is why Chairperson I appreciate the 
opportunity that you have given me to come and tell my own story 
Chairperson.  The first point Chairperson that I want to address 
yesterday Chairperson you even said to me and correct my affidavit - in 
your understanding and I agree with you Chairperson and I do not think 
this time Chairperson they were malicious on the issues when they 
were reporting.  I think it was 403 channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I do not think some 
20 
of the issues they were malicious and other media houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I think it is understanding 
on the issues that we are dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay 
so 
it 
might 
have 
been 
just 
lack 
of 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 6 of 169 
 
understanding. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Advocate Norman asked me 
about threatening journalists but she did not put like – like that.  But 
when they report they were saying that I accepted that I have 
threatened journalists.  I have never accepted Chairperson that I have 
threatened journalists.  Advocate was just confirming the discussion 
between me and those journalists which I confirmed Chairperson.  
Because I said I do not want to mislead the commission. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And if I said so Chairperson 
why should I say I did not say these issues.  But I am not accepting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That I was wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because the Advocate did not 
make follow-up to say but what you meant Chairperson.  Like one of the 
example it is education.  I was stopping journalists to fulfil the mandate 
of education.  That one I have already responded by saying when you 
20 
look the Broadcasting Act actually it is unlawful to glamourize violence 
it is not in the interest of the public but the mandate of SABC is to 
educate.  You cannot educate people in such a way.  So I have already 
responded on such issues Chairperson.  I am just making example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 7 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I do not want to 
prolong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Along these issues Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, no that is fine thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe for – for what it is worth I must just say 
that Mr Motsoeneng you have in part of what you have said you have 
made a very important distinction and I hope the media appreciates 
that.  Where you are able to say what they reported is not correct but 
10 
you accept that they were not malicious.  It may have been just 
misunderstanding.  Because there are circumstances where people say 
the media is malicious.  They know the truth.  But they are reporting in 
this way because they have certain agendas. But you are saying in this 
particular case about yesterday you do not think they were malicious 
you think it might just have been lack of understanding of what had 
been said. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.   So 
20 
then we proceed then from where we left off yesterday on the 
MultiChoice issue.  Thank you could you proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the tempers went up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And down. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  I think I was dealing 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 8 of 169 
 
with now the process after Doctor Ngubane and the former GCEO Me 
Lulama and I said Chairperson I approach Doctor Ngubane to say to 
him I think I can achieve what they could not achieve.  He agree with 
me to go and approach MultiChoice Chairperson.  In short Chairperson 
the first meeting I have already alluded what transpired in that meeting.  
I will go further Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry.  Is that the one where tempers went 
high? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes it is the first one 
Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first meeting.  But you – I do not remember you 
telling me how it ended. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I did Chair yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just remind me. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes what I said Chairperson the 
first meeting even the COO of MultiChoice Mr Imtiaz Patel walk out 
because we could not agree on the – on the matters Chairperson.  
Because in negotiations Chairperson sometimes you will threaten 
people. In the interest of SABC  
CHAIRPERSON:  As a negotiating tactic? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I must tell you the truth 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 9 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I said to Imtiaz you 
know what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I know that even unions in negotiations they can 
threaten a strike even when they know they cannot afford a strike. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson it is just part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Of the strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson.  So I threaten him 
and I must be honest Chairperson I said no but you know if we do not 
10 
agree on these issues I am going to court.  Because I believe that we 
have a case at the SABC and I have got advice. There was no advice 
Chairperson. There was no advice Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You said I shall tell you the 
truth Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am telling you the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  There was no advice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And then I can see he was 
unsettled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When the matter  And then 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 10 of 169 
 
Chairperson I said to him look in my view private sector should 
contribute to public because whether you are private indirectly you are 
benefiting from citizen of South Africa by buying decoders and other 
stuff Chairperson. I said you must contribute. So that meeting it did not 
go well between two of us.  He left the meeting. Now I was in trouble 
that I am not achieving what I was looking to achieve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the meeting held at the MultiChoice offices? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In the SABC Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in the SABC. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think early in the morning. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when he walked… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Half past five o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he walked out he left you alone.  He left you 
and he was leaving. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  He left me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes he left me and then he 
spoke to my PA because when he walked out my PA’s office he must go 
through my PA’s office they just talk I think he went out and then I 
called my PA, we sit down and discuss the issues. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did it look like at that stage the negotiations had 
collapsed? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I had to find a way for him 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 11 of 169 
 
so that I can engage him again. And my strategy now was discussing 
the sports rights.  Because we were still negotiating different matters 
Chairperson and I asked my PA again to do follow-up with him and ask 
forgiveness maybe the way I have put my issues with him and then my 
PA asked him to have another meeting with me. He came Chairperson.  
I was very down Chairperson.  You know now trying to show him that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were down to earth now? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were down to earth you were not threatening 
now? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Ja Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  So I discuss I 
show him and then he said but no it is fine.  How can we assist you?  I 
said you can fund the SABC because you know that we are operating 
under analogue so we do not have all this transmitters. Even today 
Chairperson SABC is not able to reach all cities in – of South Africa 
because of analogue.  So I said if you can assist us so that we put this 
channel as a pilot project Chairperson.  When we migrate at least we 
have four channels on our platforms Chairperson.  Those were 
20 
discussion Chairperson and I think he did concede that he is going to 
try his board Chairperson to go and talk to the board about our 
discussion which he went and came back to say they agree to fund us 
and then they put certain amount Chairperson.  I do not remember 
exactly how much the first proposal and I tried to call the finance team 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 12 of 169 
 
and the head of television now I was trying to check whether this 
budget is sustainable that they are saying they are going to fund us.  It 
was not sustainable Chairperson.  I went back negotiate with him again. 
That is why maybe Chairperson we went around R300 million plus 
Chairperson and then we agree.  He went back to his board 
Chairperson and I am not giving you exactly correct numbers 
Chairperson because I am talking from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just estimates. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  He went back 
to his board.  They discussed Chairperson.  They agree. We also have 
10 
another channel which I negotiated which is Encore channel.  That 
channel Chairperson it is also a pilot project for us to be ready for 
digital migration.  If SABC is ready to migrate those channels 
Chairperson SABC will be having five channels on their bouquet which 
according to me Chairperson it is a very good innovation within my 
sight to make sure that when channel – when digital migration happens 
at least SABC they have this channel Chair.  And Chairperson it is my – 
it is my view that when you talk about my legacy those two channels, 
the employment of people. Because we employ people especially 404 
Chairperson.  It is good for South Africa to have people who can go and 
20 
negotiate Chairperson and try to use the tactics Chairperson that I was 
using and that tactic Chairperson I did not use here in South Africa. 
When I joined the – not when I joined Chairperson.  When I was acting 
COO SABC they were having blackouts, sports blackout.  They could 
not watch Bafana Bafana in Africa.  They could not watch Bafana 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 13 of 169 
 
Bafana locally here always it was delayed.  The same tactics that I use 
with MultiChoice I went to France Chairperson.  I met this guy in 
France. I was with the head of sports. Three GCO went to negotiate 
with him they could not come with what I came with Chairperson.  They 
could not come.  People at SABC and people generally Chairperson 
even on radios and so especially Robert Marawa Show people were 
shocked that I was able to achieve that I could bring sports back.  
Today as we are speaking Chairperson blackout.  I am just talking 
about the background Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  May – I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe just to have a look at what Doctor Ngubane 
and Ms Mokhobo had on the table when they negotiated with 
MultiChoice and looking at what you had – what you got.  Now in terms 
of what they discussed with MultiChoice there was the R50 million – 
there was the fissure of R50 million.  Now the R50 million was going to 
be going down year by year until there was no payment to be made, is 
that right? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was going to be a payment for what? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It was going to be a payment 
Chairperson to have a channel.  The same channel 24 hour news 
channel. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 14 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On the DSTV bouquet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So the payment would be from SABC to 
MultiChoice? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The payment will be from 
MultiChoice to SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now it was SABC which needed a channel. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  SABC initiated the 
10 
channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But they did not have fuding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To put a channel.  That is why 
they went and request MultiChoice to fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it was a request for funding? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was going to be there for MultiChoice to 
benefit from that? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Nothing Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Nothing Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would go to MultiChoice and say we want a 
fourth – another channel.  We do not have money please fund it and 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 15 of 169 
 
MultiChoice said yes we can fund it but we will start first year R50 
million, second year less until the fifth year.  After that you must see 
for yourself. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson what I can – I do 
not know their discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So I can only talk about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood as you – the story yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I can only talk about my 
discussion. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  With MultiChoice.  Remember 
Chairperson I said I have threatened them.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no no. i… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But the benefit Chairpeson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Like when I negotiate with them 
they were already benefiting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  MultiChoice? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because – yes because of 
Must-Carry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Must-Carry Regulations. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 16 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Remember Chairperson SABC 
1, 2 and 3 they are sitting that bouquet.  MultiChoice is not paying a 
cent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So when I negotiate with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is the threat that I said no 
I am going to court to make sure that you as MultiChoice we remove… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will pay. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Our channels in your bouquet 
but it was just a threat Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I knew that by 
regulations we can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It was just tactic Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. So – so – so with – and then with you how 
much funding did they provide – they agreed to provide? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson let me say roughly 
20 
those two channels it is R700 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over what period? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Over five years. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 17 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over five years? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  It goes with annual 
increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Inflation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Every year ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Per year Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It goes with inflation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And also Chairperson what I 
negotiated is SABC shall not pay for transmitters.  So MultiChoice pays 
for transmitters. Even in Africa as it is happening today SABC we do 
not pay.  I also negotiated that all the adverts they shall go to SABC – 
the revenue from that channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It cannot be taken by 
MultiChoice it is a SABC Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that they agreed that is all in the agreement? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is all in agreement 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But maybe the English 
Chairperson because I do not want – what do you mean that is all so 
that I am able to… 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 18 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  So part of what you are telling me is 
when Doctor Ngubane and Ms Mokhobo negotiated with MultiChoice 
MultiChoice refused to go beyond R50million in funding and that is how 
negotiations collapsed between Doctor Ngubane and Ms Mokhobo on 
the one side and MultiChoice on the other side.  And that when you 
came in you then persuaded MultiChoice to agree on two channels and 
the monetary value over – or the funding over five years for the two 
channels was going to be over R700 million.  Is that right? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Maybe Chair just to also 
remember yesterday I said they negotiated R50 million. I think they 
went back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  For additional R20 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I think that one was not 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  By maybe MultiChoice board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But it was just negotiations that 
they were looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 19 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And Treasury they refused 
Chairperson to fund that channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To top up? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes to top up so that the 
channel is more financial sustainable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But also Chairperson what is 
shocking – you know Chairperson I raise money personally for elections 
for SABC.  When government is supposed to fund elections Chairperson 
and I think currently they did assist SABC but I am talking under 
10 
correction Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am not sure hundred percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I did hear that it seems as 
they did.  But  during my time they could not even now I am talking 
about election Chairperson because I am the one who said to the SABC 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like 2014 for 2016 those elections? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am the one who said they 
should – SABC should not depend on government.  We should be able 
to come with innovation like the innovations that I am coming with 
Chairprson.  And I can tell you Chairperson these two channels I was 
already engaging other private sector.  Already I logged one channel 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 20 of 169 
 
but when I left SABC everything collapsed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That channel was going to be 
there so that – but it was not going to be funded by MultiChoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then – so just to go back.  On the deal that 
you negotiated you say what was – what was the benefit or value that 
MultiChoice was getting out of the contract itself? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  My view Chairperson will be 
10 
those three channels that are sitting because of regulations must carry 
in my view they are benefiting.  In my view.  That is where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Through that ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is where I came with to 
say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But please we understand the 
regulations but because when I went to them to fund us that – it was 
the strategy Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And then as I explained earlier 
– so for me they were benefitting.  I said assist us to move forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  During digital migration so that 
we can have those channels in our platform. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162

CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I think Chairperson as a 
private sector they did very well to assist the public.  Because in my 
view they were assisting the public so that we are ready for migration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Just on that point of 
you having raised funds Mr Motsoeneng could you please have a look 
at page 169 of the same bundle because the amounts are listed there 
and I would just want us to deal with that aspect. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I know Advocate it is 387 the 
10 
first one and you go down there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is 3 and then…

there.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  169. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I saw … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I saw – I saw them a few days ago. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson sorry. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 22 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I should know because this is 
what I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because the reason why I am 
not reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is because these issues I know 
them Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You dealt with them. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  There is no need for me…Yes I 
dealt with them Chairpeson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you – thank you Chair.  So on that 
page it is listed there that the SABC – I am sorry it is recorded that the 
SABC Encore and 24 hours news channel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is at – next to 4.4 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You did not say from where about you 
reading on the page. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry Chair from paragraph 4.4.  It 
deals with success fee for raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes ja – it is – ja – yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes success fee for raising funds.  We are 
going to deal with that issue of the success fee.  And then Chair it says 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 23 of 169 
 
– maybe just if I could just read quickly?  But my interest… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what document is this? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This is the same – state – CC30 Chair.  
Exhibit CC30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh you mean the document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – ja – is it minutes of a… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is minutes of a board meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of a board meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is minutes of a board meeting held on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of the 19 t h August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  19 August 2016. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2016 yes I beg your pardon I should have 
identified it properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Board meeting of the 19 August 2016 and 
you attended that board meeting Mr Motsoeneng according to the first 
page of the mintutes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  19 August 2016.  And then at page 
169 there is a discussion about the success fee for raising of funds. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You recall that?  And then in paragraph 
4.4 you were then recused.  
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 24 of 169 
 
“At this stage Mr Motsoeneng was recused from the 
meeting.  And then – then there is a discussion about 
regulations but my interest is in the fifth line Chair 
where it says:  The SABC Encore and 24 Hours News 
Channel had been funded from funds raised by Mr 
Motsoeneng and if the SABC recognised that it had 
to raise money outside of the two main revenue 
streams there ought – they had ought to consider 
rewarding people for raising funds.  He provided the 
following analysis…” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am wondering whether you should not… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Start from the beginning? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just start from the beginning for context ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Okay.  Thank you Chair.  It says: 
“At this stage Mr Motsoeneng was recused from the 
meeting.  Mr Aguma informed members that the 
SABC relied on two main sources of funding to run 
its operations these being 12 percent from TV 
licences and 85 percent from advertising revenue 
and the remaining three percent from Government 
20 
funding and other revenue streams.  Over the years 
the cost of public mandate activities imposed on the 
SABC by the ICASA Regulations had not been 
funded by the fiscal which implied that the SABC 
had to find other alternatives of funding.  The SABC 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 25 of 169 
 
Encore and 24 hour news channel had been funded 
from funds raised by Mr Motsoeneng and if the 
SABC recognised that it had to raise money outside 
of the two main revenue streams then it ought to 
consider rewarding people for raising funds.  He 
provided the following analysis of the 1.19 billion 
funds that had been raised by Mr Motsoeneng and 
which was outside of his job description.” 
You were correct.  The first figure is: 
“386 - 387 million for the 24 hours news channel, 
10 
359 million for the SABC Encore, 60 million for the 
AFCON Games, 210 million for the volume deals on 
the sale of SABC programs to Africa, 15 million for 
the 2016 Local Government elections, five million 
for the contributions the gratuitous payment to the 
Music 
Legends, 
100 
million 
extra 
revenue 
negotiated in the first quarter, 30 million for 
subscription, video demand deal with MultiChoice 
and £2 million - I am so sorry - $2 million for 
negotiating savings on AFCON Sports Rights.  
20 
Mr Aguma mentioned that although Mr Motsoeneng 
had raised all the above mentioned funds the 
corporation had not recognised him for such 
performance.  He cautioned that if the corporation 
did not incorporate the principle of paying a 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 26 of 169 
 
success fee to the COO and employees who went 
beyond the call of duty to raise funds for the 
corporate challenge like SABC Encore and the 24 
hour news channels would close down.” 
What - sorry Chair and then maybe of relevance to the 
contract itself because there is mention of what the previous … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before you proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just want … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To - to get … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Him to confirm that he … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  These figures, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These figures correctly represent funds that he raised 
… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes Mr Motsoeneng. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson because I am not a 
financial - the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I will - I believe what the CFO 
is saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has written? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 27 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But what I need to tell you 
Chairperson is it is not just raising funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Raising funds … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is only those two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am just dealing with the 
document there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
It 
is 
only 
those 
two 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The tangent.  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Other funds … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Where you find that SABC they 
were supposed to pay certain amount like AFCON. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I saved SABC 32 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Through negotiation? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Through negotiations … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 28 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And where I saved money for 
SABC Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The saving … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is my job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
That 
is 
part 
of 
my 
job 
description. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  (Intervenes). 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The only part … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is raising funds … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Like your elections … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Like your Encore and - and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And when they were saying they 
20 
pay me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That amount which is 2.5 
percent … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 29 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I wrote a letter …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To the GCEO and the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I alert them make them aware 
that this part … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You cannot pay me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Because 
it 
is 
my 
job 
10 
description. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I mean as a manager you must 
negotiate in the interest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Of the organisation.  If I have 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Achieved that you cannot 
reward me for that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because you get a salary.  You get paid for doing 
your job. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But if I come with a brown bag 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 30 of 169 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  With 700 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I can accept that you recognise 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  My work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So these - these funds that you raised 
they came in a brown bag.  Is that what you are suggesting? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair no just - just a teaser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and were you raising these - 
how - from - where did you source these this funding? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Let me deal with sports rights 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know Chairperson like I 
was saying to you when you look the board at the SABC and 
management they do not understand business of the SABC.  It is not 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 31 of 169 
 
about always money.  It is the how you negotiate with people.  Example 
Chairperson PSL gave us the rights for free for radio and reason being 
Chairperson even that one - I think Dr Ngubane did allude to this issue 
when he was here. 
I am the one who went and saved SABC money but we are 
not dealing with that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Amount there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because previously what was 
10 
happening in the PSL each and every team - Orlando Pirates will be 
saying no our value rights.  I am just giving an example Chairperson.  It 
is 200 million.  Kaizer Chiefs will be saying no we have more 
supporters than Orlando Pirates.  So ours is 500 million.  It will go 
according to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To their - the value that they attach to themselves? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And it was risky for SABC 
because 16 teams how are you going to - to deal with such issues.  I 
20 
had to go and plead with PSL to say we do not have money.  Can you 
meet us half way so that at least these teams you as PSL you manage 
these negotiations.  I went and negotiated with them and Chairperson 
really I want to appreciate Ubuntu and understanding the work of public 
broadcaster because PSL did assist us. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 32 of 169 
 
So when we negotiate currently you negotiate with PSL not 
individuals owners of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the clubs? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Of the clubs Chairperson and I 
know SABC is saying no actually that is not the right way to do it.  I 
can confirm Chairperson it is the right way to do it because they do not 
understand business.  They do not - they do not even understand what 
informs that decision Chairperson and Chairperson if we want to get 
SABC correct there must be induction. 
When you come you must first go through induction.  Even 
10 
people that you do not like you must call them.  Tell us how you have 
been doing the work.  So - but if you do not have induction you induct 
yourself.  You think you know when you do not know.  That is where the 
problem is Chairperson and I am talking in the interest Chairperson of 
the public broadcaster. 
I do not want to go back but I can even assist them for free. 
If I assist them I can tell you Chairperson they can have another two 
channels there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Mr Motsoeneng I know that this 
issue of your success fee it is a fact that you received about 10 over 
20 
just over 10 million.  Am I correct?  As a success fee for having raised 
these funds.  Is that correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think they still owe me more 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 33 of 169 
 
than that amount. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Although Chairperson I shall 
say we are in court … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  (Intervenes). 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  With these matters Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is what I wanted to raise that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is a subject of litigation. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But maybe I should not deal into - I am 
just curious to know.  I - I mean if somebody were to say to me I must 
raise a million Rand I would know how to begin but to be able to raise 
387 million you know it is - it is of interest to me as to whether you 
20 
raised it from the people who were doing business with the SABC or 
just broadly around the world.  You know how did you raise those 
funds? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  May - yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 34 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You answer Mr Motsoeneng I just want to say you 
have made the point a number of times that you did very well for the 
SABC while you were there and we all know that there has been 
criticism of you or some of your decisions over - over time.  That is all 
in the public domain but I am quite interested and am quite open to 
really understand where you did well and where you did not do well 
because it is important that the public has a balanced view of any 
individual. 
You may have done some wrong things.  I have not made any 
findings.  I will make findings later.  You may have done some good 
10 
things but it is important that one should get a complete picture and as 
I have said here before I am not going to make findings whether it is 
you or any person who is implicated.  I am not going to make findings 
based on what the media says about those people. 
I am going to make findings based on the evidence I hear.  I 
do not - the media can say whatever they want to say about people.  I 
will look at the facts and the evidence before me and I believe that 
where there is justification to give credit people should be given credit.  
Where there is justification to say they were wrong.  We must say they 
were wrong but it is important to get a complete picture.  So I just 
20 
thought I must just make that quite clear. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson I 
am not an angel.  I am a human being and I am not saying everything 
that I did everything - everything - I did everything right.  I am - I do 
not want to imply that.  I am a human being.  In any case Chairperson a 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 35 of 169 
 
person who works very hard there will be mistakes along the way.  It is 
- it is normal. 
The question will be whether those mistakes that you did you 
did it because really you were looking to commit such an error 
Chairperson.  I am not an angel Chairperson but Chairperson I cannot 
say really I have achieved everything at the SABC.  Example 
Chairperson in my affidavit I said I have pain when it comes to people 
with disability because when I came at the SABC Chairperson there 
were just I think and I think it is not just SABC. 
You know when we employ people with disability we just 
10 
employ for making sure that equity because of the laws and so on you - 
you cover such matters because it is two percent which I think also it is 
far low Chairperson.  I think we achieve that at the SABC but I cannot 
say it is an achievement.  It is a failure and in that point Chairperson I 
think I fail. 
When it comes to provinces Chairperson I did not achieve a 
lot because what I was looking to achieve is to see where we produce 
actors from those provinces.  We also make sure that we cater for 
African languages.  I failed Chairperson because we - I could not 
achieve that.  I tried also to achieve that in that 404 Channel 
20 
Chairperson because if you remember well when it started all - not all 
African languages but African languages they were there but we could 
not do well because that channel is in Africa is and there were 
concerns but we cannot hear. 
So we decided no because now we - we are in Africa also.  
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 36 of 169 
 
Let us use that channel the language that will be understandable to all 
people who are watching that channel Chairperson.  There - there are 
many things Chairperson that I - I think I was supposed to do better … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I could not do better Chair 
person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think Ms Norman had … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then asked the question how … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As to how … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How and where you raised the - the various amounts 
and then I interrupted while she was … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Waiting for an answer.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I think I have 
20 
already alluded to the MultiChoice that we are all aware of because 
some of the negotiations Chairperson you know the fact - the parties 
they do not want to reveal their relationship with public (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I can submit to you Chairperson 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 37 of 169 
 
to say this is what I did in my affidavit because of you know those 
negotiations.  They are very sensitive Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because it affects even people 
who are working there.  You know those … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But not publically Chairperson 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Because 
I 
even 
signed 
confidentiality … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Or agree with confidentiality 
that the matters will stay between us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Confidential, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But in you Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I do not have a problem … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 38 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But maybe to assist the 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Like I said it is not like looking 
for money raising funds.  It is the negotiation Chairperson.  Even in the 
provinces I was negotiating including Government Chairperson.  
Example the 60 million that is there for AFCON Government paid for 
AFCON. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Previously? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  For the first time I approached 
the Minister of Sports at that time Fikile Mbalula and his DG.  I raised 
the issue that we do not have money to cater for AFCON and remember 
Chairperson it was emergency.  AFCON was supposed to be staged in 
another country but because of some issues it was an emergency.  So I 
went to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Which year was that again?  I remember there 
was that - there was a year when that situation was - arose.  Do you 
remember which year it was?   
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not remember but I do remember when … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if it was Libya or some other country 
that was supposed to stage AFCON and then there where challenges 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 39 of 169 
 
and then South Africa was asked. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hey I was not - I was not aware 
that you follow sports Chairperson.  You are correct.  You are correct 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So Chairperson it is - it is like I 
was saying sometimes Chairperson it is skills of negotiations.  You 
know how you negotiate.  I have other witnesses but I have other 
10 
strong points because I cannot have everything but I know I have many 
witnesses Chairperson as a - as a human being when it comes to these 
issues but also Chairperson the team that I work with at the SABC they 
were very good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a strong team? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
It 
was 
a 
strong 
team 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And understanding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The business of the SABC 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I can tell you Chairperson 
during Anton Heunis … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 40 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The financials of the SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They did very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
I 
am 
not 
talking 
about 
fundraising Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am just saying within the 
SABC … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The management of the funds? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Advertisers … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  He was in charge for sales 
division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Their role is to make sure that 
they generate revenue for SABC.  Anton was doing very well 
Chairperson.  When he - when he retired early - he took early 
retirement because of health issues.  That is where also affected the

SABC and I could not leave Anton to move away Chairperson because 
someone who is dealing with strategic position especially the financials 
of the SABC what I did to him I asked him Anton can you stay for two 
years. 
We appoint a - a woman.  Please handover and go with the 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 41 of 169 
 
woman everywhere to advertisers - introduce her.  So that at least she 
is well known in that industry.  Although she was still within his team in 
that unit Chairperson.  So there are some issues Chairperson like when 
Dr Ngubane was saying there are those people that you cannot just 
allow them to leave the organisation. 
Anton was one of them Chairperson and it is a pity that when 
I left he left.  I think that is why you have all this financial problems at 
the SABC Chairperson.

The 
only

we

differences Chairperson … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 43 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because differences will be 
there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When you have human beings 
…

for 
the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.

MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  We have our differences … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I could not take no know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is what I could not take. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When they were saying they 
could not do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I would say you cannot be a

CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 44 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I give timelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  By this time I want this 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So when you - when there was something to be 
done and you wanted them to do something and they said no it could 
not be done that is what you are talking about and you would say no 
you can do it.  You must go and do it.  That is what you meant? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson and that is 
informed by Chairperson.  In the SABC at that level I was the only 
person who has grown within the ranks of the SABC.  So when I talk 
they know I know what I am talking about because I went through - I - I 
know the SABC.  One of the examples Chairperson I think is there in 
my affidavit is the new studio that we put - the SABC put three years to 
put a digital studio. 
They said we are going to have - we are going to take three 
years Chairperson.  I am not a specialist in that area but I was 
wondering why every time SABC we take three years.  Everything that 
20 
we do is - is three years.  I do not understand and remember 
Chairperson I have five years contract which means if you have - you 
have a strategy or a plan I am not going to deliver. 
You see Chairperson and someone who is going to come also 
is going to start from scratch another three years.  You see 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 45 of 169 
 
Chairperson.  I said to them look colleagues can we go and visit other 
broadcasters.  We visit other broadcasters Chairperson.  I led that team 
Chairperson and then I asked this person you know I am not a 
technology person. 
I need assistance.  Why you - MultiChoice example - you 
have these moving studios.  Chairperson I think you also watch sports.  
You will see they are able to have a studio like this table.  It is a set.  
You can pack it and then you move with it because I saw it - I think 
Orlando Stadium first time - I said but why MultiChoice is able to do 
this and we are not able to do this. 
10 
I went to them and others Chairperson and I asked.  They 
said no but you can take three months.  That is why Chairperson I went 
to the Group Executive.  I said let us change our corporate plan.  Let 
us put ourselves under pressure.  Let us deliver this within a year but 
we deliver a studio … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instead of three years?  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Within 
three 
months 
and 
Chairperson we save 11 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And that studio it is a multi-
20 
studio set Chairperson.  Your suit that you are wearing Chairperson if 
you were looking at the SABC - those analogue studios - this suit that 
you are wearing it can be read.  That is analogue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In the … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 46 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the eyes of the viewer? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But digital it will because it has 
those set ups that it adjusts to the colour.  If I come with a red suit and 
then the technicians they are able to adjust according to what you wear 
Chairperson.  I know Chairperson, people said we did not follow the 
procurement process Chairperson.  Chairperson there are issues that 
you must test in the interest of the organisation and the public. 
I will argue Chairperson that when we put that project we 
10 
were testing whether we can compete with other broadcasters 
Chairperson which we were able to achieve Chairperson.  So - but we 
followed a process Chairperson we followed deviation and there was 
time where the head of sports said we need a studio for rugby.  Rugby 
is here.  We are left with four months. 
What do you do Chairperson? You are left with four months.  
Your own team is telling you that they are going to take three years and 
what informed these three years Chairperson because three years 
Chairperson it means that every year according to inflation or according 
to currency and remember all these technical stuff that we need we buy 
20 
from abroad. 
You pay by Euro/Dollars.  If you were budgeting 100 million 
you can pay 250 million or 300 million Chairperson.  I think people 
should check the rational.  Even if they criticise but what was the 
rational for these people to do this Chairperson.  According to me we 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 47 of 169 
 
have a good point to say there was rugby and if we take three years 
what was going to happen Chairperson. 
So I think Chairperson some of the issues especially in 
broadcasting you must be flexible Chairperson.  That is why I was 
saying Chairperson our policy shall align with the business because 
this irregular expenditure and so on it does not mean that people have 
chow money because even when media report when we talk about 
irregular. 
Irregular means that you broadcast Bafana Bafana without a 
contract Chairperson and I will tell you Bafana Bafana recently they 
10 
were supposed to play with Zambia.  Zambia cancelled Bafana Bafana 
and then SAFA rushed to Mauritius.  If Mauritius did agree the same 
day to say we are going - we are coming.  You do not have time to sign 
that contract and follow this process. 
The match is in the evening.  So that is why I am saying 
Chairperson, people need to understand the business.  That is why we 
came with the issue when we realised that we have serious issues on 
governance issues.  Let us align our policy with the business of the 
SABC.  If the regulations from Treasury - let us ask exemption.  Yes 
Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have touched on quite a number of 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 48 of 169 
 
matters that you deal with in your statement in answering the 
Chairperson.  You touched on the vision view studios and you touched 
on the issue of irregular and wasteful expenditure.  So - and - is it 
correct that these are matters also that the - because I believe that SIU 
has written a letter to you dealing with those matters.  Am I correct?  At 
least the irregular and wasteful expenditure. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson to be honest I do 
not even understand that letter of SIU.  You see media Chairperson if 
you go and then you are portrayed that you are doing the work.  You 
are so excited.  You go to street.  People are greeting you.   
10 
You  make a mistake because Chairperson the letter that they are 
asking me you’ll know very well Chairperson they are asking be about 
the union and the negotiations between the SABC and the unions to say 
I shall answer, why these people they were given annual  increment a 
sober person would never ask such a question because you know that 
every year the unions they negotiate for the workers annual salary 
increment and in that scenario Chairperson, why they asking this is 
because one union signed first, agree with the SABC, one union said 
no, we’re not going to be part.  So you sign with the union that agree 
with you and that union, you know that Chairperson, because they 
20 
represent their own workers.   
 
Normally you don’t pay those workers because you are still in 
negotiations with another union Chairperson and in the negotiation 
Chairperson and the resolution is then everything they process.  In the 
negotiation Chairperson, normally I tell people, can people go on strike 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 49 of 169 
 
for issues that you can really resolved what is harm, if they want 7% 
you give them inflation and then they are fighting to say, no, no, no we 
want 9%, you know union will drag you, will drag you.  
 
The strategy of SABC Chairperson in my view, which I led 
Chairperson to unite SABC, they are asking because there is what we 
call a sweetener, sweetener Chairperson and then we check if we give 
these people a 9% and we give them once of sweetener, which one is 
risky for SABC, the 9% is risky a sweetener is once-off, maybe half of 
your 
salary 
or 
maybe 
R2 000 
Chairperson 
that 
is 
how 
we 
negotiate…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You look at a long term to say, do we gain by doing it 
this way, do we gain more or do we loose more in doing it another way. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    And I can also attest it to your 
Chairperson, you know when I was at the SABC the union they would 
never defeat me in the SABC because in the negotiations I will tell 
them,   let’s do like this, let’s go to the workers,  put your issues with 
the workers, I’m going to push the SABC issues and when I go there 
and negotiate with them, I will tell the workers, the workers I know you 
20 
want 9% but here is the risk looming, you may be retrenched for moving 
forward but if you accept this, you’ll work forever at the SABC, let us 
look at reality and I will go with the union there Chairperson, you know 
what, they will talk but when I take the stand and put my issues the 
workers will go with me.  They even aske me, Hlaudi no this issue of 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 50 of 169 
 
you addressing workers, no we’re not going to go with you.  I’m just 
demonstrating Chairperson…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this now the union leaders? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The union leaders Chairperson, 
and I work very well with the union leaders Chairperson, that is why 
even when SABC they were dismissing me, including the Public 
Protector, CW released a statement to say that we are happy with this 
man.  Chairperson we were working very well, I mean at certain point 
Chairperson, I fight with them it’s normal because there are issues that 
I cannot tolerate or SABC cannot tolerate. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes so this issue that you’ve just told the 
Chairperson about is where then those employees belonging to that 
union, about 300 of them were paid R10 000 each? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes that’s the issue that you’re talking 
about? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes.    
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And that amounted to about R3million? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes chair, not exactly that 
number but yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and estimate? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And estimate yes and then you went Mr 
Motsoeneng – I think the GCO of the SABC has testified that there was 
an amount of about R5billion on wasteful and irregular expenditure over 
all dealing with the contracts that were conclude during that time where 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 51 of 169 
 
tax clearance certificates were not original, where people were 
employed without following due process.  So at combination of factors 
that amounted to that figure. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson it is a hearsay 
they didn’t present evidence.  In my affidavit I presented the financials 
of the SABC, I presented the governance of the SABC, maybe 
Chairperson let me just go back, I think Dr Ngubane did allude to the 
issue of when they joined SABC as a Board there were problems there, 
I mean governance issues Chairperson and when they appoint me to 
act as COO what I did Chairperson, because they were using 
10 
consultants from outside and then I said to them why can’t we use 
people within the SABC because you have people from internal audit, 
you have people from finance, you have people from risk, those people 
they 
understand 
the 
governance 
issues 
even 
better 
than 
me 
Chairperson and in any case I rely on them because that is not my 
special – I don’t specialise in those issues Chairperson.  So if you look 
from 2008 and 2009 Auditor General identify governance issues, 
Auditor General identify the SABC on top is more bloated Chairperson.  
Auditor General also identified that there were problems with personnel 
within SABC, that’s why the Board took a resolution to make sure that 
20 
they adhered to what Auditor General is recommending Chairperson.  
So – but in my time Chairperson from – I act that in 2011 on November 
on the 18 t h but I can say I started working in 2012, you know December, 
all office and other people they’re moving away Chairperson.  If you 
look at the financials from 2012 Chairperson, you’ll see a huge 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 52 of 169 
 
improvement then now we’re talking about billion cash, I’m just giving 
your roughly Chairperson, you move forward and then in 2013 you find 
disclaimer worst part.  I start working in 2012 now, 2013 you have 
disclaimer what informs disclaimer Chairperson is because now we’re 
audited by Auditor General. In he past we were audited by KPMG, when 
Auditor General comes he talks about issues that SABC  people they 
don’t even understand and what I did Chairperson, I put a task team to 
deal with the audit governance issues and Chairperson I have 
submitted my affidavit and proof on what I’m saying from Auditor 
General, audited financial statement and governance statement, 
10 
audited Chairperson.  So in 2014 Chairperson I put this team, we move 
from disclaimer to a qualification, I realise that we are not really 
dealing with – we are not able to achieve what we should achieve 
Chairperson, I decided and I informed the Board and I asked the Board 
to say, you know what I realise here, in the meeting with Auditor 
General it always fighting amongst management and Auditor General 
because management they disagree with them.  I said maybe to fix this 
issue why can’t we go and catch a fish from Auditor General, at least 
someone who has clue about how Auditor General operate, that’s why 
Chairperson, I was looking for a fish that I know that at least the fish 
20 
was auditing the SABC.  That fish he was catched by other entity, I 
asked this fish…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you could catch the Fish? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chairperson, other people 
catching him.  I asked this person we are looking for someone to assist 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 53 of 169 
 
us and then the HR informed them they went for head hunting, I think 
they interviewed two or three people including the person from Auditor 
General which is James Aguma, they recommend him to me to say this 
is the person that we think because these others they don’t come from 
AG, although they have understanding but this one he’s better because 
he has been auditing entities he has been auditing government, we 
catch this fish which we’re looking now which is James Aguma.  When 
James Aguma, Chairperson he took us to three qualifications, three 
qualifications…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   From eight? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: Ja from eight to three 
qualifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that at the end of the financial year in which he 
started? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Audited.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But there Chairperson now I’m 
dealing with the governance issues, those qualifications…[intervenes].      
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no what I’m asking is whether when he came, as 
I understand your evidence the Auditor General had eight qualifications 
20 
in terms of it’s audit of the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:      Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And then he came, that is Mr Aguma and he came at 
a time when there were eight qualifications and you say that he took 
SABC to three qualifications. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 54 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question is whether he achieved that in his 
first financial year or over a certain number of financial years? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In his first, if I remember 
correctly Chairperson because I demonstrated there, you’ll see the 
financials in that – in my affidavit attachment so in the first year he 
improved the governance issues from qualifications, eight qualifications 
to three qualifications.  When I left the SABC Chairperson in 2016 we 
were having one qualification, audited by Auditor General, one 
qualification and Chairperson you know it was a technicality because of 
10 
this agreement between the team at the SABC and that caused that 
qualification.  If they agree, and at that time Chairperson, remember in 
2015 and 2016 I was not there at the SABC because sometimes I was 
on special leave because of the Court matters and so on and so on but 
it was one qualification Chairperson.  When the Board came, the 
interim Board they went back to this thing.  So you ask a question 
Chairperson, how can you find one qualification and you went back to a 
disclaimer or adverse opinion Chairperson, I’m just now trying to find 
exactly – or adverse…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja just contrasting…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes opinion Chairperson, that 
is a problem there and in my view Chairperson, and what I’ve been 
informed because when the interim Board came they said no we are 
going to clean up the organisation.  We are going to implement the ad 
hoc committee recommendation but even if you want to act on that, you 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 55 of 169 
 
must take time to understand the business of the SABC because 
Auditor General, Chairperson, remember it’s a test, they test, if they go 
to this one, this one gives you this story and that one you are going to 
cause that havoc that they have already caused themselves because I 
think they didn’t recognise management, because I was not there 
Chairperson, I don’t think they – they didn’t recognise management so 
they caused a disclaimer themselves, they also get rid of the 
consultant, people who were taken to fix all this governance issues 
because they were saying it’s irregular but you should look at the 
rationale and the process that have been followed Chairperson.  So 
10 
they came with the guns blazing from Ad Hoc Committee Chairperson.  
That is the issue Chairperson that I can say that when I left SABC I’m 
very proud, I’m very proud about the previous Board, I’m very proud 
about the SABC management because we achieved what we were 
supposed to achieve although we have that one qualification.  When it 
comes to the financials, Chairperson, because it goes hand-in hand, 
when it comes to the financials I have demonstrated in my time we talk 
about billion audited financials by Auditor Generals Chairperson, 
consistency show.  Now people are saying Hlaudi caused havoc for 
SABC, SABC is collapsing because of local content.  Chairperson how 
20 
can SABC collapse on local content when we are budgeted R600million 
for local content, there was a budget.  If there was no budget and then 
I went and take funds from another department, division or reserves, 
maybe they will have a point but there was a budget, R600million to 
invest in local content, Chairperson and when I left SABC Chairperson, 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 56 of 169 
 
cash R881million is there in those financials of the SABC Chairperson. 
R881million but they didn’t know how to deal with these issues because 
I left SABC, R881million but Chairperson along the way you will find 
that maybe they were having maybe R500million or R400million in the 
bank, but you should know if you have that amount  what steps should 
you take to cover and that step Chairperson  is there in that document 
of Aguma, where the said I tried to raise R100million to top-up the 
amount because the service division they could not achieve R600million 
because to run SABC Chairperson you only need R600million 
operationally to pay your service providers and do other stuff.  If you 
10 
have R600million you are fine Chairperson.  So if you have R800million 
audited financials, you are more than good, you also have to make sure 
that, 
that circle, you 
generate revenue. 
 The 
problem 
there 
Chairperson, is the how, the how is very important Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair.  The document that 
you’re referring Chair that shows – although this one is a copy which 
doesn’t seem to be signed by the Auditor General but it’s page 264, 
that’s where it shows the qualified/unqualified disclaimers that he’s 
talking to be we are souring the original.    
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to remind you that I interrupted you at a 
certain stage when you appeared to still want to ask some questions or 
draw attention to certain parts of the minutes of the Board that have 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 57 of 169 
 
those various amounts.     
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So just in case as a result of my interruption you 
have forgotten that there was something that you still wanted to cover.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes Chair, there was also something that 
Mr Motsoeneng spoke about which – when he mentioned deviation 
insofar as the vision view is concerned. Chair that document Chair we’ll 
find it at pages – under HM7, this is the page 173 and it’s written by 
the Group Company Secretary and it says, 
 
“From the certified extract of the successful round robin 
10 
 
approval concluded on 31 July 2015 to approve a deviation 
 
from procurement processes to acquire a multi-purpose set 
 
and studio business case.  Resolve that approval be and is 
 
hereby given for the SABC sport and news divisions to deviate 
 
from normal procurement processes in order to appoint vision 
 
view for the construction of a multi-purpose set and studio 
 
including all technical components to service the SABC sport 
 
and news division at an amount of R39 380 000 exclusive of 
 
VAT.  The head of sport and GE technology [indistinct] 
 
mandated to conclude and sign all contract documentation 
20 
 
outlined in resolution one above on behalf of the SABC.  
 
Certified a true extract of the minute”, 
 
So when you’re talking – when you mentioned a deviation of a 
R39 million project. 
  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.      
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 58 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:       Yes and that deviation was it - was 
sent to Treasury for approval? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I’m not sure Chairperson as 
the COO my role is to oversee the organisation, the Group Executive or 
the heads of the divisions those are the people including – especially 
because if you talk about Treasury is the role of the CFO, it’s the role 
of the CFO to make sure that…[intervenes].     
CHAIRPERSON:   Processes are followed?     
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes but my knowledge, 
Chairperson on this matter, I think it’s during that time there were no 
10 
regulations for SABC to ask permission from Treasury, I’m talking under 
correction but that is my memory Chairperson, I know that regulations 
came…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At some stage.     
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    At a certain stage and there 
was some debate it but my memories Chairperson, I think the person 
who can confirm that is the former CFO whether they did receive such 
document or head of procurement.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you and then the one last aspect 
20 
when I put the reasons amounting to irregular expenditure the one thing 
that you have not addressed now is the irregular increments and 
appointments of certain staff officials and they were mentioned – I think 
the Public Protector also dealt with those Ms Gugu Duda and your own 
salary increments according to the Public Protector and I know Dr 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 59 of 169 
 
Ngubane had dealt with that – I’m sorry not Dr Ngubane, Ms Mohkobo 
had dealt with those salary adjustments relating to you, could you just 
briefly tell the Chair about that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, you know I have 
pain about this malicious gathering of information because it is 
incorrect that I appointed people irregular so.  Chairperson, the 
custodian of appointments is HR, it’s Human Resource so there is no 
way that Hlaudi can wake up in the morning and appoint someone even 
if I want to do that the HR will say, no.  If I have appointed someone 
that someone will be a process of HR not my process Chairperson 
10 
because they are the gatekeeper for such matters within the SABC but  
I have demonstrated there Chairperson, you will see that I didn’t 
appoint those people proof is there, who signed, maybe salary 
increments and appointments you’ll see that the former GCO Melua 
Mamagobo and the HR together they are the ones who dealt with that 
issue.  Example Chairperson my PA, I was not involved it is an HR 
issue, they said to me that after effects, and I was told by my PA to say 
I have been given salary increment but I knew about the process 
because they were saying three directors their PA they should be on 
par, you can’t have – because we’re all directors you can’t have 
20 
someone sitting in that level when it comes to  package someone sitting 
in that level but that one also can be also informed by the by team of 
individuals because if you have been there for too long it’s obvious that 
you’ll have a more package than someone who just joined that division 
Chairperson.  So in that Chairperson, especially from the Public 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 60 of 169 
 
Protector you are given Chairperson, I respond I have given to say I 
was not involved.  The SABC has given to say he was not involved the 
evidence is there Chairperson I have put evidence there.  Example 
Chairperson there is resolution, the resolution says one of the 
employee he shall be removed in the corporate plan because her 
position really is not there.  So it’s the resolution of the Board but the 
findings of the Public Protector is Hlaudi and the notion that has been 
given to people Chairperson is that it seems as if there was no Board at 
the SABC, I was the Board because it seems as if everything I was 
doing everything…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you not the Board and were you not the SABC?     
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes I was not Chairperson I 
also, if you check Chairperson you have a Board which I must 
accounted to the Board, they are the people…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  What I’m saying in a light note.  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair, thank you Chair so 
for me even media Chairperson there were people who were portraying 
me, you ask yourself, you have Dr Ngubane – I’m just you now about 
people that I think, you have Dr Ngubane, you have Professors there 
Chairperson and many -  you have lawyers, are these people stupid just 
20 
to be taken by this [indistinct] and though whatever, it can’t be 
Chairperson.  I mean because when you appoint these people they 
must know what they’re supposed to do.  So to be honest to portray as 
SABC the decisions of the SABC, this Hlaudi I think it is malicious 
Chairperson and it is wrong for people to taint my name and also I don’t 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 61 of 169 
 
think those people who were in charge for SABC Board they are 
respected, in my view because it seems as there was no Board, there 
was no GCO, there was no management general, the only person was 
Hlaudi, it was my company I think Chairperson, according to people 
which is misleading Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well it’s important that you deal with it because I 
did ask some of the witnesses from SABC what it is – what it was about 
you that seems to have made people or many people to feel like they 
had to do whatever you said should be done, you know, where did this 
kind of influence come from or if it was fear, where was it coming from 
10 
what was the basis for it, so I’m saying it’s good that you deal with it 
because I do want to understand that and maybe I’m not been told the 
whole story but we are not done with other witnesses so maybe one will 
establish whether that impression and that perception has a factual 
basis or not. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:       Chairperson one interesting 
story, when I was in the Free State I think I was acting as regional 
Editor, the unions they didn’t want me Chairperson, it’s well written 
media and so on.  One day they drove to Bloemfontein because 
according to them, they were workers they were going to be at Court 
20 
and toi toi because they don’t want me at the SABC.  When they drove 
and reached at the SABC they’re expecting that – the leaders of the 
unions they are expecting the workers to be outside toi toing.   
 
What surprised them when they arrived the union says no we 
support Hlaudi.  We are not going to do that.  And when I ask them 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 62 of 169 
 
someone said to them, no tomorrow we are going to strike, a blackout 
on the SABC because this man is torturing us.  And then I met this 
man.  I said but why you are saying I am torturing people?  Can we 
maybe discuss so that we resolved our issues.  The man says to me, I 
always dream about you when I am in bed I am sleeping.  So 
Chairperson how do you deal with such issues?  So in view Chairperson 
I am not a psychologist I said maybe you must dream during the day.  
Because you can see, you can feel it, you can see me.  Chairperson 
because that dream of his caused all this chaos not row row 
Chairperson now I am using this chaos Chairperson cause all this 
10 
chaos.  And people came there and then I take him through and then we 
talk Chairperson to understand what – what is happening.  Is mind no it 
was just they say dreaming.  I said you know Chairperson on the light 
note… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively he was saying you visit him in his 
dreams? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  So in his 
dream it was reality that any time I am going to dismiss him.  Yes it was 
his reality Chairperson and only one person.  But Chairperson all those 
people they were shocked. Because instead of people toyi toyi they 
20 
were singing about me.  So that is the – I do not know Chairperson it 
has been happening.  I remember someone wrote an email saying no 
Hlaudi is the Commissioner of the Police.  Because they were saying 
why can Hlaudi not be arrested.  And I do not know for what.  The man 
wrote an email to say no you know Hlaudi controls the Commissioner of 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 63 of 169 
 
the Police.  I do not even know this commissioner Chairperson.  I have 
never met the Commissioner.  So I do not know what is happening when 
it comes to me Chairperson how other people view me.  I do not know.  
Maybe it is their – all of them they are dreaming.  Maybe including 
media they dream and then they write about me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am just giving you the 
background Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of the… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is why Chairperson it is 
10 
very important to go inside the SABC. It is very important Chairperson 
that I play that clip Chairperson because it is not – it is not 25 minutes.  
I think roughly it can two clips Chairperson that I can appeal that we 
must play.  Others we can leave.  One clip I think it is one minute.  Plus 
or two minutes.  One is I think more than five minutes. If I am correct.  
And I know your team Chairperson they have already packaged that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Those are very critical clips 
Chairperson because you will see inside the SABC because people who 
are coming here they do not represent more than 3000 people within 
20 
the SABC Chairperson.  So I think it is very important Chairpersson to 
apply your mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And see so that you are able. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 64 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To deal with the issues 
Chairperson. I will be happy that we play that clip Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And not behind the scene 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because people came here put 
me as a devil so it must be played publicly so that people can see what 
was happening within the SABC Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, No that is fine.  We – as you will remember 
10 
from yesterday we decided that I will not make any decision now but 
later on in due course your counsel will look at the whole thing and if 
need be renew the application and then we can deal with it. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Mr Motsoeneng we 
now at the tail end of your statement.  We had already dealt with the 
issues relating to the matric certificate but Chair just for the record an 
affidavit that is mentioned in the SCA judgment case number 393/2015 
where it was between the – in the matter of the SABC and the 
20 
Democratic Alliance.  In the judgment at paragraph 24 the court stated 
the following: 
“In his answering affidavit Mr Motsoeneng stated that 
I have been unable to trace Swanepoel again.  But it 
would seem that she did depose to an affidavit in 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 65 of 169 
 
which she disputes this version.  That affidavit for 
some inexplicable reason does not form part of the 
appeal record.” 
We managed Chair to look for this affidavit and it only came to hand 
yesterday and we have given it to Mr Motsoeneng’s team and they have 
requested that they be afforded an opportunity to deal with it in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair then – then we will then skip that 
part that deals with – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – I did say I think yesterday  
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was it the day before that it would be important 
that if possible Ms Swanepoel be secured to come and give evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If possible and in particular I am – I was looking at 
the interaction between herself – between her and Mr Motsoeneng at 
the time of the completion of the application for employment form.  That 
discussion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now do you know whether the affidavit does deal with 
20 
that or you do not know? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair it does deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does?  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But also Chair if I may just report.  The 
investigators had been reliably informed that Ms Swanepoel has since 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 66 of 169 
 
passed on but we requested them to check with the Department of 
Home Affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I just hope it maybe it is just a rumour.  I 
do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So then we will – with your leave Chair 
then not go back to that issue and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so that affidavit will… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Deals – it relates… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will not be dealt with today but will be dealt with 
some other time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Some other time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr Motsoeneng comes back. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair because he has requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He must still get a chance to look at that affidavit. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To look at it and deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  May I just – Thank you Chair.  
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 67 of 169 
 
And then Mr Motsoeneng then that takes us to the end then of your – of 
your – of your main affidavit and the supplementary affidavit as 
indicated does not deal with the specific allegations that were made by 
the various witnesses against you and Chair had directed that you 
could supplement that and deal with the various allegations from the 
various witnesses.   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  If I may Chariperson 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Just to deal with one part 
Chairperson because we are finalising the first affidavit Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Just to summarise some of the 
issues.  The Advocate put a question to me whether I was stopping the 
journalists to fulfil the mandate of the SABC by saying they shall not 
show those visuals. Chairperson my submission to you Chairperson is 
because the question was our mandate – our mandate is in the public 
interest.  I want to submit that Chairperson.  What the journalists they 
were fighting for it was not in the public interest.  One point 
20 
Chairperson is the issue of research.  Remember the Advocate put to 
me that I said I do not believe in research which I said… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe before you get to the research let us just 
talk a little bit about the first part that you have dealt with.  My 
understanding of what you are saying against the background of the – 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 68 of 169 
 
your evidence yesterday is that you are dealing with what you view as a 
difference of opinion between yourself and those journalists where their 
stance was we believe that you are banning us from showing visuals of 
destruction of property during protests.  We believe we should show 
that and it is wrong that we should be prevented from doing that.  And 
my understanding is what you are saying is they were wrong to say that 
or to take that stance because the mandate of the SABC is to show 
what is in the public interest.  Is my understanding of what you are 
saying correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But also not forgetting 
Chairperson we agreed that those visuals certain part of the visuals we 
did not ban those visuals.  We were just saying that the physicality of 
those visuals Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well you now I just want to make sure that there 
is no misunderstanding as to what your position was and what their 
position was.  And my understanding from the discussion we had and I 
think you put it as an agreement between us was that at least before 
this commission what you have said is that you did not intend to say 
20 
SABC must no longer show visuals of destruction of property during 
protests perse.  My understanding is that you said your position was 
you did not want to – you did not want the SABC to show visuals in 
certain circumstances.  One was we talked about somebody being burnt 
when they come out of a burning building and the other one is where 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 69 of 169 
 
people said to SABC journalists we are going to burn property come 
and take – take pictures of whatever.  Now – now – and I said to you at 
some stage yesterday somebody may in due course say to me reject 
what Mr Motsoeneng said to you namely that he did not intend to ban 
the showing of visuals of the destruction of property.  That cannot be 
true because when you look at the statement that he issued the 
language is clear and he understood this language.  He is now just 
trying something else.  Remember I said somebody might argue that 
and I gave you an opportunity to deal with that.  So now coming back 
then to this issue.  I do not understand why you would have conveyed 
10 
to them the position that the showing of those visuals was not in the 
public interest if your intention was not to ban the showing of visuals 
perse.  You understand? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I understand you correctly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And Chairperson why I am 
saying this I think what you are saying is correct but when you put a 
lawyer Chairperson I must argue as a lawyer and my argument is the 
20 
mandate of the SABC is to educate.  You cannot educate by showing 
this glamourizing – this visuals Chairperson.  Currently Chairperson the 
same visuals that we are talking about you know someone has taken 
her life abroad because this individual and the family – you see there 
television is very dangerous Chairperson.  If you watch people who are 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 70 of 169 
 
fighting every day Chairperson.  I mean people who are fighting on 
television when the kids this are their role model.  When you show 
those visuals fighting it is even happening Chairperson if you will check 
these movies the children that are watching those movies the guns they 
play with the guns.  They want the guns.  Even if it is a toy because 
they see this on television.  People shooting each other what do they 
do they get a gun maybe from counsel he is having a gun they are 
playing they shoot. Chairperson this matter it is a very serious matter.  
I want to submit that Chairperson that we should not allow media to 
operate outside the mandate of a public broadcaster Chairperson.  I 
10 
think Chairperson this one Chairperson we – remember Chairperson I 
am still putting to you Chairperson that I am in agreement with you I 
did not ban those visuals as it is but if it comes to the law Chairperson 
this one I will submit that actually we are encouraging – we are 
encouraging unlawful stuff.  Chairperson if I argue like a lawyer the 
way Chairperson and I am not a lawyer Chairperson I am just saying 
you will decide Chairperson.  I am just putting my views. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On this matter because I have 
passion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson about such issues.  
And Chairperson you ask the journalists about newspapers. They said it 
is international norm to broadcaster to talk about newspapers on their 
platforms.  I want to submit to you Chairperson this broadcasting act 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 71 of 169 
 
says everything that we do it must be in the South African interest even 
the opinions of the South Africans.  So the argument about 
international is not correct.  Chairperson.  That is why Chairperson I 
think there is difference between private media and a public 
broadcaster.  Because the way we do things ours is to build democracy.  
Ours is to build the nation.  Ours is to do the correct stuff Chairperson 
and develop people.  So we cannot Chairperson argue because it is a 
norm.  I accept.  It is a norm that people have been doing the things 
the way they have been doing.  This is the time Chairperson for people 
to think differently so.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now – but did – did you have a conversation along 
these lines with any of the journalists around the time of the media 
statement following up on your decision the media statement that we 
went through yesterday.  Did you have a discussion along these lines? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson we have been 
discussing these matters at top level.  Just discussion not formal – a 
discussion but in passing we have been engaging.  Even in some of the 
committees but not officially so you cannot find those records but we 
have been discussing these issues and I said yesterday Chairperson if 
people really look the power of media Chairperson people who see 
20 
some people are toyi toyi.  If today Chairperson people can burn 
Gauteng like it is happening tomorrow it is Free State, tomorrow it is 
KwaZulu Natal where it comes from?  The influence is media.  So – and 
we are not saying we shall not show this Chairperson.  Remember I 
submit that we must be responsible Chairperson.  Important point 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 72 of 169 
 
Chairperson I said yesterday Nothando Maseko the Head of television 
and Sophi Mokwena they came to me after the statement concerned 
Chairperson.  Like maybe other people who were concerned but many 
people also Chairperson they march to SABC in my support.  Equally so 
there were those who have their own different views about the matter 
but we should not ignore the [indistinct] and other people they were 
supporting that move Chairperson.  But Chairperson what we did after 
Sophie… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now is that – is that the move to say do not show 
visuals of people burning property during protests, what is that move 
10 
that you say they were in support of? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They were in support 
Chairperson of not showing such visuals.  Others they were not in 
support.  This is what I am submitting Chairperson.  Others they were – 
which is normal Chairperson.  Others they were not in support.  But 
after this two colleagues of mine came to me Chairperson I think we 
call Kaizer Kganyago who is the spokesperson of the SABC.  I said 
Kganyago.  No he was also party because they were two and then we 
just discuss and give my own view what I am saying it should not be 
shown.  And then we ask Kaizer to go and clarify the issue.  I was 
20 
informed yesterday Chairperson by Nothando Maseko that Kaizer went 
on air and clarify the issue.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understand it based on what you told him and 
what you were told he conveyed to the public.  Were you told that he 
clarified it on the basis that the decision was not to ban the showing of 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 73 of 169 
 
visuals of violent protest and the destruction of property but for SABC 
journalists not to be party to anything where people plan to commit a 
crime by burning property and them agreeing to go there and show 
those people?  What are – how – what – how was the clarification?  
What was the clarification or to what effect was it? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The clarification Chairperson 
was Kaizer shall go and explain that we are not banning visuals totally 
so.  We are saying journalists will be responsible but also the 
physicality Chairperson – I mean like I did example if someone come 
and burn this we are inside do not show such visuals Chairperson. If 
10 
you are going to show that visuals make sure that there are no people 
inside the room.  Yes Chairperson I am just giving you one of the 
examples Chairperson.  I said Chairperson to make sure that we dealt 
with that issue I went to Press Club I explain the same issue that 
Kaizer has explained to the public Chairperson.  Chairperson the relief 
that I am seeking to you if I talk the legal term Chairperson the relief 
that I am seeking to you if you find that I was wrong on the public 
mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is the first relief Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  If you find me I was wrong on 
that one the second relief… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see you – you have had quite a lot to deal with 
lawyers so you understand some of the legal language. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 74 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes the second relief 
Chairperson I am saying to you Chairperson you shall agree with me 
that after that statement we clarify issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but of course you do remember that yesterday I 
read to you a part of the Editorial Policy of the SABC where the – it 
was made clear that the policy of the SABC is to show visuals of 
violence if certain conditions were met which was set out.  I think it 
was if it was too show legitimate information or context.  You remember 
you initially thought that that was in conflict with the requirement that 
scenes of violence should not be shown –should not be shown if that 
10 
would be glamourizing the violence.  And I said to you it might not 
necessarily mean that the two are in conflict.  They might be going the 
same route, same direction but one might be going further than the 
other, you remember that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so in looking at what the policy of the SABC was 
one must look at the – at all the relevant instruments you know and 
then take it from there but certainly you have that.  But you also will 
remember that I asked you the question yesterday what your 
understanding was of conduct that can be said to amount to 
20 
glamourizing violence. Where does one draw the line?  And you dealt 
with that.  Because obviously the policies permit the showing of visuals 
of violence but they seem to have qualifications to say you may do it 
under these circumstances.  The one refers to not promoting violence, 
not glamourizing violence or anything – any unlawful conduct. The 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 75 of 169 
 
other one says in relation to scenes of violence SABC’s policy is to 
show them if that is – if that is required in order to show legitimate 
information or context.  You remember we dealt with that. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson I remember 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You – Chairperson what I am 
appealing to you Chair you know I am not going to dwell on the law 
because I am not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is not my specialist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am dealing with the way I 
understand the things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You will come to that conclusion 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But my view Chairperson I will 
submit that the policy of the SABC it must be guided by the Regulations 
20 
of the Act and also Chairperson what we dealt with it was the 
regulations dealing with ICASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes one must look at … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And then if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of those ja. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 76 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes in one – in this book there 
is also same matters dealing with the same matter that we are dealing 
with.  You will not find anywhere Chairperson in this Act I call it the 
Bible of the Broadcasting which is SABC.  It is the bible of the SABC.  
You 
will 
never 
find 
Chairperson 
where 
the 
act 
encourages 
thatCHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I can tell you where this 
policy is informed Chairperson.  It is informed by private media. Yes 
people do a policy Chairperson it is informed by some of the parts of 
the influence.  It is not informed by what is here Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But although Chairperson I 
agreed some of people actually they want to see such visuals. Some of 
the people. This is where I am saying Chairperson if we deal I agree 
with you what you have been raising the issue with you but I was just 
saying I follow this.  But also in the – Chairperson even myself I did not 
follow this 100%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  If you look my statement and 
then – because I said you can show such visuals but here they are not 
20 
saying we shall do it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see one of the things which you – you may or 
may not appreciate.  You remember yesterday I pointed out to you at 
least one or two distinctions between legislation and policy.  You see 
an act of parliament will be broader and then it will say regulations can 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 77 of 169 
 
be made under that act.  The regulations are made in order to take 
further some of the things that are in the act to go into more details.  
And when you come to a policy it – it is supposed to be in line with the 
regulations and in line with the acts and in line with the constitution but 
it might go to even greater detail than the act and the regulation.   
So you could easily find that it says something that is the 
policy which you will not find in the Act provided it can be said that the 
Act does not preclude it.  Does not say we should not have this.  It is 
open but that is something that - so I am just mentioning that we - we 
do not necessarily need to dwell on it.  Yes.

MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:

take 
your 
word 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you very much. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair just to - information has just come 
now through Ms - Chair that the rumour about Ms Swanepoel apparently 
20 
is incorrect.  They - they have been to Home Affairs and it appears that 
she is alive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So the - the investigators are going 
to - to pursue that line.  Thank you. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 78 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is - it is unfortunate they mentioned something 
like that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because - well maybe it is unfortunate that it was 
mentioned publically … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it could have caused you know … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Embarrassment, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Family members and relatives to be concerned.  Oh, 
okay.  No that is fine.  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they will try and make contact with her? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair that is then the evidence on the first 
statement of Mr Motsoeneng and in relation to the … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Second statement that we then will - will 
have to be postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have to be dealt with … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 79 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr Motsoeneng comes back? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Motsoeneng when I asked you questions you 
had dealt with one point but I think you were going to another point.  I 
just do not want to prevent you from saying something on - on 
something that you wanted to say.  You now said before you go further 
let us talk - talk about this and we took quite long.  I just want to make 
sure that you - you are covered. 
You - you are fine or you still want to say something about 
whatever other point you wanted to - to mention. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  The point 
that I want to make is when I dealt with the issue of newspapers when 
the question arose about Chairperson I said I do not believe in 
research because you see I always make examples Chairperson and 
people when they - they talk they - they think that I do not believe in 
research at all. 
There is a portion that I do not believe in.  It is something 
that you know you see.  You cannot do research Chairperson.  I was 
saying example a councillor in a certain ward.  You know people are not 
working there.  You know there is no water there and it is your ward 
20 
and you know how many people are staying there and you know how 
many people are not working. 
Why do you want research?  It is obvious.  You see because I 
want to clarify this issue of that I do not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 80 of 169 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Believe …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In research Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I mean when medical is given to 
you they do a test before they can do - give you that medical but 
something that you see you do not need research Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so - so … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So I want people to understand 
that I - I am not saying I do not believe in research … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are against research? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  At all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, because there are always 
misquoting me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On this issue of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Research Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Other matters Chairperson that 
I was looking to cover I think I will cover … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Those issues when we dealt 
with the - those video clips Chairperson if you allow … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 81 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Those videos to be played. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I will deal with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  If you do not allow them 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I will ask permission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
To 
deal 
with 
the 
issues 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Before we conclude 
Chair … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The representatives of Mr Motsoeneng 
have a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The document to put … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair for the indulgence.  
Remember Chair at the commencement of the proceedings today we 
sought to have directions met in terms of the sitting of the Commission 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 82 of 169 
 
as to how to handle this malicious and misleading … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Reports from the media and we have handled 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  I have drafted something brief … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  (Indistinct) with the process if I can beg 
leave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
10 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  To hand in the same so that we can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  That will assist in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  In the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I - I propose that I will - I will have - I should 
have a look at it and I know that we are going - we are done with 
Mr Motsoeneng for - for now but he will come back at some stage.  
What I do not know is whether you will stay around after we are done 
but I might not be able to have an answer after the break as to what I 
20 
propose after reading it. 
So - but I would let you know at some stage.  If you are not 
around I could send word through the legal team what I propose to do.  
So it may be that I might decide to say something before the end of the 
day.  It may be that I might decide to say something tomorrow.  I am not 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 83 of 169 
 
sure.  Would that be fine with you? 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Chair whilst I take cognisance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  And guidance from you but I believe this is 
imperative … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  And of paramount importance that it be dealt 
with swiftly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Why I says so because … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  It is in terms of Section 5 of the 
Commission’s Act hindering and obstructing the progress of this 
Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Because remember that is why if you see 
Mr Motsoeneng … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  He is now being apprehensive and anxious 
and he keeps on going back to some issues because of … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  The way they are being portrayed in the 
media.  I mean he is human. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Whilst we - we have confidence in you Chair 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 84 of 169 
 
that obviously going to close your ears to what the media is saying 
about him  … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  But he cannot close his ears. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  He cannot close his eyes to that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Because he is human and he is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  The person who is affected by these 
10 
malicious reports.  More so particular from the Daily Maverick … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Chair.  That issue needs to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  We are not saying that we prescribed the 
rights of the media … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  In terms of Section 16 of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  The Constitution Freedom of Expression. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  They have the freedom of expression but 
what now that - what they are doing is that they are now stubbornly 
embarking on conclusions of facts which I believe is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 85 of 169 
 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  It is - it is hinders the project - the - I mean 
the process of the Commission but I stand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Guided by you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I was saying what I was saying because I 
have not read the … 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The document you have drafted.  It may be that when 
I have read it I feel that I am able to do something immediately.  It may 
be that after I have read it I feel that maybe certain things must be 
10 
checked before I can say anything and therefore whatever I might do 
might delay until those things have been checked.  So that is the only 
reason - reason I was saying well maybe I might be able to deal with it 
immediately maybe later in the day maybe tomorrow morning. 
So that is the only - but I - I understand that you - you have 
said it - it is something that you would if possible like to be dealt with 
urgently.  I have heard that.  So I will look at it.  I just do not want to 
promise you anything before I read here. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  True Chair.  Can I then pray to you Chair 
that if we can after tea just - I am not trying to put you under pressure 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  To deal with this issue … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  To sort of briefly address you still on this 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 86 of 169 
 
aspect … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Before you can make a conclusive on this 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No let us - let us do that then when we 
come back from tea. 
MR MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am about to excuse Mr Motsoeneng. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Motsoeneng thank you very much for coming to 
give evidence to the Commission and to share your experiences at 
SABC as you have done.  The arrangements are that you have not dealt 
with everything that you should deal with.  Arrangements will be made 
for you to come back and deal with matters that you have not dealt with 
today and in the interim whatever documents or information that we 
have talked about over the past two and a half days that might not be 
20 
at hand which is important for the Commission you will assist in 
whatever way to make sure it can be found. 
I do remember that I think you were referred to some minutes 
of board meetings yesterday and you will give information to the legal 
team of the Commission so that they can approach the SAB with a view 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 87 of 169 
 
to finding that information and any other information that maybe 
relevant.  Thank you very much. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am ready Chairperson to 
assist the Commission.  I am also ready Chairperson to welcome your 
findings at the end of the matter because this is the first time 
Chairperson where I was treated fairly with respect.  Even your team 
Chairperson because you do investigation you do not come to 
10 
conclusion before the investigation that the person is guilty like the SIU 
is doing Chairperson and I want to emphasise Chairperson the reason 
why they write me that letter is because they were aware that I was 
going to be called by the Commission. 
They have come to the conclusion not doing the investigation.  
I am in court but they themselves Chairperson they did not follow the 
process.  They abused the process of the SIU Chairperson.  I think it is 
a serious matter from where I am sitting Chairperson and I want to 
appeal to the Commission Chairperson because if you are going to deal 
with all this problems you cannot leave SIU outside especially when 
20 
you have evidence in front saying but this man that you have taken to 
court he is not part of this. 
Here is the affidavit.  This people they recuse themselves.  
The same with the former Public Protector because no one is above the 
law Chairperson.  I will appeal Chairperson they must come in this 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 88 of 169 
 
Commission and deal with these issues that why did they mislead 
people.  Why they are abusing the power when the facts are there 
Chairperson?  Thank you very much Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Motsoeneng and you are 
excused for now.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May we take the tea …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are a few minutes before quarter past but I think 
we can take the tea break now … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Now until … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And resume at half past as normal? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will take the tea break now and we will 
resume at half past 11. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman we need to deal with the request from Mr 
20 
Motsoeneng’s counsel. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The time that I have had is just not enough 
...[intervenes] 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Me too Chair. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 89 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To look at this number one, number two I was not 
asking for drafting what I would say, I was asking for what the 
complaint is and what the factual basis of the complaint is, who said 
what and what the position is and what the complaint is about that, so 
that I could see and make up my own mind whether I needed to do 
something and if so what it is that would be appropriate, so I might not 
have made myself clear. 
 
So – but you wanted to say something before I hear Mr 
Motsoeneng’s counsel. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair I have not had time at all to 
10 
consider it and also because the complaint itself relates to certain 
media articles, which are not attached to that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Now it’s difficult to look into the context 
and appreciate where the complaint actually arises from, for that 
reason Chair I would suggest it’s really a matter that should be dealt 
with at some other time now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair or the indulgence, I feel a 
20 
bit constrained with this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  You know why Chair I feel a bit constrained 
about this because remember – because I went through the rules and I 
also went through the Commissions Act because these are the 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 90 of 169 
 
empowering provisions in the determination of issues before this 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:   The Act, Section five gives provision of 
what happens if there is a hindrance or obstruction of the process of 
the Commission.  I think at the time when the Act was [indistinct] they 
did not envisage where newspapers and media can actually obstruct the 
work of the Commission by misleading a negative stories about the 
work of the Commission and that’s one of the issues which is also – if 
you look at the rules it’s absent how do we deal with such an issue. So 
10 
it’s either we do such an issue either in terms or Rule 11 where 
substantive application can be made with the Commission on a notice 
of motion with the facts and the disputed facts and the attachments like 
what Miss Norman is alluding to or we can deal with it in terms of Rule 
12, where you as the Chair can give directions as to how – if such an 
issue arises how do we deal with it.  Like I said Chair, I’m in your 
hands because we don’t want to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’ll tell you what, I mean at the moment it’s just a 
question of not having enough time to look at this, I have had a look 
but I haven’t finished looking at it but I have made – some of the 
20 
observations that I’ve mentioned.  I think the one wherein which it can 
be dealt with is that I will have no problem if Mr Motsoeneng wishes to 
issue a media statement that clarifies whatever it is that the media 
might have misunderstood from his part, just so that from the point of 
view of the public he’s able to point out if the media is saying things 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 91 of 169 
 
about him that are not true or do not reflect accurately what he has 
testified in the Commission.  Now if he does that it may be that there 
might be no need for the Commission to do anything itself but it may 
well be that the Commission might decide that, that notwithstanding it 
will do something but it would help to balance the interest because his 
interest and the Commission’s interest because I’m not going to issue 
anything or say anything until I have got all the facts properly and the 
concern now is simply that I don’t seem to have everything that I need.  
So the one option or now is simply that you – to the extent that this 
document you gave me might not have addressed this and I can’t say 
10 
that it doesn’t because I didn’t finish reading it.  To the extent that it 
might not address what I’m looking for, you could later on send a 
document that addresses what I’m looking for.  What I’m looking for is,  
a document that says A, B and C did the following on that day in that 
media or whatever, this was wrong because of A, B, C, D and it – I 
would like the Commission to do A, B, C, D about it so I can see what 
was – what is said to have been done, what the basis of the concern is 
and then I can then take it from there.  So  that’s what I’m looking for, 
at this stage I’m not looking at it as being a substantive application 
necessarily, I just want a document, whether it’s in the form of  a note, 
20 
a memo or a letter but something that will give me a full picture so that 
if I make any – if I say anything I know that I say it from an informed 
position. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair, if you look at the brief 
submissions I’ve made we’ve alluded to that. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 92 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  We’ve identified the media houses, the 
Daily Maverick, the reporter is Marianne Thamm, we’ve identified the 
issues the article and even have a footnote and which date that Act was 
been accessed which was today and we’ve even just quoted some of 
the issues in the article to assist.  What we did not do was to print the 
article but we just thought since we’ve given proof where the article is 
accessible online that can be done and in terms of paragraph 16 we 
then request what we intend the Commission to do with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  If you feel that is not enough to 
substantiate the complaint or the submissions before this inquiry we 
are prepared to argument or supplement that and then on the 
issue…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine as I said I haven’t read the whole  of it 
so if you  - if you think that once I’ve had a chance to read the whole 
document I should be able to find everything that I’m looking for, that’s 
fine and I’m quite happy that if, once I’ve had a chance to read the 
whole document, if I feel that I need some more information then the 
Commission will communicate with you and then you can supplement 
20 
that. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair and then on this second  
issue which you suggested from the onset that whether Mr Motsoeneng 
should give a media statement, whilst it’s a noble idea but we have 
challenges with that because every time the newspapers report 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 93 of 169 
 
something negative about him, then he always has to issue a media 
statement and remember with, already the current narrative against Mr 
Motsoeneng which media is going to give him that platform or the time 
to do that.  So it becomes a piecemeal fashion that whenever 
something is – that’s why I’m saying we need an all encompassing 
direction not only directed at the Daily Maverick but directed at all 
newspapers, we’re not saying we’re gagging them we don’t want to gag 
them, all we are saying is that let there be responsible reporting.  
Remember there was the issue of the [indistinct] business school where 
a lot of media also misconstrued what has happened before this 
10 
Commission.  We cannot keep on going at that rate because it really 
does not all go well for the work and the task at hand of the 
Commission that’s why we’re saying that the order is not only directed 
at the Daily Maverick but it is directed at all media practitioners to 
ensure that – we’re not saying they shouldn’t report about the work of 
the Commission because it is best that they actually report but let them 
not make conclusion, like the conclusion that the Daily Maverick has 
made that Mr Motsoeneng made a ruining of the financials of the SABC 
to 3.2billion which is not true, so, I mean I don’t want to ventilate 
further issues but I’m just giving some – a few highlights just to assist. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see I am presently not contemplating issuing 
directions as such, I’m contemplating saying something to the media if 
a proper case is made out but if one is talking about issuing directions 
that is when it may be necessary to look at a substantive application 
and so on, so let me have a chance to read it and then you will be 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 94 of 169 
 
informed in one way or another whether I need anything further before 
one can take it further but as I say it’s up to Mr Motsoeneng what I 
sought address by way of that suggestion is where he feels that 
something needs to be put out in the public domain without delay that 
corrects whatever the media might have said, that which is not correct 
and I’m saying at this stage, until I’ve read this properly and applied 
my mind I can’t promise that I can do – we can do that within the time 
he has in mind.  So that was – it was meant to address that but if he 
says, look we will wait as soon as the Commission indicates whether it 
will be able to do something or it wants further information, we will 
10 
cooperate, that’s fine. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Okay I think we’ll wait for [indistinct] Chair 
thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright thank you.  Miss Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you Chair, the next witness 
Chair is Mr Lawrence Roy Kruger, Chair that will be in Exhibit CC20,

please, there is a file in front of you marked CC20 to 24 on the spine, 
and if you turn to page one of that file that is a statement from you, is 
that correct? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:    That’s correct ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you and then if you turn to page 
20 
13. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Is that your signature that appears on 
there? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   That is ja. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 96 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And that you signed that statement on the 
21 s t of August 2019? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    And that the contents of this statement 
are true and correct? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   True. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, is it correct that you were 
approached by the investigators of the Commission to deal with your 
engagements on the migration project between the SABC and the 
Department of Communications? 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Were you involved in that project? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   I was ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, but before we continue, 
you had asked me that you would like to have an opening statement 
about what you do and how does that tally with your statement? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   May he then be allowed Chair to do that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Thank you, my name is Roy Kruger 
20 
I’ve been working in the telecommunications and broadcasting industry 
for more than 40 years.  I’ve worked for big companies like Dimension 
Data, Business Connection in countries like Nigeria, Uganda, Malawi, 
Sirrea Leone and I’m currently based in Maputo where I’m the project 
manager for rolling out the exact same project we’ve done in – trying to 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 97 of 169 
 
do in South Africa with the broadcasting digital migration.  They’ve 
currently been going for 18 months, I can’t reveal all their information 
but suffice to say that the project will be completed by December, it 
took two years.  In South Africa I’m not sure of the exact start date but 
is was something around 2004/2005 and until today it’s still not 
complete for one simple fact.  Now besides the policies, I’m talking as 
an engineer and I don’t know what the politics is behind this but in my 
opinion there’s one simple fact why we’re not complete and that is a 
system called set top box control.  Now in the broadcasting world there 
is no such term as set top box control, it is something that was put 
10 
together in South Africa.  The actual equipment used to do set top box 
control is called a conditional access system.  In simple terms it’s a 
computer with a lot of software and a lot of capabilities, you can either 
implement some of them or all of them.   In January 2012 I approached 
a personnel company to find employment and I was directed to the 
Department of Communications and through an interviewing process I 
was appointed as the technical advisor to the then Minister, Dina Pule 
as a technical advisor on the broadcasting and on their data side, on 
the broadband side and soon after I’d started, within two or three 
weeks I’d gone through a lot of documents to make myself au feit with 
20 
what’s happening.  I found that the SABC had been out on a tender, an 
open tender to request a conditional access system which, as I say in 
South Africa they termed it a set top box control system and they hadn’t 
appointed anybody because it seemed to be – it was a bit of infighting 
on who would pay for this thing, would it be the private broadcaster 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 98 of 169 
 
such as E-TV and Multichoice and the SABC or would it just be the 
SABC.  So the tender wasn’t adjudicated but on further investigation in 
my tasks I came across SENTECH which is the government’s signal 
distributor for TV and broadcasting radio signals and I found that they 
already had a conditional access system in place.  They had engineers 
trained on the system, they had the product up and running and the 
reason they had it was that, from my readings is that two or three years 
prior to that SENTECH had been sending out signals via satellite totally 
unencrypted, which meant that citizens, for example in Botswana were 
buying set top box that you want, a set top box is a decoder that you 
10 
use to receive the signals and in Botswana they were watching SABC1, 
2, 3 and E-TV for, in inverted commas, for free.  The Botswana 
Government said this can’t happen what about our own local 
broadcasting and they took action against SENTECH and from what I 
understand and documents I’ve read, SENTECH lost the case and they 
had to pay a certain amount of money, millions or rand to compensate 
the Botswana Government and they then were instructed to put in a 
conditional access system and fully encrypt all signals which they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, I’m sorry to interrupt you, 
Botswana citizens and residents were watching SABC 1, 2 and 3 for 
20 
free in Botswana for free because SENTECH had done what? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   SENTECH had transmitted the SABC 
1, 2 and 3 TV signals via satellite.  Now when you send a signal via 
satellite it covers a huge geographical area, typically the whole of 
Africa so a number of -  I suppose you can call them entrepreneurs 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 99 of 169 
 
found that listen, we can sell you a set top box and you can pick up 
SABC 1, 2 and 3 for free. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but I thin what I’m looking for is to establish 
whether this was a case where SENTECH had deliberately wanted to 
benefit Botswana citizens in some way, maybe for some fee or whether 
they were simply trying to do what they were required to do in South 
Africa for the South African citizens within the borders of South Africa 
but technologically people in Botswana could actually access the same 
benefits without SENTECH having intended that, that should happen? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   No I don’t think SENTECH 
10 
deliberately intended for them to get the information, I think it was 
maybe, either a lack of money or a lack of knowledge that led 
SENTECH to send the signals without encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   So it was just an open signal which 
meant you could buy set top box off any street market and it would pick 
up the signal because there was no encryption it was an open-ended 
signal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh they would have needed there to be encryption in 
order for the Botswana citizens not to be able to access it? 
20 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alight. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair. Could you just expand 
on that encryption issue because it becomes a bigger issue later 
whether the South African policies as you understood them as a 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 100 of 169 
 
technical advisor at the time, provided for encryption and whether what 
ultimately happened in the end was non-encryption. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   When I joined in…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry before you say so I know that I interrupted you 
while you were on a certain line, so Miss Norman is asking you that 
question now there’s something to stop you on that but to make sure 
that we don’t forget this part, just in case there was still something 
important you wanted me to know, I just want to make sure that you 
don’t forget about that one. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Okay no what I wanted you to know 
10 
Chair is that I’ve got a lot of knowledge in this business and I am based 
in Maputo right now, I’m doing this project similar to here and that our 
– in my opinion the only thing holding up the roll-out of the 
broadcasting digital migration in South Africa, even today is this 
question about encryption and set top box control and even in places 
like Mozambique they use full conditional access, encryption/set top 
box control and I’ll go through some of the reasons why and the 
benefits for South Africa and the citizens of South Africa, that’s all I 
wanted you to know there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then there is the question that Miss Norman put. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, could you then describe 
to the Chairperson the difference between the encryption and the non-
encryption status is happening and the benefits of encryption? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Ja when I joined in 2012 and reading 
the previous documents from round about 2005/2006 the department 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 101 of 169 
 
had actually put out a policy document which required that South Africa 
should have a fully encrypted digital TV network.  Then reading through 
further documents and attending meetings – I’d like to just give you a 
bit of a background, a week after I joined Chair, I went to a 
presentation in Johannesburg where the ITU, the International 
Communication Union, they seem to have a yearly thing, it’s in South 
Africa, just to kind of update people what’s happening in the rest of the 
world and I happened to be sitting next to a guy I didn’t know him and 
he was from Multichoice and the reason I knew this is, he had the 
South African Policy document on his desk and he was sitting listening 
10 
to the chap speaking from the ITU and the next thing he got a phone 
call and the phone call was to update him because right at that moment 
Minister Dina Pule’s group of people who do policy were releasing a 
policy document on that day and this chap got the  phone call and he 
kind of said, listen they haven’t changed it at all set top box control is 
still in here and I wondered who this chappie is.  He turned out he was 
an engineer from Multichoice and I’ll tell you why – if we can just put 
that into the background now it’s going to come up why that’s 
important.  So to get back to the question of encryption and non-
encryption, the reason that networks encrypt their networks is first of 
20 
all is to protect the content.  Now most major movie houses are 
insisting that broadcasters encrypt the content so that you can’t copy 
these things, otherwise your copy rights are infringed and people can 
just take and copy and make and sell products which they’ve copied 
and it’s not their right and what happened is, a number of people took 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 102 of 169 
 
this encryption thing and started putting out stories that when you 
encrypt a system or a network it becomes, not free.  There’s a term 
called free to air channels and free to air, if I can just read you an 
encyclopaedia definition, it’s a very simple definition, what free to air 
means, 
 
“Free to air TV is television transmitted over the air 
 
unencrypted or encrypted without charge for the delivery of the 
 
signal to the viewer”, 
 
That’s what free to air means, it means you and I sitting at 
home we don’t pay for free to air channels but I can tell you now people 
10 
within SABC took this information and started telling, even the 
community TV guys, if the Minister implements encryption, all your 
viewers at home will have to pay, which is a total lie.  Free to air means 
free, the examples of free to air which we have today, first of all 
SABC’s free to air, SABC 1,2 and 3 free to air, totally unencrypted, no 
encryption.  The next free to air channel is the first broadcaster 
appointed in South Africa E-TV, they have a TV company called open 
view which broadcasts free encrypted, not unencrypted, free encrypted, 
free to air TV which I’m not sure if you have E-TV at home, I do, I pay 
nothing it’s for free, that is free to air.  However, Multichoice took this 
20 
and started banging on it and telling people you are going to pay, you 
have to not have encryption.  Now my personal opinion is that they 
didn’t want the Minister to implement any type of encryption or set top 
box control because they didn’t want or they still don’t want competition 
in the pay TV market and they fought this tooth and nail, they came up 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 103 of 169 
 
with things like, Minister why is the government giving our poorer 
people set top boxes for free, they’re only going to be one more year 
and then they’re redundant.  Well the fact of the matter is, if you go 
and read the background to set top boxes, the market has grown 
exponentially to the extent that even Multichoice have released up to 
four new decoders over the past two years because they are very 
flexible, they can give information which people who can’t afford 
computers you can send it via the set top box and they can get it on 
their 
TV. 
 
So 
one 
of 
the 
– 
maybe 
I’m 
jumping 
the 
gun 
here…[intervenes]. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   No actually you are dealing most or some 
of the aspects you deal with in your statement, so as you are speaking 
I am just…[intervenes]. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Can I carry on like that or do you 
want to ask specific questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you may carry on I think you may carry on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay at a certain stage she will ask you if you are of 
the … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Of course.  Alright. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So people then say well what is the 
benefit of having a set top box control system and I would like to re-
emphasise that set top box control is not a term in the broadcasting 
industry.  It is called conditional access.  Now conditional access if we 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 104 of 169 
 
take those two terms conditional means you must meet the condition.  
In the pay TV environment the simple condition that you must meet is 
that you must pay your bill.  And if you pay your bill you get access.  
Conditional access.  That is the simple version or example of that.  So 
the benefits of these conditional access systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  I thought that when you said 
the correct term is conditional access not the set boxes and so on.  I 
thought that would apply to both encrypted and non-encrypted – that is 
not correct 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No it is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is correct? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. As I said earlier on it is a 
computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It has a number of functions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  You can encrypt, you can non-encrypt, 
you can add set top box control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  You add messaging.  There is a whole 
20 
plethora of  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But in terms of what it is that enables a 
situation where the public does not pay that has got nothing to do 
whether it is encrypted or not – non-encrypted. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It has got nothing to do with that. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 105 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is it that makes that difference in the equipment 
or whatever the arrangement is?  Because you see you have just – you 
just made a point which I think is probably very important namely that 
certain 
people 
apparently 
started 
going 
around 
and 
giving 
disinformation saying if ABC – if the Minister does this you will have to 
pay or people will have to pay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When in fact as I understand your evidence people 
would not have to pay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know. So I am trying to – to establish what makes 
the difference in terms of the two.  In terms of this program where does 
the difference lie?  If you have this – if you want free to air this is what 
you must have.  If it is going to be – it is not going to be a free to air 
and people have to pay then this is what you have to have. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might not be articulating this as – as eloquently as I 
would like to. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No, no, no that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But partly it might be my lack of knowledge of this 
20 
technology.   
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay.  No as I said earlier on Chair.  
Free to air is exactly what it says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Whether we encrypt or we do not 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 106 of 169 
 
encrypt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The end user gets the channel free. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And the free to air channels are I am 
assuming by law have been implemented 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  To say that the end user must never 
pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No matter what the technology is 
behind it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No matter if there is encryption or not 
it is free. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the whole project was based on it being a free to 
air project? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what you are saying is that when at a certain 
stage MultiChoice and maybe and I think you said some people within 
the SABC began to say to people you are going to have to pay if bla, 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 107 of 169 
 
bla, bla, bla.   
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you say was not true because the whole 
project was based on it being a free to air project. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am trying to understand whether in giving what 
you would refer to as disinformation or misleading the public what it is 
that they may have been using that could easily cause confusion to 
people as to whether they were right to say they would have to pay or 
not?  Or it was simply false information being distributed on the 
10 
assumption that people will believe. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It is false information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That is the bottom line.  It is false 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  You  may continue.  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry I beg your pardon Chair.  Just 
following – how does – because you have just termed it conditional 
access meaning that you can access it having satisfied certain 
20 
requirements.  How does that link up then we encrypted or non-
encrypted. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Well as I said the conditional access 
system has the capability to encrypt your information.  In other words 
the signal it can encrypt it or it does not have to encrypt it.  You can 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 108 of 169 
 
just do that via the computer.  So you have an encryption or you do not 
have encryption. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think – I think maybe I am kind of getting to what 
was confusing me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said conditional access simply means you will 
have access if you meet the conditions. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what was confusing me is that you said when 
10 
we talk about this set boxes it is really conditional access and then I 
was wondering why are you saying let us talk about conditional access 
when the whole project is meant to be  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Free. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Free to air project.  I think that is where I was getting 
confused. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I got the impression that you were saying 
whether you are going to end up with a free to air project or a not free 
20 
to air project this system that you are going to need to use is called 
conditional access and then I was thinking why call a system 
conditional access. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is actually not conditional. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 109 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay.  If I can maybe just then step 
back one step.  The conditional access system is a computer.  Let us 
put that on the side.  Here it sits here. Conditional access.  SABC, E-
TV and MultiChoice sit here and they send signals to the network and 
you – you watch these signals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Some of those signals are called free 
to air.  So they send free to air signals up and down.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The end user does not pay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  A conditional access the Minister in 
the beginning said listen we want to encrypt those signals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Because we getting pressure from 
movie houses etcetera and there is a number of other issues which I 
will go through just now.  We want to protect our local industry from – 
local manufacturing industry and I will tell you why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So he said we are going to use the 
20 
conditional access to encrypt these signals but it will still be free for 
the people at the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay conditional access, computer 
can encrypt but it is for free for the people on the end.  That is it. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 110 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ordinarily – ordinarily a conditional access 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  System 
CHAIRPERSON:  System is based on – on the fact that the end user 
will pay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No.  The end user does not pay.  I just 
mentioned that in a pay TV operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  They also have conditional access.  
MultiChoice has got a conditional access system; 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  As well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And one of their conditions to watch 
TV is you must pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But the one that Sentech has got we 
are not going to – one of the conditions is not payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  There is no conditions for you to 
watch.  So it is not conditional. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But the computer is still called 
conditional access. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so in the end the computer remains called 
conditional access. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 111 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that does not necessarily mean that… 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That you have to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anybody using it has to pay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. Nobody has to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now I think I understand. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I just gave that as an example that 
pay TV guys you must pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Yes Okay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That is one of the conditions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay that is fine. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But it has many other applications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  So then the 
way you have described it to the Chair that was you role at the time 
when you were Technical Advisor that you had to go and actually take 
control so that people understood exactly what the system was all 
about? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja I think you know part of my job 
description if you want was to make sure that people with – in the 
20 
Department of Communication which they had about 450 staff 
understood what this whole project was about exactly.  Now I did not 
want to go into deep technical detail but I know there is a lot of people 
just did not have the understanding of exactly what they are doing.  So 
I used to have lectures to try and give information to these guys.  But 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 112 of 169 
 
at the end of the day we ended up with a policy document which then 
stated that there should be set-top box control in the South African 
Policy document that there will be set-top box control. There will be a 
messaging system which is – the conditional access system it can do 
set-top box control.  It can do messaging and it can do – there was 
another piece of software to check set-top boxes.  Let us call it a set-
top box checker software.  The conditional access can do those three 
so the Minister put that in the policy and said listen Sentech via our 
policy we want those three implemented. The main one being set-top 
box control.  And … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The initial. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The SABC was with us all the time.  
The SABC approved.  Lulama Mokhobo wrote the Minister a letter – oh 
sorry I need to step back one.  So when I found out that Sentech had 
this conditional access system already in place I went to the Minister I 
said Minister I see SABC has gone out on tender for a conditional 
access system.  They do not need to.  Sentech’s already got one.  The 
Minister was kind of surprised.  He – oh ja.  So I said yes.  So all we 
have to do is advice SABC.  You do not have to go out on tender you 
will use – you will… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Sentech system. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I am using that word so that you can 
understand – you will use Sentech. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So which year was this now? 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 113 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Pardon? That was 2012. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  In 2012. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So and she wrote a letter to Doctor 
Ngubane and she told him please advise SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Doctor who? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Doctor Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Doctor Ngubane? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chairperson of the board at the time. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The Chairperson yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Please you will use Sentech they have 
already got the system in place.  They have bought it.  They have got 
engineers trained on it.  They have a help desk to help people.  So it is 
available.  Then E-TV decided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  At that time do you have any recollection 
as to how far the tender process had gone at SABC for the same 
system? 
20 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It – the first tender had lapsed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And they renewed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  For another 90 days. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 114 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It lapsed again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And they were about to renew it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  When I actually stepped in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja.  So  
CHAIRPERSON:  This letter was sent to Doctor Ngubane [indistinct]. 
xMR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ngubane ja and E-TV – it is strange 
10 
kind of setup but at that stage E-TV did not support set-top box control.  
So they took the Minister to court and this basically got rid of 2012 
deep into 2013 when we eventually ended up in court.  And the reason 
they took the Minister to court was they said you as the Minister do not 
have power to tell – to direct SABC what they will and will not do.  
Strange but I thought the Minister had power but it turns out in law she 
did not have power.  And E-TV won the court case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – but if the Minister did not have power to tell 
the SABC what to do how was that prejudicing them? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It was not that the prejudicing SABC 
20 
but – oh you mean E-TV? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I mean E-TV you know where did they come 
in? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I think it was because they did not like 
the fact that the Minister was saying you will use Sentech’s set-top box 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 115 of 169 
 
control system whereby – I need to step back again.  The tender that 
SABC sent out was done on behalf of a consortium and the consortium 
was E-TV, SABC, MultiChoice and the community TV broadcasters.  So 
by the Minister saying listen SABC – although she wrote the letter to 
SABC it would affect the other guys because she is telling SABC no, 
no, no forget about that tender you will use Sentech and the E-TV said 
ah, ah, ah we want to go out on tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just remember because of the question that I asked 
that you talk about E-TV taking the Minister to court.  I think that is a 
matter that ended up in the constitutional court at some stage. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I was part of the panel that heard the matter but 
that is neither here nor there. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No I think you talking about –  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think that… 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  There is a second court case on now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe it was … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But the – I am raising that because I seem to 
remember that even during the hearing of that matter I may have asked 
20 
the same question to say but where does – where did E-TV come in 
here?  I want to understand why would they have that complaint you 
know?  What was their basis for – for even going to court about this 
because I may thought that the papers, the affidavits did not seem to 
explain that?  So – so but you may proceed. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 116 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I will have to look at the affidavits and the 
judgment and refresh my memory. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As to what happened.  Yes continue. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay.  So we then – we got a letter 
got back from SABC from Lulama Mokhobo saying yes this is all 
systems go, we fully support you, our project team headed up the CTO 
or acting CTO at that stage from SABC Sipho Masinga.  We sat in the 
project team.  We went through all how we are going to implement this 
10 
to the extent that we actually had agreements set up by Doctor Setuma 
Mohapi from Sentech how he would implement the set-top box control, 
the costs involved from the broadcaster’s side not the end user.  The 
end user pays nothing.  The broadcasters what they would pay, the 
monthly costs, how it would be implemented?  And SABC fully behind 
us.  Then it – then it came a change in the Minister’s – Minister Dina 
Pule was recalled and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – I am sorry.  Just before you go to the new 
minister coming in.  So the position we are – you were at at the time 
when Minister Dina Pule left was that the tender process that the SABC 
20 
had initiated in order to get conditional access had been stopped 
because the Minister on your advice wrote a letter to the Chairperson 
of the board and the board and the management of SABC accepted the 
instruction, direction or whatever it was or suggestion from the Minister 
that there is no reason to seek to obtain a conditional access because 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 117 of 169 
 
Sentech has got it ready.  That is the – that is what – that is what the 
position was. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Minister Dina Pule left. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright yes.  So Minister Pule left. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Maybe and kind of happening at the 
same time – at the same time what was happening is that MultiChoice 
was also objecting to all kind of things in the policy document which 
they did not like.  And – sorry I am just trying to get my thoughts there.  
10 
Because a am just trying to tie up the time line when the Minister 
changed and Minister Yunus Carrim came in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  There was already a complaint from 
MultiChoice and suddenly – I just cannot get the exact time but the 
SABC decided we no longer want to cooperate in this we do not need a 
conditional access/set-top box control system.  So we as the SABC are 
not participating.  Now we were shocked because we had like I say we 
already had contracts set up with Sentech that the SABC would sign.  
E-TV – E-TV in fact I think they might have even signed their side of it.  
20 
It was just SABC still to put their signature.  And the next thing SABC 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at that stage E-TV was in line with your views? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what should happen, is that right? 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 118 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It is strange but remember they took 
the Minister to court but then they kind of changed their mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But they were then in line with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  The stage where Minister Pule left. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had E-TV taken the Minister to court already? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had that litigation been finalised? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja that was finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the outcome of that litigation? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The outcome … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you recall. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Oh in the court 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja in the court as you recall it. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The Minister lost the case. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And her letter had to be withdrawn 
from the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But that was my understanding. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 119 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  She was – she had no power to tell 
SABC what to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That issue that went to court in regard to that 
litigation related to the letter from the Minister that said stop the tender 
process because Sentech has got what you are looking for. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright so after the outcome of the case as you 
understood the position was the position therefore that the SABC board 
was the one that was said to have the power to decide whether they 
10 
would need to go to tender process or to continue on the path that had 
been suggested by Ms – Minister Pule? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That is how I would understand it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how you understood it? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But after the Minister had left then what happened? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So as I say one day we kind of getting 
ready to sign these contracts and SABC via Sipho Masinga says we no 
longer going to participate the SABC has decided they do not want any 
set-top box control, any encryption or anything to do with the 
20 
conditional access system from Sentech.  Now we were kind of 
surprised because we had these like war room meetings every week to 
update and get ready to go.  So I decided to try and find out why and 
then talking to colleagues in the SABC it turned out that the SABC had 
signed the contract with MultiChoice and the DG at that stage Ms 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 120 of 169 
 
Rosey Sekese she called me and said listen have a look at this 
contract.  There is a clause I cannot remember which clause but there 
are two or three clauses what does it mean to us as a Department of 
Communications and the SABC?  And I will summarise it but those 
clauses said – we as MultiChoice will give you I think – I do not know 
what the exact numbers are R500 million a year for you to put your 
channels on our network but you are – oh I am using my own words now 
– you are banned from using encryption or set-top box control on this 
network.  Which is – how can a MultiChoice tell the government you will 
not use set-top box control.  But somehow they convinced the SABC 
10 
and that was the end of that.  So the Minister – SABC said we no 
longer want.  So – but our – as I say I do not know the time lines.  
Even Ms Ellen Tshabalala she became the new CEO of SABC also 
during that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she was [indistinct]. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Also during that time.  Even she wrote 
us a letter to Minister Yunus Carrim he just started and she listen you 
have got my full support, go ahead, let us sign up with Sentech, we 
fully support you.  Within a week she sent a letter sorry we have 
changed our mind. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ha. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I am still flabbergasted today because 
that whole process is why South Africa is not finished with their digital 
rollout.  That whole process is stopped right there.  Because there were 
influences from other people, other companies that have somehow 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 121 of 169 
 
stopped the whole thing.  They came with this free to air that people 
must pay.  Oh the costs are going to be ridiculous and the more we – 
the Minister Yunus Carrim called – he called conferences and he got 
MultiChoice and everyone to try and come up with a consensus.  He 
gave them leeway.  He came up with new – he asked them to put in.  
And then we came up with a – in fact we even got a new policy, a 
totally new policy which we took to Parliament and they passed the 
policy.  And it was a brand new policy and that policy said, Okay the 
SABC does not want encryption so what we will do is we change the 
policy to say okay the set-top box control system will allow – allow or 
10 
disallow encryption depending on what the broadcaster wants.  If E-TV 
wants encryption we will allow it but they will pay what the government 
decides.  To me it was a simple system.  Either you wanted it and you 
paid or you do not want it and you do not pay.  And Parliament passed 
the thing that is it.  They passed the policy.  Not good enough.  And 
that is why we are still sitting where we are today.  Somebody still did 
not like it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what was the – or what were the important 
differences between the policy as it was before Minister Carrim came in 
20 
and the policy that he took through Parliament and got passed.  What 
was the main …? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The main difference was that – call it 
Minister Pule’s policy said there will be set-top box control.  Minister 
Cariim’s policy said there will be set-top box control if you want it. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 122 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then you must pay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Then you pay, if you do not want it 
there will not be set-top box control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And we even – sorry Chair.  At the – at 
Sentech a Doctor Sethuma Mohape he is a very intelligent guy he 
actually came up and drew pictures and said listen okay this is what the 
network is going to look like.  Here are SABC network – channels 
running through the network, totally unencrypted.  Here is E-TV running 
through the network, through the conditional system payment because 
10 
they are going to now pay us and they will be encrypted.  He made it so 
simple for people but no the SABC and MultiChoice said no we want 
nothing, nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now… 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Because people are going to pay.  So 
now I got to add it on because the user – the viewer is going to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Which is rubbish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position that certain – those who were opposed 
to this from the point of view of entities wanted to benefit from a 
20 
system without paying anything.  Was that the issue as you understand 
it or was the issue a much bigger one maybe relating to the 
suppression of competition or whatever? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Chair there is – there are a number of 
issues.  First of all if you can imagine the government’s decided listen 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 123 of 169 
 
we are going to give 5 million free set-top boxes to poor people.  So 
now we put set-top box control in and E-TV comes along what do they 
inheret?  They inherit 5 million subscribers so MultiChoice jumped on 
that. This is rubbish.  We have had to go and find out own 5 million 
subscribers through marketing and programming and whatever.  E-TV is 
coming along, jumping on – and they getting 5 million free – free 
subscribers.  So they opposed it vehemently and in one way I can kind 
of say ja well that is fine but it is – it is one of those things. Those 5 
million customers are already there.  Sorry and then I say to – I said to 
MultiChoice their engineers but listen MultiChoice you are also getting 
10 
those 5 million customers for free because you are on the same net – 
you are coming onto the same network so you getting another 5 million 
customers and yes E-TV is getting but we changed the policy.  Minister 
Carrim changed the policy so they [indistinct] pay.  So what is the big 
issue?  Well I know the big issue is politics and that is not my issue.  I 
am an engineer I know that this network will work in simple terms.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But is the issue politics or is the issue corruption? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja look I do not want to speculate 
between those two but you know it is one of those things somebody you 
do not – those big corporations do not just do something because they 
20 
think oh well we just going to do it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  There has got to be some give for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Why do they do it? 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 124 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But I am – like I say I do not want to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say you do not have the facts to … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   I do not have facts to say it is 
corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I have the engineering facts to say 
listen why do you do it?  I mean it is – you are not going to lose 
anything and me as a simple citizen like you are not – you gaining 5 
million customers in this case, they gaining customers.  Common sense 
10 
says geez. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I mean my network is going to grow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And if I do my marketing properly with 
my extra 5 million poorer people I am going to market towards that lot.  
I am going to get even more revenue.  So I – common sense cannot put 
it in place why they did not do it and specifically SABC.  Here you got 5 
million people it has been now ten years that this thing has not been 
rolled out.  The revenue streams that they have lost.  And now I am 
20 
going to jump ahead because I am – I need to move – well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I am – ja – I just want to more 
[indistinct] because they said what about – why would you put a set-top 
box control system in not just because it is policy. There are some 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 125 of 169 
 
issue – some benefits for that.  One of them is that again my opinion 
but it is an engineering opinion.  The SABC is looking for revenue 
streams why can they not become a pay TV operator?  You have got a 
set-top box control system in – a conditional access system.  It is there 
– it is [indistinct] it is working.  Put it in and become a pay TV operator 
and be in opposition to MultiChoice.  No, no we cannot have opposition 
like this. That is not – what is not fair?  SABC is a private company why 
can they not compete?  The second thing is if they do not want to 
become a pay TV Operator there is a technology called pay-per-view.  
Pay-per-view on the – in Europe and America multi billion dollars. 
10 
Now there are some people in South Africa - let us call them 
the Boere - they like rugby but they cannot afford to fly to the World 
Rugby Cup now and they - they cannot afford DSTV. 
So they are not going to see the Rugby World Cup.  SABC 
with the conditional access system can tell them listen for 300 bucks 
we will put the channel onto your TV and you can watch it.  Do that 
times three or four million people millions of Rand flowing in there.  I 
do not know why they do not do it.  That is why I said that the set-top 
box control system has got so many advantages. 
It is unbelievable.  Then - then MultiChoice will come and 
20 
SABC but to - what we have to do is we have to put a little chip in - in 
the decoder.  Yes you have to.  It cost $2.00.  It is R29 to put it in but 
you can generate millions.  R29, ja but who is going to pay that?  The 
taxpayer.  Yes the taxpayer.  Yes it is a lot of money but the revenue 
kickback one you do your model it is a non - you do not even have to 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 126 of 169 
 
think about it because you are going to make so much money out of it 
but they fought against it.  So I - I know I get worked up because it 
irritates me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  When simple things can get - get 
solved by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that is very important Mr Kruger because as I 
say you know I was involved in the Constitutional Court when the case 
came - at least I think it would have been the first one relating to this 
project and I seem to recall that there were just certain things that did 
10 
not seem to make sense in positions that were being taken by certain 
people - entities and - and you were involved in the project quite 
closely. 
You are an engineer you understand all of these things.  It is 
very important that you share with me exactly your own understanding 
of what the challenges are.  What is the problem because you will - you 
would know what is possible and what is not possible and because I 
asked some witnesses last week already here about this issue. 
I said from my recollection of the court papers in that matter 
this whole thing the Government began to talk about policy - about this 
20 
project way back in the mid-2000 there about and I think one witness 
said 2002 … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Initially and I say we are in 2019 and it still has not 
been you know - what is going on you know.  So - and it is interesting 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 127 of 169 
 
that you are telling us that in Mozambique they started after - after 
South Africa? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja.  Last year - 18 months they have 
been going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18 months they - they will be done.  So it is important 
that we find out exactly what it is because if it is corruption.  Then it 
needs to be dealt with very urgently and properly because in the 
meantime I mean costs are going up.  I mean in the end you know 
certain things might be free to the end user but probably somebody 
else pays you know. 
10 
You know.  So - so often we say things are free but the - the 
truth is that somebody else pays so that you do not pay you know.  So - 
so I am very keen.  So do not feel bad about being worked up because I 
want to try and … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Really understand what is going on and you are trying 
your best to put me in the position to understand. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank …. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Kruger in fact you 
have actually dealt with everything in your statement … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 128 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But there are just areas that I am going to 
just take you back.  So that you can just … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Deal with those just thoroughly but 
answering the Chairperson you ended up just dealing with everything 
that -  
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That you dealt with but can I just take you 
to paragraph 25 at page 7 of your statement.  I know that you did touch 
briefly on the - on the useful functions of the STB.  Could you just 
10 
emphasise those that you have in paragraph 25 please? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Okay.  I - I would also like to Chair 
you - you were talking about corruption.  Now again I cannot say there - 
there was corruption but I am in the simple common sense you say 
something went wrong. 
These set-top boxes they are simple devices and when I 
started there the policy document the Government had budgeted I think 
it was R750 per set-top box multiplied by five million gives you a billion 
Rand and - and people were saying and now you want to go add 
another R29 - this is now down the road - for - for this set-top box 
20 
control but there is - end result is that the set-top boxes came right 
down and today you can buy them for R300 including set-top box 
control. 
So Ms Dina Pule calls me and says listen we need to go out 
on tender for this.  Can you please arrange the whole thing?  As an 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 129 of 169 
 
advisor I can - I can do the documents but I cannot participate in it.  
According to the law apparently but I mean I did the technical 
document.  I did the tender specifications and we sent the tender out 
and we got a reply from I think about 35-odd companies and the 
Government’s policy was to develop the electronic manufacturing 
industry here specifically for small manufacturers but more specifically 
for Black entrepreneurs. 
So we made sure that this is the area that we are going to get 
into to make sure that South African entrepreneurs score and to the 
extent that we went to the South African Bureau of Standards and they 
10 
set up a specific standard that every set-top box sold in South Africa 
must comply with this standard.  Specifically for the subsidised - we 
call them subsided units for the - the five million that the Government 
is given away. 
They must comply with this standard and everybody SABC, 
MultiChoice, E.TV, community operators all agreed - they all signed off 
the document at SABS and in that document it says there must be 
set-top box control.  So the reason for that is if you do not protect 
these boxes you can go and buy a foreign imported box for literally 
R20. 
20 
That would kill the local manufacturing industry.  So we - our 
group at the - at the - under Minister Yunus Carrim and - and under 
Dina Pule were adamant that we have to have the set-top box control to 
protect the boxes.  So to come to the lawyer’s questions is one of the 
benefits of putting set-top box controlling is to protect the local 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 130 of 169 
 
industry from dumping of cheap set - set-top boxes. 
Now I know maybe some people say but I want a cheap 
set-top box.  The problem is when you talk about poorer people if 
something goes wrong - they had this in Mauritius.  They just opened 
up and let anybody bring set-top boxes in.  When the thing goes faulty 
they phoned the Government call desk and said listen my box is not 
working. 
I cannot see SABC and the guy on the call what is the name 
of the box and says oh well it is a - it is Wang Dang 1 and they say we 
do not have this on our list.  I do not know and that guy is left.  He 
10 
cannot watch TV.  So we come up with a standard.  All the boxes 
comply with that.  We put set-top box control in.  You cannot bring your 
box into this country unless you take it to SABC and get it verified. 
So that was the - that is the one benefit of having set-top box 
control is that we can - we can keep our local manufacturing industry 
under control.  The other thing is and they sound simple for people like 
us here maybe all of us that a set-top box control system has got a 
number of intelligent systems.  Number one we can send information to 
people. 
It is called a messaging system but you can send it because 
20 
when - when you get a set-top box and you go pick it up at the post 
office which is the way we were going to distribute it.  You fill in a form 
so we have got all your details.  It is on the set - it is on the subscriber 
management system part of the conditional access system computer 
there is a subscriber management system. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 131 of 169 
 
So we have got your details and we know that you speak Zulu 
and we know that guy speaks Sotho.  He is English.  He is Afrikaans.  
We know that.  Now the Government wants to have elections.  They can 
send out information in the language of that person to say listen on that 
date we are having elections you go there - very valuable information.  
To me that is a benefit for the Government. 
That is why you set-top box control in.  Not only that.  If there 
is a disaster coming in an area you can send disaster reports in that 
area’s language or the individual to say listen there is a disaster 
coming.  You need to get out and you can go to this and this place. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and those messages come out on - on the 
screen - on their … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  On the screen, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On their TV screens? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  On the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So you will see a little - a little - I do 
not know those who have got DSTV sometimes you get a little message 
there a little envelope.  It is a message.  You go and click on it and it 
tells you.  So - so you can do that. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So - what else? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, you have - you have touched - you 
have dealt with 25.1.  You have dealt 25.2 when there is an emergency 
or you know whether and then elections you have dealt with and then 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 132 of 169 
 
let us deal with - then with - although you did touch upon it being able 
to disable foreign intrusion you deal with that in paragraph 27. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Another function of the set-top … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Box control system … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before you do … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do that just to make sure I follow.  I thought that 
10 
when you - when you started you said we actually do not need the 
set-top boxes.  South Africa did not need them … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of SENTECH.  I misunderstood that part. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Sorry Chair.  Every - every household 
in South Africa with any kind of TV … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Must have a set-top box. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Whether you have - if you get one 
from - from MultiChoice that is your choice.  You pay … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But if it is from the free-to-air 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 133 of 169 
 
channels … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  You can collect it at the post office - 
the indigenous people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Or those who do not they have to buy 
it from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Dions or wherever but everybody must 
have a set-top box.  Sorry.  I - I  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Maybe I failed to mention it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  My understanding at that time when you were 
speaking and I must have misunderstood you … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I got the impression that what you were saying was 
South Africa seems to be obsessed with this idea of set-top boxes … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there is a system … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is maybe more modernised much better and if 
you - if you use that system which I - I understood to be the SENTECH 
System … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you use that system you do not really need this. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 134 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that is what … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not true? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Sorry.  No, no that is not true … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Because some of the - some of the 
TVs that the poorer people have got they are very old and they still 
have what they call an analogue interface where - where you plug your 
antenna into. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And now we need the set-top box to 
convert to digital … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So ja.  You do need it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So sorry.  The other benefit which it is 
20 
linked to is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And it is in the policy document of 
South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 135 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Is that you need to be able to disable 
set-top boxes that are stolen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And you can only do that by having a 
set-top box control system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh, hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Now subsequent to that another new 
Minister came in Minister Muthambi and - and she got some engineers 
from MultiChoice … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Who came up with this - I do not know 
if I must call it the ingenious idea … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But you do not actually need this 
conditional access system.  We can just (indistinct) a bit of software.  
They call it Multiplex Verification … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And it is a simple software which can 
be hacked at any time and - and that will disable the - the set-top box 
control and that is what they were going to implement as South Africa’s 
20 
set-top box control system. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Rubbish.  So I do not agree with that 
system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Talk more about the merits - merits and 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 136 of 169 
 
demerits of what they came up with. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The merits and demerits of? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what they came up with.  Their - their proposal. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those ingenious. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  As I say the software they came up 
with for set-top box - first of all - I assume the Minister’s team.  They 
said but messaging - messaging is quite simple.  If you watch your TV 
every day you see at the bottom … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That little - they call it tickertape 
running there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  We can send messaging there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That defeats the objective of sending 
it in - imaging sending 11 languages on that tickertape there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I think you will probably confuse half 
of … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  You probably confuse all the White 
people but certainly most of - a lot of the Black people will be confused 
because so many languages … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 137 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And I think you will lose the message 
but that was their idea.  So we do not need a set-top box control 
because we will send our messaging via that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the MultiChoice engineers … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I - I am assuming … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are saying that in terms of your (intervenes). 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I think the SABC engineers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  They - they used some advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, some advisors, yes. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja, let us use that or they used some 
advisors … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  To give them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  How do we kind of - in my opinion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  How do we bypass this policy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But not bypass it in terms of we still 
20 
sticking to the basic clauses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So we saying set-top box control, yes.  
We will do Multiplex Verification … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 138 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Which is not a set-top box control.  It 
is just a piece of software … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But - but it still complies.  It still set - 
we are still controlling the set-top box. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Oh - oh the policy says messaging.  
Oh, ja we will just sending messaging at the bottom then.  So they still 
comply … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And that is how - how this kind of 
thing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Got stuck somewhere along the road. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Apart from the weaknesses of that proposal that 
you have - the said - what other weaknesses in this proposals of the 
SABC advisors that - that they came up with? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Well I think the thing is it comes back 
to and I think that is the whole emphasis of my - my … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Input here Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Is encryption or non-encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 139 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  If you do not encrypt basic systems 
like your WhatsApp that you use … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Is fully encrypted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Now there is two ways of doing 
encryption.  You can do what they call end encryption … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Or you can do end to end encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  End encryption means like from the 
transmitter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  To one side of that other transmitter 
you can encrypt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Let me give you an example.  If we go 
back to this conditional access.  Say for example you have not paid 
your bill … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  At ET - ag … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  At MultiChoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The conditional access system … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 140 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Will send out what they call an 
entitlement control message … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And it encrypts it.  Just here by the 
computer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And it sends out this encrypted 
message over the network.  It does not encrypt it on the network. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  When it gets to the other side the 
set-top box control - ag the set-top box … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Decrypts it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And says listen this set-top box has 
not met the condition … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  To be switched on because you have 
not paid your bill. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So it tells the set-top box do not 
switch me on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So you sit at home why is it not 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 141 of 169 
 
working.  Well you have not paid your bill. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  You then go and pay your bill … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And the conditional access system 
then sends out a thing called ECM.  An Entitlement Control … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It encrypts it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Sends it on to the network.  It does 
not encrypt.  It is already encrypted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And it sends it to the set-top box … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And says listen this guy has paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  You can now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Switch him on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And that is what it does.  So that is 
the end encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 142 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It is just on the end … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And - and at the set-top box. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just before you move on is that what you 
described at page 24?  You have a diagram there.  Would that talk to 
…? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just - could you just take 
the Chairperson to that page?  Page 24 - 2-4. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So you then get end to end encryption 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Which is fully encrypted across the 
network and the reason you do that - ja that - that in essence if - if you 
look at that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  There we have input.  We have 
encryption and no encryption and then the set-top box sits with the 
control chip inside it and - and your channels come out the other side 
20 
for free. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But - I have lost my train of thought 
for a minute. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you were still describing one - then 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 143 of 169 
 
somebody has (intervenes). 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The end to end … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Encryption. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That means from when the - for 
example where we are sitting now the guy - there is the camera.  He is 
taking a movie of me.  As soon as it goes out the camera into his 
Multiplex we encrypt.  We then send that across to SENTECH fully 
encrypted.  Why do I say fully encrypted and what is the benefit? 
10 
Say for example - can I use politics as a - our political 
system … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  As an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Say you have got - I have been a 
member of the ANC for 40 years or nearly 40 years but I want to do 
something against the DA.  So now you and I Chair we are sitting and 
talking I say listen the DA we need to sabotage them and - and I am 
talking to you now.  So it is going on the movie but I have encrypted it.  
20 
It goes out and there is somebody from the DA who is an engineering 
wizard. 
He is sitting there with a receiver which can receive all these 
frequencies and he takes this and he says listen what Roy Kruger said 
and he rushes off to his side and said listen check this line.  They spy 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 144 of 169 
 
and so effectively they are spying on us.  Sorry that was a - if it is not 
encrypted but if it is encrypted they cannot get that information. 
So an unencrypted network is very easy to sabotage because 
people can just come in onto your frequencies take over and start using 
the network but if you have got a set-top box control in here he cannot 
do it unless he has already hacked the condition and access system 
which by then - well there is - there is problems on the whole computer 
network but encryption is the most important thing. 
WhatsApp uses it.  Facebook uses it and there is pressure 
because people are stealing people’s personal information because it is 
10 
not encrypted.  So you will see today hence Mozambique, Kenya, 
Namibia everybody is putting in encryption and the big movie houses 
are insisting on it.  Thanks Chair.  I think that is all I have got to say on 
this. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so coming back to the South African situation 
when you left what was the Government’s position?  I say Government 
as in the Minister of Communication’s position whoever he or she was 
at the time you left the Department of Communications.  What was their 
- were they wanting encryption?  Did they - did they not want 
20 
encryption?  What was the position? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  The Minister at the time was - is 
Minister Yunus Carrim.  He put the new policy to Parliament and his 
position was that we are going for set-top box control and we will have 
encryption or no encryption but if you want it you will pay for it and that 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 145 of 169 
 
was the final policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so his position was kind of a compromise? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister Dina Pule’s position was encryption … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is it and Minister Carrim’s position was well 
we will have encryption but if you want - if you do not want to 
encryption then you can have your non-encryption but then you must 
pay for it. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja.  It is exactly - that picture that you 
10 
see on page 24 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It shows you E.TV Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  It goes through that orange block.  It 
says encryption … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Because they wanted encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  SABC, Community TV and Future TV 
20 
they did not want encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  So you bypass it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That is what we offered them in the 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 146 of 169 
 
final policy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  And that is how - I am sure that is still 
how it is today.  I am not sure Parliament changed that policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So and again you said it is the no 
encryption regime that is open to easy sabotage? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Thank you ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and you also mention it is 
open to sabotage and terrorist - terrorist attacks and all of that? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then you have already dealt with - 
with MultiChoice - MultiChoice’s attitude and E.TV’s attitude.  Then you 
have mentioned and Mr Motsoeneng has been given we call the Rule 
3.3. Notices in term … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Say that again. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have - you mentioned Mr Motsoeneng 
in your statement.  Am I correct? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and he has been given notice and he 
did testify yesterday that he would have preferred that you testify first 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 147 of 169 
 
because you referred to him in you statement. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja.  I refer to Mr Motsoeneng because 
on my investigation on - on why does the SABC all of a sudden change 
its mind it then turned out that Mr Motsoeneng had signed this contract 
with MultiChoice whereby MultiChoice banned the SABC from using 
set-top box control system.  So that is why I mentioned that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of that as you call it … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The set-top boxes that had been intended to be used 
10 
would no longer be allowed.  Is that right?  Is that what you say? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  There would be no encryption allowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There would be no encryption allowed? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja.  The set-top boxes will still be 
used … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  But there is no encryption in it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is what I wanted to understand. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So the - the agreement as you understand it 
20 
that SABC signed with MultiChoice through Mr Motsoeneng insisted that 
the SABC would have to use non-encryption? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is - that would open the SABC up in terms of 
this project to very easy but serious sabotage of the system? 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 148 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and the other point that 
you make in paragraph 41 if you could just turn to that page and then 
summarise what you - you convey to the Chairperson there. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  On page 41? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 41 page 11. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Paragraph 41. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Page 11 paragraph 41 and you 
already mentioned what you say in paragraph 40 but could you just deal 
with what you say in paragraph 41.  I think these are the - this is a 
consequence of - of that agreement. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja.  I think we have spoken about the 
free-to-air … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Where - where MultiChoice was using 
20 
this as one of the convincing statements that - to the SABC and in fact 
to all the community TV broadcasters that free-to-air would no longer 
be free-to-air if they include encryption. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So - and then if you go to - I just 
want - so that I make sure that you have covered everything in … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 149 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Your statement.  You have already dealt 
with the letters of support that Ms Mokhobo and Ms Ellen Tshabalala 
had submitted supporting the encryption model.  Then you say 
something in paragraph 47 where you deal with the change of 
Ministers.  You have already mentioned this slightly but there is 
something that you say in the last two sentences.  Could you just tell 
the Chairperson what you convey there? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Paragraph 47? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 47 page 12. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Ja, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  That is why I mentioned that earlier 
that when - when the new Minister - Minister Faith Muthambi came in 
they then with the SABC fully supported changing or in fact not 
implementing set-top box control and that is public knowledge that the 
Minister then went again - against the ANC policy or the - or the 
Government policy. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which Minister was that now? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Faith Muthambi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The - as you understood it the Government 
policy and the ANC policy was in favour of encryption? 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 150 of 169 
 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Yes.  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Minister Muthambi took an - the different 
approach? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And said there should be no encryption? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I - I must just say I mean I have already 
said that I was involved in hearing the matter that came to the 
Constitutional Court relating to litigation around this matter.  I - I could 
not understand why if the Government policy and the ANC policy was to 
10 
the effect that encryption was the right way - was the way to go how 
there could be a Minister who is a member of the ANC who is deployed 
by the ANC in Government who is part of the Government how such a 
Minister could afford to go against both Government policy and the ANC 
policy and still remain Minister.  You understand? 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  I am engineer but I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean it - it does not make sense to me.  If - if the 
ruling - I mean the ruling party says all the time that it deploys people 
in Government … 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says deploys even the President.  The President of 
the country would be the President of the ruling party and how do you 
have a situation where a Minister who is subject to the ANC who is 
subject to the Government of which he is part continue to go against 
Government policy and ANC policy and nothing happens.

She continues to be Minister.  Well I am sure there will be 
more people who will come here and Minister Muthambi will - will come 
here also and put her side of the story and maybe she will be able to 
explain. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:  Hm, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - maybe you might think that with the position 
she took was against Government policy, maybe she would be able to 
show that it was not against government policy, even if it was – it may 
have been against the ANC policy, I don’t know, but it is something that 
I am very interested in getting enlightenment on, because in the 
10 
Department of Communications there has been a high turnover of 
Ministers wile this whole project lingers on.   
 
Now you tell me, and you are involved in a similar project in 
Mozambique, you tell me that in Mozambique 18 months was enough for 
it to – for this project to be implemented, where in South Africa it has 
been ages, we – it has been ages and to the extent that this whole 
project was in part intended to benefit poor people. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It means those poor people are not benefitting, there 
is no service delivery and the question is why, and if it is true and I do 
20 
not know if it is true at this stage, I will hear evidence, but if it is true 
that Minister Muthambi took a position that was against both 
government policy and against the ruling party’s policy then I think both 
leaders of government and leaders of the ANC at the time may have a 
lot to explain, to say how do we have a situation where such an 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 152 of 169 
 
important project has been decided upon, lots of money involved and 
there is just some rambling that is going on and at a certain stage a 
position is taken by a Minister that goes against Government policy and 
so on.  As I say I do not know whether it was against Government 
policy and I don’t that it was against the ANC policy but I do know that I 
have read things to that effect, and the relevant people will come and 
will explain. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, and then lastly you 
mention some of the benefits which you deal with at paragraph 49 
10 
which would enable citizens to get information relating to applications 
for ID documents, visa’s and passports, it is an aspect that you did not 
mention. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   No, I was just saying about all the 
different types of messaging that – to benefit poor people by sending 
messages you know for example I stay in George, which is a nice area 
but – and I do some work in the community, and there is a little, call it 
a squatter camp up the road from my house and when I say up the road 
it is about eight kilometres and I go there and I say to people listen you 
need to vote and they say but we have not got an ID book and you kind 
20 
of say well you and I as a normal person well why don’t you just go to 
Home Affairs and get one.   
 
Well I don’t know if you have ever walked eight kilometres, 
gone to Home Affairs, walked eight kilometres back, then you wait three 
or four weeks, Home Affairs is quite efficient, but you don’t have a post 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 153 of 169 
 
box, so they don’t know how to get the – that the ID book is ready and 
it lies there and lies there, if you go to most Home Affairs they’ve got 
thousands and thousands of ID books because people don’t know they 
are ready and they don’t get informed, but if they are then you have to 
get up and walk another eight kilometres, get your book and walk eight 
kilometres back. 
 
For people with cars it’s very easy but for poor people it is not, 
and the set up was control system via the messaging, you can send the 
message, if the person hasn’t got a TV, I don’t know many households 
that don’t have TV’s, whether they’re poor or not but at least via a 
10 
family member the message can come through to say listen this is how 
you apply for the book, this is where you get it and yes it is ready for 
you to come and pick up now, so you know I don’t want to belabour the 
point but to me it’s just impossible not to have this system for the 
benefit of South Africa. 
 
Thank you Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Kruger I think I would like you to do some 
extra work, if your situation permits.  You were involved with this 
project quite closely from the Department of Communication side and 
20 
you are an engineer, you are able to explain certain things that 
somebody who is not an engineer might not be able to explain.   
 
I would – I believe I may benefit a lot if you were to have the 
opportunity of reading the papers that were placed before the Court in 
the litigation letter we are talking about that went to the Courts, and 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 154 of 169 
 
now I don’t know whether at that time you may have been still part of 
the Department of Communications and I don’t know whether your 
affidavit might have been put in to explain certain things or not, but I 
would very much like a situation where you could see what had been 
placed by – before the Courts by all sides and be able to see whether 
the Courts got a full and correct picture of what the position was about 
this project at that time, and if you think that the full and correct 
picture did not emerge from all those affidavits, from all sides, then 
prepare an affidavit that says here is maybe misrepresentation that was 
made if there is misrepresentation, here is where there are gaps, this 
10 
should have been explained to the Court, here is what we give the 
Commission, a correct and complete picture. 
 
Is that something that your situation will permit you to do and 
possibly there will be assistance from the Commission but I know you 
work in Mozambique, you might not be easily accessible but I just want 
to know about the principle whether in principle provide that the 
logistics can be worked out whether it’s something that you could 
consider. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Ja I can consider that, I mean it won’t 
be an immediate thing, but certainly I can yes Chair, no problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you very much.  The Legal Team I 
would like you to talk to Mr Kruger and make available to him a full set 
of papers that were filed in the High Court and the Constitutional Court 
in that matter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   We will do that Chair. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 155 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a lot of – it is bulky. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to be sure that the Courts were given 
the correct and complete picture, because if those papers do reflect the 
correct and complete picture as at that time then I know that if I look at 
them it’s a complete picture. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they did not represent the complete picture you 
can fill in the gaps by way of an affidavit to say here is what was left 
out which completes the picture. 
10 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just thank you then for coming to give 
evidence to the Commission and to share what you know about this 
project with the Commission, I think it is important.  We may ask you to 
come back at some stage, I am not sure, but if we do I am sure that you 
will do what you can to make yourself available. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Thank you, thank you, no problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but thank you very much and for now you are 
excused. 
MR LAWRENCE ROY KRUGER:   Okay, thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  May we now take the 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162

witness, we might adjourn earlier than four o’clock today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And tomorrow, I thought there were a few witnesses 
that we were supposed to have heard yesterday. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair but I will come and just advise 
you on what is happening yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Those are the witnesses that deal maybe 
just to so that it is open they will, with the lot – lots of reports and we 
are going to – yesterday we tried but there were a lot of people queuing 
to see you Chair, just to ask for other days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because they will not finish today and 
tomorrow yes thank you, but we will come, we will approach you in 
chambers, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine.  Okay we will take the lunch 
adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162

ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  By Advocate Mutebi (?) has been 
placed in front.  However Advocate Mutebi was unable to come …

- CC10.1 and that can be found on page 1-1-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the two advocates talk about the same thing?

Page 159 of 169 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
What 
- 
what 
is 
that 
document 
Mr Lekgetho? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  The first page it is written EXHIBIT CC10.1 
- Statement of Leonard Lekgetho. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if you turn over the next page what 
- what document is that? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  The next page it is a statement that I have 
made. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if you turn over to page 1-2-1.  Is 
that your signature? 
10 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And you signed at - you signed this 
statement in Pretoria on 6 September 2019.  Is that correct? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Lekgetho are you employed?  Where 
are you currently employed? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  I am currently employed at the Special 
Investigating Unit as the Chief National Investigating Officer. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And can you please inform the Chair 
what are your functions as the Chief National Investigations Officer? 
20 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  My function as the Chief National 
Investigating Officer is to overlook all the investigations relating to 
national 
departments 
including 
the 
SOE. 
 
I 
manage 
all 
the 
investigations that relate to all those departments. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
Thank 
you 
Mr Lekgetho 
and 
in 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 160 of 169 
 
paragraph 3 on that first page - on 1-1-8 of your statement you state 
that you are going to be dealing with the affairs of the SABC.  Can you 
just elaborate on that? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  That is correct.  I have been called to 
come and - and give progress in terms of the investigation that we are 
currently dealing with in - on SABC. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And these are various investigation 
matters and so forth concerning the SABC? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  Correct.  There - there are several 
investigations that we are currently dealing with at SABC and I think 
10 
when I am ready I will take you through the progress which should 
outline all the progress that we have today and the name of the specific 
contract that we are looking at. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  Chair if I can just take you 
to the slides in which Mr Lekgetho will be referring to in all the matters 
that the SIU is currently dealing with concerning the SABC.  You will 
find those slides Chair on page 1-5-3 of that same folder … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  But however Chair we do have an 
updated version of these slides that were furnished to us this morning 
20 
by the SIU.  It is more or less the same just an updated version that 
was presented to Parliament on 10 September 2019 and these slides 
will basically incorporate the table that is highlighted as from 
paragraph 6 of Mr Lekgetho's statement that could be found on page 
1-1-9 of Mr Lekgetho’s statement. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 161 of 169 
 
Upon Chair’s approval I beg leave to hand up the updated 
slides on which Mr Lekgetho is going to take us through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you know what I am thinking unless there is a 
concern that he - there has been an excessive delay in the 
investigation process in regard to a certain matter I - and I want to be 
satisfy why nothing has been done or why progress is slow there is no 
particular reason that I can think of why I would want to be given 
evidence about what the progress is. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is what - what I am thinking about now.  
10 
You know we have heard cases where somebody says we - I reported to 
the Hawks this particular complaint or the SAP and they have done 
nothing.  Then one wants to find out if it is something that relates to 
corruption and so on that falls under the terms of reference. 
Otherwise I am not sure that if it is not that kind of situation I 
am not sure that I particularly need to hear evidence about how far they 
have gone.  Assuming for example that everything is - you know on 
track. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Of - yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you understand what I mean? 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there - is there an angle that I am missing that you 
might wish to tell me about? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Well Chair the purpose of - of 
Mr Lekgetho coming this afternoon was to update the Commission on 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 162 of 169 
 
the progress particularly in terms of what is going on with specific 
matters at the SABC.  This will be dealing with you know the 
irregularities and so forth and matters they have referred to for 
instance to the SAPS and - and so on. 
Mr Lekgetho did come and convey that he does not 
necessarily want to dissect each and every matter because they are 
before courts and they have been referred to the relevant platform and 
so forth.  So Mr Lekgetho will just be dealing as to you know what is 
happening with this particular contract the progress and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but that is what I am talking about.  If there is no 
10 
concern that they have delayed unduly why should I spend time 
listening to them telling me how efficiently they have dealt with the 
matters.  If they explain that to a Parliamentary Committee which has 
oversight of them - over them that I can understand. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not exercise oversight over them.  I am 
interested only in terms of issues relating to State Capture and 
corruption but where they were supposed - where there is a concern 
that they were supposed to have investigated certain matters relating to 
corruption for example and there has been a delay I could then want to 
20 
hear what is going on. 
You know but otherwise if there is no such concern I am not 
sure that I really need to hear how they - how they or what progress 
they have made. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair.  We can ask if 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 163 of 169 
 
Mr Lekgetho because he - he is privy to all their ongoing investigations 
and so forth.  If he could then highlight exactly if there have been 
delays and so forth because particularly these … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but I am saying as things stand unless you tell me 
something that I might be missing.  As things stand unless there are 
matters where there is a concern that there has been a long delay I do 
not see why I should - I need to know what progress they - they have 
been making.  In other words if everything is going according to plan. 
There is no need for me to - to spend time hearing his 
evidence along those lines. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If - it maybe that it is - it is a report that might be of 
interest at some stage to read but I do not think that I should hear oral 
evidence simply about that. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair.  If … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Upon Chair’s approval can I put to 
Mr Lekgetho if there has been any undue delays in any of these matters 
and so forth … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
Because 
he 
would 
be 
privy 
to 
everything that is going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHESHELE:  Can I put that question … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 164 of 169 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  To him? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you do not - if you do not have the concern of 
a delay why would you put that question to him?  You - you would be 
wanting - you would be - you would be fishing for information?  He 
might say no there is nothing and that is the end.  You understand? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes indeed so Chair.  I do understand 
what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The Chair is trying to convey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe we will - we will say this the matters 
10 
that are taking care of - that are dealt with in this report are there are 
any matters that have delayed for long periods while they were being 
investigated by the SIU? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  No Chairperson.  All the matters are on 
track. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are all on track? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair just to bring to the Chair’s 
attention that these matters that Mr Lekgetho was going to talk about 
20 
are matters that are being investigated by the Commission.  It is not 
just only the SIU that have taken those responsibility of investigating.  
So the investigators are on these matters as well and that is why - that 
is why we felt that it was important for Mr Lekgetho to talk about this - 
the matters that are ongoing and so forth. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 165 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if they are being investigated by the Commission 
let the investigation be finalised first and then witnesses can be 
brought at the time. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair.  We also have a 
witness that is coming in due course that will talk about the reports - 
the investigative - the forensic reports and he will come and talk to 
those reports.  So there is a link between these cases that the SIU 
have taken on and the upcoming witness that is coming to talk about 
these reports that the SABC themselves have investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if there is a link what - what may be possible is 
10 
that hearing his evidence now does not reveal the relevance but if it 
comes later after certain witnesses who deal with the reports have - 
have given evidence it maybe that then it is relevance would become 
apparent. 
You see it might be that it - it is coming at a wrong time in 
that sense because at this stage as I say if - if it is matters that they 
are investigating everything seems to be under control.  I am not 
exercising oversight over them but if a matter was reported to them a 
long time ago that falls within our jurisdiction and they seem have done 
nothing about it. 
20 
Then I would welcome evidence that tells me what happened.  
What is going on?  You understand? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair.  I appreciate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The - the Chair’s concern. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 166 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  I would then propose Chair with your 
approval … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That we hear our upcoming witness that 
is going to testify about the forensic that is happening at SABC and 
then 
at 
a 
later 
stage 
have 
Mr Lekgetho 
dependent 
also 
of 
Mr Lekgetho’s availability that then he would then come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No what we can do is if you think that once the 
evidence of certain witnesses has been had in relation to certain 
10 
reports the relevance of his evidence about the progress might become 
apparent.  Then take that decision at that stage and if you propose to 
bring him back then I can at it at that stage but at this stage I do not 
think that I really need to hear what progress they - they are making if 
there is no complaint that they are not doing their job. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair wishes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you - you understand what I am saying? 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  I understand Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you may be asked later on but for now 
maybe it is not the right time. 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  Thank you. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 167 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You - you are excused. 
MR LEONARD LEKGETHO:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Due to Mr Lekgetho being excused that 
would then conclude the witnesses of today and we do have a witness 
lined up for tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For tomorrow? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage do you know whether we - the - the 
witnesses for tomorrow is able to be here at 10 o’ clock or is that 
something that is still uncertain? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  We are still awaiting 
confirmation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But in the event that particular witness is 
not available we have lined up another witness that could start at 10 o’ 
clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So should we - I mean there are two options. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the witness that is scheduled for tomorrow is only 
going to be here like at 11 … 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162 
 
Page 168 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we could say we start at 11 but if - but another 
option would be that we start at 10 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if she is here at 10 we start with her.  If she is 
not here we start with somebody else. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then we take it from there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  I am - I am just worried that in 
the event that she is not able to - to make it tomorrow then we would be 
10 
wasting a day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe we should adjourn until 10 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair then I will have the 10 o’ clock 
witness ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  We will adjourn the proceedings for the day.  
We will start at 10 o’ clock tomorrow. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
12 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 162
