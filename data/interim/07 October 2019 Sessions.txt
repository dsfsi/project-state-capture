PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 7 OCTOBER 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we start with the oral evidence I am going to 
make an order that has got nothing to do with the witness who will be 
giving evidence today.  It is an order relating to some application for 
Leave to Cross-examine.  Let me deal with that and then we can start.  
The order that I am going to make relates to an application that was 
brought by Mr Kevin Wakeford for Leave to Cross -examine Mr Angelo 
Agrizzi and Mr Frans Hendrick Steyn Vorster who previously gave 
10 
evidence in this commission in relation to Bosasa.  I am going to make 
this order and will only give reasons if it becomes necessary at a later 
stage.  The order I make is that  
1. The applicant’s non-compliance with the time frames provided for 
in the rules governing the commission’s pr oceedings in relation 
to the orders set out below and to the extent necessary 
extending such time frames - okay I am going to rephrase that.  
He applicant’s non-compliance with the rime frames provided for 
in the rules governing the commission’s proceeding s in relation 
to applications for Leave to Cross-examine a witness is hereby 
20 
condoned. 
2. The applicant is hereby granted in terms of Rule 3.3.6 read with 
Rules 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 leave to give oral evidence and 
to cross-examine the witnesses who have given evidence and 
implicated him names Mr Angelo Agrizzi and Mr Frans Hedrick 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 3 of 176 
 
Steyn Vorster on such terms  as the Chairperson will give at the 
commencement of the cross-examination.   
3. The applicant is granted leave in terms of Rule 3.9 to make 
written and oral submissions on the possible findings and 
conclusions that the commission ought to make on the evidence 
placed before it insofar as that evidence relates to him.   
The cross-examination of Mr Agrizzi will take place on Wednesday this 
week and at the c ommencement of the proceedings I will announce the 
amount of time that I will give the applicant to cross -examine each one 
of those two witnesses. 
10 
Yes Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair on the 15 t h August 2019 the 
commission dispatched correspon dence to Mr Duduzane Zuma and his 
legal team wherein Mr Duduzane Zuma was invited to appear before 
this commission and to answer questions by the commission’s legal 
team.  And on the 5 t h September 2019 the commission dispatched a 
letter to Mr Zuma and his legal team responding to a letter which was 
inadvertently not responded to of the 20 t h June 2019 where Mr Zuma 
and his legal team were assured that today when we commence with 
the proceedings they would not be postponed and that we will – you will 
20 
never stand down the matter as there were queries relating to the 
previous sittings.  Fundamentally Mr Chair Mr Zuma was also informed 
that today he will be expected to answer questions in relation to six 
witnesses that testified before this commission and their e vidence was 
previously led through different members of the legal team.  For 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 4 of 176 
 
completeness Chair those witnesses are the evidence Mr Jonas, Mr 
Dukwana, Advocate Ramatlhodi, Advocate Muofhe, Mr Booysen and Mr 
Sundaram.  And that correspondence was duly ackno wledged and 
received by Mr Duduzane Zuma’s legal team.  Mr Duduzane Zuma is 
here today.  He has available himself to come and answer those 
questions.  He is being represented by different legal teams depending 
as to on which matter one it is referring to ma y I allow them an 
opportunity to place themselves on record Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us do that. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair I appear for Mr Zuma together with Mr 
10 
Joubert in – on instructions from Mr Van Der Merwe who sits next to 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS: Mr Commissioner I appear on behalf of Mr 
Duduzane Zuma on all issues in respect of he will – of which he will be 
cross-examined save in relation to Mr Mcebisi Jonas instructed by MDK 
Attorneys Mr Krause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair if I may perhaps say the following.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  We – Mr Zuma has not been subpoenaed to be here 
in terms of the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I was going to make that point as well.  
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 5 of 176 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  That means that there are certain limitations on the 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And what our learned colleagues can ask of Mr 
Zuma and what he is legally obliged to do in that regard.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I want to give you the assurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  That we are not going to take any technical points.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  However there must be a basis laid before our 
learned friend and of course you have to give  permission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  For cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Zuma is here as I say not under subpoena but 
because he wants to be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And we would expect our learned colleague  to be 
interested in what he has to say. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And that our learned colleague will not present a 
case against Mr Zuma as if they are in opposing camps.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And I take it that this commission will als o be open 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 6 of 176 
 
to accept what Mr Zuma has to say and you will make your findings in 
due course.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So once again these are not adversarial 
proceedings they are inquisitorial and we are merely here to assist in 
the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair surely this proceedings will be 
10 
conducted in terms – within the ambit of the Rules of the Commission 
and I think the one that is also paramount would be Rule 3.2 whereby 
questions should be posed in order to assess and in order to get to the 
truthful of the evidence of any witness that appears before the 
commission.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  For the purpose of this se ssion Mr Chair 
we will be referring to a number of documents. Before you Chair there 
must be three arch lever files.  You will see Chair that at the spine of 
the two files you will find that the one it is marked as A and the one it 
20 
is marked as B.  Those are the documents which were referred and 
relied upon when Mr Jonas was led.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. And you will see that there is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is A and B? 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 7 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is A and B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That really relates to Mr Jonas and for 
ease of reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We propose that that A and B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Be referred to as Exhibit LL1.  You will 
see when you open – when you open a folder of the first thick file Chair 
there must be a divider that already has marked it Exhibit LL1.  But for 
10 
ease of reference you can also refer to them because they are marked 
at the spine as A and B simply for you to be able to locate it with much 
more ease.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if we just say they are Exhibit LLA, Exhibit LLB, 
Exhibit LLC would that not be adequate?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It might not because when you now deal 
with different witnesses we have now created a separate f older for 
each.  Even though the numbering might be – might be continuous but 
for convenience it becomes much more easy if you know that LL1 it is 
for document in respect of Mr Dukwana.  LL2 is the second witness, 
20 
LL3 is the following witness’.  If you go to the document Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I can see…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is A.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can see it is just that the way we have dealt with 
Exhibits most of the time you will recall is that I prefer that what the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 8 of 176 
 
Exhibit is should be r eflected on the spine of the lever arch file.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that if I am looking for Exhibit LL1…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It should be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I should see that on the spine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I should not see Exhibit LL and then I have to go 
through a documents. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Definitely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Inside to find. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is one – that is one had hoped that 
has happened but Chair we will deal with that file.  But for the purposes 
of the questioning in this regard you will see that the first file goes 
from page 1 and the numbering that we are relying on because these 
documents were used from time to time they might be having different 
numberings but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are going to restrict ourselves to the 
red numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That you will find on the left hand side.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then if you go to the first file it must 
be going from page 1 and it ends up at page 334.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you under A? 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 9 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am under A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see what we could do is on the spine we could 
write Exhibit LL1 to Exhibit LL2 if inside the  lever arch file you have got 
both Exhibit LL1 and Exhibit LL2.  So at least on the spine the reader is 
told what is insider. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja we can mark the two files A and B.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As LL1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both of them 1. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So then we can have LL1A  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And LL1B. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And LL1B.  Yes it makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  As long as what is inside if th ere is 
different exhibits is reflected on the spine as well.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No that – the third file is the one that 
now have Exhibit – the LL2 up until LL7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So for now let us mark as the Chair has 
20 
proposed. The first file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As LL1A and the next file dealing with 
the matters relevant to Mr Jonas as LL1B. An the third file is the small 
file Chair. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 10 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you must just – we must just remember to make 
sure the witnesses files are also appropriately marked so if we talk 
about Exhibit LL1A, Exhibit LL1B.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He knows exactly which file you are talking about.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes in fact while I am still addressing 
the Chair someone can simply do that while I am still addressing the 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Not even in tea time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Because it is going to be easy for now 
for reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the third file Chair you will see the 
one that was only marked C on the spine we can then refer to it as 
because it is having – it is having LL2 up until LL7 we mark it on the 
spine to be LL2 to LL7.  No the Exhibits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the third file which is marked Duduzane Zuma 
prep bundle C. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the spine will be marked Exhibit LL2 to Exhibit 
LL7. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 11 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now that file Chair the one it is LL2C 
you will see if you open it it is divided into sub -folders.  Folder number 
2 it is all the documents that you are referred to when Mr Mxolisi 
Dukwana was led and folder number 3 relates to all the documents 
which were relied upon and referred to when Mr Sundaram was led.  
And folder number 4 relates to the documents which were referred to 
when Mr Booysens was led.  Folder number 5 relates to all the 
documents which were referred to when Mr – when Advocate 
Ramatlohodi was led.  And folder number 6 – folder number 7 Chair 
relates to only two documents.  The first document it is a document 
10 
depicting the directorship of Mr Duduzane Zuma in various entities and 
the second document relates to – depicts the shareholding which was 
held by Mabengela Investment which is an entity that was owned by Mr 
Duduzane Zuma.  And two last documents Chair for ease of reference 
we have also produced the A3 size documents.  I am not sure if they 
found themselves in file because they are far mu ch more legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the last documents appear to me to be 
diagrams? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The diagrams.  Those are the ones that 
you are referring to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Those will be the documents Chair  that 
we will be referring to from time to time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And Chair we are ready to proceed.  May 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 12 of 176 
 
the witness be sworn in?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes that is fine. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record:  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Duduzane Zuma. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give you be the 
10 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Before Mr 
Mokoena you – before you start Mr Zuma I just want to emphasise a 
point that your counsel or one of your counsel made is that you are not 
here because you have been subpoenaed to be here.  You are not here 
because you have been compelled to be here.  You are here because 
you decided last year when your application for Leave to Cross -
examine Mr Jonas was being dealt with that you would co -operate with 
20 
the commission and that you would make yourself available to the 
commission to give evidence.  I did say at the time and I want t o repeat 
today that I think that was a good decision. This is an opportunity 
where whatever it is that any witness may have said about you, you get 
an opportunity to put your side of the story and the commission has no 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 13 of 176 
 
particular preferred version.  The co mmission was to just get to the 
truth.  You put your side, other witnesses have put their side. At the 
end of the day I will look at all the aversions and decide what I believe 
the truth is.  So I just want you to – to know that all versions will be 
looked at and will be considered and you must just put your side of the 
story.  Questions will be put to you by the evidence leader.  In putting 
questions he too does not have any particular preference for any 
version he too seeks to simply try and establish wha t the truth is.  I 
may ask you questions as well I probably will ask you some questions.  
The whole point is just to make sure that I understand what your 
10 
version is.  I understand what other witness’ version is.  I may have – I 
may put questions that indicate that I have some difficulty with some 
aspects of either of your version or of another witness’ version but that 
does not mean that there is any version that is being preferred by the 
Chairperson.  It just seems – it just means that I want to establish  
where the truth lies.  So if you do not understand any question feel free 
to say so and it will be repeated and I am sure some of these things 
your counsel have explained but I just want to make sure that you 
understand.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand.  Okay.  Thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Zuma I have a very limited time to 
canvass a number of issues with you.  What will assist the process in 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 14 of 176 
 
order to short circuit your evidence is if we can agree on the common 
cause issues?  Common cause issues are those which after having read 
all the documents it does not appear as if there is any dispute around 
them.  Do you understand?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  The first one is that a meeting did 
take place on the 23 r d October 2015, correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You are the one who arranged the 
meeting? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You might … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The meeting…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just wish – I am sorry to raise your voice Mr Zuma.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes or bring the microphone a little closer but not too 
close.  Ja.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  The meeting did take place at the 
Gupta residence, correct?  
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And you are the one who 
suggested the Gupta residence as the venue?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. And you are the one who also drove 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 15 of 176 
 
Mr Jonas from the Hyatt Hotel to the Gupta residence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  At the time you know if you can 
just clarify for me – at the time when this meeting took place on the 
23 r d October 2015 would I be correct that you were already conducting 
business with the Gupta’s?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You talking about the actual business relation? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  And also at the time when this 
10 
meeting was arranged I mean it is common cause that your father was 
still the President at the time, am I corr ect? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Mr Zuma. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  Now the common cause issue is 
that when this meeting was arranged Mr Jonas was the Deputy Minister 
for Finance, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And Mr Nene was the Minister of 
Finance? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Sir. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And on the 9 t h December if my memory 
serves me well I think on the 9 t h December 2015 two months after your 
meeting Mr Nene was then dismissed from  his position, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is the time frame yes that is correct.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  Now when you arranged this 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 16 of 176 
 
meeting with Mr Jonas you were not friends, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Friends with who – Mr Jonas? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With Mr Jonas? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No not at all. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You did not conduct any business with 
him? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You did not even sit in the 
structures within the ANC, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now having dealt with those common 
cause issues I just want to now move to another topic which is the 
Gupta residence as the chosen venue for the meeting, correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You have made or delivered an 
application in this commission and you have deposed to an affidavit in 
support of your Rule 3.4 application, do you recall?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I recall. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now I want to refer you to a bundle 
and for ease of reference you can look at the spine is the one that we 
20 
have referred to as LL1B.  And if you may turn to page 735 concentrate 
on the red numbering so that you are not confused Mr Zuma.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 735 Chair. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 17 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You will see that on page 735 this is the 
statement which you have provided to this commission is support of 
your application in terms of Rule 3.4 where you applying to participate 
in these proceedings and also to cross -examine Mr Jonas.  But if you 
may refer to page 737 Chair.  On page 737 paragraph 7 you told the 
Chair through your statement that…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second Mr Mokoena.  I think this lever 
arch file is too full.  Maybe during the tea break another lever arch file 
can be used. There is something wrong with this or moving from a page 
10 
somewhere at the beginning towards the end is problematic.  It i s 7? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  737 Chair with particular reference to 
paragraph number 7.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Are you there Mr Zuma? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  [Indistinct] Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then in that paragraph you s tated 
the following:   
“When 
these 
rumours 
started 
to 
surface 
Mr 
Hlongwane in discussion with me decided to set up a 
20 
meeting with Mr Jonas in an attempt to clear it up.  
As Mr Jonas also in his discussion with Mr 
Hlongwane wanted to know from me directly w hen 
the rumours were spreading or coming from.   The 
important part is that eventually a meeting was 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 18 of 176 
 
arranged for 23 r d October 2015 at the Hyatt Hotel, 
Rosebank at about 13:00 or – to 13:30.” 
And that is what you conveyed in that affidavit, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So you would agree with me that at least 
from having read that paragraph there is no ambiguity pertaining to the 
agreement as far as it related to the venue.  Am - am I correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And when you agreed at least on your 
version with Mr Jonas to meet at the Hyatt you did not raise any 
10 
concerns that the Hyatt Hotel is not private enough.  Am I correct - to 
discuss the rumour? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes; and I - I just want you know I mean 
from your own independent recollection and knowing the Hyatt Hotel 
would I be correct that if there was a need to secure a private venue at 
the Hyatt Hotel that could hav e been easily arranged.  Am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  So in other words there could not 
have been any need to do - to go to the Gupta residence while the 
20 
Hyatt Hotel could have offered another private  venue? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  You - it was you and Mr Jonas - 
and Mr Hlongwane who decided on the change of the venue.  The 
change of the venue had nothing to do with Mr  Jonas.  Am I correct? 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 19 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That will be incorrect.  We all agreed to move 
the venue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Jonas has agreed with you - I 
am simply you know trying to clarify and - and following the sequence 
of events.  Remember that you and Mr  Jonas have agreed to meet at 
the Hyatt Hotel. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No issues of privacy were raised with 
Mr Jonas? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At that point no. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  It is only when he arrived when he 
is being told that a private venue is being sought.  Am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  When he arrived at the Hyatt?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When you arrived at the Hyatt, yes.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, yes.  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is the only point.  Am I correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is the only point.  Yes that is …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now I take it that at the time 
yourself, Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas were members of the ANC.  You 
were comrades.  Am I correct?  
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And in fact was there any reason why 
the three comrades could not have actually suggested to meet at 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 20 of 176 
 
Luthuli House to discuss the rumour?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  They would find that a bit strange 
because Luthuli House is a political office.  It has got nothing to do 
with myself at least. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But I am saying that at least the three of 
you were comrades … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Who belonged to that organisation.  
10 
There is this rumour that appeared to be troubling either you or 
Mr Hlongwane and I am - I am posing this question in the light of 
Mr Hlongwane - what Mr Hlongwane has said. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Maybe let me refer you to the same file - 
the same number file number B. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you may turn to page 5-1-7 and you 
will understand why I am posing  that question.  Why you have chosen 
the Gupta residence and Luthuli House.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We - we remain with the same file?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page - same file Chair.  We are in the 
same file.  Page 5-1-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now if you were to go to lines number 19 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 21 of 176 
 
and 20 - by the way simply to orientate you.  This is the transcript 
Mr Zuma which recorded the interview between Mr  Hlongwane and the 
Public Protector and the date of that was on 11  October 2016 and 
during his interview if you go to lines 19 and 20 that is what - he said 
the following to the Public Protector.  
“The meeting was essentially a meeting between us 
as comrades - ANC comrades - to address the issue 
that was disturbing to me.  Duduzane knows the 
people in that space.  I do not.”  
So that is the basis of the question as to instead of having 
10 
chosen you know the Gupta residence would this not have made sense 
in line with what Mr Hlongwane has said that this the meeting between 
the comrades you know and to choos e? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That does not make any sense to me sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Does not make any sense to you?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Alright.  At the - and at the time also 
when this meeting was arranged would I be correct that you were either 
a shareholder, a member or a director in various companies?  I do not 
have to go to their names for now.  I am just saying that as at 
20 
23 October 2015.  Am I correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  They also have offices and boardrooms.  
Am I correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 22 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It did - it did not make sense to you also 
to arrange the meeting there rather than the Gupta residence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At that time it was a proximity and a timeframe 
issue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So we had to - chose the closest possible area 
to meet. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So that is why we met at the residence.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now when you talk to proximity during 
10 
that time am I not correct to say that you in fact owned a property in 
Saxonwold and to be more specific you owned a property at number 18 
Griswold Street in Saxonwold and on my little research it is 600 metres  
from the Gupta residence and it is almost seven minutes’ walk from the 
Gupta residence. 
Why was that not the logical private place to meet and why 
choosing the Gupta residence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I think what we need to understand is I have 
conducted many meetings from the Gupta residence.  On a daily basis 
that was a preferred meeting place outside of an office environment.  
20 
My residence purely was a private residence for my - for my stay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have never conducted any meetings out of my 
- my private place.  So we did not go there.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I was addressing you know your last 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 23 of 176 
 
statement when you talk about proximity.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When I said Luthuli House could have 
been a logical place to go.  You said that well because you were at the 
Hyatt Hotel in Rosebank it made sense for you to go to the Gupta 
house … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And yet you had another house …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And according to you was it not private 
10 
enough - your house? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not conduct meeting from my private 
residence. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Oh, but was - but was the reason not - 
the logical reason why the Gupta residence became appealing and the 
logical venue you know to hold this meeting was it - was it not because 
there could have been one of the brothers of the Gupta to be part and 
parcel of the meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  That is not the case. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me ask this question.  On your version and 
the version of Mr Hlongwane what the three of you were going to 
discuss that is yourself, Mr  Hlongwane and Mr Jonas needed only the 
three of you and nobody else.  Is that right?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 24 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one would have expected that really if your - one 
of the three of you has a house close by that - that is where you would 
- you would go because on your version what you want ed to discuss 
had nothing to do with the Guptas.  So - so I - that is what I would 
expect because it is just the three of you and maybe what you wanted 
to discuss could very well be discussed as a very personal issue.  
As I understand the position and you m ust tell me if I am - my 
understanding is wrong.  You were friends with Mr  Hlongwane and 
Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas had been friends for a long time as I 
understand Mr Jonas’ evidence as well as Mr  Hlongwane’s affidavit.  
10 
That - that is what one would have expected. 
It is - it is something that has got nothing to do with - with the 
Guptas.  One of you has a house close by.  Why do you not just to go - 
to that house and sit there and discuss this personal matter among 
ourselves without anybody?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I - I see you now.  I understand what you are 
saying Chair but it was a private meeting between the three of us.  
There was no one else present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course to the extent that you - you or the three 
of you wanted a private meeting.  Then if you went to somebody else’s 
20 
house there could be - there was always a risk - there would always 
have been a risk of people intruding and so on.  Whereas if it was your 
house you would be in charge of the house and if you said you do not 
want anybody to interrupt the meeting then nobody would interrupt the 
meeting.  You understand that?  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 25 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand.  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I mean just piggybacking on what the 
Chair you know was trying to inqu ire from you.  We know as a matter of 
fact also that during that time you were a member if not a shareholder 
of Mabengela Investment.  Am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And I am sure that you have conducted a 
number of meetings in that Mabengela’s Offices?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Was it also not another option to hold 
this meeting among the friends and you know deal with it in a private 
atmosphere of your own company?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So Mr Jonas was coming from a Nedlac 
meeting.  That is where we agreed to meet in Rosebank.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You and Mr Jonas there is no ambiguity?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No, no.  I am just …  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You have agreed. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am just trying to point out because the 
distance between and my office - Rosebank and a private venue which 
was the residence …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 26 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Is vastly different.  It is much closer and then 
there was a third party who was coming to the meeting.  I am assuming 
from his own home in Hyde Park.  So we were all in that part of - of 
Johannesburg and the closest place was the place we met.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I see.  Now may I refer you to file - the 
very same file if you can go to page 5-0-7?  Just to close up you know 
the point that I was making in relation to your residence and let us see 
what Mr Hlongwane told the PP on page 5 -0-7.  If you go to line number 
nine to line 13 he said the following:  
“To the best of my knowledge I have been to 
10 
Duduzane’s place in Saxonwold.  It is a walking - 
maybe a minute than indistinct.  So in my you know 
to the best of my knowledge he does not live there 
…” 
And there I think is the Gupta residence.  
“…because I think he has a house nearby.  Have I 
been to his house?  Yes Madam.  I have been to his 
house.” 
Now you know following from what Mr  Hlongwane has said a 
person who has been in your house.  He is  the friend to Mr Jonas.  You 
20 
are still saying that it did not make sense for you to have a meeting at 
your house having the - the reason that you gave in terms of proximity?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  You will see Mr Hlongwane also 
proceeds on the very same page.  If you go - if you can go to line 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 27 of 176 
 
number - line number 25 and up until page 5-0-8 line 15.  He said … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Number, number 20? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page, page 5-0-7. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Alright.  Go to the last line of the page.  
He says - the following is being said by Advocate  Madonsela: 
“Because you say when you go there you go visit 
Duduzane.  That is what confusing me when I am 
asking does he live there .” 
And Mr Hlongwane says: 
10 
“No, no.  He lives in Saxonwold you said.  Have you 
been to Saxonwold?  Yes.  He does live in 
Saxonwold.  So it is.”  
Advocate Madonsela says: 
“Okay.  Have you been to the Gupta house?”  
And Mr Hlongwane says: 
“Yes Madam.  I have several times.  Several times?  
Yes.  At - as whose guest?  I will be going through 
Duduzane because he is the one that has primary 
relationship because you would find him there at 
20 
the Gupta house.  Oh.  Yes.  I find - I find him there 
sometimes we would go together in the same car.  
Let us put it this way.  The one chap that I met 
there is the one that is familiar with me.  So I do 
not know - I am not familiar with any other people.”  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 28 of 176 
 
You know consistent with the theme that I was say - I was 
trying to interrogate with the Chair and you know to simply point out the 
obvious fact that it might have been at the time when Mr  Jonas said he 
was going to meet at the Hyatt Hotel with you.  Already you had thought 
that a best venue should be the Gupta residence and for reasons that I 
have put to you before to say that because it was convenient to one of 
the Gupta brothers. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Because it was convenient for one of the 
Gupta brothers. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Now I want to ask.  I just want to ask a 
question.  When you say it was convenient you are saying that the 
meeting - the meeting at the house was already pre - pre-planned by 
the time we got to the Hyatt?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  What I am saying to you is that the 
meeting was planned and agreed upon you …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With Mr Jonas to meet at the Hyatt 
Hotel? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And for reasons which you tried to 
explain the meeting was moved to the Gup ta residence? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And I am saying that it was moved to the 
Gupta residence not to your house, not to the private venue in Hyatt 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 29 of 176 
 
Hotel, not to any of your offices where there might have been pri vate 
facilities.  Simply to accommodate that the must be a Gupta brother 
present in the meeting. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is not true sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  Now I want to share with you but I 
know that you might have read it also.  The version  of Mr Jonas you 
know pertaining to how he arrived at the Gupta residence.  If you can 
close File B and go to File number A.  Give you go to File number A 
sticking with the numbering on page - oh, the red numbering. 
Page 6 Chair is the relevant page and Mr  Zuma if you can 
10 
read paragraph 15 into the record.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry sir.  Can you just repeat what, what 
(intervenes)? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 6.  We are now on File number A.  
LL1A. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I am there. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And if you go to paragraph 1-5 and 
simply to - it is easy to understand what you would be reading.  If you 
go to page 1 of that document - page 3 of that document you will see is 
the statement of Mr Jonas which is submitted before this Commission at 
20 
the time when he adduced his evidence and if you may turn to 
paragraph 15 now page 6 and if you can read simply paragraph 15.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Read it. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, yes.  I am there. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 30 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  “We drove in Mr Duduzane Zuma’s 
car which appeared to be a two door Mercedes 
Benz.  I did not know the surrounding area very well 
and 
only 
gathered 
when 
we 
arrived 
at 
our 
destination that we had driven to the Guptas 
residence in Saxonwold.  Mr Duduzane Zuma did 
not suggest to me that we had left - that we left the 
Hyatt and that we were going to the Gupta 
residence or that we meet the Guptas.  As 
10 
Mr Duduzane Zuma parked his car I noticed that 
Mr Fana Hlongwane had also arrived at the Gupta  
residence.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  He is accurate.  Do - do you agree 
with him that this is what happened?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Which portion is this?  There are portions that 
I may agree.  There are portions that I may not agree with.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Well identify to the Chair which ones are 
you in agreement with and which ones are you not in agreement with.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am in agreement that he jumped into my car.  
20 
I am in agreement that we arrived at the Gupta residence but I am in  
disagreement that he did not know where we were going.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Well he was here as well.  He - he 
did testify not only in evidence in chief but he - I mean he was 
consistent in as far as that version is concerned even under cross as  to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 31 of 176 
 
the fact that when the venue was changed and when he - you decided 
to drive with - drive him to the Gupta residence he was not told that he 
was actually heading to the Gupta residence.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So he jumped in my car and decided he was - 
he was going to go where I take him?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, because he said that if you look at 
the preceding paragraphs he - he said that he thought that you were 
going to take him to go and meet other people.  He did not ask about 
the venue.  You took  him to the Gupta residence. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  He knew exactly where we were going and he - 
10 
he knew exactly who we - we were going to meet and why. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might have missed something. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he know that you were going to the Gupta 
residence when he jumped into the car or is that something he got to 
know after he had jumped into the car?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So there was phone call that happened in the 
interleading time because we were the two sitting at the Hyatt.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same day? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja.  On the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So this was after - this is during …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 32 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Our first interaction at the Hyatt Hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So there was notably a third gentleman that 
was not there.  He was on his way.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  A phone call came in.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A phone call came in and that is when 
the change of venue happened.  That discussion was had between 
myself and I call him “Uncle  Fana” Mr Hlongwane and I passed the 
10 
phone over to Mr Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes and we had a discussion and there was a 
mutual agreement to where we were going to meet …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And then there was decided that we will jump 
into my car and then the rest is documented.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I will shortly take you to Mr Hlongwane’s 
20 
evidence but if - let us - let us - while you are still on that same page 
simply to contextualise you know the evidence of Mr  Jonas and I am 
giving you this opportunity to react to it you know.  It is paragraph 14.  
He says that: 
“When Mr Duduzane Zuma arrived at the Hyatt 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 33 of 176 
 
Hotel we had a brief discussion.  He appeared quite 
nervous and spoke in very vague terms.  He said 
nothing of substance except to say that his father 
then President Jacob Zuma liked me.  After a while 
I indicated that I was under time pressure.  He said 
that the place was crowded and that he had 
important matters to discuss but that he wanted 
other people to join the discussion and that he 
wanted to drive to a more private place which  he 
said was close by.  I assumed that we - we would 
10 
be going to an office nearby.  So I said let us go.  I 
have received a call from Fana Hlongwane as 
Mr Duduzane - as Mr Duduzane Zuma and I told him 
that I was with Mr Zuma.” 
That is what actually he told the Chair when he testified and 
you said according to you that is not accurate?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is exactly what I am saying sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now the next topic that I need to 
address with you Mr Zuma is you know why - why you, you know.  Why 
were you the one chosen to facilitate this meeting to discuss you know 
20 
the rumour and that is the theme that I want to interrogate with you.  
Maybe let us start that by going to File B - File number B.  LL1B.  If 
you go to page 6-1-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say we must go to B?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  L - yes.  LL1B Chair. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 34 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what is the page number?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 6-1-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now you will see that is the affidavit of 
Mr Hlongwane the person whom you refer to as the uncle which was 
submitted in support of his Rule 3.4 application to cross -examine 
Mr Jonas and to participate in this Commission’s proceedings.  The 
relevant page that I want to take you through is page 6 -1-8.  6-1-8 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have got it. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Paragraph nine - paragraphs nine and 
10.  This is what Mr Hlongwane said in his affidavit.  He said:  
“I confirm that I know Mr  Jonas for many years and 
that we became good friends.”  
10: 
“When in fact tried to negotiate a number of 
transactions in the past.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  We 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  “The detail of such business 
relationship is …” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is says “we” Mr  Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  “We …” 
Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 35 of 176 
 
“We in fact - we in fact …” 
Thanks Chair. 
“We in fact tried to negotiate a number of 
transactions in the past.  The detail of such 
business relationship it is not relevant to the issues 
at hand and I will therefore not burden this 
statement with further details relating to this 
aspect.  The objective facts are that we knew each 
other well in October  2015.” 
Now that is what Mr Jonas (sic) at least informed the Chair 
10 
through the 3.4 affidavit.  What is quite cle ar from paragraphs nine and 
10 is that him and Mr  Jonas were friends they knew each other from 
long time ago.  Am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now what simply escapes one’s 
mind and I am - I am sure you are here to explain is that why would the 
two friends that knew each other from this long time decide that you 
must be the one who arranges a meeting simply to discuss a rumour.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Mokoena so you - you say why the two 
decide.  Is that what y ou intend saying? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No, no.  Why he …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Was chosen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 36 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Firstly I was not chosen.  I - I decided - I 
decided to put the meeting together and the reason for that is on the 
one side yes and they very good friends.  They have known each other 
- that is common cause - for a long time.  You have a situation where 
there is a number of things being said in the backgroun d. 
The one person is not aware of it and the other one is alleged 
to be talking about it.  So I would raise these matters over a period of 
time with Uncle Fana to say look you had a good relationship with 
Mr Jonas.  Why am I hearing that there is - these murmurs and these 
10 
rumours behind the scenes?  Why am I hearing that and you are not 
coming across it? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So by the third time of asking I said to him can 
we resolve this and he left the matter in my hands.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I was the one left responsible to put the 
meeting together which I did. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And - and that is exactly you know what I 
am trying to understand. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Me and you have agreed that you were 
not friends with Mr Jonas.  Correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You did not interact with him on any 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 37 of 176 
 
social level? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Not at all sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually I think according to Mr  Jonas the two of you 
had never met or intro - being introduced to each other until 
October 2015.  Is that right? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You also do not ev en have his cellphone 
number? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Yet you become the person that 
must facilitate this meeting. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Exactly as it happened, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Why - do you know why was it 
difficult?  I mean at the time they were still friends Mr  Jonas and 
Mr Hlongwane. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Why could one friend not call the other 
and say … 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Because the one …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And say that there is this rumour which 
you know it is disturbing.  Can we meet you know to deal with this 
rumour? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  (Intervenes). 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 38 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Why you become the third person to be 
the one to facilitate a meeting simply to discus s the rumour? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   As I’d said sir there is one person that’s 
aware of it and one person that’s not aware of it.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes but there’s nothing that is stopping 
one friend…[intervenes]. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Of course not. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   To call the other friend. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Of course not sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   To say that there is this rumour come 
10 
let’s discuss this rumour they don’t even need the third person, am I 
correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, now from your own version you 
say, if I understand it very well and I’m simply paraphrasing, is that the 
meeting of the 23 r d of October 2015 was simply for the three of you to 
meet and to discuss a rumour, no thing else there were no offers that 
were made and that’s your version?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that’s my version sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you move away from the previous question Mr 
20 
Mokoena I do want to get the full perspective from your side of your 
involvement because I think it’s important, it’s an issue that keeps on 
coming back to my mind as well, namely if as we now know, you had 
really never met Mr Jonas obviously you might have met in meetings 
but you have never been introduced to each other, you  didn’t know 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 39 of 176 
 
each other in that sense, and you were just friends with Mr Hlongwane 
and Mr Hlongwane had been friends with Mr Jonas for many years, it is 
strange that Mr Hlongwane shouldn’t either speak to Mr Jonas himself 
about these rumours or get somebody, that, if he can’t fro whatever 
reason or if he feels that maybe it won’t be – he needs a third person 
why he didn’t think of getting somebody who knew both himself and Mr 
Jonas to say, you know both of us, maybe you are friends with both of 
us there’s an issue between us, won’t you help us resolve this?  So that 
is that question in my mind and I would like to get your full perspective 
because it seems strange why somebody who is a stranger to one of 
10 
the parties should be asked to be the one to make arran gements for the 
two friends to meet and discuss an issue?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you Chair from my side, with all respect 
to you Chair, I don’t see it as strange that an unknown entity tries to 
resolve an issue.  I have been in meetings where people hav e put me 
together with other people in the room where I did not know the third 
party and similarly I’ve done this, not just with this matter with Mr 
Jonas but on numerous other occasions.  Sometimes everyone is known 
to each other in the room, sometimes th ere’s strangers in the room but 
the common issue is resolving the issue.  Now when it comes to why 
20 
me, I’m the one who raised the issue with uncle Fana, as I call him. 
Now the difficulty is if, in my view, if he approaches Mr Jonas at some 
point he’s going to ask where’s this coming from so now as – I mean 
I’m obviously the younger guy in the relationship so as the younger guy 
I said to him, look this needs to happen and he said if you’re putting 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 40 of 176 
 
your neck on the line you need to be part of that meeting bec ause when 
he asked me, who’s listening to people saying stuff he is going to ask 
who and that person is me.  So as part of the meeting set -up as part of 
putting the issue on the table they needed the horse’s mouth and I was 
the horse’s mouth.  So I don’t s ee it strange being in a meeting with an 
unknown person regardless of how long their relationship has been.  
There is an awkward issue, I’m the one that raised the issue, I’m the 
one that put the issue across that the meeting either resolve it or didn’t 
resolve it and that was it, it’s that simple.  
CHAIRPERSON:   In understand you completely, the need for you to be 
10 
present at the meeting to the extent that you might be the one who 
knew about these allegations or these rumours.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That I don’t have a problem with that, the difficulty 
that I have is, you being tasked with the responsibility of organising the 
meeting because that s my understanding of what your evidence it, that 
is my understanding of what Mr Hlongwane says in his affidavit.  I 
would understand if, what Mr Hlongwane did was either to speak to Mr 
Jonas and say, let’s have a meeting or get somebody else to arrange 
that who is known to Mr Jonas but say you must be present because 
20 
you know about these rumours, th at would have – I would have 
understood.  But with regard to why it may be – at least for me, it’s 
natural to expect that in this situation, Mr Hlongwane – one would 
expect Mr Hlongwane to either speak to Mr Jonas himself to arrange 
the meeting or to get somebody who is known to both of them is that, in 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 41 of 176 
 
a way the two parties who have issues need to have confidence in the 
third party that is being brought in, you understand that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if you don’t know somebody i t might be difficult 
to have confidence in that person for purposes of helping to find a 
solution to a problem.  Whereas if it is somebody that you know, and 
maybe both parties, namely Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas have 
confidence in that person they trust tha t person won’t be biased, will 
just try to help them.  Maybe they know that, that person has got skills 
of trying to help people resolve issues, then it makes a lot of sense to 
10 
me, you understand, that’s where I’m coming from with my question but 
you have put your perspective but if you have got something more that 
you would like to say about it, please feel free to do so.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Maybe to help me understand, as you 
have attempted to make the Chair understand, if I may refer you to 
page 737 of the same bundle …[intervenes].  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe, I’m sorry Mr Mokoena, maybe just to 
complete the picture of what I was saying Mr Zuma, in that kind of 
situation where the two friends – where two friends have an issue they 
want to resolve between themselves, actually, if the one friend knows 
that the person being proposed to play the role of helping them resolve 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 42 of 176 
 
this issue is a friend to the other one but a stranger to him, he might be 
more reluctant to agree to this person but if the person who is being 
asked to help them resolve the issue is somebody that is either friends 
with both of them or not friends with any o ne of them but knows them, 
then there might be more chances of acceptance, you understand?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I understand Chair, if I may just…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I was tasked with this, it was a simple – if 
you’re raising this my laaitjie you run with it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s exactly what I did, you resolve the 
issues if you are going to raise these sorts of matters then you need to 
put your skin in the game and that’s exactly what I did be cause I 
needed to stand by whatever it was that information was being passed 
around and I needed to communicate.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Now I strongly disagree with you Chair that – I 
understand your point that there’s a certain way certai n meetings are 
conducted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   This was informal, these sorts of meetings 
happens all the time, like I said I’ve been part of meetings where I 
haven’t known certain people in the room but I was asked to attend 
certain meetings, we’ve either resolved the issues or we haven’t 
resolved the issues and we’ve moved on and this case is exactly that 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 43 of 176 
 
case it’s not the first time it’s happened and will continue to happen, 
just purely to put matters on the table to try and resolve th em Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you must just understand when I put questions 
to you like this, that it doesn’t mean that’s a permanent view in my 
mind. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s simply to be transparent with you to say this is 
what’s going on in my mind, tell me what you might be able to tell me 
and my view might change at the end but it’s just to be transparent with 
you to say, this is what is concerning me, what can you tell me about it.  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I appreciate it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Your view looks like it’s changed so 
[indistinct]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Chair just a few questions I just want to 
wrap up on this issue I see that we are getting to quarter past.  I have 
referred you to page 737 simply to close on this issue that we’re 
debating with the Chair and piggy backing on it.  If you read paragraph 
eight, just one line, and that’s really what troubles me about how this 
thing was arranged, you are saying there, it’s your affida vit, 
20 
 
“I met Mr Jonas for the first time at the Hyatt Hotel as 
 
arranged by telephone discussions, SMS exchanges between 
 
us”, 
 
And I think, that’s, you know support what the Chair or at least 
you know also brings into light the questions as to why you – you are 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 44 of 176 
 
meeting with them for the first time, you don’t know each other, you are 
coming to discuss this rumour and that’s why we are posing those 
questions to you so that we can at least make sense of what you are 
saying that, why you, why were you the chos en one? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes as I said earlier on I haven’t disagreed 
with any of the questions that you’ve put forward, I haven’t disagreed 
with me having to have agreed with you that I met them for the first 
time whether it was via SMS, whether it was  via a phone call that was 
the first time I met them and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  
How do you meet people, you make contact and it’s either they want to 
10 
meet you or they don’t want to meet you for whatever reason and we 
met? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Ja and this rumour, since it was 
troubling Mr Jonas so much and I think you also were troubled with it to 
the extent that you know, there was this meeting that you had to 
facilitate, did you approach any of the other senior ANC members, you 
know, to tell them about this rumour amongst these comrades?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No it was no one else’s business it was 
between the two of them and I was trying to resolve it.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair is this the appropriate time to 
take the tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes we will take the tea adjournment.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   I might have stepped into some of the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 45 of 176 
 
minutes of the tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it is after quarter past we’ll take the tea 
adjournment and resume at twenty five to twelve, we adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us proceed Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Thank you Chair.   Except Mr Chair that 
we might have competition with the air conditioner and I know that at 
some point you see that my voice is fading.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I will try to raise my voice but I will also 
Mr Zuma to try his level best.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes he has a soft voice. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us see there have been times when we have had 
to switch it off because one cannot hear properly.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It interferes yes.  We will try. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us see how we go. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Zuma I want to explore the last topic 
20 
you know on the issues pertaining to Mr Jonas and what transpired on 
the 23 r d October 2015 and clearly that topic is that you know simply to 
explore who was present at th e meeting and what really happened at 
the meeting you know and that will be my last topic out of that. Having 
in mind the fact that your version is quite clear that the meeting was 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 46 of 176 
 
simply to discuss a rumour and it was between amongst the three of 
you at Gupta residence, am I correct?  That is?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes ja.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And if I may refer you to file A – A Chair.  
And if you may turn to page 4.  That is Mr Jonas’ witness statement 
which he submitted before this commission.  And I will try to summarise 
what is contained in there in order to save time.  If you look at 
paragraphs – you know from page 4 paragraph 3 to page 6 paragraph 
10 
14 Mr Jonas gives details specifications and times when different calls, 
exchange of sms’, even the missed calls which you know occurred 
between yourself him and you know Mr Hlongwane at some point.  The 
question that I simply – and if you look at that detailed narration  of 
what transp – what according to him transpired and the exchange of the 
telephone or of the cell phone calls and the sms’ you will not find at 
least from his version where he says that prior to the 23 r d October 2015 
when you called him you disclosed to him that the reason for the 
meeting was to discuss the rumour.  Would I be – would that be a fair 
reading of your statement?  
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sir can you please repeat that question?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  The question is if you read Mr Jonas’ 
statement those paragraphs that I have referred to you will not find 
anywhere where he says when he called you; you disclosed to him that 
you know the purpose for this meeting was supposed to be to discuss 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 47 of 176 
 
the rumour, would that be a fair reading of Mr Jonas’?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I understand the question that will be a 
fair readings. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now I want to know from you I 
mean having regard from the time when you started inviting him to the 
awards up until the 23 r d October 2015 did you disclose to him that you 
wanted to discuss with him a rumour and if so you know I might have 
missed it also in your affidavit.  If you can point me to your affidavit 
where you have said that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No that was discussed. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You told him? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes the meeting is to discuss an issue between 
himself and Uncle Fana. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Okay.  And then is that what you 
conveyed at some point in your affidavit?  I might have missed it.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not sure if it is there or not – can I just 
reflect on it? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Ja because I seem to recall – I might 
20 
you know I am speaking under correction that I have read your 
affidavit. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That was deposed to in support of the 
3.4 you know application.  I did not seem to recall seeing that during 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 48 of 176 
 
that exchange of calls, sms’, you told him that the reason for the 
meeting it is simply to discuss the rumour.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct if you look at my affidavit Sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  There is no detailing of any sms’, or phone 
calls either. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I did not touch upon any of th ose topics at 
all. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And this … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I just want to make sure I understand that 
correctly.  Are you admitting that in the affidavit that you deposed to in 
support of your application for Leave to Cross -examine Mr Jonas you 
did not anywhere indicate that you did not anywhere in the affidavit 
indicate that ahead of the meeting you had told him that the purpose of 
the meeting you were seeking to have was to discuss the rumour.  That 
is – that is what you are saying?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What I am saying is that and many other topics 
that may have been discussed telephonically or sms – or by sms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have not included in my affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the affidavit? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay good. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And if you look at you know those 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 49 of 176 
 
paragraph of Mr Jonas he is detailing you know even the text of the 
messages that were exchanged between the two of you.  He gives you 
the time frames around when this text message were exchanged and 
also the telephone calls that were made between the two of you.  Now 
what I want to understand is that all this effort was simply made in 
order to discuss the rumour and that is your version?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Okay.  Now you also state in your 
affidavit before this commission that at some point during that meeting 
one of the Gupta brothers did peep inside the room in order to 
10 
ascertain your availability for the next d ay in a different meeting.  And 
you say that was Rajesh Gupta, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed Mr Mokoena.  Let me go back to 
the earlier question.  So you say that in one or other conversation on 
the phone between yourself and Mr Jonas prior to the 23 r d October you 
had told him what the meeting was about.  It is just that you did not 
include that in the affidavit?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And when you told him what was his attitude?  
20 
I take it it might have been – it might or might not have been I do not 
know the first time that he heard about there being rumours that had 
reached your ears – maybe reached Mr Hlongwane’s ears.  What was 
his reaction? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  His – his reaction the whole time was very 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 50 of 176 
 
relaxed and calm.  I think he took his – his understanding with the 
relationship that he may have had with Uncle Fana at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That that face value to be nothing untoward.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So it was not – there were not any – any 
apprehensions of any sort.  It was like okay if that is the case we will 
do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Not subject to scheduling an availability that 
10 
only happened a bit further down the line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But there was no hostility of any sort from 
anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Mr – Mr Mokeona may have been intending 
to mention this but let me say.  In one of the statements that I think  Mr 
Jonas deposed to which is in one of the files he refers to a meeting or 
an occasion when he met with Mr Hlongwane in the presence of 
somebody called Mr Bongani More and as I understand it he says on 
that occasion Mr Hlongwane told him that you would li ke to talk to him 
20 
and – and as I understand it it was on that occasion that he therefore 
asked for your number that is Mr Jonas.  I hope I am getting it right.  Is 
the position that he was the first one to make contact with you between 
the two of you to make contact with you in terms of either a phone call 
or a sms? 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 51 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I would be…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two of you? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chair I do not recall.  I will have to check that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But I am inclined to say that I probably 
contacted him first.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I will have to check that I am not sure.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair the…  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You see the context of that question 
would be – I mean they were meeting that is Mr Hlongwane and Mr 
Jonas on that occasion. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to the 23 r d.  If – and I think it was – it may have 
been October or September I cannot remember.  So if…  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It is September? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Really Hlongwane was concerned about rumours 
about something that Mr Jonas was said to be – I mean rumours that he 
was said to be spreading one would have thought that he would have 
20 
talked to him about them to try and resolve it  or told him what you 
wanted to talk to him about rather than say to him somebody that you 
have never met wants to talk to you about it.  But we have discussed 
the issue but I just put that angle for the sake of completeness.  But if 
there is something you want to say about it feel free to do so.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 52 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No I think we have covered that point.  Thank 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair we do not even need to speculate 
about the chronology. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  If one turns to page 4 where I have 
referred to page 4 and paragraph 3, 4 and 5 and I think that would 
assist and bring light to the questions of the Chair.   
“Mr Jonas is at on or approximately 27, 28 August 
10 
2015 when I was in Luanda at an African caucus of 
finance ministers.  I recall being contacted by Mr 
Fana Hlongwane whom I knew relatively well telling 
me that Mr Duduzane Zuma would like to speak to 
me to invite me to an awards ceremony.  
4. I subsequently met Mr Hlongwane during October 
2015 in Johannesburg in the presence of Mr Bongani 
…”   
Chair you are referring to him as More  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  May I think I would be safe to mention to 
him as More. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am embarrassed.  Yes so it might be More. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It might be More Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 53 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.   
“Bongani More and who told me that Mr Duduzane 
Zuma wanted to meet me.  During the course of the 
conversation he mentioned that the Gupta’s were 
important to him.  I indicated that I would not want to 
be associated with the Gupta’s.   
5. I asked Mr Hlongwane to provide me with Mr 
Duduzane Zuma’s number.  I had not previously met 
Mr Duduzane Zuma nor had any previous interactions 
with him.” 
10 
And that is what you know the context about the questions of the Chair.  
Now moving to the topic that we dealing with is that you say that you 
were sure that the person who peeped in – in the room was Mr Rajesh 
Gupta? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And you say that you are certain that it 
was him definitely? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now may I refer you to file number B.  If 
you could put file number A away.  File B page 517.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry it is 517? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, yes Mr Duduzane. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you Sir.

Page 54 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We did visit this transcript before but for 
different reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page did you say? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 517 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  If you go to line…  
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be – Mr – I am sorry Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that we should – you should try and 
approach the end of the …  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  This line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Jonas. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I will try to – I will try to do that Chair.  
517 Line 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I will just read to you what Mr 
Hlongwane told the PP in relation to who might have been present or 
not and I will do it quickly.   In order to save time I will read it.  From 
20 
line 19 he says: 
“The meeting was essentially a meeting between us 
as comrades.  ANC comrades to address the issue 
that was disturbing to me, Duduzane – to me.  
Duduzane knows the people in that space I do not.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 55 of 176 
 
Somebody did come into that space.  I would – for 
me I made an assumption that it is a member of the 
Gupta family.  Somebody slim – somebody of slim 
height, slim build entered the room.  He was clearly 
known to Duduzane and briefly – and left.  Whether 
the person was looking for another meeting or 
another person I cannot say to you but Duduzane … 
then the question is posed did that person speak to 
Mr Jonas no.  Did you ever have occasion to leave 
the room?   No I did not have occasion to leave the 
10 
room.” 
And then line number 6 right on page 15 of your affidavit paragraph 27 
you say: 
“I deny that Mr AJAY Gupta was present at the 
meeting or that any member of the Gupta family ever 
participated in the discussions between ourselves.  
In this regard I can categorically state that I had not 
met AJAY Gupta at that stage.  He was completely 
unknown to the – unknown to me then.  Earlier on I 
thought you said you met AJAY before that meeting 
20 
at a Parkhurst.  No, no I can explain.  Okay.  With 
this thing Advocate – no Advocate I did not say I met 
AJAY earlier on I said I met Rajesh for lunch with  
Duduzane.  Oh was it Rajesh in Parkhurst?  Yes.”  
Okay. On paragraph 28 you say: 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 56 of 176 
 
“There is a person who came into the room.  It was 
definitely not AJAY.  You said you had met Rajesh 
before, was it Rajesh?”   
Mr Hlogwane says then: 
“The person that came in was in build Mr Frans 
Lekubo in build and height so it was not the fellow I 
had lunch with at Parkhurst.  So it was not AJAY?  
Mr Hlongwane says number 1 it was not the fellow I 
had lunch with in Parkhurst and the fellow you had 
lunch you say it was Rajesh?   Mr Hlongwane says 
10 
Rajesh yes and it was not any of the female’s two 
brothers.  Maybe there is more but it was not any of 
the female’s brothers.  It was not AJAY, it was not 
Rajesh.  Yes.” 
That is what he says.   
“Are you sure it was not Rajesh that you h ad lunch 
with in Parkhurst?” 
Yes I am sure it was.  Now if I can simply pause there and I am simply 
posing this question so that at least this part of evidence must be clear 
also at the Chair.  On the one hand you are saying that definitely it was 
20 
Rajesh that came in.  Mr Hlongwane says that no it was not Rajesh and 
it was not any of the female’s you know brothers.  And the question is 
that which version should the Chair believe when he assesses this 
evidence?  Who really came in?  Who was there?  Who it te lling the 
truth?  Who is not telling the truth?  You or your uncle?  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 57 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I believe looking at the events and the 
versions from what the uncle is saying – Uncle Fana I cannot – I cannot 
give an opinion.  I cannot give a view on it.  He was the re, he was saw 
what he saw.  He did see what he did not see.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I know what I saw.  I know the lay of the land 
in that house very well.  The gentleman that walked in was a Mr Rajesh 
Gupta. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And I am posing this question 
because he seems to say to the PP – the Public Protector but he had 
10 
met Rajesh before.  He knows him and he is definitely sure that the 
person that came in was Mr Rajesh.  And on the one hand you are 
saying that well it was Rajesh.  And I am simply putting that so that you 
know one must at least know what really transpired on the day and who 
was present on the day.  And both of you are certain about what you 
are saying.  But now both versions unfortunately cannot be r econciled.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  How so?  How so Sir? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Because Mr Hlongwane says that Rajesh 
never came in it was not Rajesh.  And you say that it was Rajesh.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I can only speak for what I know. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you know did Mr Hlongwane know Mr Rajesh 
Gupta quite well?  I think earlier on there was reference to I think his 
affidavit that is Mr Hlongwane where he seems to have said he had 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 58 of 176 
 
visited the Gupta residence several times.  So as far you know did he 
know him quite well? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At that point definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you know he did not know him quite well at 
that time? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I am the one that introduced the two of 
them so I know they did not know each other.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Well that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the other Gupta brothers do you know 
10 
whether he knew them quite well?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  My understanding is I do not think he had met 
them prior to this event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To that meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Or – ja that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But I mean he appeared to be very sure 
from what I have read you know when he told the PP he was clearly 
sure that it was Rajesh – it was not Rajesh that came in and he said 
20 
the reason why he knows it was not him it is because he has met with 
him before. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is exactly what it appears to be. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  We are reading the same document but I was 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 59 of 176 
 
not there when the Public Protector meeting was happening so I cannot 
comment on that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now let us also deal with another point 
that is not quite clear while you are still on that file and I am trying to 
move as fast as I can because the Chair have told me to wrap up this 
issue.  If you turn to page 724  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  74? 
CHAIRPERSON:  724 yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  724 okay.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Or maybe you can even leave that.  Go 
10 
to 729.  That is the affidavit of Mr AJAY Gupta which was also 
submitted before this commission.  The relevant portion Mr Zuma is the 
one that appears on page 733.  If you can go to page 733.  A nd I just 
want to read paragraph 12 so that we can clear up what really 
happened and who was present.  Paragraph 12 Mr Gupta says to the 
following to the Chair. 
“I also gave evidence under oath to the Public 
Protector denying the allegations and the versio ns 
claimed by Mr Jonas and I also depose to an affidavit 
in the Minister of Finance application in the high 
20 
court Pretoria which is self-explanatory.  I point out 
that it is highly unlikely that the meeting took place 
because if it did in the manner allege d by Mr Jonas 
he would immediately have reported it to the nearest 
police station as he – as any other ordinary citizen 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 60 of 176 
 
was legally obliged and duty bound under the law to 
do.” 
Now here is an affidavit which was deposed to years after the incident 
in question and Mr Gupta is now saying that he doubts – he say that I 
point out it is highly unlikely that the meeting took place.  I am sure 
that you do not agree with him.  I mean your version is that the meeting 
did take place? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to file A.  File 
A if you may turn to page – if I am correct – page 23.  Now before 
10 
putting you know clarifying questions with that document would I be 
correct that you were either directly or indirectl y you know part and 
parcel of the Oakbay investment either through other entities or in your 
personal capacity? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Through other entities correct Sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Sorry. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I am correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now there is this press release if you 
20 
can look at the date is the 13 March 2016.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is it? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 23 Chair.   23 File Number A.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought I was there.  In file A?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  File A Chair. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 61 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what I have there is not a statement.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Is this the Public Protector’s interaction?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is Public Protectors Report. I have seen th at 
statement that you are talking about but it is not here.  It is not on page 
23. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  23? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no I am sorry I am – I think I am looking at 
the black numbers. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather than the white – the red numbers. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It happens as we proceed in the day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Zuma were you also looking at the black numbers?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No which file is it? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  File A. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  A? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Ja A.  And go to page 23.  Concentrate 
on the red numbering.  I know that it might be confusing because these 
documents were used. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well even the red one is no t the statement it is still 
the Public Protector… 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It Advocate – the Advocate Madonsela’s start 
of her [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Zuma your page – your red …  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 62 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am on the same page as you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes same. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The line 2 is where the Advocate Madonsela 
starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Um. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair it is a document immediately after 
Mr Jonas’ statement – witness statement.  It follows immediately on file 
A.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry Mr Mokoena page 22 is the end of Mr 
10 
Jonas’ statement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Page 23 starts off with the opening of the 
meeting of Advocate Madonsela’s interview.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Chair for some odd reason mine – I 
do have the file – it was handed in as Exhibit C2 by Mr [indistinct].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have seen the statement but certainly not on 
this page.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes mine is 23 the legal team is 23 as 
well of Mr …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think somebody is sabotaging me and the 
witness.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  For a moment I was thinking that I am 
looking at different files altogether Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I – I looked at that statement last night.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 63 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you want to – if the witness has got it. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can go ahead and put the question in the 
meantime. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now this – this is the press release 
which was made on the 13 t h March 2016 and the essence of the 
meeting – of this press release I do not have to read it.  It was read 
into the record before.  Is that if you look towards the middle it says:  
“To be absolutely clear there was no meeting at all.”  
10 
Can you see? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I see it.  The one liner. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes that one liner. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now was this correct what was conveyed 
by Oakbay on the 13 t h March 2016 that there was never a meeting at 
all? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  A meeting with who?  Is the question.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  With yourself, Jonas, Mr Jonas and Mr 
Hlongwane? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The meetings most… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Mr Zuma maybe you do need Mr 
Mokoena to just read parts of this statement.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that he understands the context ja.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 64 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I was avoiding to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Let us read it. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes please Sir that will be helpful. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   
“Athol Gupta not even in the country on the 27 March faceless, 
perverse of this lies should produce evidence to support…”  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr  Mokoena.  I know you are 
doing that because I said you should … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  (Intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Approach … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  by finishing on this issue.  The - the statement 
appears to be a media statement.  I think was a media statement …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the top it says: 
“News and Analysis” 
And then it says: 
“Oakbay” 
And then the heading is: 
20 
“Mcebisi Jonas:  there was no meeting - Gupta 
family” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you can just read the - you know so that he 
understands the context. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 65 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And - and the second portion that I was 
just about to read says: 
“Statement from Oakbay Investment on behalf of the 
Gupta Family in response to the Sunday Times 
Article - How Guptas Shopped for New Mi nister - 
13 March 2016.  Issued on behalf of the Gupta 
Family. 
 
Johannesburg 
South 
Africa 
Sunday 
13 March 2013.  “There have been an extraordinary 
number of allegations around the Gupta family in 
recent weeks several of which have involved the 
10 
Finance Minister.  As we have said countless times 
our primary focus is on business not politics (see 
Sunday Times Report).  We challenge the faceless 
purveyors of these lies to provide evidence of any 
of this allegations.  To be absolutely clear there 
was no meeting at all.”” 
And you must read that with the caption that the Chair has 
actually read and also in report to say you know to the allegations that 
are actually being indicated there.  How the Guptas shopped for a new 
Minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I - I think Mr Zuma what the context is that after 
Mr Jonas’ allegations had been published in the media that there had 
been a meeting at the Gupta residence at which you were present - 
according to his version - where he said he was offered the position of 
Minister of Finance and was offered I think R600 million.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 66 of 176 
 
After that had come out this media statement was then 
issued. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says Oakbay and it says there was no meeting.  
That is what the Gupta family is saying.  So that - that is in the context 
… 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what they were saying here is that as I 
understand it those who say there was a meeting must come forward 
with evidence. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I think Mr Mokoena is … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is asking you whether you wish to comment on this 
statement? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is helpful.  Thank you very much Chair.  
Yes I do wish to comment.  If you go to line three in bold it says:  
“Statement from Oakbay Investmen ts on behalf of 
the Gupta Family in response to the Sunday Times 
Article.” 
20 
Now this response was made by their spokesperson whoever 
on behalf of the Gupta family.  If that is what they are saying then that 
is what they are saying.  Were they part of the me eting?  I said none of 
them were part of the meeting. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 67 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So your question I am trying to - I am trying to 
- to get a bit more clarity from your side sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja.  The question is not what w as 
discussed or who was present.  The question simply is that you know 
they - you are saying and you have told the Chair that well the meeting 
did happen.  They …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Most definitely did, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and they are saying  that the meeting 
did not happen.  We are trying to simply and you were at - at that point 
part and parcel of Oakbay Investments.  Am I correct?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  In one way or another.  That is correct.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and this statement was made on 
behalf of Oakbay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  On behalf of the Gupta family by Oakbay.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  By Oakbay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now which is the correct version.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Was there a meeting or was there not a 
meeting?  Who was …? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I point out you to the same line on behalf of 
the Gupta family.  So I cannot be attributed to a response that was 
made on behalf … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I see. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Of the Gupta family.  From my side I stated 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 68 of 176 
 
very clearly there was a meeting. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Who was present in the - present in the 
meeting I have made that very clear sir.  Thank you very much.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And not necessarily that you might be able to 
comment on this but one would have expected that before Oakbay 
issued this statement on behalf of the Gupta family they would have 
checked with all the Gupta brothers to see whether anyone of them 
says - is aware of any meeting that took place and if anyone of them 
was aware then maybe they would have said there was a meeting but 
10 
maybe we were not involved in that meeting.  It involved other people.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry.  Who - who was not involved?  Sorry 
Chair.  Maybe who was not …?  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am saying if Oakbay before issuing the 
statement on behalf of the Gupta family.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have expected that they would have 
checked with all the Gupta brothers whether they were aware of any 
such meeting you know and if they - if the information from anyone of 
the Gupta brothers was that I am aware that there was a meeting but I 
20 
was not involved. 
Maybe the statement would say there was a meeting but none 
of the Gupta - there was a meeting at the Gupta residence but it 
involved so and so and so and so and not any Gupta brother.  You 
understand? 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 69 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand.  It is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It is definitely open to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I think just for - for clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The statement as - as I said was on behalf of 
the Gupta family. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Who discussed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  How they conveyed that message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not part of … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I was not part of …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  (Indistinct) present in the meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Interpretation from my - my side would be …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  They were trying to state …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 70 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  They were not part of the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  There is another alternate hypothesis that is 
being put forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That they knew.  Why did they not mention that 
and that is something that you - you have expanded on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I cannot comment on that.  I can comment on - 
on my involvement.  Now …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Me being a - a shareholder - a cold 
shareholder in Oakbay and whatever else - whatever other companies 
exist.  That is - that is a matter of fact but this statement it cannot be 
attributed to me though.  I cannot be drawn into the same - the same 
boat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were not party to its preparation?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Most definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am trying to jump a number of things 
that I would have actually wished to convey with you - to - to canvas 
with you.  Mr Jonas informed the Chair about the events you know post 
the meeting of 23 October 2015.  He went at length you know informing 
the Chair how he arranged the meetings to meet with Mr  Nene in order 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 71 of 176 
 
to tell him about what happened. 
I mean in his version is that - he said that there were offers 
that were made to him - monetary offers and - and a Ministerial 
position.  He also contacted Mr  Gordhan.  He contacted the ANC 
General Secretary at the time.  He went to Luthuli House and informed 
Mr Zizi Godo. 
He informed the ANC Treasury General about the events of 
23 October 2015 and what you know I simply d o - do not understand 
from all these things if these offers did not happen why would he go to 
such an extent and the length of you know informing people in those 
10 
important positions about what he said happened on the day.  
Do you know why - why would he fabricate these lies against 
you? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  When - when you asked him what did you say 
Mr Mokoena because I cannot give you an answer on that?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You do not know? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not know. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What - what response did he give if you 
recollect. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  His answer was that there were offers 
that were made on 23 October … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  2015 which were disgusting to him and 
which were made by people who did not - were not - not even supposed 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 72 of 176 
 
to make those offers and he was also made offers of money - 600 
million.  If he accepts the offer of Ministerial position 600  000 on the 
spot and that is the reason after the meeting he took su ch an effort to 
tell those other individuals. 
Now that is - that is why and your version is that he - he is 
lying.  Those things did not happen.  My question is that why would he 
go to such extent to fabricate such lies against you.  Do you have any 
reason why he would - he would lie about you? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I - I have no idea.  I do not want to - to jump 
into speculation …  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But if I may just add something to that as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I think another question that should be posed 
is why did not anyone ask me for my - my view - for my version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat that (intervenes).  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am saying from the other side I mean I als o 
need to ask why my view or my version was not requested at the time 
because there is emphasis on a timeframe.  This was raised in the 
20 
media.  There was media statements put out.  The man went out on TV 
and said whatever he needed to say.  I am not taking  away from why he 
did it.  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  He did what he had to do. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 73 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Good for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have no issues with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Now what I am saying is it is the first time I am 
being asked this question.  The only time I - I came across it was in 
3.3.  I was not given an opportunity by the Public Protector.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You do not see my - my record in the Public …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The Public Protector Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Did you ask why? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of - of course maybe this can be said.  As I read one 
of the affidavits deposed to by Mr  Ajay Gupta he says he was not 
approached to give his version himself but he initiated.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said he wanted to give his version and as I read 
what he says in his affidavit it is - it is almost like he is saying I forced 
the Public Protector to actually give me - to interview me and - and 
then so that I could put my - my side of the story and he says what he 
was given was a superficial interview.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 74 of 176 
 
So I mention that to say of course maybe it could be sai d that 
even if you were not asked you - you could have said look Public 
Protector I want to say - to put my side of the story as well.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You absolutely - absolutely correct Chair.  If I 
may just touch on that as well …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And I am glad you raised it because I did get 
an invite … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To - to go and attend the - the meeting with the 
10 
Public Protector and her team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Then it - within a matter of days it changed 
into a summons or a subpoena.  Whatever it was at the time …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And my - I got a telephone - phone call - I got 
a telephone call from I think it was her PA at the time …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And I was travelling at that time and I told her 
look I am travelling. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You know I was not - I was not in - in the 
South African space for a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I still am not …  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 75 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And I - I told them I am travelling but I will be 
back within the next week and a half two weeks.  I will come and see 
you when I am back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have got other commitments now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And she said fine.  Let us know when you are 
back.  We just want to have a discussion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Before you know it the - the report is wrapped 
up.  I did not have a chance to give my …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  My version of events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It is the first time I must come and speak in 
front of everybody …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And then I am being questioned along the lines 
of why I was - what do I think of - of Mr Jonas and …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And then - and why he did it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And no one is concerned about me not getting 
a fair - a fair shot. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 76 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I just want to put that across.  It is not a 
complaint …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  In any manner …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But I just - I just want it be in on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have complied the whole time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am being asked these sorts of questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I appreciate the questions.  I will answer …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  With no issues … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But let us be fair on me as well please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will - I will - you might not understand why 
Mr Mokoena was putting that question to you but I think your lawyers 
will understand and I understand.  You see after the hearing of all 
20 
evidence at a certain stage lawye rs will stand in front of me and say to 
me I must accept the evidence of certain witnesses.  
I must reject the evidence of certain witnesses about things 
that have been testified upon about by various witnesses and where 
there maybe two or more who have different versions of what happened 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 77 of 176 
 
in regard to a particular matter.  One or more lawyers including 
members of the legal team they might say when that time comes 
Chairperson there is a problem with accepting Mr  Duduzane Zuma’s 
version and that is because of A, B, C, D and if they are going to say 
anything along those lines they need to give you an opportunity to 
comment on that. 
So when he says to you why do you think Mr  Jonas would tell 
an untruth about what happened.  He is actually trying to say if there i s 
something you know that could be motivate - could have motivated him 
to say you were party to a discussion or in - to a meeting where he was 
10 
made this offer.  You could then say well I know why he would say that.  
This is what would motivate him to say t hat.  So that - that is the idea.  
It is not anything else. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No and I agree.  It is not …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not somehow being …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Adversarial about it.  Not at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  With all due respect sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  If just - just one point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And I just and I raise it purely because you 
know a lot of the evidence pack …  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 78 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Revolves around the Public Protector’s Report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Maybe you can shed some light …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And you mentioned that Mr Ajay Gupta had to 
basically force himself to go and - and have the discussion.  I gave my 
- my version of why I am not reflected in the documents.  Can you just 
help me out and - and maybe make me understand why I would not 
have been since I am integral to a lot of what is going on here.  
10 
Why was I not invited and y ou know there is a whole report 
that came out and I am massively implicated.  Why do you think they 
would missed out on that step?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well that is - that is the Public Protector of 
course. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so we - we do not know.  We cannot provide that 
… 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That answer.  We - we do not know but it may well be 
that even if the Public Protector who was responsible tha t who is no 
longer in office.  It may well be that if you ask your - ask your lawyers 
they might write to the current Public Protector who has access to the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 79 of 176 
 
records that were there at the time and maybe she might be able to say 
I have looked I can see why he was not given a chance.  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but I think connected with the question that 
Mr Mokoena put is - is this as I understand your evidence and  you must 
just tell me based on - on your affidavit.  The discussion at the meeting 
involving you, Mr Jonas and Mr Hlongwane was really restricted to the 
discussion of these rumours.  Is that correct?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and as I understand your evidence most of the 
time you played the role of a spectator or mediator in that meeting.  Is 
that correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not say in your affidavit and you must tell me 
if I misunderstand this.  You do not say that you provided the 
background to the rumours.  Do you?  Is my understanding correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That - your understanding is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I understand correct and as I understand it you say 
20 
that at the end of that meeting the issue appeared to not have been 
settled as such but to you know there - there was some understanding.  
If I put it in my own words between the parties but there - not that it 
was resolved completely.  Is that right?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is right. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 80 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And my understanding of what you say in you - in 
your affidavit suggests that when the parties parted - when the meeting 
ended they - nobody was unhappy about anything.  Is that right? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To - to a very large extent everybody appeared to be 
satisfied is that right?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now when I - when I see that picture emerging 
from your affidavit of how the meeting ended I look at the - at what 
Mr Jonas says.  On his version as you know the meeting involved a - a 
Gupta brother and the meeting ended as I see it badly - negatively on 
his version.  You understand?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Negatively and then he says if I recall correctly 
on his way to the airport he made a call to Minister  Nene and I think he 
made also a call to Minister  Gordhan and - because he wanted to talk 
20 
to them about what had happened at the meeting which had made him 
unhappy as I understand the position and he arranged to meet with 
Minister Gordhan on the Sunday. 
I do not know if the 23 r d was a Friday - 23 October was a 
Friday or not but he made an arrangement.  He was going to the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 81 of 176 
 
Eastern 
Cape 
and 
he 
made 
an 
arrangement 
to 
meet 
with 
Minister Gordhan on - on Sunday and he made an arrangement with 
Minister Nene that they would meet on Sunday and he says they did 
meet - he did meet with Minister Gordhan on Sunday and mentioned 
what had happened or at least the - the essence. 
Minister Gordhan has given evidence here and has deposed 
to statements and he is - he confirms that he was phoned that same 
afternoon by - by Mr Jonas and that they met on Sunday and he 
confirms that Mr Jonas said he had been made this offer that he was 
talking about at the meeting and Minister  Gordhan says he could tell 
10 
that Minister - Mr Jonas was still kind of upset or unhappy and 
Minister Nene also confirms in his testimony and affidavit as I recall 
that he was called by Minister - by Mr Jonas that same afternoon. 
They arranged to meet on Sunday but on Sunday they moved 
that to Monday morning and they did meet on Monday morning at the 
office.  They went out to the balcony because they thought well maybe 
the offices might be bugged and that at that meeting Minister - 
Mr Jonas told him the fact - the essence of what had happened at the 
meeting on his version. 
So you get the picture of somebody who came out of the 
20 
meeting.  Being - being unhappy, started phoning you know people - the 
Minister - Minister Gordhan and both - both of those people I think were 
- were connected with the Minister of Finance - Ministry of Finance at 
some stage or another and ultimately told the st ory and they both 
confirmed that that is - that is what happened. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 82 of 176 
 
So - so that - that is something I am drawing to your 
attention.  You might not be able to say anything about it.  Maybe all 
you might say is as far as I am concerned when the meeting ended 
there was no animosity.  There was no unhappiness and - and that - I 
do not know what he is talking about.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is exactly what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am saying that just to be clear that after the 
meeting everything was cool …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And as - as I have mentioned in - in my 
affidavit I bumped into him.  This is Mr  Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Once or twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Subsequent to that meeting …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And my view was there was no hostility at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So that is - that is the way I took it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What happened behind the scenes the phone I 
- I do not know.  I cannot comment on it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know.  Yes.  Of course as far as your role 
is concerned he does say at the meeting you were quiet most of the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 83 of 176 
 
time.  So that maybe he might have been unhappy about t he fact that 
you brought him to the - to this meeting on his version but he does not 
say you said anything at the meeting that - that made him unhappy, but 
also he does say that that evening he called Mr  Hlongwane as well and 
he says he expressed to Mr  Hlongwane I think he said he spoke two 
times that evening - afternoon and evening from the Eastern Cape.  
He phoned him and he expressed his disgust at what his - he 
- he said Mr Hlongwane had done.  That - that is I thought I will just 
mention that there is that version. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your version meeting ended very well.  There was 
no problem.  On his version the meeting ended in a very negative 
atmosphere and he was unhappy.  He started contacting other people 
and later on according to him he phoned Mr  Hlongwane and expressed 
his disgust. 
So you - you might again say there is nothing I can say.  All I 
know is that the meeting ended well.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I - I confirm again and - and I stick to 
what I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Earlier on Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And you know you also mentioned that he had 
called me afterwards …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 84 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To basically give me a mouthful as (indistinct).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I should not conduct myself in that way.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You now the meet - the way the meeting 
happened it should not have - whatever - whatever it is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That he said that I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And that phone call never came through.  So 
10 
the point I am trying to make is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA: 
 
The 
communication 
that 
happened 
telephonically I - I cannot comment on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Some of it may have happened.  Some of it 
may not have happened …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But - as - as I said to you everything at that 
point the meeting, the contents of the meeting went the way they did.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Whether issues were resolved or not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is a different story …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 85 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But when we all emerged from that room …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It was all cool. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Then just one last question from my side and I - 
I do not know how far Mr  Mokoena still has questions for you.  He said 
that when you met at the Hyatt Hotel you made a remark to the - to the 
effect that I do not know whether he said you s aid you old man but 
basically your father liked him.  I did not see you - you denying that - 
that allegation in the affidavit.  Is that correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I did not include it in my affidavit.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  As I said there is a lot of SMS’ phone calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That were not included. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  There is (indistinct) information as well.  I did 
not include. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is a remark that you made?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No that is not a remark that I made.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not make? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Most definitely not sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  If you may turn to File number A.  I 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 86 of 176 
 
am not sure which file you are having with you.  Page 11.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Page? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  11 - 1-1. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you.  Got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On - in relation to Mr Jonas I am proposing to restrict 
you to five minutes now. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To wrap up.  Is that right?  (Intervenes).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Is it the five minutes of Judges or of the 
lawyers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the lawyers. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 11 paragraph 31.  It simply to 
contextualise the question that I was going to put but the Chair has 
already done that.  It is not as cool as you say Mr  Zuma because to 
Mr Jonas the meeting did not end as cool as you say - suggest.  He 
says on paragraph 31: 
“I was very shaken by what happened at the 
meeting.  Due to the sensitive and threatening 
nature of what happen - had transpired at this 
meeting and because of the uncertainty of the 
20 
events that were playing themselves out on a 
national basis.  I decided I would initially discuss 
what had occurred with the people I felt I could 
trust. 
 
Later 
that 
day 
I 
contacted 
Minister Nhlanhla Nene and advised him that I had 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 87 of 176 
 
a - I had something serious to tell him.  He was on 
his way to KwaZulu-Natal.  So we agreed to meet 
on his return on the 20 t h - on- on Sunday 
25 October 2015.” 
Paragraph 32: 
“Upon 
landing 
in 
Port 
Elizabeth 
I 
spoke 
telephonically to Mr  Hlongwane and expressed my 
disgust about what had transpired particularly in 
respect of the manner in which he had deliberately  
misled me.  I told him he should never again do 
10 
what he had done to me or to any other person.  He 
suggested we should have as meeting to discuss 
what I have raised.”  
And paragraph 32 takes care of the meeting that was no 
scheduled between Mr  Nene and Mr Jonas and so that is his version.  
You have already answered to you.  Everything was cool.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now the other point that I wanted 
to clarify with you.  I mean you were saying that you were  not - not 
given an opportunity by the Public Protector to place your version you 
20 
know to her and you know that maybe you were treated unfairly.  One 
would not be able to comment on that but you had other avenues you 
know that you could have actually explored at the time. 
I mean here is the person according to you spreading lies 
about.  These are serious allegations that were made against you.  Do - 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 88 of 176 
 
do you agree? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Most definitely, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Definitely, yes.  Did you ope n any case 
against Mr Jonas? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I will be exploring the avenues.  These 
avenues you are talking about. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Sorry. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  These are the avenues that you are talking 
about. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, but I am saying that now that you 
10 
are testifying I mean from that time 23  October 2015 to date did you 
open any criminal charge against him?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  I did not sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Did you bring any action for 
defamation against him? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No sir.  I did not. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Did you lay a complaint against 
him at the ANC about these lies?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It was none of the ANC’s business.  It was a 
personal matter sir. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  So that - the short answer you did 
not do it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  As far as I am concerned neither did he.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.  Now …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I think somebody has completely switched 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 89 of 176 
 
off the air conditioner.  It feels a little ho t.  Maybe it should be on but 
not too high.  So maybe somebody could do the - take care of that.  
Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The last question on this aspect of 
Mr Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No.  I thought that there is something 
that maybe my learned colleagues wanted to raise.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We know as a matter of fact and you 
10 
have also dealt with it I think when we started with your questioning.  
That two months after that meeting you have already said you now 
agreed with me that Mr  Nene was removed and he was replaced by 
Mr Van Rooyen.  Was this simply a coincidence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I believe so. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Chair I am moving now to 
Mr Dukwana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  May I please have a comfort praise sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I just need to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Comfort break?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Comfort break please Chair. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 90 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that is fine. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  10 minutes will be fine?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Three minutes maximum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three minutes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair it may be difficult to compute three 
minutes.  Maybe 10 minutes might be better.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Just to be on the safe side.  Let us 10 minutes.  
It is now 25 to one.  So we say we come back at quarter to one.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You said we are moving to something else now?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   We are moving...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   You know respecting the time limitations 
I’m moving to Mr Dukwana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine I just mention one thing Mr Zuma and 
you might have no comment about it but I mention it because it is in my 
20 
mind so it’s the transparency I was talking about earlier.  On Mr Jonas’ 
version at this meeting , if I recall correctly he gets told that Mr Nene is 
going to be removed as Minister of Finance.  Now I can’t remember 
whether he gets told that expressly or  it’s just implied because 
according, on his version, he is being offered the position of Minister  of 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 91 of 176 
 
Finance and if I recall correctly he says that the Gupta brother who was 
there told him – I hope I’m not misrepresenting what he said, told him 
that if he needed advisors he would be given advisor – they would give 
him advisors and that’s October 2015,  October 23, and about six or so 
weeks later 9 December Mr Nene gets removed as Minister of Finance 
and of course the person who gets appointed is Mr Des van Rooyen and 
in terms of the evidence that I’ve heard here he comes with two 
persons – advisors who are alleged to have links with the Gupta family.  
So I’m just mentioning, you might not be able to say anything I’m just 
mentioning something that comes to my mind as I listen to the 
10 
evidence. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Mr Zuma the last question I asked when 
I dealt with the issues of Mr Jonas whether or not did lay a criminal 
charge it was also put to Mr Jonas as to why didn’t he lay charges 
right, I’m just putting that to you.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Okay I agree thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now let’s move on to Mr Dukwana, Mr 
Hlongwane when he was interviewed by the PP he told the PP that he 
20 
used to frequent or visit with him to the Gupta residence…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s the Public Protector when you say PP?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   The Public Protector yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes, do you confirm what he says that, 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 92 of 176 
 
you know you guys used to frequent the Gupta house you used to visit, 
you also being in the company of the Gupta brothers?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And do you know whether Mr 
Magashule, you know, did also visit the Gupta residence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I’m not sure I’ve never met him there. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   There was no occasion where you met 
Mr Magashule at the Gupta residence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Not at the Gupta residence. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And do you know Mr Dukwana?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No I do not know Mr Dukwana. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   You’ve never met him? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I may have in passing but in this relation no I 
have not, I do not recall meeting him.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, now may I refer you to the very 
small in comparison to the other files i t’s file number C – LLC Chair and 
I will try to be as quick as I can and if you may refer to…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   You see Mr Mokoena before the tea break I did have 
a file marked C but certain changes happened during the tea break and 
the file that was marked C no longer has C. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   I think that they were trying to assist 
the Chair with those files that you are not able to navigate through but 
now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s supposed to remain marked C. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   For ease of reference in future Chair, if 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 93 of 176 
 
hey mark it LLC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And we’ll be dealing with the documents 
from folder number two and I think that is the first folder and I was 
referring Mr Zuma to page 18 of t hat document. With particular 
reference to paragraph 52 and simply to save time Mr Zuma I will put to 
you what Mr Dukwana told the Chair when he testified there contained 
from paragraph9 52 to 59, let me read them so that you can react to 
them at once and teen I can pose questions so that we can be quickly 
he said that, 
10 
 
“I was ushered into a room whilst Tony and Magashule went  to 
a different room.  After a while they joined me and  accompanied 
by 
other people and the notable was Mr  
Duduzane Zuma.  Tony in 
the presence of Magashule asked  me to sign a document purportedly 
prepared by me on the  
letterhead of my office addressed to Lulani 
Management  
Services appointing them to run a whole project I 
presented  
in the cabinet meeting on the 10 key bases, I r efused 
to  
append my signature”, 
 
If I may pause Mr Zuma he says that when all these things 
were happening the were happening with you being part and parcel of 
20 
that meeting and in your presence and he says that,  
 
“In the said letter my surname was written Dukwana, Dukoana 
 
any Magashule knew that is how my surname is written 
 
because I always preferred and wrote it as Dukwana, and he 
 
says Dukoana is a Sesotho version of my otherwise Xhosa 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 94 of 176 
 
 
surname.  In an effort to try to persuade me to append my 
 
signature to the said letter Tony intimated to me that both 
 
Magashule and Duduzane Zuma were recipients of monies in 
 
cash from a mining project from Jakalsfontein Mine.  Neither 
 
Magashule nor Duduzane Zuma disputed Tony’s claim they 
 
both nodded their heads in agreement.  Further Tony told me 
 
that Magashule would not benefit from the project because it 
 
belonged to me and him (Tony).  Magashule did not dispute 
 
Tony from this project, Tony told me that I would receive a 
 
monthly payment of R2million, I was told  by Tony that if I 
10 
 
append my signature at the time an instant payment of 
 
R2million would be given to me.  In this regard a gentleman  of 
Indian decent was called by Tony and Tony whispered  
something, 
words in the language unknown to me.  The  
gentleman left the 
room and came back with a black pilot  
bag, 
this 
same 
bags 
frequently used by lawyers, I distanced  
myself from that Mr Zuma 
and 57 it says, I still persisted that  
I cannot sign the document 
to which Tony said that he had  
spoken to Magashule tha t upon my 
signature the provisional  cabinet will gratify the appointment.  Tony 
then opened the  pilot bag which was full of R200 South African bank 
20 
notes  
stating that the money was mine if I signed the document.  I 
 
still refused to sign, I went to the extent of suggesting that it 
 
be prudent that the letter I was being compelled to sign 
 
should be referred to Mr Venter, Provincial Legal Advisor in 
 
the office of the Premier to give a legal opinion about the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 95 of 176 
 
 
legality of the contemplated appointments.  A fter that 
 
suggestion Magashule mumbles something to Tony to which 
 
Tony asked that I give him back the letter, I had intended to 
 
keep the letter to refer it to Mr Venter”,  
 
 
And that is what Mr Dukwana informed the Chair and what is 
your comment on these issues? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I’m not sure what Mr Dukwana is talking about 
that’s my comment. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, when you say you are not sure, 
you are saying either you are not sure what he is talking about or 
10 
whether you don’t agree with what is stated in those paragraphs or that 
all of the things that he is saying in that statement did not happen at 
all? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I do not agree with each and every part of the 
statement, paragraph by paragraph.  I do not agree that this meeting 
took place, I do not agree that his placing all these wonderful people in 
this meeting, so in entirety I completely refute.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Zuma you might wish to just reconsider 
whether that’s the answer – whether that answer reflects what you 
intend saying I heard you earlier on saying you – I think I heard you 
20 
saying you did not attend any meeting involving Mr Dukwana, did I 
understand that correctly?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes now if he says you were present at that me eting 
– at this meeting and you say you were not present, then you would not 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 96 of 176 
 
know whether this meeting may have taken place but he is just 
mistaken about you having been present and if that meeting did take 
place, those things might have happened, you were  not there you don’t 
know. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I appreciate the clarity and I take your view 
and I agree with your view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes so your position is that you were not 
present at such a meeting?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And are you definite about that or is there some 
10 
doubt? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No, no definite. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are definite about that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes sir 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now piggy backing on what the Chair 
have, you know, canvassed with you, if I understand your evidence is 
that, when Mr Jonas testified about the offers which were made in your 
presence clearly your answer is that he is lying, that never happened 
20 
am I correct? 
MR 
DUDUZANE 
ZUMA: 
 
 
I 
gave 
my 
view, 
I 
gave 
my 
version…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I don’t know if he put that way…[intervenes].  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Ja that’s not the way I put it, I gave my view 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 97 of 176 
 
and I gave my version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja Mr – General Booysen said when he gave 
evidence about Mr Duduzane he said he is very respectful, I think to 
adult people so he might have not have put it that way, that he’s lying 
but he has put his version, is that correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct thank you Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Mr Chair the version is either you are 
correct or Mr Jonas is correct. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s right sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, it can never be both of them that 
10 
are correct because you are saying that it did not ha ppen and he said 
that it did happen, is that correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, Mr Dukwana also told the Chair 
about the offers and he says that you were present there was no 
uncertainty about him or about your presence at that meeting and you 
are also saying that he is incorrect, that did not happen?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s what I’m saying, that’s correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What of course Mr Mokoena, was not done, if I recall 
correctly when Mr Dukwana gave his e vidence is that his evidence that 
20 
Mr Duduzane Zuma was present at that meeting may not have been 
tested because there was nothing to suggest that Mr Duduzane Zuma’s 
version would be different, that he did attend such a meeting.  So I’m 
just mentioning that maybe we don’t know what Mr Dukwana would say 
when he’s being told Mr Duduzane Zuma says he was not present 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 98 of 176 
 
there, are you sure he was there.  So I just mention, that’s my 
recollection. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Well it was put to him Chair and at least 
mine it’s not only premised on that event but when reading those 
documents again it was clearly…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   He was clear. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Clear and there was no uncertainty on his 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And simply the point that I was making 
10 
was that, now we are having two people, Mr Jonas and Mr Dukwana 
who are talking about the offers that happened in your presence at the 
Gupta residence and both of them, according to you, they are simply 
fabricating this evidence? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I’m being conveniently placed at a supposed 
crime scene yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, and I’m sure that none – myself 
and you would not be able to proffer any answers as to why would they 
really fabricate this evidence against you, we don’t know?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Ja definitely we don’t know. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Okay, now you have provided with 
obviously the statement of Mr Dukwana to the extent that it implicated 
you in terms of Rule 3.3 am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes he did mention me. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, and he did also have the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 99 of 176 
 
opportunity to read it and also to decide whether or not, you know, to 
challenge that version or not, you did not, you know submit any version 
contradicting him nor did you apply in terms of Rule 3.4 at which that 
challenges his version and also to cross -examine him am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Reading his version of events I felt that at the 
time and obviously through consultation that I was mentioned and I was 
not implicated in any allegations that may have come to the fore.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, but if a person says that there 
were those, I mean, unlawful or illegal offers at least on the version of 
Mr Dukwana, that were made and he was made to sign certai n 
10 
documents when in fact he could not have the authority to do so he was 
made to sign those things by individuals who were not even officials of 
the government, surely you know, in that meeting it was not a meeting 
where one does not actually attribute any  illegality on it, isn’t it?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   And you’re present, that’s why I’m 
saying that, that’s why you’re given a Rule 3.3 notice.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Correct and as I said I was – I didn’t believe, I 
still don’t believe I was implicated I believe I was mentioned, the 
meeting, as I’ve said I’ve got no recollection of it, it did not happen.  
20 
So that’s the angle I took. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, now let’s move – Chair I want to 
move to Mr Sundaram…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes before you do so again, Mr Zuma you might have 
no comment or anything to say about this but as I understand it Tony 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 100 of 176 
 
Gupta is Mr Rajesh Gupta, is that right?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is the same person  that, on your evidence, 
peeped in at the meeting at the Gupta residence where you, Mr 
Hlongwane and Mr Jonas were having a meeting and wanted to check if 
you were available for a meeting the following day or something.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now there is a lot of issue as to – if Mr Jonas’ 
version is correct and an offer was made to him such as the one he has 
described at that meeting, who of the brothers made the offer and, at 
10 
least on your version and Mr Hlongwane’s  version the only Gupta 
brother that was around in the residence was Mr Rajesh Gupta.  
Assuming that maybe he is the one that made the offer if an offer was 
made it would be – it’s interesting that, according to Mr Dukwana this is 
now another meeting and Mr Dukwana says, this same person, you 
know, offered him money in a briefcase.  When he was giving evidence 
here a briefcase was shown to indicate what type of briefcase he was 
talking about, lawyer’s briefcase that Mr Dukwana disassociates 
himself from and he said the bag – the briefcase was full of R200 
notes, you know that was offered to him.  So there are just those 
20 
features that happened, but again if you were not at the meeting and 
the version about your meeting at the Gupta residence with Mr Jonas 
was different, you might have nothing to do but it’s just interesting that 
there is this meeting happening and apparently Mr Rajesh Gupta is at 
the venue at both – on both occasions. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 101 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I see your point then, one would find it even 
more interesting that I’m always placed in the middle of these 
discussions and I happen to be a couch or a lampshade in the 
meetings. I didn’t see anything, I don’t say anything so I find that more 
interesting than the point you’re making but I take your point Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you, Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Chair I’m told that we have now 
approached the lunch adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay we’ll take the lunch adjournment now, the 
time is five past one, we will resume at five past two, we adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Zuma the part that I did not include in the 
observation I was making about which I said you might not have much 
to say was that as I understand Mr Dukwana’s evi dence including what 
he said in his statement was also that at that meeting which he says 
you attended which you say you did not attend if I recall correctly.  He 
also says that when he said that the document that Mr Rajesh Gupta – 
Tony Gupta wanted him to  sign.  When he said that in effect that is a 
20 
matter that should go to the head of department Mr Rajesh Gupta 
suggested to him that he should get rid of – of his head of department 
and the call was made and then Mr Richard – what is his surname 
again?  Mr Richard Seleke. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Seleke. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 102 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Seleke – Mr Richard Seleke was brought in and in 
effect he – you said you know… 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Said he was brought into the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the person – ja at the meeting. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the person you should have as your head of 
department.  So I mentioned that this simply as part of that observation 
that you have a situation where on both occasions the venue is the 
Gupta residence.  On both  occasions Mr Rajesh Gupta is in the house.  
On both occasions – on both occasions he at least on the version of 
10 
and not necessarily his because we do not know his version. On the 
version of a person visiting the house – the person visiting the house is 
being asked to do certain things and he is being offered money for that.  
And both occasions it looks like there contemplation that somebody 
may have to leave a certain position and somebody else might – must 
take that position.  But I am just completing the  picture.  I think I 
understand what = what you have said.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is definitely the narrative that is out 
20 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And I am being like I said I am being placed a t 
the crime scene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 103 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Most times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But whilst we are still on that if I can just refer 
us back to point 55. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No I mean it is just the paragraph that deals 
with the Jagersfontein mine.  The – look I am not sure you know a lot is 
said – a lot of accusations have been laid on my table. But just a point 
of curiosity I mean with all – with all due respect Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Zuma I did ask that the air conditioner 
10 
be put on but maybe not too high.  I think it is interfering.  I do not 
know if whether – whether if you raise your voice that is going to make 
a difference. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just try and raise your voice. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay I will do that Chair.  Thank you.  No I 
mean it is just a point of curiosity.  And I say it with all due respect.  
There are a lot of accusations that have been labelled and placed and 
on me and I am not sure what the investigative  processes have been 
but you know I would just like to ask you have heard what I have had to 
20 
say about my non-attendance in this meeting – my denial of this 
meeting.  But when it comes to procedural points I have been accused 
of receiving monies from they said – by Mr Dukwana – has the 
commission…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry I missed that.  You have been 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 104 of 176 
 
accused of? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Of receiving money from a mining project in 
Jagersfontein.  Yes I just wanted to ask did the commission follow any  
due process.   Did they look into it?  Did they investigate?  What is the 
status on that?   
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean what Mr Dukwana says?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  Just as a point of – of getting to the 
bottom of it.  The reason I am asking is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – yes – well as I understand it he – he is not 
saying that you gave money to anybody Mr Dukwana?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  If I ever made a statement [indistinct] Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No the reason – reason I am asking is there 
are a lot of accusations that have been thrown around.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You know true or false. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is for the commission to  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To decide.  So this specific poi nt. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Whether the commission decides to believe my 
version or Mr Dukwana’s version or whoever else.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Due process by – from an investigative 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 105 of 176 
 
perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  By the commission have they actually looked 
into you know activities in Jagersfontein?  Is there – are there actually 
mines that exist there?  Are there any linkages that are linking this 
specific – because this is a very – very serious allegation?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well look part of trying to establish what the truth 
is is exactly hearing both sides.  So what is happening here is part of 
trying to understand what the truth is.  Up to today certainly I did not 
know whether your version is that you adm it that you were present at 
10 
that meeting or not.  So now I know that your version is that you were 
not at that meeting.  So this is not the end of the matter there will be 
more witnesses who will be called.  And the investigation 
– 
investigators do what th ey can but the people implicated also they are 
expected to come forward and say – I know that the commission has 
been told this and that about me.  In this case I take it that you were 
furnished with Mr Dukwana’s affidavit.  So they are expected if they do  
not agree with what has been said about them they are expected to 
come forward to the commission to say I want the record to be put 
straight.  Here is my own statement, here is my affidavit, I deny this.  
20 
This – I was not at that meeting.  And indeed if y ou have been given 
somebody’s statements who says something about you or implicates 
you in anything you would have been given that together with a notice 
from the commission that advises you of your rights.  And part of the – 
of those – some of those rights are that you can apply to commission to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 106 of 176 
 
give evidence yourself and refute what is being said about you or 
against you and so on and so on.  You can apply for Leave to Cross -
examine.  Some people do not apply for Leave to Cross -examine but 
they send an affidavit saying this is my version.  You know.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so 
1. This is part of the commission trying to establish the truth and 
you have now told us what your side of the story is in regard to 
that.  And that is not the end.  The commission would look at 
things but you are not expected to sit back and do nothing if it is 
10 
something that you feel strongly about.  
Indeed if you do nothing about it in circumstances where you are aware 
that somebody has given evidence or has given t he commission a 
statement that implicates you if you do nothing about it you might be 
expected not to complain if the commission at a certain stage takes it 
that you had no version to put forward.  You had no problem with what 
was being said about you.  Yo u understand that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you very much for the clarity.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Mokoena you may 
proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair I will try to move as quick as 
possible in order to short circuit the remaining issues which I wish to 
canvass with Mr Zuma.  Mr Zuma I was just about to move to deal with 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 107 of 176 
 
the evidence of Mr Sundaram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I should say Mr Mokoena I – I have not put 
any time limit in regard to questions relating to the other witnesses 
simply because on my recollection nobody has applied to cross -
examine and so on for Leave to Cross -examine or rather he has not 
applied to – for Leave to Cross -examine them unlike with regard to Mr  
Jonas. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But obviously that does not mean you have all the 
time no, I will be keeping an eye on how much time you spend on each.  
10 
So I just thought maybe I should just explain that.  So let us do what 
we can to ensure that the issues are – justice is done to the issues but 
at the same time we do not necessarily take too long.  Okay.  I am not 
expecting you to take too long but I wanted to explain that why I have 
not said anything about time frames with regard to th e other witnesses. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you can proceed where I think maybe we have 
taken too long I will mention on any particular witness.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Mr Sundaram used to work for 
Infinity and at a later stage Mr Duduzane he was the editor of ANN7, do 
20 
you know him? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I do know him thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  He testified before this commission 
and related to the Chair the events which took place in four meetings 
which he refers to in his statement and he says that three of those 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 108 of 176 
 
meetings were held at the presidential residence in Pretoria and one of 
them I think the last one – the fourth meeting was held at ANN7’s 
offices in I think he said in Sandton.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  In Midrand. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  In Midrand. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now did you attend all of those meetings 
or any – or some of those meetings?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I only attended one of those. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  One of those 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That was in Midrand. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And the one that you attended is it the 
one where was it held? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  In Midrand at the ANN7 studios. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now we have now established and 
it is common cause that you are a shareholder in Mabengela may I call 
it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And in turn Mabengela held shares in 
Infinity Media Networks, am I correct?  
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And would I also be correct that 
Mabengela did conduct business with our government?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  From an – ja yes they did, that is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.

Page 109 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Well no ANN7 did not Mabengela. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So the TV station did not my company directly.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  If I put it the other – if I say that Media 
Networks –  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Infinity Media Networks did conduct 
business with government. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now the idea of the TV station 
10 
would I be correct that the person who was much more involved – I 
mean if I compare you and your father it was your father who was m uch 
more involved in the TV station than you?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not know about that Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You do not know about that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Okay.  Now in the meeting that you 
attended was your father also present – the President? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That was a studio visit so it was walk around 
the studuo. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  So he was present? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Thank you.  Can I refer you to bundle C.   
We are now going to deal with bundle C only.  You can ignore the other 
bundles.  If I may refer you to page 36 with particular reference to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 110 of 176 
 
paragraph 9.  I just want to establish whether were you aware of these 
presentations or at what point were you inv olved with the TV station or 
your company conducting business with government through you know 
any of your entities.  Now in paragraph 9 Mr Sundaram says that  
“I had earlier been told by Mr Atul Gupta to prepare a 
detailed presentation about all aspects o f the TV 
project for the President.  Three copies of this report 
were printed and bound by Aslam Kamal an employee 
of New Age and close confidante of the Gupta 
brothers.” 
10 
Did you come to know about this presentation?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No I do not know about this presentation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You are not part of it?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No I am not. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now if you move onto paragraph 12 of 
the same page Mr Sundaram said that:  
“After I arrived in South Africa I got to know that th e 
then President Jacob Zuma’s son Mr Duduzane Zuma 
was a 30% shareholder in Infinity Media.”  
Is that correct? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It was no secret Sir that is correct.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Sorry? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It was no secret that is correct Sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Correct yes.  And if you move on also to 
page 37 simply to verify certain issues with particular reference to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 111 of 176 
 
paragraph 18 which simply identifies different role players.  Mr 
Sundaram says that the first meeting with Mr Jacob Zuma was attended 
by Mr Ajay Gupta, Mr Atul Gupta, Mr Nazeem Howa, Mr Moegasien 
Williams, Mr Ashu Chawla and Mr Arun Agawan and me.  I know that 
you said you did not attend this first meeting but maybe the last 
meeting.  When there was this studio visit were th ese individual also 
present?  To the best of your recollection.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To the best of my recollection I think the 
majority would have been present.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Okay.  Now did you come to know what 
10 
were their role in the TV statio n? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The role of which specific persons?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The individual that you saying – I mean 
those that are identified on paragraph 18?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Ja.  No I am saying that do you know  
what each role was – I mean was played by these individuals, do you 
know? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, yes I responded yes I. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you tell us – can you share with us I 
20 
am sorry? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  Mr Ajay is a co-shareholder. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is Mr Ajay Gupta sorry.  Mr Atul Gupta 
was chairman of the group. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 112 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  If you can – slowly. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  Mr Ajay Gupta is a shareholder.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Mr Atul Gupta is chairman of the group.  Mr 
Nazeem Howa was Group CEO if I recall.  Mr Moegsien Williams was 
the Group Editor.  Mr Arun Agriwal was the co -shareholder as well from 
India. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I think you have jumped one n ame. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And then I am sorry Mr Ashu Chawla he 
was I think director at one of our IT companies yes.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Would I be also correct that you were 
co-owners with Mr Chawla in Mabengela?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You were also co-directors with Mr 
Ashu Chawla in Oakbay? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And you – would I be correct that Mr 
Ashu Chawla was the CEO of the Sahara Computers the Gupta owned 
entity? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes if I recollect at this point he possibly was 
20 
ja [mumbling]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And would I also be correct that 
you were a director in Sahara Holdings?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That sounds correct Sir.  I will have to che ck 
that at that point but it sounds correct.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 113 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  To sum it up also would I be 
correct that you had close business relationship with Mr Chawla?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now can I refer you to page 39.  
Paragraph 19.4 Mr Sundaram says that Ashu was the CEO of the Gupta 
owned Sahara Computers.  He had lived in South Africa for many years 
and was the Gupta’s point man for any co -ordination with the President 
and the South African governmen t.  He was particularly close to 
President’s son Duduzane.  Would that be accurate?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No that is not accurate. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You are not close with him?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No not at all. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is the part that you say is not accurate the last 
sentence that says you were particularly – he was particularly close to 
you or is it.. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am – it is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is it everything in that paragraph?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It is both points sorry I was particularly 
responding to …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The last part where my relationship with him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Were said  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what you are responding to?  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 114 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I am responding to that and I would like to 
also respond to the point where it said he had lived in South Africa for 
many years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And was a Gupta’s point man. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  For any co-ordination with the President and 
the South African government.  I am not aware of that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I am refuting that as well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  That is fair.   And if I may refer you to 
page 56 – 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me just with regard to that last one.  You 
know it says he was particularly close to you.  If we take out 
particularly and say he was close to you, is that fine, is that accurate?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No he is still very cold ja.  Still cold no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was not close to you?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  He was not close to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You only business relationship with him?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 115 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now if I may refer you to page 56.  
Paragraph 25.17 and he says that: 
“I later asked Nazeem…”  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry it is another page?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes it is 56 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 6? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  56 okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  25.17. 
“I later asked Nazeem why President Zuma insisted 
on lecturing us on editorial and personal matters.  Do 
you not know has not Lex Magee told you already he 
has a big say in this venture.  His son Duduzane 
holds 30% in the company.  His involvement is very 
critical to the first year of our operations.  If we are 
able to get government advertisement we will be able 
to break – we will be able to break even in the first 
year he told me.  If this were true it would explain a 
20 
lot and it felt as though everything was falling into 
place.” 
Can you confirm that you did hold 30A% of the company? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I can confirm that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 116 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That number may have changed but I confirm it 
is around that number yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And then did the entity get any 
business from governmen t? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It did. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And then we can move now to paragraph 
56 – page 56 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  The very same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  If – let us go to paragraph 25.18. 
“The news channel was heading would be a pro ANC 
pro Zuma channel that was promoted and run by not 
only people close to the President – to President 
Zuma but by President Zuma himself.  If Nazeem had 
his [indistinct] and Zuma held the shares through his 
son he would be projected positively in the news 
bulletins.  In this scenario I could see how he would 
use his position as President to ensure government 
advertisement – advertising for the station.  The 
20 
important part which I think is relevant is that  is also 
seemed if this was true that there was a clear 
conflict of interest as his son had a stake in not just 
Gupta owned newspaper but also a proposed TV – 
the proposed television news channel.”  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 117 of 176 
 
And I am affording you this opportunity to comment on the  contents of 
that paragraph. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Is there anything specific that you would like 
to know? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Which of the portions of that paragraph 
do you dispute and which ones are accurate?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Look I think there is a lot of creative writing in 
this paragraph. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The simple – the simple fact is government 
10 
advertising well for us to be in line for government advertising should 
never be an issue.  The conflict myself being the son the President at 
that time – my father being in office I think that is an unfair point to 
make by Mr Sundaram or anyone else.  The fact of the matter is it was 
a TV station – it was a new TV Channel.  It was a start -up an just like 
any other channel I implore government to support any start-ups.  So 
when it comes to government ad spend revenue just like any other 
outlets that exists out there you name them, they getting government 
support via advertising revenue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I completely refute this those whole 
paragraph. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now let us dissect you know what you 
have just said to the Chair in the light of what Mr Sundaram has said. 
Firstly if my memory serves me well your father the President M r Zuma 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 118 of 176 
 
did not dispute that he played an instrumental role in the establishment 
of the TV station when he appeared. Do you recall his testimony?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  If that is what you saying I will take your word 
for it. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And then – that is the first point.  
The second point is that you own shares or you have interest in the TV 
channel itself directly or indirectly, am I correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  The TV channel was getting 
business from government you have just simply confirmed that, that is 
10 
correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now would that not be any obvious 
conflict from the analysis of those facts?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Which facts?  The facts that you have just put 
to me? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Which I have just put to you yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No I do not think so. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  No conflict at all? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry Sir. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You are saying there is no conflict at all?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not think so no. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now if we can move to page 56.  I 
want to move over from page 56 to page 59 Chair.  Paragraph 28.8 and 
I will read with – to you also paragraph 28.10 and 28.13  simply to – to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 119 of 176 
 
fast track this – the line of question.  28.8 it says that:  
“Atul has organised a chip reader and a 14 inch 
procus quality monitor to be sent to Ashu earlier in 
the day.  He was to bring this for the meetings.  We 
were ushered into the same  waiting room where we 
had before – been before. Soon Duduzane Zuma 
walked in and greeted us before proceeding to hug 
the Gupta brothers. “We had a surprise for you 
today.” That is in quote.  We had a surprise for you 
today Dudu we will show you the bullet in we have 
10 
been producing.  Ajay Gupta said with an animated 
movement of his hands. Good so we should move to 
the next room it has a large TV.  In starting moving 
out and all of us followed him.”  
Do you recall these events?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No just to put it into context. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So it is not taken out of context.  If – I will 
answer your question.  If we go back to 28.6.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Which is page 58.  And I will just read the first 
sentence.  It says: 
“The plan was to take a chip reader to President 
Zuma’s Pretoria house and connect it to a monitor for 
him to see the bulletins.”  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 120 of 176 
 
So when we come to paragraph 28.8 I am being placed in this meeting 
which I have clearly told you tha t I was not part of.  You asking me to 
comment on an event that I was not – well a scenario that I was not 
part of.  I am not sure how you expect me to do that Sir.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I am simply putting to you what Mr 
Sundaram has actually told the Chair and to give you a fair opportunity 
to [indistinct] to it.  So your answer it is simply that you are not part of 
that meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now let us move on to para - to 
10 
page 62.  Paragraph 28.18  and to afford you a chance - an opportunity 
to respond to that. 
“At this point Ajay asked me to go back to the office 
while Atul, Nazeem and Duduzane met him for 
discussions about the newspaper and commercial 
issues.  I was told the next day that - I was told the 
next day by - next day by Nazeem and Atul that 
they had secured R20 millions worth of business 
the previous evening.  By this time I had decided to 
resign as editor at ANN7 and go back to India after 
20 
the launch.  It was happening without the exten sive 
training I had suggested.  It was happening with our 
test runs with all systems and equipment in place 
but what really pushed me to resign was the 
violation 
of 
editorial 
integrity 
and 
dubious 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 121 of 176 
 
commercial dealings that I had seen with my own 
eyes.” 
Would also be this one of the occasions where people are 
simply placing you in the crime scene as you have suggested with the 
other witnesses?  You were not part of this meeting as well.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Just give me one second.  Let me just; this will 
be part of the same meeting correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and you were not part of it?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You were simply placed on the crime 
10 
scene as well? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Alright.  Now let us turn to page 63.  
Before we go to page 63 while you are still on page 62 so that you are 
able to familiarise yourself with the context of what I am - I am about to 
put to you.  This is now the fourth meeting which happened at Midrand.  
The offices of ANN7.  On 19 August 2013 were you part of this 
meeting? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  (No audible reply). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Zuma. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Were you part of this meeting?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Just give me two seconds please. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 122 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  This is a meeting that I was part of.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and in paragraph 30 Mr  Sundaram 
said: 
“Apart from the usual attendees the meeting was 
also 
attended 
by 
Mr Laxmi Goel 
and 
Mr Duduzane Zuma.  President Zuma toured the  
studios, newsroom and technical areas at the N - 
AAN7 Office and also met the staff during the visit.  
My last meeting with President Zuma happened just 
10 
48 hours before ANN7 launched.  I was told that the 
President would make a quick trip to the studios to 
take a look for himself and he was expected to stay 
on to see the rolling of the news bulletin.  I was 
part of the team that would show him around.  This 
was critical - this was a critical time as I was 
visually camping in the office.  Sleeping for a few 
hours in the temporary rest area created for a few 
members of the core team on the first floor of the 
New Age Offices.  I was in the morning in the 
20 
editorial meeting where I got a call from Aslam to 
come and receive the President.  He is expected 
any time now.  Laxmi and Atul  G want to see me 
immediately.  Aslam said outside.  I found Nazeem.  
Laxmi and Atul were already there.  With them was 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 123 of 176 
 
Duduzane Zuma.  I greeted them and waited with 
them for the Presidential convoy to arrive.”  
Do you recall these events?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Very clearly sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So you are part and parcel of this …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Activity, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct, sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If I may refer you to page 65 paragraph 
30.12.  It is right at the bottom.  
10 
“He stood at the PCR for another 15 minutes and 
then moved towards the door.  Laxmi, Atul,  Nazeem, 
Duduzane and I saw him off.”  
I take - I take that him was the President - the then President. 
“He said he was happy before he left.  Atul assured 
him that the station would be run as per his 
guidance and wishes.”  
Do you recall this happening?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I recall the event - seeing him off.  That is 
correct.  That did happen. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then the rest you can recall?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  The rest I was not part of that . 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Alright.  Now let me conclude on this 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 124 of 176 
 
evidence of Mr Sundaram and simply wrap up you know what appears 
to be his testimony at least in as far as it relates to you 
Mr Duduzane Zuma. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We know and you can take it from me 
that when Mr Zuma testified he did talk about the importance of a TV 
station and his role before the Chair and we know that you were the 
shareholder in Mabengela Investment.  Mabengela connected business 
with Government and Mabengela Investment held the shares in Infinity 
Media Networks.  Would I also be correct that Infinity operated the 
10 
channel ANN7? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I was the vehicle. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now the channel ANN7 benefitted 
through advertisement from Government.  You confirm that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Like any other channel around.  Yes.  That is 
correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mabengela was partly owned by 
Tegeta? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I will have to check that.  I am not …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Let us check that.  In turn Tegeta owned 
20 
(“OCH”) Optimum Coal Holdings?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Optimum Coal Holdings is the holding 
company of is the holding company of Optimum Coal Mine?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That sounds correct sir. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 125 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Optimum Coal Mine supplied coal 
to Eskom? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is very correct, sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Alright.  Can you now proceed to 
deal with Mr Booysen? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you go to Mr  Booysen.  Mr Zuma you 
have read Mr Sundaram’s affidavit.  Is that correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have - I have taken a look yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have read it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would you agree with me that in that affidavit if 
what he is saying is true then the former President was being briefed in 
very great detail about a number of many matters relating to ANN7?  
Would you agree or would you not agree with that - if what he is saying 
is true? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry.  Just to be clear you are asking me to - 
to give an opinion - a speculative opinion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether - if you read what he is saying you would 
take the view that the former President was very involved in matters 
relating to ANN7? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is a very tricky question Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It (intervenes). 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not - I do not have a problem answering 
but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 126 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But that is - you are asking … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  For a view and opinion a speculation which I 
am not comfortable giving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not speculation.  It is - it is simply when you look at 
what Mr Sundaram says …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were doing.  The meetings they were having  
with the former President.  The issues that he says they were being 
discussed and it may be that the former President when he gets a 
10 
chance he will say there is nothing like that.  There are no - no such 
meetings happened - that happened or there were som e meetings but I 
was not involved in the kinds of details that this person is talking 
about. 
So it maybe that that is what I will be told but I am simply 
saying if what he says is true it seems to me that the former President - 
for President’s role or involvement in N7 - ANN7 was not superficial.  It 
is quite - it was quite - he was quire involved in it.  So I am inviting you 
to say whether if all of that was true you would share the same view or 
would you say no when I look at what he is saying I would not  say the 
20 
former President was very involved.  I would say since his involvement 
was superficial. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chair I see you pushing me to give a view.  I 
will give you a view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I want - I want a view, ja. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 127 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, but I would also like to place it if this 
Mr Sundaram’s version of events was not true.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Is there anyone else that can give that same 
speculative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Anyway to answer your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I would have to agree with you most - most 
definitely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so - but you say as far as you know that - what 
he says is not true? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  I am answering your question.  I was just 
putting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Putting my view across … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  As a - as an alternate but to answer your 
20 
question since you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You - you have pushed me to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I will answer it.  My view is I would have to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 128 of 176 
 
agree with you.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  The reason why I am simply raising that is 
that in part - somewhere in his affidavit Mr Sundaram seems to - well 
he certainly says that the former President was much more involved 
with ANN7 issues than you were.  Despite the fact that you had 
shareholding in AAN7.  You - you did - you remember that part of his …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, yes.  I remember that.  I remember that 
clearly sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, sir.  Your - your own involvement in ANN7 are 
you - I - I think out of the four meetings you did say there is only one 
10 
that you attended. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he talks about. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  On the face of it without you putting your input in 
regard to that that - that seems to go along with what he is saying.  
Here is a situation where the  former President and ANN7 people have 
four meetings with him.  He is not a shareholder but here is the 
shareholder - 30 percent shareholder. 
Out of those four meetings only one that he attends but of 
20 
course there may be other meetings that you were involv ed in that 
Mr Sundaram does not talk - talk about but I just wanted to - to mention 
that and just hear whether you have something to say about your - your 
own level of involvement on - in ANN7 issues. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I will - I will respond. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 129 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Firstly he mentioned that I was part of a 
number of meetings but then he mentions that I did not contribute to 
any of the meetings.  So he cannot have it both ways.  He needs to 
decide whether I was there.  I was active or I  was not there and as I am 
saying to - to the Commission is I was not part of those meetings.  
That is the first point I want to make and Chair the second 
point is besides ANN7 a lot of other companies that I have - as 
Mr Mokoena pointed out.  I was a share holder/director whatever the 
case was at that time.  There has been a prevailing narrative up until 
10 
this point about State Capture, corruption, influence outside of 
Government, appointing of Ministers and whatever else.  
Now I made the decision to pull back  and not to be active in - 
in a lot of roles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To my detriment.  So I could not grow with my 
company … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And not just Mr Sundaram.  I am sure there will 
be a lot of staff … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That worked in the offices.  They would have 
said then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  We have not seen this gentleman around in a 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 130 of 176 
 
long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I would make some - some visits from time to 
time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And give my input …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Where I could. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Now the point I am trying to get to is if it was 
10 
the other way around …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And I had been in all these meetings.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I had been there …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Directing traffic …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Whatever - and whatever purpose I need to be 
in that meeting for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Today I would be sitting here and you would be 
asking me the question on …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You have been placed at these meetings.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 131 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  There is no editorial interference from 
shareholders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What would I say about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I would rather be sitting at this point saying 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not sure what Mr  Sundaram is talking 
10 
about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Because if it was the other way around.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You would be asking me and you would 
actually be putting to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That as a shareholder I was part of these 
meetings and I was interfering editorially.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So I have spoken in a roundabout way but I 
just wanted to make that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I - I think what you have said is 
important but let me just make sure I understand it.  With special 
reference to my question you seem to be saying I am not denying that I 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 132 of 176 
 
was not very involved in ANN7 but there was a reason for it.  I decided 
to pull back but also there were a number of o ther companies in which I 
was involved.  Is that right?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding of what you are saying correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  You are correct.  As - as well as me 
having to have limited my roles as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  That is what I am talking about.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  You are correct.  You are correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No.  That - that is important because it is - 
10 
we want to hear all perspectives because without all the perspective s 
things might seem to be looking in a certain direction but when has all 
the perspectives it is important because what you are saying is I 
deliberately try to limit my - my role for - for the reasons that you have 
given. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Thanks Chair.  Mr - Mr Zuma I was just 
20 
about to move now to the evidence of Mr  Booysen.  He testified before 
this Commission.  He informed the Chair that he joined the South 
African Police in 1976.  It is folder number four.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and he told the Chair that he was 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 133 of 176 
 
promoted to different ranks.  I mean starting from the Colonel, 
Brigadier and Major-General.  He told the Chair that you were once a 
complainant in a criminal matter that involved Mr Ian Endres concerning 
a fraud line betting scheme.  Would that be correct?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is incorrect. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is incorrect? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is - yes.  It is incorrect sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And how did you encounter Mr  Booysen? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I met him through a mutual friend of ours.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A mutual friend? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And under what circumstances?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Just an introduction. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Just an introduction? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mokoena.  I missed - I missed the - the 
question to which Mr  Zuma answered it is not correct.  I believe the 
first question. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He says that to the extent that 
Mr Booysen says that he was once a complainant in a matter involving 
20 
a fraud betting scheme …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And he says that is incorrect …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But he admits that he did meet 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 134 of 176 
 
Mr Booysen I think under different  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and we just about to interrogate …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Those circumstances where you met 
Mr Booysen.  Do - can - can you share with us? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So there is the issue that he is speaking about 
which is not my issue and I ha ve denied it.  There is a mutual friend of 
10 
ours that was handling his own matters at that time which relates to the 
issue that you just raised which is not my issue and that is how this 
whole thing arose of the meeting. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So this issue that he is telling the Chair 
about is not your issue but it is the issue of a mutual friend?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Oh.  So that is how you met.  In those 
circumstances? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  In those circumstances.  So it was purely by 
chance … 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And it was just a social. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA 
SC: 
 
And 
would 
I 
be 
correct 
that 
Lieutenant Botha from the Hawks in KwaZulu -Natal was the one 
appointed to investigate that case sir?  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 135 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not know about that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You do not know about that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now Mr Booysen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that do you have any recollection 
whether maybe when the mutual friend laid the complaint or asked for 
the matter to be investigated?  You accompanied him and the - and that 
maybe that is how General Booysen might have thought both of you 
were complainants in that matter?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Youi did not (intervenes)?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  It had absolutely nothing to do with that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Specific subject matter, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you - you know of no reason why he would think 
you were the complainant in that matter?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Confusion but I - I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, but flowing from what the Chair was 
asking you.  He says that he did not meet with you once but on many 
times when you would inquire about the progress of the investigation in 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 136 of 176 
 
this matter.  Is he also - he is - he is not telling the truth?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What I am saying is I met him a few times - 
numerous times if you wan t to put it that way and it was purely on a 
social basis.  There was no discussion of any pending cases of any 
sort.  I was not following up any cases of anybody.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It - it was just on a social basis?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He relayed one such meeting that took 
10 
place in Sandton.  Can I refer you to page 3 of his statement and he 
states - Mr Chair I am referring to paragraph 1-5-8.  He says: 
“On 16 August 2015 a few days before I was 
interviewed for the post as the Head of the Hawks I 
was contacted by Captain Dirk Swart from SAPS on  
behalf of Duduzane Zuma the former President’s 
son who wanted to meet me which I agreed to.  I 
knew Duduzane as a result of a fraud investigation 
in which he was a core complainant - complainant 
in a criminal matter.  The investigation related to a 
20 
complaint by Duduzane and one Winston  Innes 
against Ian Andries concerning a fraud in an online 
betting scheme (gambling).  At the time I had 
appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Marthinus Botha from 
the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal - in KZN - to 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 137 of 176 
 
investigate the alleged fraud.  I had previously met 
Duduzane a few times when he inquired about the 
progress in the investigation.  One o f these 
meetings took place in - at his office in Sandton 
when I was in Gauteng for a meeting.”  
I take it that you dispute everything that he says in that 
paragraph even though we can see - what - whatever - what you are 
saying to the Chair it seemed that you did meet with him a few times 
but not as - related by him your meetings.  It was simply on social - on 
social basis? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Before I answer that.  I will answer that.  If I 
may just ask a question.  What does co complainant mean?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I do not know.  Maybe we will ask 
Mr Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A co complainant must be a person that 
launched a complaint together with you.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is - it is somebody who together with somebody 
else lays a complaint. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  (Intervenes). 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So that document would be available if I am 
correct. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 138 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That document or that (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  There ought - there - there ought to have been at the 
time.  I do not know now, but there ought to have been documents.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Then I think we should pull that document up 
then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That will answer that question …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And then moving onto - I mean I think that it is 
10 
- it is clear that we have met a few times.  We have not disputed that.  I 
once again deny that I was a co complainant and I wish those document 
- that - that record could be pulled up.  As for the meeting happening in 
my Sandton offices.  I do not recall.  It could have happened.  It is 
possible but I do not recall. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think - I think maybe - maybe I could say that 
probably for the Commission’s purposes it - it is neither here nor there 
whether you were a co complainant or not.  I think what is important is 
you - you had met with him …  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A few times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a number of occasions. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to this. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 139 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  May I humbly disagree with you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I think that is quite a focal point here because 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The theme of the - of the meetings and the - 
the subsequent meetings …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Is based on me being a co complainant which I 
have said I am not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but you see the - the issue in which he says you 
were a co - a co complainant might not be the type of issue that the 
Commission is really looking - it might not be the type of issue that the 
Commission is busy with you know in terms of what it has to 
investigate.  That is what I am saying.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Maybe to take that point further with the 
Chair.  If you turn to p age 4 you will see the importance of why you 
were sent a 3.3 Notice.  He proceeds at paragraph 1 -5-9 and I will read 
that to paragraph 1-6-4 for you to react at once in those - on those 
paragraphs.  He said that: 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 140 of 176 
 
“I met Duduzane at the Sandton Gauteng Station 
where I took it.  He wanted to discuss his matter.  
Duduzane was driving a black Rolls Royce.” 
Can I pause?  Do you have a black Rolls Royce or did you 
own one at some point? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Not a black Rolls Royce but there is a white 
Rolls Royce, sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Oh a white? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you say there is.  At the time that he is talking 
about … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  At the time, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  At that time there was a white not a black one.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja.  I was - I was doing well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  He - he just got - he might have just got the 
colour wrong. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I just had to ask that question. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So that I was - you - you do have one or 
you did own one? 
“Duduzane had suggested that I get into the vehicle 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 141 of 176 
 
with him.  I told my son who was with - with me at 
the time that I would be driving with Duduzane and 
that he should follow us.  My son followed us in his 
own vehicle.  I took it that we were going to his 
office in Sandton.  We chatted about odds and 
ends.  There was no discussion about his fraud 
matter.  Prior to our arrival Duduzane had made no 
mention that we were in fact going to the Gupta 
compound or anything regarding my interview into 
the position of National Head of the Hawks.  The 
10 
next moment we pulled up at the residence in 
Sandton which I recognised - recognised as the 
Gupta’s Saxonwold compound.  I alighted from the 
vehicle by which time my son had walked up to me 
and asked me whether we were there - whether we 
were where he thought we were.  I responded and 
told him that I thought so.  Although I was caught 
by surprise I decided to see how things would 
unfold.  We were escorted by security guards and 
entered the house where the - where we handed our 
20 
cellphones over to them before entering the lounge.  
Tony Gupta was the only Gupta brother present .  
There were also house staff present which I 
gathered were from India who served us some light 
Asian snacks.  Tony spoke to my son who is an IT 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 142 of 176 
 
specialist and told him if he wanted to go into 
business a venture he should speak to them.”  
And the next page the last two paragraphs: 
“There were no significant discussions but what I 
need to - what I indeed considered curious was that 
Tony knew that I was about to interviewed a few 
days later for the post of National Head of the 
Hawks.  Although I recall that a  daily local - local 
newspaper in KZN the Mercury at the time reported 
that I had applied for the post as National Head of 
10 
the Hawks.  Tony - Tony said that if I was appointed 
we should have supper together in Durban.  I did 
not know what to make of his st atement but 
suspected that he wanted to create the impression 
that - that should I be - should I be appointed he 
had had a hand in it and that I would consequently 
be indebted to him.  I would like to reiterate that 
Tony did not say this directly and that this - and 
that it is merely speculation on my part.  I laughed 
and said that we could.  Duduzane who was present 
20 
did not partake in the conversation other than 
discussing 
generalities. 
 
After 
having 
had 
refreshments my son and I left.  I did not hear from  
the Guptas again.  This was my one and only visit 
to the premises.” 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 143 of 176 
 
And I give you a chance or should I also say that this is one 
of the instances where you were also placed in the crime scene.  You 
were not part and parcel of this meeting?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Please.  Give me a chance please.  Give me a 
chance please sir to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess crime scene in inverted commas Mr …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokoena? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because certainly in regard to this meeting there 
10 
does not seem to be a suggestion of any …  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Impropriety. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any impropriety or any criminal activity.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   If I may be allowed to res pond thank you.   
But then to start off with is like I said the interactions between myself 
and General Booysens were on a social basis, that’s the the 
engagements we had, we discussed a lot of weird and wonderful things 
but it was on a social basis.   I h ave detailed that is to how we got in 
20 
touch.  Now on this specific day then what leads to it is he would 
always ask questions about the Gupta family, which a lot of people ask, 
friends, family, strangers, and he is obviously a career policeman so he 
has got a level of inquisitiveness or quite an investigative nature, even 
when we had discussions on general stuff, random stuff, he would 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 144 of 176 
 
always enquiry from a policing perspective.  I mean that is his history.  
 
So in a few discussions prior to this eventful da y he’d raised a 
question like how are the guys, you know what is their situation, or 
what’s their story, like I said the usual questions, and I said look one 
day if there is an opportunity I will take you to meet them, just like I 
have taken a lot of people to meet the guys, just like I have taken Mr 
Tony to meet a lot of other people, friends, family, just to get a 
perspective, because a lot of people don’t have that perspective, an 
inter-personal engagement. 
 
So this leads us to this day and I may be wron g but if my 
10 
memory serves me correct this would have been a weekend and not a 
week day, so for me to – for there to be a suggestion that we are going 
to the office I am not too sure about that.   By the time we had 
arranged to meet at the Gautrain, if I re collect he was coming from 
either Midrand or Pretoria, the plan was to go to number 5 Saxonwold, 
and that is exactly what we did. 
 
He arrived, we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry to interrupt you. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he too knew that the plan was to go to the Gupta 
20 
residence? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That was the only plan for that day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That was the plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.

MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   There was nothing else, like I said I m ay be, I 
stand to be corrected but it was definitely a weekend.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I mean we have met a few times you know and 
there’s times where I have met him in Pretoria.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   So there is no issue of the venues we have 
met in interesting places.   This specific day was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, was for going there? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, this was that we had agreed, okay if you 
10 
come through I will take you through to meet Mr Tony ...[indis tinct] I 
would  like you to meet him, and he said okay if that is case, whether it 
was inquisitiveness, whether he thought I was joking I don’t know but 
that was the plan for the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I interrupted you while you were 
continuing. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Okay, so that covers that point.  So moving on 
he is correct there was no discussion about any fraud matter, like there 
20 
was not any previously.  Let’s move on to pa ragraph 163, definitely 
general discussions, there was some specific discussions with the son, 
obviously on him being an IT specialist and opportunities around that 
nature of what he does, the usual pleasantries.  Getting to the point 
where – because what paragraph 163 actually, forgive me but it doesn’t 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 146 of 176 
 
make sense to me.   If you read the whole thing, the whole paragraph it 
takes you from an accusation of prior knowledge to a Hawk’s position 
or prior knowledge to an interview for a Hawk’s position or short list.   
Then it goes on to say that this popped up in The Mercury at the time 
so it could have been public knowledge, then it winds off to an 
impression creation of information being known beforehand and then it 
ends off with a reiteration, a firm reiterat ion that the statement was not 
made directly.  It is a very confusing paragraph to me, so I cannot 
respond to that.   It has got a whole host of things that don’t make 
sense to me, but what I can say is that was not discussed and that was 
10 
definitely not the issue, that is on paragraph 163.  
 
Yes, I think that’s what I comment to respond.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, now to sum – to sum up what you 
have testified in regard to this paragraph, I understand you correctly to 
say that indeed you did meet him at Gautrain, you did take him to the 
Gupta residence, and he did meet a Gupta brother on the day in 
question, and had discussions yes.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes.    
CHAIRPERSON:  You know when General Booysen was givin g evidence 
20 
here I think I asked him a question about the purpose of the trip to the 
Gupta residence, because it did not seem to me that it was clear what 
the purpose was, if you look at what he said happened once he was 
there, but you say that there was a purpose, is that right?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, and I will reiterate it if you will allow me 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 147 of 176 
 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, go ahead. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   The purpose on that day was very specific.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   By the time we agreed to meet up at the 
Sandton Gautrain Station we all knew where we were going to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That was discussed prior to us getting, and 
the discussion was preceded by a discussion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   On enquiring about the nature of the Gupta 
family and so on and so forth, and I would say look that’s my guy, just 
as much as I have a good relationship with him, I was starting to build 
a relationship, I believe at least, with Mr Booysen and if the time arises 
I would love for you guys to meet and he said no it is cool, and we will 
meet and that was that specific day so the purpose for the meeting 
happening was purely a hello, how are you, it was a meet and greet, 
there was no other specific purpose.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So am I right in understanding you to be saying that 
in previous discussions or discussion in a previous discussion he had 
20 
expressed an interest in meeting the Gupta brothers, or a particular 
Gupta brother socially?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Socially yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes, he had expressed that interest.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, after discussion definitely. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 148 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and unlike – is it Mr Hower that we dealt with a 
while ago, in respect of whom you say you are  not close to him.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Mr Chauke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mr Chauke.   General Booysen are you able to say 
as at that time you felt that the two of you were close, had a close 
relationship or not? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Obviously we do not have a long -standing 
relationship ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but ...[intervenes]  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   From the interaction over a period of time 
10 
leading up till then I think we had a very good report definitely, yes, 
yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   And I hope it is still that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   So if Mr Booysen is watching ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you that when he gave evidence here 
he said he found you to be very respectful and so on and – so that part 
I can say.   So you took him to the Gupta residence because he had 
expressed an interest in meeting the Gupta family.     
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Let me make it clear, due to prior discussions 
there were discussions around the Gupta family, so it was not him who 
decided let’s go meet the guys.  After discussion it was – you know I 
raised it and said look if you are asking all these questions you can ask 
them directly.   He seemed to – you know, so, ja so afterwards he is 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 149 of 176 
 
like if there is an opportunity to I would honour tha t opportunity I will 
do so.  I said okay fine.   So that day is the day that we went, we met 
up specifically to go and fulfil this exercise, for him to get a sense of 
who this family is, where they live, I mean it has been a major talking 
point and people are inquisitive about it, so I feel even with his 
background he thought okay, let me go and check it out and that is 
exactly what he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you see the reason why I am putting these 
questions is that I want to make sure that I do not misre present what 
you are saying.    
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you gave the answer that you have just given 
now the impression that I was getting was that you were saying that it 
was at his instance that you took him to the Gupta reside nce because 
he had expressed an interest in meeting the Gupta family, or one or  
more of them, so that is what I was checking.     
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be correct to put it that way?     
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   If I may answer it, not, if I may just answer in 
this way. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, he seemed to have a lot of questions 
...[intervenes]      
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  There were questions, there were discussions 
and I said to him these are open people ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I can take you there.     
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 150 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Ja, if you would like to meet them at any point 
let me know, and he could have said no, he said yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So if you are asking me, if you’re saying at his 
instance I am not too sure about that, but this is the way it panned out.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so it may or may not be at his instance but that 
is the context in which  ...[intervenes]     
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, there was a build-up to it yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had questions that he was asking about them to 
you.    
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Like many other people Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and then from your discussion with him it was – 
you all agreed that when there is an opportunity you could take him 
there.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no thank you.     
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   But he seemed to say, I mean from the 
paragraph that you have read that when you fetched him at the 
Gautrain he was not aware that you are going to take him t o the Gupta 
residence. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No, then that is not true sir.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, and I mean that is also you would 
recall that we also traversed that questioning in light of Mr Jonas, he 
also said that he did not know that he was  going to be taken to the 
Gupta residence and you say that is not true.  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 151 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, that’s what I am saying, I mean would it 
make sense on a random weekend we decide to meet up, to drive all 
the way from Pretoria to Johannesburg, and meet up a t the Sandton 
Gautrain station, the offices are closed on a Saturday so reasonably 
you cannot expect me to be taking you to an office.  It can happen, I 
may have the keys in my pocket, but it is a Saturday.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, but you can take me to your 
house? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja, 100%.     
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And not to the Gupta residence. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   But the specific discussion was we are 
meeting in Johannesburg, I can – if you want to meet the guys I can 
take you through and there was that agreement.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – is your understanding that he came all the 
way from Kwa Zulu Natal for the purpose of that trip to the Gupta 
residence or is the position that he was in Gauteng and there was an 
opportunity to meet ...[intervenes]  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...and to go there and that is what was happening.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, I do not want to put other people’s 
20 
business in the street, but he was in Gauteng at that specific point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Some of the meetings that we have had have 
been in the Gauteng space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.    
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 152 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   More specifically Pretoria.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   This given time he honoured me and he 
graced me with his presence in Johannesburg so he made the trip, and 
I appreciated him for doing that because he did not have to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   And from there we went through to the 
residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair the two that are remaining it is 
10 
Mr – it is Advocate Ramatlhodi and Mr Mofe.   You must have read their 
statement.  The legal team took ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before you do that just maybe to complete 
maybe what I am saying might be kind of observation, some things that 
one is noting.  On this occasion there is somebody that you are taking 
to the Gupta residence, that person – the person that that person meets 
at the Gupta residence is Mr Rajesh Gupta, Tony Gupta, so t hose are 
the two aspects, the third one is the one that Mr Mokoena mentioned 
that what we have is on the two trips, on the two visits to the Gupta 
residence, one involving Mr Jonas, the other one General Booysen, 
20 
both of them say they were not aware that t hey were being taken to the 
Gupta residence, but you have said actually each one of them knew 
quite well that the trip was going there.  In the case of Mr Jonas that 
was decided after everybody, after you had met at the Hyatt Hotel in 
regard to General Booysen you say that – there must be a trip to the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 153 of 176 
 
Gupta residence, it had been discussed and decided even before you 
met at the Gautrain station?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that is correct Chair, I think it is – it may 
not be well known, it may well known, I do n’t know, it was pointed out 
in the company organogram that Mr Tony is a business partner of mine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Mr Tony Gupta is a business partner of mine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, and he is also a very dear and close 
friend. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was about to check that because I seem to 
have heard somewhere that out of the Gupta brothers he was the one 
that was quite close to you. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   that is correct, the reason I am pointing that 
out is because I spent a lot of time with him, on a daily basis.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And in regard to him we can say he was particularly 
close to you? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   More than particularly close, that is my guy.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   That’s your guy?   I am just about to 
move to the statement of Mr Mofe.  The legal team of the Commission 
took the view that the two of them mentions your name but they do not 
implicate you, and ...[intervenes]  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 154 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are you talking about now?     
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Mr Ramatlhodi and Mr Mofe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, however you are given a 3.1 
notice.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   You might have read their statement, 
both of them, I mean Mr Mofe simply confirming what he was told by Mr 
Ramatlhodi.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes sir. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Then we can stay with Mr Ramatlhodi, 
do you need – do you wish to react to any of the  contents of his 
statement?    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No I have got nothing to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  For the – I am sorry Mr Mokoena, for the sake of the 
public and those watching do you want to repeat what they say?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes Chair.   Let’s go to folder number – 
it should be 5 I think.  If you go to folder number five and you go to 
page 2, the relevant portions where your name is mentioned appears to 
be paragraph 2 to 11 and as requested by the Chair let me 
20 
contextualise them and simply you know by reading only those relevant 
portions.   
 
Paragraph 2 says: 
“Following my appointment I received many congratulatory 
messages including one from Duduzane Zuma.  What was 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 155 of 176 
 
peculiar about Duduzane’s messages was that he asked me 
to meet me and convey his message personally.   At the time 
I responded by saying I was very busy in Cape Town and that 
during weekends I should still be busy because of my political 
appointments.   Then after a few months I got a frantic call 
from Duduzane who was de manding to meet me.  I arranged 
to see him at St George’s Hotel where we were having a 
National Executive meeting.  In that meeting he said to me he 
was sorry to meet me under those circumstances where he 
had lodged a complaint against me instead of meetin g me in 
10 
order to congratulate me.  He wants to tell me that he had 
received information from two sources that reported that I 
have been going around bad -mouthing him and his business 
associates, saying that they were involved in criminal 
activities.  I asked him who his sources were, he mentioned 
two names, one from India and the other from South Africa.   
I do not remember those names because he promised to 
furnish me with their names in writing.  That never happened.  
He also mentioned that he told his fa ther, the President, 
about these allegations.  My response was that he grew up in 
20 
front of me, so I was one of his uncles, as we were referred 
to in those days by children in exile.   I went on to say that as 
his uncle I do not need to run around reporting  on him doing 
crime.  I would simply summon him and ask him if he was 
doing crime and if he was I would order him to stop or report 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 156 of 176 
 
him to the police.   I went to tell him that I will tell his father 
about our conversation.   His response was to ask me to meet 
Ajay Gupta in order to explain the situation to Ajay Gupta.  I 
told him I don’t know Ajay and I owe him nothing.  He left the 
meeting on that note.”  
Any of these facts emanating from this paragraph which are accurate or 
which you wish to comment on?   Did you call Mr Ramatlhodi, did you 
have that exchange of ...[intervenes]     
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   If I may start from – I am sorry – if I may start 
from point number two, and that states that following my appointment I 
10 
received many congratulatory message s including one from myself, I do 
not recall that but that could be true.  I will take it as that being the 
case, it sounds like something I could have done.  
 
As far paragraph 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 I am not sure what 
he is talking about. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when you say you are not sure what he is talking 
about are you saying you have no recollection of what he says you said 
to him and he said to you on that occasion, are you saying you are 
denying that you said to him what he says you said to him, and so on or 
20 
what is the position?    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   The position Chair is that I am denying the 
points that I mentioned now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   This version of events as placed in this 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 157 of 176 
 
document do not reflect the reality at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you admit having met with him on that 
occasion? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   On which occasion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he says first you made calls but ultimately the 
two of you met at St George’s Hotel. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say there was no such meeting?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   There was no such meeting, the only times I 
have met him have been in passing, there has been no formal sit -downs 
10 
or get togethers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you sure about that, because it might have 
been quite a few years back, it is important for you to reflect in case 
maybe it is true, you have forgotten or are you quite sure that it never 
happened, that meeting never happened?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes I am quite sure, I mean he is detailing a 
lot of events that have happened, that happened in that timeframe, and 
none of that is reflective to that so me meeting him at St George’s 
Hotel to discuss the subject matter that he is placing forth, becaus e 
that is what these paragraphs are about, is entirely not true.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, is it possible that the meeting and the discussion 
did happen but he might have got the venue wrong when he says St 
George’s Hotel, maybe it happened elsewhere?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   As I am saying any formal sitting with Minister 
Ramatlhodi has never happened, whether at St George’s or anywhere 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 158 of 176 
 
else, unless I have stated I have bumped into him in a number of 
places but that has been in passing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, well I do not know whether you would call this, 
the meeting that he is talking about, a formal meeting, but in other 
words you say that you have not at any stage in the past ever accused 
him or complained to him that you heard that he was bad -mouthing you 
or your companies and so on, you have never had any discussion along 
those lines with him?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No, I haven’t had that discussion with him 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm.    Yes okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   So all these details that he is putting 
from these paragraphs he is simply imagining them, they never 
happened?    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   More than that it is an environmental issue 
because now we have spent a whole page printing a whole bunch of 
stuff that should not be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Now if you turn to page – to folder 
number 6.    
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Paragraph 4, ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, the paragraphs that you said you don’t 
know what he is talking about did they inc lude paragraph 11, I’m sorry?    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes they do. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 159 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, I read it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   If you go to the next folder, that is the 
statement of Mr Mofe, and if you turn to page 5, paragraph 4 he is now 
relating to the Chair what you now happened in relation to you as 
stated by Mr Ramatlhodi.  He says that:  
“Former Minister Ramatlhodi informed me that Mr Duduzane 
Zuma called me and wanted to meet him for the purpose of 
which was to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister 
10 
Mineral Resources.  I cannot remember the dates since it was 
not essential that I record it.”  
And that is you know the essence of Mr Mofe simply confirming what he 
was told by Mr Ramatlhodi I am sure that is there anything to react to?     
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No I cannot react on this point. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes lastly Mr Chair I just want Mr Zuma 
to confirm if you go to folder number seven ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we go to number seven going back to what Mr 
Ramatlhodi said Mr Zuma ...[intervenes]     
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Folder five? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Going back to folder five and I am looking particularly 
at paragraph 11, so I am bearing in mind that you say the re was no 
such discussion – the discussion he is talking about never happened 
between the two of you, I bear that in mind, but if one looks at what he 
says, if that discussion did take place it seems that one of the things – 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 160 of 176 
 
one of the things you wanted to  do in paragraph 11 was to meet – to 
get two people, that is himself and Mr Ajay Gupta to meet but to 
discuss maybe rumours of bad-mouthing and so on and I go back to Mr 
Jonas, you have Mr Hlongwana, you get to know that there are rumours 
that Mr Jonas is blackmailing, was blackmailing Mr Hlongwana and then 
you want to bring them together to resolve that, it seems that Mr 
Ramatlhodi if what he is saying is true is coming up with a situation 
where you have become aware of rumours of him bad -mouthing your 
companies and I guess Mr Ajay Gupta as well and you want to get them 
to meet to discuss the matter, is that right, you understand that?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I see your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If his version is correct. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes, yes, and that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say it is not correct. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That is not correct and it fits into the narrative 
of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Which is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Which is to one being, myself being an 
20 
organiser, a conduit to meetings and influencing whatever else it is and 
the second point being I am always there trying to put people together 
to resolve you know issues that are non-issues via rumours in the 
atmosphere, so I take your point Chair, and where it comes from.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay, thank you. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 161 of 176 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now folder number seven, just for you 
to confirm you see that the first diagram it is having a face right on the 
centrefold, can you see that and there are a number of entities, I have 
gone through them, I just want you to confirm whether were you the 
director or have you any stake in those companies, if you want you can 
tick them one by one or just take us through.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   If I may make a request, because obviously I 
will need to check, a lot has changed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Over a period of time, so I don’t want to give 
10 
the wrong information.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Looking at some of these companies yes I 
have been involved, some of them I am not too sure what the situation 
is, so far I can request that if I – whatever question is being raised I 
can pointedly go through one by one and I can submit it to the 
Commission as soon as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Because I won’t be too sure at this point.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should not be a problem, so in other words you 
want to check before you give any answer in regard to each of  the 
companies, because there are too many of them.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Everything active not active, share register 
the whole thing.

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that should not be a problem.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   If you can also do the same in relation 
to Mabangela.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I will do that, I will do that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Chair that concludes the questioning for 
Mr Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, there are two w ays in which this can be done, 
10 
one obvious one is for you to submit an affidavit in which you explain 
what the position was.    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not apply my mind to your question Mr Mokoena 
whether you were talking about now o r you were talking about at a 
particular time, so when he looks he needs to be able to say in this one 
I have been a shareholder or director from that time up to now, so is 
there a timeframe that he ...[intervenes]  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   No, he ...[indistinct] just look at the 
company and whether he knows that at some point he was a director 
20 
and he can give us the timelines of it yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   That will quite help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that can be done and do you thin k you would need 
more than seven days to ...[intervenes]  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 163 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No, no, most definitely not Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so let’s say today is Monday if at all possible if 
that affidavit could be delivered to the Commission not later than 
Monday next week. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright.   You are done?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   I am done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Before I release or allow your counsel to say 
something I just want to ask one or two questions g oing back to Mr 
Jonas and the meeting in the Gupta residence.  Mr Jonas said that 
10 
among other things he said that the Gupta brother who was in the 
meeting told him that I think told him that they would make him rich or 
he would be rich or something to that  effect and said that – said 
something along the lines that you had become a billionaire or they had 
made you a billionaire, I am not checking now the exact wording, and 
that you – I think he said they said to him you had been able to buy a 
house in Dubai at that time.  Now of course the question that 
immediately arises would be in case those things are factually correct 
how would Mr Jonas know them or were they publicly, were they 
information that was publicly available, so I just want to raise that 
20 
because it is in my mind as well.  I don’t know if you are able to say 
anything?    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   My only comment at this point is I am not sure 
where you would have got that information from, but there has been a 
great deal of publicity around my financia l status, I mean it is not 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 164 of 176 
 
secret, I mean that is one of the reasons I am sitting here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so ...[intervenes]  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   And that is for the claims that I have been 
made this wealthy person and then secondly is property in Dubai, t hat 
has also been – I am not sure if you have seen it or not, but 
unfortunately I have, it has been well publicised.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   In the media space so I think those ideas that 
have made the rounds over the past few years.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But part of my question would be whether leaving out 
10 
what the position is now of what is publicly available whether at that 
time that was publicly ...[intervenes]  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Like I said I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, thank you.   Thank you.  I think counsel 
wants to say something?  
ADV PIET LOUW:   Yes Chair I would have thought that we have right 
of re-examination just shortly, I have got about seven points.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Sorry, sorry, sorry to do this again to 
20 
everybody but am I the only one who needs to use the bathroom in this 
room? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   If we may take a comfort break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is alright, I wanted to say to you earlier on 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 165 of 176 
 
you asked for a comfort break but I wanted to say the Chairperson 
needs to be au fait with all the terminology because sometimes it is 
comfort break, sometimes it is an opportunity to wash hands.  Okay we 
are at twenty to four.  We were goin g to, we normally stop at four but 
sometimes when it is necessary we go beyond that.  We do have some 
witnesses tomorrow but they are short so depending on how much time 
you need I just want to mention that subject to everybody being 
agreeable there is an opportunity of finishing tomorrow morning.  
ADV PIET LOUW:   Mr Chair we understood in fact that we were going 
to be here for two days and that – we have a difference on our side of 
10 
the fence, we understood two days and our colleague understood one 
day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can say that certainly my contemplation was 
that we should be able to finish with him in one day but that should we 
not finish we would continue the following day before other witnesses, 
but as things stand you know Mr Mokoena has no furt her questions, if 
we – there is room for us to try and finish, there is room for us subject 
to what Mr Hellens might have to say there is room for us to finish 
tomorrow morning. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:   Mr Chairman may I make a suggestions, no 
20 
fingers pointed, we thought it was one day, tomorrow is difficult for me, 
I have about five areas to cover which I don’t believe will take more 
than ten to twelve minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:   So if I could go before Mr Louw I would finish 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 166 of 176 
 
today and if Mr Louw needs to run into tomorrow then he can do that 
and I don’t have to be here because he is dealing with Jonas and I am 
not involved with Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, I don’t have problem with that, if he has no 
problem with that, yes. 
 
Okay then is that fine with you, would that be fine with you?  
ADV PIET LOUW:   That is excellent thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be fine, okay, so I think we must then take 
the comfort break and then come back and then Mr Hellens will then 
have a chance to re-examine and then when we finish then maybe we 
10 
can adjourn to tomorrow morning. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are nearly at quarter four, let us just adjourn until 
four o’clock, is that alright?   Okay, we adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Hellens you may proceed. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Zuma you will have 
heard the phrase on the scene of the crime a few times.  Now no one is 
20 
actually suggesting I think that a crime w as committed but they using 
the phrase in inverted commas to say at a significant moment you were 
there and yet at a significant moment again you were there and what is 
sought to be painted I think is a pattern which is undeniably something 
that must be questioned and is ominous. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 167 of 176 
 
Do you understand that that in my submission is the - the 
theme of those questions?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Now to test whether you actually were at the 
places that people say you were and doing or s aying what they say you 
were doing or saying it would appear to me that this Commission is - it 
is incumbent on this Commission to investigate whether there could 
possibly be any truth behind that which is being described by - by the 
witness. 
Do you have comment?  That is a leading question I beg your 
10 
pardon. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No that is - that is the Commission’s duty I 
believe (intervenes). 
ADV MIKE HELLENS: 
 
Now 
let 
us 
take 
a 
concrete 
example.  
Mr Dukwana is - said that someone at Saxonwold said that yo u were 
getting money from a mine in Jagersfontein and this was a good 
indication that it - it is suggested that there would be something in it 
for Mr Dukwana moneywise if he also climbed in to this effort with 
Mr Magashule - Magashule - to - to make money. 
I can give the appropriate section but we all know what we 
20 
are talking about.  Do you remember that evidence?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Do you have any interest in a mine in 
Jagersfontein? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  I do not sir. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 168 of 176 
 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Do you have any knowledge of a mine in 
Jagersfontein that you could possibly be said to be receiving money 
from? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Do the Guptas with whom you are negatively 
linked have a mine in Jagersfontein?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Would you invite this Commission to investigate 
what mines there are in Jagersfontein to establish whether it would be 
remotely possibly for you to get money from a mine in Jagersfontein?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  As I mentioned earlier that I thought that they - 
they had done.  They clearly had not but I definitely invite them to do 
so. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Now it would seem explicable that if you were 
not getting money from a mine in Jagersfontein and this was a 
portentous or ominous allegation made by a witness led before this 
Commission and before the public that that investigation as to the 
possibility even of you receiving money from a Jagersfontein mine had 
not in fact been investigated.  Would you agree?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I agree sir. 
20 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Now to conclude on Mr  Dukwana if it is found 
that there is not the remotest possibility of you receiving money from 
that source then it would appear outlandish that anyone would make 
such a suggestion and then it would  bear on whether Mr Dukwana is 
talking the truth at all as to your presence at a meeting where you say 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 169 of 176 
 
you were not present. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That would be correct sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  What is your attitude finally about the 
investigation into the Jag ersfontein money?  Do you invite it?  Do you 
ask for it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  As I said earlier on it is - it is a point that I had 
raised and with all due respect to the Commission.  I am slightly 
disappointed that it was not looked into but we are sitting here today 
and if there is a possibility of that being revisited the Chair did make 
his comments, ja. 
10 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Mr Zuma I have noticed you are very polite.  You 
say I am very disappointed.  You say I do not know what he is talking 
about and when you are asked more closely what do you mean by that.  
You say I deny it.  I take it that is your politeness coming through?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I believe so.  Yes sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Ja.  Now let us just talk about Mr  Booysen.  The 
Chairperson said well the issue is not whether you were a co 
complainant leading to your association with Mr  Booysen.  The fact is 
there was an association and you went to the Gupta house.  You 
yourself asked the question but do these documents still exist.  
20 
Can it not be established whether I was co complainant in a 
matter being investigated by Lieutenant  Botha in KZN.  Do you invite 
such an investigation? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I most definitely do sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  And if it is found that you are not a co 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 170 of 176 
 
complainant in the matter that would suggest that Mr  Booysen is 
completely mistaken or not honest about how your relationship with him 
arose. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  That will be correct sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  What possible reason would there be for him to 
be not frank - not honest or even mistaken about his relationship with 
you and how it arose? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not know. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  But if the background was not that you were co 
complainant that he came to be talking to but as a result of a friend of 
10 
yours being a complainant he got to know and in that context the 
conversation came to well you talk about the Guptas.  Why do you not 
come and see them?  What would your comment be then?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  You can just repeat that question please.  
What did you say? 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Mr Booysen pictures your relationship as being - 
he comes to meet you in a semi-official capacity or official capacity as 
a co complainant in a criminal matter.  Right?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Were you a co complainant in a criminal matter?  
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  I was not. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  What reason would Mr Booysen have to be 
mistaken or even to be not honest about that?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not sure.  He may have been confused.  I 
do not know. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 171 of 176 
 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Your version is that you became friendly.  You 
met because a friend of yours was a complainant in a criminal matter.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Right? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is it. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  And thereafter you became friendly? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I like to believe so, yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS: 
 
Mr Booysen 
does 
not 
characterise 
that 
relationship you had as a friendship or a fairly close acquaintanceship.  
He does not characterise it as that?  
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  He does not. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  He says you - you unexpectedly took him to the 
Gupta home. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is what he said. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  And what is the truth? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That all along as I detailed before when I was 
asked by the evidence leader  that day in question there was an 
agreement for us to go through to the said meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Hellens if I am not mistaken to be fair to 
General Booysen he does say that the two of them had several 
20 
meetings.  So - so the extent that what you have said to the witness 
might suggest that his version is that there might not have been much 
interaction between them before that.  
I am just saying my understanding of his affidavit is that he 
does say before that there had been quite some interactio n between the 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 172 of 176 
 
two of them. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Mr Chairman without asking the witness let me 
make a direct submission if I may.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  We invite the Commission to - to investigate 
whether Mr Zuma was a co complainant.  If it is show that he was not it 
would colour the background reason …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  To Mr Booysen explaining that they met and how 
they met and it would give impetus to Mr  Zuma’s evidence.  Namely 
10 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  We were friendly and he wanted to see the 
Guptas at my suggestion as I understand it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  And so I took him there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  As opposed to it started off as and then …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Something formal and then out of the blue.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  The investigation of co complainant …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Would contextualise and  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 173 of 176 
 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Destabilise we submit Mr Booysen’s evidence to 
the extent necessary …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  To make far less onerous - ominous the trip to 5 
Saxonwold. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  That is the point and then in conclusion.  
Mr Sundaram, he mentions you but without a purpose because you do 
not appear to have done anything in any of these meetings at all.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
10 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  But you get a mention. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Honourable every time. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Ja.  Sometimes when you are not there and 
once when you were there?  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  And then Mr Ramatlhodi too.  There does not 
seem to be much point in him pulling you in.  It is just that you are on 
the crime scene as Mr  Mokoena loves to say.  Coincidentally 
apparently. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
20 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Hellens.  I - I see Mr Hellens that you 
kept to your 10 to 12 minutes that was - that is to be commended. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So sorry. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  I have been around a long time. 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 174 of 176 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Sorry.  Excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Excuse me.  Mr Chair we spoke on this side and 
there is no chance of completing my side of the work today …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Thought of asking you whether you could perhaps 
commence at 9 o’ clock … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Tomorrow morning.  Then I should be done by 10 o’ 
clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that.  Well one, adjou rning is fine but we - we 
might not need to start at - at 9 o’ clock.  We might be fine with starting 
at 10 o’ clock because the other witnesses that are scheduled for 
tomorrow will be very short. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I thought …  
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It might just assist in getting the job done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no I understand.  No.  I - I understand. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So it will be 10 o’ clock then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we will start at 10 o’ clock.  We - oh I am 
sorry.  Mr Zuma. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So sorry to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to say something?  
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 175 of 176 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes please.  Just a concern from my side and 
it is quite a big concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Just from the evidence pack that has been 
presented today …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And that I have been questioned on.  There is 
a glaring omission.  I am not sure if there is a mistake.  
CHAIRPERSON:  A glaring omission. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Omission of - of a witness that testified in front 
10 
of the Commission and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh who has not been mentioned here?  Who has not 
been include here? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Correct.  That will be an Ms  Vytjie Mentor.  So 
I am not sure where that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Line of questioning will be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think - I think what may have been intended - maybe 
we should - we should adjourn.  Your counsel hears what you are 
saying and I think they have started talking to Mr  Mokoena. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will discuss and tomor row morning I will be told 
what happened to your concern. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible that it was thought that you might be 
07 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 178 
 
Page 176 of 176 
 
asked to come back at another time but Mr  Mokoena will - will deal with 
the … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The concern and then tomorrow morning I will be told.  
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we - we are going to adjourn or before we - we 
adjourn.  Okay.  Maybe we can deal with this tomorrow.  We will 
adjourn and then tomorrow we will start at 10 o’ clock.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
