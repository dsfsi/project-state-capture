PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 20 MAY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Good morning Mr Callard.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair when – when we broke on Friday we had 
gone up to page 15 paragraph 63.  Are you there Mr Callard?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we had gone through the upfront payment 
of R7.37 billion required for the various locomotives on the basis that 
they had to happen in that particular financial year.  We move then Mr 
Callard to your paragraph 64 and we start at 64 on the increase in the 
estimated total cost.  Could you take the Chair through your paragraph 
64 and following? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Thank you.  It was on the 15 April 
that I was asked by Mr Leher to assist in updated a memorandum from 
Mr Molefe to the BADC the Board Acquisition and Disposals Committee 
20 
on an increase in the estimated total  cost for the acquisition of the 100 
21 E Locomotives.  He g ave me a memorandum requesting a 
recommendation by BADC to the board for an increase in the estimated 
total cost of the 100 locomotives from R3.871 billion to R4.840 billion.  
This was an increase of approximately R1 billion or 25%.  May I take 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 3 of 247 
 
you to that memorandum which is on Annexures 18, 18A page 284.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  BB4[a].   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the same bundle?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is the same – the first bundle.  Yes Chair 
same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  284. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is Annexure 18A which starts on 281.  
You want us to have particular…  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the divider?  What is the divider number?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is divider 18 Chair.  Under 18 there are 2.  
There is 18 and there – 18A starting at 281.  So at 281 that is where 
the annexures starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard you specifically want us to turn our 
attention to page 284? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 284 of the memorandum. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Details a table – table 2 which 
reflects how the increase is made up.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is complimented from table 2 if I 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 4 of 247 
 
may draw your attention please to 285.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At paragraph 14 on page 285 
where the final amount is given as R4.840 billion or R4  840 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is the – table 2 indicates for us the 
increase from 3.8 to 4.8?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   To table 2 gives us the increase 
from R3.8 to R4 – it says there R44 million per locomotive but then 
added to that is we have a – an additional difference which comes out 
on paragraph 14 of page 285 and the asterisk point there is 10% is 
10 
added for options, variation orders, special tooling, test equipment, 
initial spares and capital spares.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Mr Laher provided you with this 
memorandum with a request – with a request to update the NPV?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In respect of the acquisition of these 
locomotives, did you? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes in the middle of page 285 at 
the – under paragraph 12 he writes: 
“That the NPV would become a negative XX billion at 
20 
the original hurdle rate of 18.56% Francis Callard to 
provide updated calculations.”  
And that was the work that I did on this memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now on page 285 you have got that XX billion rands – 
have you got the actual figures now or not really?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 5 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Chair I did not bring those 
figures or even put them in my statement as that was just essential 
work done.  My statement was related more to the aspect that I was 
surprised at the makeup of the figures of table 2 and the final price of 
R4.4 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no I just saw that at the end of that 
paragraph that you have read says you will provide updated 
calculations so I thought at the time of preparing this statement maybe 
those calculations were not available and that you might be having 
them now.  But you say you do not have them?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I provided those calculations.  
Those showed a change in the nett present value of the project.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which changed because of the 
increase in price the locomotives the nett present value reduced 
marginally but it was not such to negate the project.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay.  And on page 284 you have got that 44 – 
you said that 44 on table 2 at the end that total is R44 million per 
locomotive? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you multiply that by…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  BY 100 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the number of the locomotives to arrive at the – at 
the total increased amount. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  That is so.  Taking the 44 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 6 of 247 
 
million per locomotive times by 100 locomotives gives us the 4.4 
billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that 4.4 billion was an 8% 
gives us the figure of 4.840 at – as the contracted price on page 285.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Mr Callard the – your Annexure 
18A which is the document we are considering is the memorandum as 
received by you from Mr Laher?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct that is correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You indicated your paragraph 66 you express 
a view that you considered the increase excessive and difficult to 
justify. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Could you explain why that is so? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  On the first line the 
price per locomotive as per the board’s submission of the 31 January 
34.34 that… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please just a second Mr Callard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think you must just alert us when you move from 
20 
the annexures to the statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh apologies Sir I – at his paragraph 66 of 
the statement.  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is at page 15, 15.  So at – yes.  At 66 the 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 7 of 247 
 
Chair will note that Mr Callard states; 
“In my view the increase was excessive and was 
difficult to justify.”  
And that is the increase that is reflected in the – at page 284 of 
Annexure 18A.  My question to Mr Callard is why he forms that view?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  I formed that view with 
reference to line 2 of table 2 which was the impact of the exchange rate 
to contract value.  On the table it is indicated as 3.69 million per 
locomotive.  Given the short period of the time between asking for this 
quotation to the time of award I believed that impacted exchange rate 
10 
to be excessive I could not see an immediate justification for that 
increase.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just – I apologise Mr Callard.  Chair if we go 
to page 284.  The table 2 that Mr Callard r eferred us to he is dealing 
with that – with the items at table 2 to express a view on whether or not 
they are excessive under the circumstances or whether to – whether 
there is a base – there is a basis to justify that increase.  So I will 
request the Chair to keep his finger at 284. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is the table that Mr Callard is dealing 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard you have – table 2 indicates a 
price per locomotive as per board submission of 21 January 2014 of 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 8 of 247 
 
34.34 million. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have just spoken to the impact of the 
exchange rate to contract date resulting in an increase of 3.69 million.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please recap because I unfortunately had to 
interrupt you to assist the Chair to locate the page – the table. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  On the premise that the 
imported component of a locomotive of this nature is at the order of 
40%. If one were to take 40% of the 34.34 million over the relatively 
10 
short period with the movement of the exchange rate the 3.69 at first 
glance was excessive and that was certainly what it appeared to me.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would we be correct then to say that you 
would have expected an impact of the exchange rate what you are 
questioning is the value?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The quantum the x rate. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The quantum that is reflected there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is too… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is excessive in your view?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My issue was not with the line 
items. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLA RD:  Per se but more with the impact of 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 9 of 247 
 
some of the line items. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understood.  The next one is impact of 
inflation up to contract date.  Do you have a view on that?  The 
quantum of 1.26? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have no view on that.  It is just 
perhaps in line might even be conservative.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Anything else on the line items that you would 
like to draw the Chair’s attention to?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly and yes thank you.  The 
other line item, additional c osts for variations / duties of the 3.47 
10 
million that in our original submission was already built in to the 34.34 
million.  That factor was already included in the 34.34 million when we 
did the initial business case as being the total delivered price of t he 
locomotive.  This was not meant to be an addition in our original 
business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So whereas with line item 1 you may question 
the quantum insofar as additional cost for variation / duties is 
concerned you question the line item itsel f in its entirety that it should 
not have been part of the calculation to increase from the 34.34 
million? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that the correct understanding?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Any other issue you would like 
draw the Chair’s attention to at table 2?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 10 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes if I may then go to the next 
line item which is the cost to fix forward escalation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At – given on that table at 4.63 
million my cursory view is that that was over a two year delivery period 
of the locomotives bearing in mind it was to be fairly quick delivery 
over a two year period for CPI at 6% or 7% even that was excessive in 
relation to the local content the 60% local content of the locomotive of 
the 34.34.  In essence 34.34 60% of that would be around 20 million for 
example.  CPI over 20 million for two years at even at 6% per year 
10 
would give one a rough figure of 20 million at 6% po ssibly a 1.2, 10.8 
million.  Arithmetic but it did not come to 4.63.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Continue please. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The further point to that if I may  
refer to page 285.  The asterisk  there which gives a ten percent added 
for options, variation orders, special tooling, test equipment, initial 
spares and capital spared is a – if not a full duplication it is certainly a 
partial duplication of the line item on page 2 where additional cost for 
variations duties it is now reflected again as a 10% added for options, 
variation orders, duties – so from – it appears to be counted a number 
20 
of times.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And looking at that table it states that 
discount negotiated is 4.47 million per locomotive.  If one were to 
discount that discount the total of the additions would bring the 
purchase price to 4 – to 48, is that so?  If we look at the table and we 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 11 of 247 
 
do not take into consideration the discount negotiated, the actual 
increase comes to 48 million per locomotive and it reduces to 44 when 
one takes into consideration the discount negotiated?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that correct. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Interpretation of the table?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You proceed in your statement to quote from 
the Fundudzi Report in respect of this acquisition could – what is the 
10 
purpose of so doing?  Do you do so to indicate that Fundudzi your view 
or your conclusion is consistent with Fundudzi or what is  the purpose of 
that quotation? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Whether my view was consistent 
with Fundudzi given that my view was prior to that may I say that 
Fundudzi’s view was perhaps consistent with mine perhaps in some 
more detail and calculation but i t comes to the same – the same 
conclusion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for the record Chair the Fundudzi Report 
was – is part of the bundle on Transnet that has been submitted to you.  
20 
And Fundudzi did investigate this trans – particular transaction.  What 
then transpired after you had worked out the new NPV?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well sometime later when looking 
at this memorandum again and I am on item – paragraph 67 of my 
report that subsequent interrogation of the memorandum from Lehar 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 12 of 247 
 
raised the following question.  That para 5A of the memorandum states:  
“Foreign exchange rates the rand has depreciated by 7.8 for against 
the Japanese Yen.  This has impacted the expective price of the 
locomotive as approved by the – this has impacted the expective price 
of the locomotive as per the business case and ultimately the estimated 
total cost ETC is approved by the board by approximately 10.74%.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I commented that this was most 
unusual as the Japanese Yen woul d be associated with Mitsui Japanese 
Company and not CSR a Chinese company.  Furthermore the cash flow 
10 
spreadsheet that was presented that is Annexure 17 and that is page 
256 of the bundle in Annexure 17. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Also reflects a United States dollar 
for CSR.  I cannot talk to the anomaly why we would be justifying a 
price of a locomotive in Japanese Yen when in fact it was from China 
based on a USA imported component would be based in US dollars.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well was that possibly indicative of failure by 
whoever drafted the report to apply their minds to relevant issues 
because that would be relevant?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I read it as…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or could it be in other words some carelessness or 
could it be that it was something else?  Are you able to say or were you 
able to think of why anybody could produce a memorandum that had 
this kind of anomaly? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 13 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The only reason I can offer Mr 
Chairman is that given the time from w hen a memorandum was altered 
from my original calculations that those altering the memorandum did 
not either have the time or the base information to do a complete 
reworking of the memorandum.  To implement these changes would be 
quite extensive, it would take certainly a fair amount of work.  They did 
not have that amount of – they did not have that time available and 
hence just left it as changing the firm without changing the actual 
underlying assumptions and calculations within the memorandum.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Well on the face of it it points to say the least an 
10 
alarming amount of carelessness because here you are dealing with a 
transaction that costs billions. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And one would have thought that more care w ould be 
shown in working anything particularly that has something to do with 
prices and so on and this kind of mistake on the face of it just seems 
you know a very high degree of carelessness.  How can you miss using 
the correct currency for something like  this when you want to adjust 
prices? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I truly cannot explain it Mr Chair I 
20 
do not think it is explainable as I put in my statement I believe that Mr 
Singh with whom I had been submitting these original business cases 
and Mr Lehar the author of the memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From whom I received it that they 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 14 of 247 
 
should talk to this anomaly.  I cannot explain the anomaly but ully 
agree with you that it is unexplainable that one would justify a price 
increase from a locomotive which one is – where the foreign component 
is contracted in US dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To try and explain that based on a 
movement of Japanese Yen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It makes – I cannot see it making 
any logical sense whatsoever. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And one would have thought that maybe before 
it was given to you it would have passed a few people at least one of 
whom should have picked this up?  If the first person – if the drafter 
had made a mistake? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just – it is just strange on the face of it but 
maybe – maybe there will be an explanation that will show that you 
know it is not so strange. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would be interesting and 
informative if such an explanation were to come out Mr Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay thank you Chair.  Mr Callard the 
quotation in italics at your paragraph 67 actually derives from page 283  
of Annexure 18A under table 1 at A.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is – that is correct I should 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 15 of 247 
 
have mentioned that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we proceed.  Now this memorandum 
that Mr Laher gave you that we are dealing with now. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now a certain version of the memorandum that 
you were asked to effect certain changes to that were not of your own?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry if I understand Mr Chair you 
are… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja is it – is it a certain version of that memorandum?  
10 
Remember the one you were asked to – in respect of which you were 
asked to effect changes, you remember that one we talked about?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I did not draft this 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I received… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it is a complete different memorandum?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is complete… 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the one that we talked about?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is a complete different 
20 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And perhaps for clarity I should 
have mentioned that this memorandum was addressed – to be 
addressed to the Board Acquisitions and Development Committee 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 16 of 247 
 
motiving why the increase in the 100 Class 19 E Locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes, yes.  Now I – but – but what is strange 
is that it seems this different memorandum seems to be also 
characterised at least in part by similar carelessness to say the least 
as we saw in terms of the  changes that were you asked by Ms Mdletshe 
to effect on the other memorandum.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I would agree with – yes Mr 
Chairman I would agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You remember you told me  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That where they were supposed to say CSR they said 
GE and so on and so on and there were other things which were part of 
your concerns that just did not make sense.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know now you have another memorandum where 
a wrong currency is being used in order to justify or seek to justify an 
increase you know.  So it is – the two memorandum and maybe they are 
not the only ones.  Two memoranda seem to be characterised by at 
least in part similar kind of carelessness.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is so.  If I may summarise Mr 
20 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The memorandum I received from 
Ms Mdletshe modify – or with the change from Mitsui to CSR had – still 
had as its original assumptions locomo tive costs and calculations 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 17 of 247 
 
based in Japanese Yen.  The motivation for the increase post event 
because this is now the – I received this on the 15 May and the tenders 
– the awards have already been made.  This increase post event is a 
memorandum to motivate for the increase but nevertheless still based 
for Chinese locomotives – locomotives from CSR where the imported 
component is in dollars the increase is motivated on changes in the 
Japanese Yen.  I cannot explain that anomaly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is difficult to understand.  I mean you referred – 
you referred us on Friday you referred us to the email that Mr Gama 
sent to Mr Singh. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After receiving your email where you were raising 
your concerns about the other me morandum. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in that email he in his own words said this is a 
mess. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we – we know from what you told you us and 
maybe another witness will come and say ther e is something you 
missed that is why you told us this.  That – it looks like – it looked like 
20 
the memorandum went to the Board Acquisitions and Disposals 
Committee without correcting some of those obvious issues that you 
had raised.  So with that – so one would have thought that maybe after 
that any further memoranda would really be looked at quite carefully for 
– to make sure that these kinds of mistakes were not there.  But here 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 18 of 247 
 
we have another one that makes some of the same mistakes that we 
saw in the other one. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  They are – they appear – certainly 
they appear to have been carried through from that original 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They appear to have been carried 
through here without correcti on or qualification or explanation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They certainly appear so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I say maybe somebody will come and say no there 
is something you people do not understand there is nothing wrong with 
what these memoranda say.  We will wait to hear.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will.  I had indicated Mr Callard that that 
quotation at your paragraph 67 is extracted from page 283 of that 
memorandum under the table at p aragraph A.  Now it – looking at 
paragraph A I noticed that what you quoted is the first portion of 
paragraph A.  The remainder reads as follows and I quote.  
20 
“It should also be considered that during the 
negotiation process the rand was impacted by the 
possibility of war in the Ukraine which resulted in 
Transnet taking the view that the rand should be 
fixed 
at 
current 
levels 
and 
negotiations 
and 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 19 of 247 
 
contracting should be speedily concluded.”  
You do not deal with this part of that paragraph in your statement.  I  do 
not know if you can express a view - firstly whether you can explain 
what that means and secondly express a view what possible impact the 
anticipated war in the Ukraine would have on the price of these – these 
locomotives. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you counsel/Chair.  I cannot 
express a view on that.  Reading this memorandum was the first one 
comes across it in none - certainly in none of the discussions which I 
had had on foreign exchange rates and the like given this was this a 
10 
factor that we had taken into consideration personally that I can recall.  
One can – I could only speculate as to why this reason would be put in 
this document and speculate that the possibility the impact of a war in 
the Ukraine – I cannot make sense of it but let leav e it at that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  I thought you might – you might 
shed light on that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Seeing as it impacted the foreign exchange 
20 
increase.  So – but at the Chair says perhaps somebody will come 
available as a witness to explain these issues.  You at paragraph 68 
indicate that you had expressed concerns about delaying delivery and 
that we had dealt with on Friday already and you indicate that – that 
your concerns were realised on 6 June 2014 at paragraph 68. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 20 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you deal with the contents of paragraph 
68 …? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And going forward. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may and recapping that my 
initial email expressed concerns that Transnet engineering’s capacity to 
deliver.  Received this – an email on 6 June 2014 from a colleague.  He 
copied me on a mail that he had sent to his General Ma nager Capital 
Projects.  May I take you please to Annexure 19 page 290?  May I start 
10 
first please at 289? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  289 is just the mail from a 
colleague to myself and it is – the subject is Class 20E Production 
Concerns.  From my email I mentioned that:  
“Production concerns on the class 20E may impact 
the class 21E.” 
If I may then take you further to page 290 please which is a fairly long 
exposition of the class 20E production concerns.  It is not my intention 
to go into this in all its detail suffice to say that this page together with 
20 
the subsequent page 290 deals with these concerns in some detail but I 
would just like please to take you to one or two items as illustrative of 
the point. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If you could look at the first bullet 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 21 of 247 
 
point please under paragraph 1.  It says:  
“Note that the locomotive 20 015 is still on blocks 
and this locomotive was scheduled to be handed 
over in May for acceptance in June  2014.” 
It says: 
“Note that locomotive E20 015 that is class E20 015 
that is locomotive 15.”  
Could I ask you please to turn to page 297 of the - page 297 is a 
picture of a locomotive and it is marked – that is locomotive 20015 and 
we will see that it is still on block s whereas in blocks it should be far – 
10 
should have progressed a lot further.  It should already be on its 
bogies.  It should be on its wheels and it should be almost mobile and 
it indicates that this locomotive is way behind in its production.  If I 
could do a second example. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
The 
– 
under 
sub 
– 
under 
paragraph 2 there the first bullet says:  
“R/TE is scheduled to hand over locomotives 20 
016.” 
If I could take you please to page - picture on 29 – sorry – to handover 
20 
locomotive 20 016 and if you could have a look please at the picture on 
page 296. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the bottom of that picture it 
indicates that this is locomotive E20 016.  That is locomotive 16 and 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 22 of 247 
 
looking at the interior of that locomotive it is certainly nowhere near 
ready for – for handover.  A similar story is told if we look at locomotive 
E20 021 – locomotive 21 which is pictured on page 292.  If we turn to 
page 292 please and that is the interior of the locomotive.  This email 
was sent in May – sorry – in June. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  June. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In June and it said this locomotive 
is scheduled for handover for acceptance in July  2014 and the interior 
of the locomotive is totally emp ty.  It is devoid of equipment, motors 
and the like and this is – these are illustrative of the delays in the 
10 
production line. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and that conclusion is captured in 
Mr Harris’ email at 289 of a possible three month delay …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At paragraph 3 thereof?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is - supports his conclusion 
yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you said – you said having received this 
email and report you then drafted a memorandum conc erning these 
delays? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  The memorandum is in 
Annexure 20. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  You deal with that from your paragraph 
69? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will deal with that from paragraph 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 23 of 247 
 
69 - because of these delays and the collective concerns we had about 
these delays one of the options was to approach China South Rail to 
import 100 locomotives directly from China.  Recognise the implications 
on local content and the like but certainly this would bring them in fair ly 
quickly.  Recall that the motivation said that they could five locomotives 
per day.  So we should be able to get the 100 locomotives fairly 
quickly. I drafted the memorandum to this effect in conjunction with 
various colleagues.  I sent this memorandum to General Manager 
Rita Roper that perhaps that she would forward it to Mr  Gama so who 
would in turn forward it up the hierarchy that we import 100 locomotives 
10 
directly but it stopped at Ms Roper.  It did not go further.  However the 
purpose of this memorandum was – and tabling it – was just to express 
our concern at the delay and what the possible mitigating actions were 
we could take place– we could put in place to overcome those delays.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and you say this – as far as you are 
aware – this email was not acted upon?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This memorandum rather. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Email was not acted on. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then what transpired thereafter?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Nothing insofar as I was involved 
with in expediting locomotive delivery.  What happened thereafter was 
on – and that deals with – goes to item – paragraph 70 of my statement 
– that on 24 October I received an email from Niresh  Budhai from 
Transnet Corporate.  Budhai’s responsibilities – as I understand it - 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 24 of 247 
 
included providing administrative support to the various approval 
bodies in the Transnet Group and show that submissions were in the 
required format and met the required standard and was the liaison for 
communicating with the Department of Public Enterprise.  The essence 
of this point was that Budhai requested that I review a table of risks 
and mitigating actions relating to 100 21E locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may just point out for record purpos es the 
spelling of Niresh Budhai - his first name N-I-R-E-S-H, surname B-U-D-
H-A-I.  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  As per my paragraph 
10 
71 I updated the table in consultation with my technical colleagues from 
Freight Rail and would highlight the risks and the mitigation actions 
largely mirrored the concerns of my email to Mr  Gama and Mr Jiyane in 
January 2014 and the remedial actions incorporated the specifications 
of the 20E – 21E locomotives.  If I may take you to pa ge 21 – sorry – to 
Annexure 21? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To Annexure 21 page 306 the 
subject of that email on page 306 reads:  
“Risk/mitigation 
plans 
for 
the 
100 
coal 
line 
20 
locomotives.” 
And at the bottom of that page is a table of the risk and the mitigation 
actions.  The mitigating actions which I put in are in the lighter colour 
in blue where I amended and added too what was already in the table 
and particularly under the design risk and the operational readiness 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 25 of 247 
 
was what I added.  Essentially to all intents and purposes as I stated 
this highlighted the risks already previously pointed out.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what would be the implications of the fact that 
what you were coming up now was based on the c oncerns you had 
raised earlier with Mr Gama but which had been ignored?  What – what 
would be the implications of the fact that down the line you are raising 
– your update is based on the same concerns.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those concerns had previously been ignored.  Could 
10 
they be taken into account in the light of the fact that they had not 
been taken into account before?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what extent would taking them into account on 
their part undo a lot of things that had been – had been done in 
disregard of your concerns. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my interpretation and I stress 
that this my personal connecting of the dots.  Having sent the mail to 
Mr Gama and Mr Jiyane in January 2014 having noted that those 
concerns were not reflected to the Board or BADC when the transaction 
20 
was approved the subsequent change in technical specifications that 
were required.  This document that Mr  Budhai had asked me to now 
prepare was a way of now comm unicating those risks and changes 
further into the hierarchy of the organisation and wider into the 
organisation but that is my interpretation of this table and given 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 26 of 247 
 
Mr Budhai’s role at the time in preparing documentation that is how I 
read it at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at a practical level - before we proceed – could 
they be taking into account without – could they be effected without – 
without going back to the Board and basically say – you know – here 
are things that have not been brought to your at tention and now we – 
we did not pay attention to certain concerns that we – had been raised.  
We realise that that it is coming back to haunt us now.  Can you 
approve that things be done this way or could they be effected without 
having to go back to the Board or is that something that you would not 
10 
know? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly at the technical level and 
at the operational level there were actions in place and many actions in 
place to deal with the de facto situation.  These locomotives …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Were coming …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We had to deal with them 
(coughing). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I comment specifically as to how 
all of this was communicated further higher into the Board.  I do not 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say operationally your understanding is that 
in effect what had gone wrong could still be rectified if this time 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 27 of 247 
 
everyone concerned would be act in accordance with what you were 
putting up or most of the things maybe not all?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Most of the things.  What – 
certainly what did happen is I mentioned the – the technical meetings 
which took place on the 19 t h to modify the locomotives.  Yes the 
locomotives were modified that they were suitable for the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Operation on the coal line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That certainly happened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So the locomotives were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Modified and brought into service.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  How all these mitigating actions 
and the like were communicated to the Board in the management of the 
process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at a practical level they could be done?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At a practical they could be done  
… 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 28 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And they were done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were done? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So the plans you proposed at Annexure 
21 were to mitigate the impact of delay were actually implemented.  Is 
that what you are suggesting?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  We - we had to do that.  We -
we modified the locomotives where drivers were trained appropriately.  
10 
Those practical things were done. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And did it - did that have any impact on – on 
the problem of delay of delivery of the locomotives or did that remain 
unchanged – the delay? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my understanding that the 
locomotives were delivered within the – a reasonable time.  I would not 
like to comment on the … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay that is fine. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Implications of the delay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No we will take that up perhaps with 
20 
somebody else. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – you then draw conclusions on this 
entire transaction of the acquisition of 100 locomotives at your 
paragraph 73? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 29 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you express an opinion in about six 
paragraphs.  Would you like to summarise that for the Chair?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes certainly and as you point out 
in paragraph 73: 
“It was my – it is my considered opinion the 
decision by group and/or Supply Chain Service to 
arbitrarily 
or 
unilaterally 
chain 
technical 
specifications without technical consultation well 
not 
technically 
proficient 
themselves 
was 
10 
irresponsible in the extreme.  The impact of the 
change …” 
73.2: 
“The impact of the change from MARS to CSR and 
the associated design changes on locomotive 
delivery were never discussed with technical or 
operations and was equally irresponsible.”  
73.3: 
“The delays caused negated the entire raison d’être 
of the project.  I believe in …”  
20 
73.4: 
“…that the confinement to CSR was flawed in 
concept and execution – in my considered opinion.  
The motivation to use CSR was based on production 
capacity in China and a supplier who at the time of 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 30 of 247 
 
award had yet to deliver a working locomotive, did 
not meet the confinement requirements inter alia 
these include when goods or servic e had been 
procured a highly specialised and largely identical 
executed by that supplier and further almost 
identical to previous work done.”  
And I think we have covered that …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We did. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Previously. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  73.5: 
“The increase in estimated total cost from 3.871 
billion to 4.84 billion for the acquisition of 100 
locomotives was unjustified and …”  
73.6: 
“…the upfront payments amounting to 60 percent 
before the first locomotive was delivered were 
excessive.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then that brings you to the conclusion of 
your testimony insofar as the 100 locomotives are concerned?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We move now to a new chapter but not very 
new as we had previously touched on it – the Market Demand Strategy 
starting at page 18.  You will recall that we previously dealt with this 
subject and we – we promised the Chair that we will deal with it in more 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 31 of 247 
 
detail later in the course of your testimony. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just to put things in context that MDS 
discussion informs the next transaction which is the 1  064 … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Acquisition?  If then we  could turn to page 18 
from paragraph 74?  Before you - we deal with the detail – Chair just to 
indicate Mr Callard has provided Annexures – as the Chair will see at 
paragraph 75 – Annexure 26 through to Annexure 35.  That is – what – 
nine annexures. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At times they are fairly detailed and complex 
tables and in the course of preparation we found a way to perhaps 
make them digestible for some of us who failed to go to engineering 
school.  We will therefore n ot deal with the annexures in the order they 
are presented and if you permit Mr  Callard to move from annexure in 
annexure in order to – to draw this complete and concise picture, thank 
you.  We are now dealing with the Market Demand Strategy Mr  Callard 
and you said at 74 that this section outlines the development of the 
Market Demand Strategy.  You may proceed.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  May we first turn 
please to Annexure 25 and I am dealing with paragraph 75 where the 
acquisition of 1 064 locomotives was predicated on the MDS which in 
turn predicated a nearly doubling in general freight volumes from a 
budgeted 91.2 million tons in 2013/2014 to 180.25 million tons in 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 32 of 247 
 
2019/2020.  If I – we could go to Annexure 25 please and if we could 
start off on page 315? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are there. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This 315 and 316 are headed 
“Supporting 
Documentation”. 
They 
ae 
also 
titled 
“Seven 
Year 
Commodity Growth”.  These tables detail fairly extensively by 
commodity and by business u nit the expected growth in those 
commodities – rail transportable growth of those commodities over the 
seven year period.  If I may take you please first just to the bottom of 
page 316 … 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The last line says: 
“Total MDS …” 
And the print is small but in 2013/2014 that is:  
“91.712 and it goes through to 180.252.”  
Effectively and of some 89 million tons this near doubling in growth.  
This is a substantial growth over a short period of time for such an 
organisation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So what we have at pages 315 and 316 are 
the anticipated volume or is the anticipated volume growth over a seven 
20 
year period. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  My question is was that a factor in amending 
the original fleet plan to acquire 776 locomotives to now acquire 1  064? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 33 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may continue. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  I refer then to 
paragraph 76.  Through April  2013 to September 2013 I highlighted 
various – I highlighted shortcomings in the compilation of the Market 
Demand Strategy and this ultimately resulted in the workshop being 
convened by Mr Pillay on 19 August 2013 to validate the MDS demand 
and produce a validated traffic dema nd file.  In summary what I set out 
here was that integrating these increases in detail I felt certain 
inconsistencies that I could not reconcile and wish to say – and said if 
this traffic file is inconsistent it affects the volumes you want to convey, 
10 
it affects the assets we require, it affects our operations and what we 
have to have in place for operations.  We need to have a coherent 
triangle if I could put it this way of the traffic we wish to convey.  These 
are the assets we have and these are the ope rational requirements – 
the operational procedures we need to execute that traffic file.  If 
anyone – if anyone of them is out of synchronism then we have a 
problem.  We either have too much volume or we do not have enough 
assets or we have too much – too many assets.  If we predicate too 
high a market demand. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You indicate at paragraph 77 then in summary 
20 
that you highlighted the inconsistencies – firstly where market tonnages 
exceeded the capacity of the mine and secondly where inconsist encies 
where the ratio of coal and steel did not align.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  May I take you through 
the three inconsistencies in brief?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 34 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Could I first turn in 
that respect to page 322 please?  322 and that is Annexure 27.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This was an email to one of my 
marketing colleagues and effectively it said:  
“Please look at the attached presentations.  They 
indicate that  
 has an installed capacity of 8 million tons per 
annum.  I took those presentations out of the 
10 
annual reports and what was available on the web 
and this installed capacity excluded the shutdowns 
which would be potentially be taking place in 
Arcelor Mittal but the seven year MDS indicates 
that we will ramp up to over 10 million tons of iron 
ore to Arcelor Mittal.  I think the MDS is overstated 
but would you check please.”  
That was the tonnage going into Arcelor Mittal.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you leave 322 just so we understand. 
You have listed the various plants of Arcelor Mittal?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you have indicated historically what the 
capacity per plant has been?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Should we add up those totals to understand 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 35 of 247 
 
therefore what the annual capacity of Arcelor Mittal  is? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thanks.  So you say that the seven – the MDS 
notwithstanding these historical facts indicates a ramp up to over 10 
million tons of iron ore?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you question that conclusion?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We cannot say we are going to 
give you 10 millions of iron ore when you can only process 8 million 
tons. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May (intervenes)? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are now dealing with the in – the three 
inconsistencies you highlight. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you want to demonstrate where and how 
20 
those inconsistencies arise.  Which annexure are you looking for?  
Perhaps I may help. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry – it is one on the ratio of 
coal to steel. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Will – let us try page 327 and see …  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 36 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  327? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Page 327, this is 
again an email to my marketing colleagues but it reads:  
“Hi, the ratio of coal to steel in the third and the 
last four years is out of range.  The premise for this 
statement is that in the making of steel there is a 
specific ratio historically which the pla nts use of 
coal and iron ore to produce steel.  They – that 
range is consistent over all the years.  What I …”  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Callard before you unpack that …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Table. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What are the consequences of the ratio of 
coal to steel being out of range?  What would be the consequences?  
CHAIRPERSON:   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well if the ratio is out of range you 
either have too much coal and n ot enough iron ore or you have too 
much iron ore and not enough coal.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So the – the small print – if I may 
take you to on 327 the small print at the bottom of that says “ratio of 
coal to iron ore” and in the – it ranges you will see from 13, 14, 53% to 
58%, to 45, to 50 to 55 to 54, give or take that those are bounded but 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 37 of 247 
 
in the last year’s those ratios changed from 61 to 61% to 64% to 57 or 
67 and the last year is 71%.  This would indicate that one of t hose 
commodities is out of range, and cannot be a true reflection of what we 
would be transporting and I just wish to highlight this and say please 
we need to correct that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if we read that by 2013, by 13/14 you 
meant the year 2013/2014 which would be the first entry the first 
column. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That ratio stands at 53%. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then it increases and thereafter it drops 
to 45 to 50, to 55, to 54 in the succeeding years. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes so the ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Sorry, the range we’re looking at 
is in the order of 50 odd percent.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay so from 2019 the ratio then increases 
from 61 and next year 64, 67 and 71.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes, effectively that says you’re 
20 
bringing in too much coal 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what would be the average correct ratio if 
I may call it that, what is the proper ratio of coal to iron ore?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I believe it should be of the order 
that we have in those one, two, three, four, five, six years of that order 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 38 of 247 
 
of the range of 50/55% of that order which they have there.  I am not 
going to be pedantic as to the exact figure but I had no problem with 
the earlier ranges, it was at the last four years went way out of the 
bounds of the preceding years. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now before we leave this table do you know 
the source of this information, was it ob tained from Arcelor Mittal itself 
or how – where do we get this information from?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This source I – the source of this 
information was the traffic file, the traffic file which makes up the MDS 
file and this was an interrogation o f that particular elements of the MDS 
10 
file and asking do they produce a credible traffic file that we could use.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then let me take a step back and find out 
what is the source of information for the traffic file.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:  The source of information for the 
traffic file is normally the executive business managers, each one in 
charge of a particular business unit, like we have agriculture and bulk 
liquid, coal, export iron or manganese, steel and cement, mineral 
mining and chrome and intermodal each of those executive managers 
would be responsible for producing the budgets and the traffic file in 
their business units for their commodities over the seven year period.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then lastly the business executives would 
they reflect, would they calculate their own projections or would they in 
this instance be in engagement with the client, Arcelor Mittal in this 
instance, and have obtained those figures, those projections from 
Arcelor Mittal or would that be their  own calculations internally, do you 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 39 of 247 
 
know? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I can’t say how they obtained the 
figures, the fact that I pick up the anomalies in the figures gave cause 
for concern and this, the workshop which I spoke to was an attempt to 
get back to engage with the business unit managers to revisit these 
figures to see if they needed correction, if and where and how they 
needed correction. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, and that then deals with your concern 
regarding the ratio of coal to ore.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You said there were three inconsistencies, 
what is the second? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And the third inconsistency is on – 
if we may turn to page 329 please which is Annexure 30.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And this was an example for 
Exxaro Leeupan Mine.  If we were to look at the first line under the 
light blue heading it says Delmas Siding Exxaro Coal Area destination 
New Castle and one would read that as being Arcelor Mittal.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  We have in the one year 1.4million 
tons, the next year 1.7million tons, then a blank, then a blank and then 
it jumps to 5million tons for four consecutive years.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QU ENTIN CALLARD:  My comment on that to my 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 40 of 247 
 
colleagues was the jump in five million tons in one year to Newcastle is 
optimistic, the ROM that is Rate of Mine ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that a comment or a question?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well it was a comment or a 
question to him saying what is going on because the ROM, the run of 
mine is – I said the mine can only produce 4.9million tons per annum 
and not the seven million tons projected as you will see which is at the 
bottom line of that table, because all this is coming from one mine, and 
I did some internet research, looked at the annual report, there were no 
plans to increase them mine capacity which is a fairly major exercise if 
10 
I may add, and if there were no published plans to increase m ine 
capacity how could we then project conveying more than the mine could 
actually produce and this was the essence of my comment to my 
colleagues and these were three of the examples that I sent to my 
colleagues saying we need to relook at the MDS and ens ure that every 
line item in fact is credible for the track that we are going to convey.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is so because that information in part 
dictates the number of locomotives necessary to acquire?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The number of locomotives and the 
number of wagons. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the number of wagons. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And the number of wagons, but yes 
locomotives as well. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Now on the two examples we have gone 
through would we be correct in concluding that both in respect of 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 41 of 247 
 
Exxaro and Arcelor Mittal the documents project a sharp increase in 
production from the two clients, would that be a fair summation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They project a sharp increase in 
the delivery of raw materia l to the mines, whether they have their 
capacity to produce that was, but project a sharp increase in delivery.  
May I comment and take it forward to the production?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes absolutely, which would mean a sharp 
increase in demand of our services as TFR. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would be a logical step to take 
that forward yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then have included in your – no I will 
restate, if you change to page 19 continuing on this topic, you state at 
78 that a process was developed to derive a validated and executable 
MDS file? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Could you clarify what you mean in that 
paragraph? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Certainly.  Because of these 
concerns we need to, I felt we needed to put in place a process to 
validate this traffic file, and if I could then take you please to page or 
20 
to Annexure 30, correction, Annexure 31.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 333. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This was to various colleagues in 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 42 of 247 
 
setting up a meeting to set up this process to develop a validated 
traffic file, it is further taken forward in Annexure 31, page 335 where I 
write to ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think that’s Annexure 3 2, please check 
yours. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry Annexure 32, apologies, 
Annexure 32. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please continue. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 335, this is a mail to many 
colleagues at the time and in essence:  
10 
“Dear Colleagues, 
Thanks for the meeting, some very brief notes.”  
All of those items and detail are process to develop a validated traffic 
file which would have coherency in specifically the wagons and 
locomotives we need from the customer point of view, from the traffic 
we convey, out network capability is the – does the supplier have 
sufficient capability to deliver as we have mentioned in the example of 
Exxara.  Does the supplier have the ability to load the product, 
irrespective that he can produce the product can it be loade d into the 
rail wagons in the requisite time.  Can the receiver consume that 
20 
product, can Arcelor Mittal consume that product for example.  Can 
logistics integration or the department function which was dealing with 
the actual operations, do they have the capacity to deliver on these 
tons. Could we bring that together, and this meeting detailed how we 
achieve and what we needed to do to achieve that process.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 43 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this you do because in your view the 
traffic files on which the MDS is predicated had not been validated, you 
wanted a process to validate those figures before conclusions drawn at 
the MDS could be drawn?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes I was concerned at the – if I 
use the phrase “the hockey stick effect of the rapid increase” a nd 
sought to have greater clarity on how the process was validated and 
was it in fact a file that we could really trust.  This is carried through 
into Annexure 33 where we – with comment from my colleagues where 
we now have the detail, their comments to it , we all agree on the 
10 
process.  Annexure ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now the validation that you called for was it 
carried out? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I would like to revert back to my 
statement, paragraph 79, that while the MDS was fine t uned and 
obvious errors were corrected there was no substantive change in the 
MDS.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Considering the position adopted by the MDS 
for your recollection was this consistent or that hockey stick effect that 
you spoke of, was this consisten t with the economic outlook generally?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No it was not consistent with the 
economic outlook, and for that if I could refer to Annexure I think it is 
number ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  26, correct. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CA LLARD:  26 was a report, if I could call it 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 44 of 247 
 
that, developed by a commercial colleague, it came to me under the 
heading “economic assumptions to support the seven year MDS” this is 
at the middle of page 318, it came from my commercial market research 
and insights, one of my colleagues there.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just for the record what’s the date of 
that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The date of that report is the 9 t h of 
April 2013, the date of the email is 9 April 2013.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And was this during the time the MDS was 
being developed? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The MDS had been developed 
before and the MDS was a rolling plan so it was updated each  year.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But this was specifically at the 
time when we were putting the MDS into the 1064 locomotive business 
case, so it was highly relevant that this in fact supported the – we were 
looking for the information to support the MDS in the locomotive 
business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But if we turn to page 320 while we 
20 
have this doubling of market demand predicated in the MDS page 320 
the economic assumptions to support the seven year MDS do not 
correlate with this significant doubling of demand and a reading of  page 
320 in the downgrading of global forecast SAGDB growth has come 
down, global trade is forecast to shrink, commodity prices are under 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 45 of 247 
 
pressure, S A Mining Production index which is a key component of the 
materials we transport fell by and has fallen, exchange rate forecast, 
the weaker rand will support exports and to some extent commodity 
exports but will raise the price of imports, this did not correlate with the 
optimism if I may put it that way of the doubling of volumes in the MDS.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:  Now in your supplementary statement you 
introduce a further document marked 26A, Chair I am handing over your 
supplementary statement, 
we 
were updating 
it 
with 
the 
other 
supplementary statement, I will speak to you later.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Chair you now have your BB4C it’s in two 
parts, it’s the first supplementary statement and the second which we 
are introducing this morning, and the second relates to the corrections 
that have been effected to the statement of Mr Callar d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Annexure 26A I refer to as in Section 2 of 
BB4A, the supplementary statement and according to your statement, 
supplementary statement to be precise ...(intervention)  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is page 15 I believe. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At paragraph 9 you – of the supplementary 
20 
statement you state: 
“I introduce a document from Anoj Singh dated April 2013 to 
the National Treasury reflecting projected flat economic growth 
as Annexure 26A.” 
Now if we go to 26A of the supplementary and that will be at page 14 of 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 46 of 247 
 
the supplementary. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes page 14. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would you like then to talk us through this 
document? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly, page 15 of the 
supplementary is an email from Mr Anoj Singh to National Treasury and 
it says: 
“Good afternoon, 
Kindly receive attached correspondence from Anoj Singh’s 
office. 
10 
Kind regards” 
The date is 12 April 2013.  This is around the same time as I received 
that early email from Commercial Marketing Research, the key points 
though if we turn over to page – the following page which 
supplementary 16 and Mr Singh writes effectively that:  
“Transnet has not yet announced its revised 13/14 corporate 
plan but I will provide you with the salient features of the 
13/14 corporate plan to enable you to articulate these on 
National Treasury’s Roadshow in the weeks ahead.  Salient 
features of the 2013 corporate plan.”  
20 
I quote specifically from the third bullet:  
“The CP reading the corporate plan takes into account the 
prevailing economic slow-down and related reduction in overall 
commodity demand.” 
The next bullet: 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 47 of 247 
 
“Slower economic growth both locally and internationally 
impacting negatively on rail and port commodities.  Overall 
volumes over the seven years remains stable but at a slower 
growth trajectory initially.”  
Sorry the last point: 
“The 
MDS 
is 
still 
achievable 
by 
adopting 
revenue 
diversification strategies, cross-production initiatives as well 
capital investment portfolio optimisation programs.” 
But the overall tenure of this letter is that it supports and is consistent 
with the economic forecast that was provided by Commercial Marketing 
10 
Research and indicates that it does not support in my mind the 
optimism of the (indistinct) MDS plan . 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then our take out from these documents is 
the MDS projected a sharp increase in demand.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Over the seven year period. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The economic projections as provided, over 
that seven year period as provided by Market Research within Transnet 
and by the Chief Financial Officer advising Treasury both anticipated 
20 
the converse, instead of an increase in demand there will be at best, 
the demand will stay stable, at worst it will decrease.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It could have allowed for a 
marginal moderate growth on the trajectory which we were currently at, 
but certainly it did not support the hockey stick growth that the MDS 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 48 of 247 
 
predicated. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But nonetheless the MDS carried through and 
based on the MDS the calculation was that a further 1064 locomotives 
are required by freight over the period of seven years?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I put that in my belief in par agraph 
80 that the pressure to achieve the MDS targets and the significant 
consequences of changing the MDS made any attempt to question the 
MDS unlikely to succeed.  And yes the 1064 was predicated on the 
MDS. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then get to the section where you now 
10 
deal specifically with the 1064 locomotives.  You start at page 19 
paragraph 81, you indicate to the Chair that you will deal with this 
under four specific headings. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you could take us  through that part of your 
testimony. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you Counsel.  Certainly 
Chair and I would quote from paragraph 81 that in this section I will 
outline the development of the 1064 business case and the role of 
McKinsey further go to show, 81.2, that hedging and escalation were 
20 
included in the business case, para 81.3 that the accelerated 
locomotive delivery was in my opinion ill-considered, and four that the 
advance payments had a negative impact on Transnet finances.   
 
Para 82 the process to evaluate the 1064 locomotive bids is a 
section in its own right. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 49 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, let’s deal with the first of your topics, 
which is the development of the 1064 business case.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay, if I may you through that 
then from paragraph 83, that the first 1064 business case, locomotive 
business case was developed from the work on the market demand 
strategy and the locomotive fleet plan which I previously outlined in 
paragraph 21 and 22.  Again predicated on the market demand strategy 
and the near doubling of general freight volumes over a seven year 
period and the replacement of aged locomotives that were beyond their 
economic life. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The business case developed in 
Annexure 36, was presented to Transnet Freight Rail Investment 
Committee on the 9 t h of March 2012, with an ETC of 38146million or 
38.1billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And ETC meaning estimated total cost.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Estimated total cost. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I don’t know if one wishes to turn 
to Annexure 36 it merely just confirms that point.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I’m sure we accept that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We can pass on that, thank you.  
On the 9 t h of March 2012 Mr ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  19 t h I think. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Sorry 19 t h of March thank you, Mr 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 50 of 247 
 
Gama requested an update version to the Capital Investment 
Committee. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Further detail is given in Annexure 
37.  At that capital investment meeting of the 21 s t of May 2012 it was 
decided inter alia that an external party should review the 1064 
business case and provide a risk assessment.  A timetable was outlined 
at that same meeting which envisaged the contracts being signed in 
January 2013, that is set out in Annexure 38.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not much happened, it was 
followed by a hiatus in the locomotive procurement as freight rail 
developed an overall wagon fleet and infrastructure plan to complement 
the locomotive fleet plan and this is set out in Annexure 39.  The 
important point beyond this was now the interaction with McKinsey.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which started I believe on the 1 s t 
of March 2013, I do not believe that I saw a formal clarification of their 
role but understood they were engaged to lead the further development 
of the 1064 business case. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you proceed, at this point wha t was 
the status of the 1064 business case, was it complete, was it approved 
and in response that you if you may then indicate what role McKinsey 
was intending to play specifically in respect to that business case to 
your understanding. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 51 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In terms of my personal 
involvement that is – I have given my personal involvement what 
happened in between it is my understanding that the business case in 
fact was approved, it was – ja PFMA approval was sought for the 
business case and tenders  were invited and in fact bids were opened 
during 2012, I was not part of that process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was part of the process and 
involved with Department of Public Enterprises in Wagon Business case 
and the overall approval of the wagon infrastructure and locomotive 
10 
fleet plans per se but I have not detailed that in here.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So on the 1 s t of March 2013 the RFP was 
issued and bids had already been called for?  Is that what you are 
stating or you don’t have a recollection was to that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I just go back to, may I just 
refer to an item. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You might not have, I am trying to understand 
what the role of McKinsey was intended to be at this juncture, are you 
able to shed light on that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Okay, alright, the role of McKinsey 
20 
because the business case, the absolute business case had not been 
approved by the board, the role of McKinsey now was to take the work 
which we have done and transform that into a business case that could 
be approved by the Board. 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO: 
 
Okay, 
please 
proceed 
with 
your 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 52 of 247 
 
understanding. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you, so on the 1 s t of March 
– I believe the interaction with McKinsey on the 1064 busine ss case 
started 1 March 2013.  I state here I do not believe I saw a formal 
clarification of their role but understood they were engaged to lead the 
further development of the 1064 business case, and a freight rail 
locomotive team was formed under an execu tive to lead that team.  The 
key point is – core point of this or the key point is in paragraph 89, that 
the core team of Messrs Pregasa Pillay, Johan Bouwer and myself had 
a sometimes strained relationship with McKinsey.  Annexures, and I 
10 
refer to Annexures 40 and 41 in this regard ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and those annexures point to advise 
given to McKinsey as regards railways and how railways operate.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CA LLARD:  Annexure 40 which is page 359 
from my colleague in finance to Mr Mohammed Mahomedy, Vuyo Kahla 
and others the whole of that page details concerns on their interaction 
with McKinsey and the strained relationship we were having.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what is the main take out of that 
20 
document?  What was the main concern regarding interactions with 
McKinsey?   I note if I may at page 359.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  If I may refer you to 
paragraph 5 of 359, paragraph 5 of the email.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 53 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The McKinsey team is and I quote:  
“McKinsey 
team 
is 
focussing 
on 
two 
specific 
questions relating to the MDS volumes as well as the 
TFR road to rail strategy.  These two questions are 
not the drivers of the need for locomotives and were 
agreed to with the board and DPE in the Transnet 
corporate plans interactions and should not be the 
backbone 
of 
explaining 
the 
need 
for 
more 
locomotives.  I refer you to the next paragraph.  The 
McKinsey team are refusing to take direction on the 
10 
case and seem to be a collating of data team.  The 
TFR team will gladly be the conduit that cannot take 
responsibility for a case if it is an import – if its 
inputs are ignored and no case is presented for 
review.  Your interventio n is required.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you proceed.  You just read us 
paragraph 5 and 6. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please have regard to paragraph 4 that would 
appear to have some level of relevance.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly it highlights that and 
thank you for pointing it out.  I quote from there paragraph 4.  
“I am concerned that the McKinsey team is not focussing on their 
mandate to validate assumptions in the original business case and 
enhance the case specifically focussing on the queries raised by 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 54 of 247 
 
TEFRIC, CAPEC and DPE. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that we can accept that to mean that their 
main – their mandate was to validate the assumptions?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that they were failing to do at that point?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And instead they were concentrating on other 
issues? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may proceed. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I followed this up with an email 
which is in Annexure 40 or a draft email in Annexure 41.  Annexure 41 
page 361.  I subsequently discovered that though drafted I had not sent 
this email but the sentiments remain the same.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If that is the case so Annexur e 41 was never 
sent to the intended recipients?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No I – it was in my – left in my 
outbox. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the view expressed there are unknown to 
the intended recipients?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The views expressed are unknown 
to the intended recipients but they remain where I follow on my 
colleague’s email and say: 
“I am also very concerned”  
I quote.  The second paragraph. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 55 of 247 
 
“McKinsey chose to restructure and rewrite the 
business case and as Johan has indicated to date  it 
has been a restatement of what already exists.”  
My interaction and I read the second paragraph.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   
“My interaction to date has largely been informing 
them about locomotives, railway operations and 
railway operating parameters including the difference 
between GTK and NTK and what is a class 1 
10 
railroad.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what is the difference between a GTK and 
NTK for our own identification?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  One is gross tonne kilometres and 
nett tonne kilometres for interpretation nett tonne kilometres are the 
income producing kilometres or a railroad for the traffic who actually 
convey. Gross tonne kilometres is the actual tonnes that move over the 
railway track including the weight of the locomotives and wagons. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the view was that they were conflating 
the two concepts? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not conflating did not know. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is what I am interpreting 
here.  If I may just read – the email is clear in so much. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes it is clear.  So – but then the point you 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 56 of 247 
 
make at Annexures 40 – Annexure 41 is that although you never did get 
to send it erroneously you still hold the view that you expre ssed in that 
annexure? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Absolutely. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  We move on then to your 
paragraph 19 where you attach emails to reflect a change in the 
original business case concept as introduced by McKinsey.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you deal with that at you paragraph 90 if 
you could take us from there. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I deal with that in paragraph 90 
and that is page 42 or Annexure 42.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which – and the starts off at page  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  364? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  364. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It starts at 363 overleaf it is the actual – the 
actual emails. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  The original business case 
predicated delivery from completing by 2019 McKinsey changed this 
20 
back to or changed this on their own accord to 2020 and this email of 
364 really says to them you are not authorised to change this business 
case unilaterally on your own score please bring i t back to the original 
timelines of the business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the business case ran until 2019.05.20  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 57 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is a seven year. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Period and McKinsey had changed that to run 
to 2020. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you get an understanding of what was the 
cause of that changing if I can by McKinsey?  What informed them to 
change their end date to 2020 as opposed  2019? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I cannot recall that we were – I 
10 
cannot recall what informed them to change it.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the point you make here is that you and I 
– by you I mean plural took issue with that change and requested a 
reversion to 2019? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  When you say you took issue 
may I read that as you plural took …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely I am saying you plural yes at the 
team. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  You plural took issue with that and 
Mr Gama also took issue with that – with that change if I reflect 
20 
correctly. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes and so – was that reversion effected?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes.  May I refer you on that 
score to page 365 please. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 58 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And the middle of page 369 – 365 
and I quote from the email.  This was a mail from Pragasen Pillay to 
McKinsey I quote: 
“Nasiem please note we have had a discussion with Mr 
Gama the CE of TFR and the following was the outcome.  
1. TFR cannot accept the budgeted amount for the 1064 
be escalated due to delivery time shifting two years 
beyond their SVM MDS timeline.  Note the effect on 
time value of money by noting the effective time 
value of money by the extended proposed delivery.  
10 
2. The 1064 is purchased to support and delivery on the 
agreed MDS volumes.  The question is, what is the 
value of receiving 152 locos beyond 2018/2019 to 
the MDS. 
3. This assessment by McKinsey was to insist in 
speeding up the process of approval so that the 
delivery supports the volume ramp up.  In this case 
it seems not to do this.”  
So yes collective you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And you express a view that in getting 
20 
McKinsey to understand and to revert to the 2019 was a rather fraught 
process and the engagement was less t han cordial at time but you won 
the day? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was.  Given this following 
virtually immediately on this and on our – my paragraph 91 that on 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 59 of 247 
 
Friday the 12 April we were asked to turn this business case around for 
the locomotive steering committee meeting and the Transnet board 
meeting by Sunday evening.  We were working late and under pressure 
at McKinsey’s office and they were just not understanding what we had 
to achieve.  I vented and via my frustration which my colleagues 
captured in Annexure 43.  One may read Annexure 43.   
“Humorous as this might be in hindsight it was 
deadly serious at the time.”  
And if I may just quote one sentence from page 369?  
“Sorry Francis cannot repeat your anger on mail.”  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That bad? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was that bad. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You then turn to Annexure 44 which is 
– it that – can I call it an – the updated case – business case following 
McKinsey’s contribution?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  And as I quote: 
“That illustrating this frustration was that on the 16 
April we received a version of the business case for 
updating.” 
And this was Annexure 44 and may I take you please to Annexure 44 
20 
because the first and the fifth pages are relevant.  Annexure 44.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It will start at page 370.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  370 is then – could I ask you 
please to turn to page 371. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 60 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which was the front page and here 
it says the date of submission this is the one of the 16 April.  If we 
could turn through to page 372 please.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We at 372. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  372 and this is the purpose of the 
business case.  May I take you through to the first bullet please?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is now the prime purpose of 
the business case to purchase 1064 locomotives. It states here:  
“This business case provides the rationale to invest 
10 
in profitable etcetera.  The new locomotive purchase 
will create 28 000 new and indirect jobs and 50 
billion in economic impact through local supply 
development.”   
What follows there underlined is my comment to this saying that these 
are totally – these are secondary objectives.  The primary objective is 
to enable TFR to deliver 170 million tonnes on MDS by 2018/19.  
McKinsey in essence what I am saying here McKinsey seem to have 
lost the plot in what we were trying to achieve.  We wanted to provide a 
business case for locomotives that was the prime rationale of the 
20 
business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now if we can just understand that.  Did 
you – by you I mean Transnet team working on the business case have 
any data to support that the business case would create 28  000 new 
direct and indirect jobs?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 61 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not reflected in my testimony 
but Mr Garry Pita and I had extensive discussions on this one.  I 
disagreed with his interpretation of 28  000 jobs.  The basis which I 
used for that disagreement was that there was a body of knowledge at 
the moment which said that to create one full time job required 100  000 
US dollars investment in a capital industry.  I could not correlate that 
body of knowledge with the investment we sought in the locomotives to 
these jobs.  The equations did not hold for me .  So we had extensive 
debate on that but he won. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And secondly it states that this acquisition will 
10 
introduce 
50 
billion 
in 
economic 
impact 
through 
local 
supply 
development.  My question is the total – the estimated total cost of this 
transaction was 38 billion. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I do not know if it is my difficulty how do I 
reconcile that to – with 50 billion economic impact through local supply 
development? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot explain that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With your assistance? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot explain.  I do not know 
20 
how they arrived at that figure.  It was not part of the locomotive 
business case.  I cannot explain how they arrived at a figure that an 
investment of 38 billion into locomotives would have that multiplier 
effect of 50 billion in the local economy.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where – at the very least 40% of them will be 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 62 of 247 
 
assembled in China? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or 40% would be foreign conten t 
yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Yes okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Approximately – between the 
electrics and the diesel. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Now if we may then continue – if you 
may continue with your testimony.  We are now at page 93 – ag 
paragraph 93 my apologies. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Paragraph 93. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  My colleagues and I 
extensively revised the document and we returned it on the evening of 
the 16 April 2014 copying Mr Gama and Mr Singh  in our reply.  
Annexure 45 just indicates that trace of emails.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Following on that on the afternoon 
of April – the 17 April 2013 my colleagues Mr Pragasen Pillay, Johan 
Bouwer and I sat with Mr Singh and McKinsey to review our previous 
inputs on a page by page basis. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This was – we were turning page 
by page going through the modifications.  We had made modifications 
to McKinsey had made what were they  – what would we accept of their, 
what was accepted by ours.  All our inputs were accepted.  All were 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 63 of 247 
 
accepted and we could agree on those we left out.  We could not agree 
with the Mr Singh on the inclusion of the TE and for TE please read 
Transnet Engineering section setting out the role of TE - we had a 
different view.  My colleagues and I had a different view to that of Mr 
Singh and we left that for Mr Singh and Mr Gama to resolve.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you proceed let us just discuss there – 
the Transnet Engineering issue.  The original business case did it 
contemplate a role to be played by TE in this transaction?  Was there 
provision for TE in the business case?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Without reference to the original 
10 
business case? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My recollection and without 
validating this through the research of the business cases but the role 
– the position adopted certainly by – that we adopted was that we 
should be neutral on the role of TE that we should not be prescriptive 
on the role of Transnet Engineering.  If a supplier or an original 
equipment manufacturer wishes to use Transnet Engineering that 
should be of their own volition.  The reason we adopted that was that 
position was that if we were to specify to a supplier that they had to 
20 
use Transnet Engineering as a sub -contractor and in the event that 
something went wrong a locomotive was delayed or there were delays 
for example caused by that sub-contractor we would have the – we 
would be suing or seeking redress from the original equipment 
manufacturer who in turn would be seeking redress from Transnet from 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 64 of 247 
 
an operating division of Transnet and creating a vicious cycle.  How do 
we sue a contractor where they in turn giving a counter claim to one  of 
our operating divisions for delaying them?  That was why we were of 
the view that we should be silent and neutral on the role of TE. As I 
said there were different views at the time.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now you say you could not reach agreement 
with Mr Singh on this what was his view at the time?  What view did he 
express as regards TE, the role of TE?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not recorded and please these 
were discussions. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my recollection that he 
favoured a role or positing a role for TE however it was defined.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did he advance any reasons for that to your 
recollection? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot recollect. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now when you say the decision  was that this 
issue be left for “Singh and Gama to resolve” is that to the CFO and the 
CEO to resolve? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And to amend the business case based on 
whatever decision they arrive at?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN C ALLARD:  Correct, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  At –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 65 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  You conclude then from 
paragraphs 95 to 97 that the business case was now as you state full in 
the hands of Group and at 97 that it w as discussed at the Locomotive 
Steering Committee meeting of the 18 April.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was that your final – your last engagement 
with the business case as it is?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was our last engagement with 
the business case on the 18 April yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And as at the 18 April that business case 
10 
anticipated an ETC of 38.9 if my memory serves me well but 38 billion?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  38- Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It was still at 38 billion? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was still at 38.6 if I…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  38.6 thank you.  38.6 billion.  You then after 
then introduce a topic hedging and escalation and you had stated at 
your paragraph 81.2 that you will show that hed ging and escalation 
were included in the business case?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We deal with that from page 90 – ag from 
20 
paragraph 98. If you could take us through that part of your testimony?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  And I would repeat my 
paragraph 98 that one of the contentious issues that has arisen it has 
been in the [indistinct] for some time as to whether the 1064 business 
case and by extension the financial model included hedging and 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 66 of 247 
 
escalation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And certainly I will show that 
hedging and escalation were included in the development of the 
business case and the financial model but this was misrepresented in 
the final business case.  This has been covered in the MNS Report and 
the Fundudzi Report but I will just give some additional supplementary 
detail to that finding. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Per paragraph 100 I was shocked 
10 
rigid when interviewed by Werksmens Attorneys as part  of their 
investigation into the procurement of the 1064 locomotives.  Their first 
matter was to show me a 25 April 2013 version of the business case 
stating that the 38 – 38.6 billion excluded the potential effects from 
hedging, forex, escalation and othe r price escalations, interrogate me if 
I knew anything about it.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please hold there.  Chair it is part of the 
supplementary statement effecting the corrections.  That date of 23 
April reads 2014 and I think it should read 13.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It should read 13 yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Please continue.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I replied that I was the of the 
firm conviction that the business case included forex hedging, forex 
escalation and other pricing escalation subsequently interrogated by 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 67 of 247 
 
records.  What follows is from an interrogation of my records.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In April 2013 McKinsey finalised 
their own financial models.  One of the core inputs was from a series of 
emails from around 10 April to 12 April 2013.  My apologies.  Recipients 
initially were McKinsey and the core team but later Mr Gama and Singh 
and this is email annexure 42. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Pertinent points if we may just turn 
up that email please which is – it starts at page 364. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The key points from that email are 
that price and forex estimates were sourced from expert interviews.  
Base locomotive prices were set at 2013/14 where US dollars 2.6 
million for diesel and US dollars 3.5 million for electric locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I apologise.  You have taken us to page 364. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry, sorry.  Yes and I am reading 
from the – my statement. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay you went back to your statement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I went back to my statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright.  You are reading from 1021 to 1025.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 68 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I still read from my 
statement? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 102.3 the contract signing fee 
was assumed to be 250 million for diesels and 300 million for electric 
locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I at this point just correct 
something which I believe I mis-stated on Friday afternoon where I said 
the contract signing fee might be 3 million for electric locomotives if I 
10 
said 3 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which I believe I did I should 
actually have stated that as being 300 million per the figure which we 
have here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just so that we know then where you are 
correcting is that when you were at para – page 61 – paragraph 61? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Paragraph 61. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The last sentence reading the upfront 
payment per the 1064 business case for  electric locomotives was a 
20 
setup fee of 300 million. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes I believe I – in my  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Testimony, oral testimony. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Testimony. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 69 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I said 3 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It should have read 300 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   We shall correct the transcript accordingly.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  We are now at 102.4 . 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  The hedging costs were 
assumed to be 8% of the locomotive cash flow and on 102.5 McKinsey 
and the individual from McKinsey or McKInsey instructs there their 
personnel to put these assumptions into the financial model.  I was 
10 
partying to vetting the financial and this was done and the ETC 
included hedging and escalation.  All of these statements can be traced 
formally or in that Annexure 42. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please take us to 42 so that we can identify 
their respective areas where they are. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And starting with your 102.1  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Sorry ja.  May I turn you please to 
page 366. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And approximately a third of the 
way down the page the email reads?  JD Francis I am reading there 
from the second paragraph quote: 
“Our USD costs of 2.6 million per diesel and 3.5 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 70 of 247 
 
million electric were derived from working with a Mr 
David Potter he was the expert view.  We have 
escalated these prices on projected US inflation and 
converted back to ZAR based on the forward rate 
from the Transnet Treasury.  Let us know if you have 
any feedback there?”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was the point I was making 
that  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 102. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hedging and – on the base price.  
On the table below that right at the bottom we have a table and at the 
bottom of that table it says:  FX Futures and US inflation indicating that 
those are incorporated in the table.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That table is headed Here is the 
price forex estimates used 13 t h 14 t h prices sourced from expert 
interviews. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that – it is from that table we see the 
USD locomotive price for diesel at 2.6 and for electric at 3.5?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  .5 correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is what you state at your 102.2.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may turn over then to page 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 71 of 247 
 
367. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Just below that second table of 
locomotive capital costs and I read quote:  
“Locomotive capital cash flow sche dule assumes a 
contract signing fee of ZAR 250 million and ZAR 300 
million for diesels and electrics respectively.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may go to the – just below the 
next table please? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hedging costs.  We have the table.  
The statement. 
“Hedging costs are assumed to be 8% of loco cash 
flows.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now you saying all this information 
was – it is part of the email chain that both Mr Gama and Mr Anoj Singh 
became party to? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that we find at page 364. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 364, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So is it your - is it your case then that it 
cannot be contended by anyone that the business case did not include 
forex and hedging …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 72 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Based on this annexure?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may proceed.  We are now at your 
paragraph 103. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  On 18 April McKinsey 
distributed a PowerPoint presentation which was dated 2012/04/18 
“Procurement 1 064 Locomotives for General Freight Business Final 
PowerPoint.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Now turn over to 103 – in my 
10 
paragraph 103.1 I extract slide 12 of that presentation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And slide 12 of that presentation 
clearly indicates that: 
“Escalation and hedging were included in the 
estimated total cost.” 
I would take you to the point – to the item in that slide the first, 
second, third, fourth one down forex.  
“Current forward exchange that they are USD 
exchange rate at an average R11,00/$ over the 
20 
acquisition period.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is a McKinsey slide? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is a McKinsey slide. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Now you go to the last block there 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 73 of 247 
 
which is called tariffs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry – correction.  The one – 
price –the one above it please - price which reads: 
“US$2.6 million, 25.2 million for diesel and US$3.5 
million/R339 
million 
for 
electric 
assuming 
50 
percent localisation and 2 percent localisation.  
RSA component escalated within inflati on.  US$ 
component 
escalated 
with 
US 
inflation 
and 
converted back to ZAR based on forward exchange 
10 
rate.” 
This is in total agreement with what has been set out in the emails.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  However slide 27 of the fin al 
presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  By the final presentation it is the same 
presentation as the slide you just referred to at 101?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Same presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 103.1? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The same slide. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or sorry same presentation but the 
final slide. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  However had been changed from a 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 74 of 247 
 
previous version what the addition of and I quote:  
“Excluding the potential effects from forex hedging, 
forex escalation and other price escalations.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you are reading in the second box of that 
slide. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  BADC recommends the following to 
the Board of Directors for approval.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “The acquisition of 1 064 
locomotives for the general freight business.  Two, 
10 
ETC for the acquisition is estimated at 3.86 billion – 
sorry - 38.6 billion as per the corporate plan 
excluding potential effects from forex hedging, forex 
escalation and other pricing escalation.”  
And that is slide 27 does not coincide with slide 12.  It is not going to 
be in slide 12. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In the same presentation then McKinsey 
suggests that the 38.6 billion include forex and hedging?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That would be their slide 12 but in the same 
20 
presentation at slide 27 they suggest that:  
“ETC for the opposition is estimated at 38.6 billion 
as per the corporate plan excluding  potential 
effects from forex hedging, forex escalation and 
other price escalations.”?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 75 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  All this in one presentation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  All this in one presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  If we may then proceed to …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  104. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  104. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Also on 18 February McKinsey 
emails Mr Singh the business case 2012/04/18 “1  064 Locomotive 
Business Case_Final PDF”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is in Annexure 48. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Inter alia the comments and I 
quote from that: 
“Final version for BADC…”  
That is Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee.  
“…with updated numbers (now 2.7 billion versus 
NBV versus 0.3 billion previously including item 1 
…” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “New forex curve based 
on Treasury’s input.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “Adjusted fleet estimates 
to add up to 1 064 as per JD’s input today.  Three, 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 76 of 247 
 
updating CO2 savings based on only diesel changed 
back – changed from today’s back of the envelop to 
– of 13 million to 5 million bottom up accounting for 
updated fleet plan.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “Item 4, updated TCO - 
Total Cost of Ownership – as a result of the forex 
change.  Item 5, new funding and forex hedging 
section received from Danie this evening.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is from McKinsey?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  McKinsey to Mr Singh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it confirms that forex and hedging are 
part of the business plan?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Per that outline. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 105 – paragraph 105 – 
Mr Singh was the Acting Chair of the 1  064 locomotives steering 
committee meeting held on the morning of 18  April.  The draft minutes 
included the Acting Chairman highlighted inter alia the following.  The 
minutes are included as Annexures 49 and 49A and these are extracts 
20 
from those minutes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For simple reference.  105.1: 
“GCE - the Group Chief Executive - has confirmed 
that he has worked through the document sent to 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 77 of 247 
 
him on 17 April 2013 and he is satis fied with the 
document.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  While we are on that before you move and 
what document would that be he is referring to - the one of 
17 April 2013? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  He is referring to the business 
case held before.  May we just then turn to 49 and 49A?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Just a minute.  Your 49 starts at 383?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  49 starts at 383. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And 49A starts at 386 and the document at 
10 
386 is minutes of the Locomotive Steering Committee?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that is the document that GCE confirms he 
has considered and he is satisfied with that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Going onto 105.2: 
“The difference between the documents submitted 
on 17 April and 18 April 2013 include inter alia …”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Reading from 105.3 i: 
“Significant amendments – the forex rates included 
in the model previously were high.  The forex rates 
have now been amended downwards which creates 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 78 of 247 
 
an NBV on the business case at (indistinct) rate of 
2.7 billion.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “Accordingly the 0.3 
billion NBV at (indistinct) rate in the previous 
versions of the document has been amended to 
R2.7 billion.  Consequently the business case is 
now more than robust.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Clearly indicating forex is in the 
10 
business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As an aside the – paragraph 105.4: 
“The MNS Report Volume 1 records that the minutes 
of 18 April 2013 pleased at 2014 is dealt with in the 
supplementary and it is actually 2013 …”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “…of the Locomotives 
Steering 
Committee 
was 
signed 
on 
– 
in 
September 2014.” 
20 
Going to paragraph 106 - the resolution of the meeting however states 
notwithstanding what we have in the meeting the resolution of the 
meeting however states: 
“The 
Steering 
Committee 
resolved 
that 
it 
recommends that the Group Executive Committee 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 79 of 247 
 
approves the acquisition of 1  064 locomotives for 
the general freight business.  Estimated total costs 
of the acquisition of 38.6 billion per the corporate 
plan (excluding the potential effects from forex 
hedging, forex escalation, other price escalations 
and borrowing costs).”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If we – if we then could turn to – to the actual 
document what you quote at page – paragraph 106.1 appears at page 
388 at item 3.1.2.  Is that correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  388 the document I am quoting 
10 
from.  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is correct.  Now – then you contrasted 
two documents.  This minute and the document of 18  April 2013 from 
McKinsey. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The McKinsey document confirms that forex 
and hedging were included in the original business case.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This minute however reflects at 3.12 that th e 
38.6 billion ETC does not include forex and hedging at 388 that 
20 
quotation you give at your paragraph 106.  At three - sorry - 312 – my – 
my mistake. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  312 not 3.12.  I misread that.  I apologise.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Three … 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 80 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The resolution at page 388 at item 312 is 
inconsistent with the very document provided by McKinsey of 18  April 
indicating that hedging – forex and hedging were included in the 
business case? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if we take it date wise it would appear 
that the McKinsey document comes a day after the meeting.  The 
meeting is for 17 April.  My apologies.  They are both 18  April. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They are both 18 April. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja, they are both 18 April. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They are both 18 April. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then perhaps – then – then it is a bit 
confusing.  Please bear with me.  Go to your paragraph 105.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  105. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 105.1 you record there that the GC – and I 
quote: 
“The GCE has confirmed that he has worked 
through the document sent to him on 17 April 2013 
and he is satisfied with that document.”  
You indicated earlier that the docum ent referred to is the minute.  It 
20 
cannot be because the meeting only takes place …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That document …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the 18 t h.  So let us correct that.  What is 
the document referred to that the GCE confirms he considered  … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  With … 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 81 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And he is satisfied there with. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The revised business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The revised business case, thank you.  The 
GCE being Mr Gama is that the – who is the GCE? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No that was Mr Molefe – Group 
Chief Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we dealing here once again with official that is 
quite strange where when you expect people to know simply at a factual 
level that this is the position but you have documents being produced 
that says something different?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is so.  That is correct 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then we can conclude that – that Steering 
– the Locomotive Steering Committees r esolution is factually incorrect 
at 3.1.2 at page 388.  That the 38.6 billion ETC excludes potential 
effects from forex hedging for escalation and other price escalations.  I 
is not supported by any document thus far put before us and put to the 
GCE and to Mr Gama? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not supported by what was 
20 
submitted previously.  It is not supported by the discussion in the 
business case itself.  The conclusion – the resolution is incorrect. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
And 
if 
anything 
the 
business 
case 
demonstrates the direct opposite?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 82 of 247 
 
DV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That the hedging and forex is included in …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In that 38.6 billion? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  I – it is drawn to my 
attention that it is tea time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will take the short adjournment and 
resume at half past 11. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes Chair, we may, are you ready Mr 
Callard?  You deal then Mr Callard from your paragraph 107 with the 
contradiction between the minute and the documents.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And you make an important interpretation at 
paragraph 109. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes, I received an email from 
McKinsey dated the 24 t h of April, this is Annexure 50. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Which is page 390, it comes from 
McKinsey, it’s addressed to amongst others myself, Pragasen Pillay 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 83 of 247 
 
and it reads: 
“J D Francis, congratulations on the BADC approval, hopefully 
the Board meeting goes as well.”  
I interpret in this email th at – which was dated the 24 t h of April – that 
McKinsey were party to the presentation to BADC on the 23 r d of April 
and BADC requested a few minor updates which are outlined in this 
Annexure 50.  The updates themselves are not (indistinct) to the issue 
but on paragraph 110 on the 29 t h of April 2013 Naresh Budai circulates 
the locomotive business case 2013-04-29 1064 15h00 locomotive 
business case no Annexure for review and comment.  This business 
10 
case has been updated as per the input from BADC on the 29 t h of April 
Annexures 51 and 51(a) and the purpose still reads,  
 
“Accordingly it is recommended – sorry may I repeat, the 
 
purpose as set out on page 4 still reads, accordingly it is 
 
recommended that the 1064 locomotives business case be 
 
approved at a cost of 386billion excluding borrowing costs”,  
 
On the 30 t h of April, this is now the following day Budai emails 
the file 2013-04-30 09h00 locomotive business case no Annexure PDF, 
may I take to the sub-paragraph, the cover page is dated 25 April 2013 
it indicates it is the final version to the Board of Directors and the 
20 
purpose per page 4 reads, 
 
“Accordingly it is recommended that the 1064 locomotives 
 
business case be approved with estimated total costs at the 
 
acquisition of 38.6billion as per the corporate p lan (excluding 
 
the potential threats from Forex hedging, Forex escalations 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 84 of 247 
 
 
and other price escalations)”. A significant Change.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So then your Annexure 51(a) is the BADC 
approval of the business case or is the business case approved by 
BADC? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     51(a) is as I received it from the 
– Mr Budai. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Budai, yes and as at the 29 t h April 2013 the 
document reflects that the 38.6billion excludes borrowing costs.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now was that factually correct?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That was factually correct, that 
was factually correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay then the same document at page – at 
Annexure 52 addressed to the Board of Trans net. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Final version. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     The final version of the business case.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now indicates at 381 – 398 last line that the 
38.8billion as per the corporate pl an excludes the potential effects from 
Forex Hedging, Forex escalations and other price escalations.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     That is distinctly different from the first.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Distinctly different. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Do you – are you able to shed light on the 
explanation regarding this change?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 85 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The only explanation – the 
mechanism for the change. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Not why the change but the 
mechanism for the change was that the META data for this file which we 
are dealing with under Annexure 52, the changed one.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :    Indicates that it was last modified 
on the machine of Yusuf Mohammed from the office of the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Transnet on 30 April 2013, please note 2014 there 
10 
should read 2013, I’ve addressed that in the supplementary at 10h31 
the total editing time was four minutes and I include this as A nnexure 
53.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so you’re suggesting that to 
understand this change from the one business case that indicated that 
38.6billion only excluded borrowing costs to the document now reading 
that it excludes Forex and hedging to that – for an explanation of that 
change we should turn to Mr Yusuf Mohammed?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     The Group Chief Financial Officer of 
20 
Transnet at the time? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    No office of the Group Chief 
Financial Officer.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Office of? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Ja. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 86 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So what actual position did he hold?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     I cannot say, I cannot give you 
his exact title at the time except that he wa s in the office of the Group 
Chief Financial Officer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay we will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:     These continuing, glaring, maybe omissions or 
inconsistencies basically where the factual position – the true factual 
position is not given but a wrong position is given and to the BADC or 
to the Board one is tempted to think that maybe it was not negligence 
or it could not have been negligence for somebody who may have seen 
10 
certain documents who may have known different documents or certain 
documents that stated the true position and so on and so on.  It may be 
something that you are not able to say anything about but having 
looked at some of this correspondence and he sequence of the 
memoranda and documents and knowing them to pass through cert ain 
people who have to read them an apply their mind to them are you able 
to say whether they couldn’t have been – the wrong position couldn’t 
have been stated due to negligence if somebody had read all the 
documents that they can or should be expected to have read in the light 
of their role in the whole thing?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If I may reply Mr Chair, on my 
paragraph 114 addresses that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Given the extensive 
communication and response to hedging and Forex issues in the 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 87 of 247 
 
formative stage of the final business case, together with the partial 
editing of the PowerPoint presentation and the business case, it’s my 
considered opinion that the altering of the final business case and 
PowerPoint presentation with a phase excluding potential effects Forex 
hedging, Forex escalation and other price escalations was a deliberate 
misrepresentation, this cannot have been an accident.  
CHAIRPERON:     Yes, yes, I think that addresses my question quite 
pertinently ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     What this does mean is when 
one excludes Forex hedging and Forex escalation from what is given to 
10 
be an estimated total cost, it allows for increases to that estimated 
total cost which are undefined in the business case . 
CHAIRPERSON:    And to the extent that this was done deliberately or 
may have been done deliberately, logic says that somebody must have 
wanted to increase the amounts that would be paid by Transnet, for 
whatever reasons?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It is a reasonable explanation of 
what happened here, if I may connect another dot, that we are aware of 
the final price paid for the locomotives with or without the variations 
from 49odd billion to the 54- we’ll deal with the exact figures later but it 
20 
may be purely coincidental that a 50billion figure was mentioned in one 
of the upfront statements by McKinsey in the initial part of the business 
case, the connection may be highly speculative I grant you that, but it 
is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 88 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And – so we should understand from your 
evidence that the estimated total cost, regard being had to the fact that 
the locomotives would be imported and therefore paid for in foreign 
exchange, would have to – the business case for that would have to 
include the hedging and the Forex, in order for the business case to be 
complete? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     May I do a slightly different 
scenario please? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Elements of a locomotive are 
10 
imported, there are imported components and there are local 
components, the ratio of imported local components – of local to 
foreign amounts of a locomotive are specified by the Department of 
Trade and Industries and there are different perc entages for diesel and 
electric locomotives.  The imported amount – the imported components 
or what is deemed the imported foreign content, that would be subject 
to the Forex hedging, the local component would be subject to local 
escalation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So then the amount specified in the 
business case is important insofar as the imported components are 
20 
concerned because it indicates whether that is a cost – an actual cost 
to Transnet or whether the 38.6billion or a percentage thereof still has 
to include the Forex and the hedging.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It was our common practice that 
when we presented a business case we presented a business case with 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 89 of 247 
 
an estimated total cost.  That is the total amount that the organisation 
had to prepare for as a cash outlay over a given period of time.  It was 
to the best of my knowledge and recollection in all the business cases 
– I cannot recollect having prepared a business case that would have 
been accepted without giving the approving authority an indication of 
what is the total cost of the transaction because without that, the 
approving authority, at whatever level is uncertain as to what the final 
amount is going to be and as such it may or may not be – it may or it 
may be outside of their delegated authority, that is why I specifying a 
total and estimated total cost with all the unknowns into the future was 
10 
a essential element of a business case.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So in approving, as per the business case 
approved by the Board, an ETC of 38.6 billion as specifically stated, 
excluding the potential effect from Forex hedging, Forex – and Forex 
escalation, the Board understood that the cost of that Forex hedging 
and Forex escalation are still to be added to the 38.6billion?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Unfortunately I cannot state as 
to the Board understood. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Or to have understood from that statement.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     What they should have – they 
20 
should have understood from that statement, yes, they should h ave 
understood from that statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay and therefore anticipated a return, of 
let’s say the Executive to now seek approval for escalation and 
hedging. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 90 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    I’m hesitant to place myself in 
the mind of the Board.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     But as a reasoned approving 
official presented with an unknown estimated total amount and I don’t 
know whether the final figure is going to be inside or outside of my 
delegated authority, I would, in the mind of a reasonable approving 
official, I should have returned the business case and said please give 
me what is your estimated total cost so that I can budget correctly for 
the cash flow for the organisation over the years of this project and not 
10 
leave it open-ended but I stress that is how I believe it should have 
been approached. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     I accept that, thank you. 
CHAIERPERSON:    Which goes to simply saying, in the case of the 
Board which might be different, maybe if it was  a lower body in the 
case of the Board how can you approve anything when you don’t know 
what the cost will be, that’s…(intervention).  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     That is the nub of it whether it 
was the Board, whether it was BADC or any lower approvin g authority 
the principle that I believe is addressed here, is how can I approve 
20 
something when I do not know what is the final estimated cost, however 
correct or incorrect those assumptions may be, give me a final cost that 
I know that this is within my limits of authority and I can then address 
the final estimated cost.  Here if I’m presenting something with such an 
open-ended aspect as Forex hedging, Forex escalation and other price 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 91 of 247 
 
escalations, I would not know what I am approving, is my interpretation.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Was the Board the highest approving authority in 
respect of any projects or were there circumstances where the 
approving authority in terms of projects, were there circumstances 
where, if the project was beyond a certain amount it had to go to the 
Minister responsible or not?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is correct, the Board was 
the second highest approving authority, the ultimate approving authority 
was the Minister.  The Board had defined limits in terms of its 
delegation of authority and these were updated through various times 
10 
but the Board had an upper limit as to its delegation of authority.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Would it have been possible for the Board, in the 
context of what we are talking about, would it have been possible for  
them take a view that, having regard of the cost that they’ve been told 
and having regard to what they were being told was excluded, there is 
no way it could have been – the total cost could have gone beyond their 
delegation of authority?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     This…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Let me make an example just to make sure that you 
understand what I’m talking about.  If I must approve that you must fly 
20 
to Durban I might not know how much your ticket is going to cost, 
exactly but I’ve got some idea that it’s not going to be more than 
R20 000.00 and if my authority for whatever you are going to Durban 
about or whatever the project is, such that, that price, even though I’m 
not told but from what I know that there’s no way it’s going t o be more 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 92 of 247 
 
than R20 000.00 that, that would still be within my authority, I might 
adopt a certain attitude but it may be different if there’s a risk that it 
could actually put it beyond my authority then I must – I may have to 
really insist.  So you do understand the context of the question?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Yes indeed and the example you 
quote is absolutely correct.  At a level of 38.6billion it was, however, 
outside of the Board’s authority and it would have had to go to the 
shareholder, irrespective of the Forex escalation or not, it would have 
gone to the Minister shareholder. 
CHARPERSON:     It was already out of their…(intervention).  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Already out of their authority to 
approve yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Then maybe we might as well deal with that 
point now that it’s raised, are you aware whether or not the Minister’s 
approval was obtained for the 38.6billion?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes the Minister ’s approval was 
obtained. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And the Minister’s approval was in respect 
of which – what ETC to your recollection, we probably will get there 
20 
later? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     I believe I have that as a – that 
item as a particular Annexure in here because I ’m dealing with it under 
another…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay we will park that question we will 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 93 of 247 
 
come back to it Ms Molefe will find us the Annexure.  We may continue 
then…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     So – sorry, so then I believe that so even with the 
Board then concern about approval being given without knowing, you 
know, the exact total cost or at least a reasonable estimate, it would be 
– it would raise two issues, one is no-one should approve any project 
without knowing what it would  cost you know. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But also then you come to the issue of delegation.  
If your authority is limited then it’s all the more reason why you should 
10 
know what the costs will be because you need it for that pur pose as 
well.  So it seems to me it’s two factors, you know, but they all lead to 
the same thing. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It’s my understanding Mr Chair 
that in the interest of time, bearing in mind that the April 2013 which we 
are dealing with now  is already a year beyond the time when the initial 
business case was delayed, the decision was taken by the Board, 
whatever authority, to issue the request for proposals before obtaining 
the Ministers approval that the request for proposals – and it was 
indicated to the tenders – tenderers that this would be subject to 
20 
Ministerial approval being obtained which it was subsequently and I – 
that was obtained on the PMFA approval was obtained on the 3 r d of 
September 2013, I have that as item 157.4 of my notes that we had the 
Ministerial approval to proceed with that.  That outline of events is set 
out on – slightly later in my testimony. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 94 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     And who was the Minister responsible at the time, 
do you know? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   It was Minister Gigaba.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you Chair, on that question the 
Annexure you were looking for without dwelling on it, is it Annexure 82 
at your page 637, that would be in your second volume.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Second volume being? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Of BB4(b), thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes BB4(b) what divider?  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     I invited him to Annexure 82 at page 637 to 
check whether that’s the approval – the Ministerial approval he was 
seeking. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes page 637 of the Bundle the 
approval is given in the last paragraph on that page.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Am I misreading the document or is the 
document silent on the actual price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I also read that the document is 
silent on the actual amount.     
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay and following on what – the 
20 
discussion you just had with the Chair, the approval to be sought by 
Transnet would be where the costs exceed the Board’s threshold.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So we can assume from that letter that – 
the approval was sought precisely because it exceeded the threshold?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 95 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     To your knowledge and experience what is 
the proper approach, does the Minister approve the actual ETC or just 
approves that the Board may exceed the stipulated threshold, what 
normally happens? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I can’t talk with authority on 
what had previously happened in terms of ot her approval letters from 
the Minister, I can’t talk. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay if you’ve got no knowledge or 
experience on that we will probably get an answer somewhere else.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     But in regard to this particular one that should be 
gathered from the request to the Minister if we’ve got it read with the 
response isn’t it? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     That we will locate in the MNS reports it’s 
not part of Mr Callard’s papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct though I have seen it, I 
did not include it here because it was not the point I wished to make in 
this one but the document is available.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes Chair.  Okay then Mr Callard we move 
on to the – your next topic on the 1064 an d that starts on page 28 and 
is the accelerated locomotive delivery, (indistinct) to your paragraph 
116. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you, as background to 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 96 of 247 
 
this the business case posited a delivery over seven years ending in 
2018/2019.  It is know n that, that delivery was – the contracted delivery 
was for a far faster rate of delivery of locomotives.  If I may take you 
through to paragraph 116, this accelerated locomotive delivery which 
was the accelerated delivery contracted for the 1064 locomotiv es did 
not, in my opinion, make operational or commercial sense and it was, in 
my opinion, ill-considered as it was contrary to the operational advice 
we provided from TFR, it was beyond Transnet Engineering’s scope to 
deliver this accelerated delivery and  it was contrary to the procurement 
strategy of the business case. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes, just to place things in context a 
delivery was scheduled to be over a 7 year period, the accelerated 
delivery reduced that delivery period from 7 to?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     7 to some 3 to 4 years I won’t 
talk to the rate but it was at a rate of 480 locos per year that was – we 
will come to 300 to 480 locos per year whereas the business case, and 
I will talk to that posited delivery, if I can remember corr ectly of 230 
locomotives per year. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The – if I may just go back to – 
20 
for a moment please to paragraph 115, just to place in context that I 
used the Transnet Board approved version with all the iss ues 
beforehand is – I use it as a point of reference and this is Annexure 54 
in the case and I will refer to it just as the final business case of the 
1064 business plan, it is – when I make reference to it and that is what 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 97 of 247 
 
I will be doing in future. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I say that as introduction to 
paragraph 117 because the 1064 business plan, which we’ve just 
referred to, Annexure 54 discusses delivery and the key point of that 
delivery are that the delivery was to b e posited or is posited over 7 
years ending 2018/2019 at a maximum rate of 230 locomotives per 
month, 
page 
48 
of 
that 
business 
plan, 
that 
would 
be 
on 
page…(intervention).   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  449 perhaps? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  449 cor – and that is on page 449 
paragraph 7.2 of 449. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The – this on page – sorry that 
was 448 where we posited the delivery – no 449.  Planning and 
delivery.  448 page 48.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think your page reference is still not correct.  
We will find the correct page for you.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  My page reference is not correct I 
apologise. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will find the correct one but let us 
continue with… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With the essence of your testimony in this 
regard. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 98 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 449 however of my reference 
for paragraph 117.2 delivery risks and whether the positive time frames 
are achievable is clearly set out in 449 and that comes under paragraph 
7.2 planning, delivery and risk.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And then highlighting the 
significant locomotive shortfall that Freight Rail would experience 
against the business plan and assumptions and the associa ted loss of 
tonnes and revenue are also set out there under the delivery schedule 
sensitivity we highlight those issues.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  That is really background though 
to what happened later in early February 2014 pa ragraph 118 when was 
requested by Mr Singh what would be our response to an aggressive 
delivery schedule for the 1064 locomotives?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Messrs Pillay, Roper and I and 
with other technical input we prepared a  report titled TFR preliminary 
view on expediting 1064 locomotives.  This may be found on page 21 
Annexure 56. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 56 is – starts from 520 I do not 
understand your 21? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is 520. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  520. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  521. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 99 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  And while we do that could you quickly 
indicate whose Pillay – is that a Ms Pillay? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is Mr Pragasen Pillay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If – in the documentation he will 
often be abbreviated as JD. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  JD.  And Roper? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is Ms Rita Roper who was the 
general manager Capital programme.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You will see that we are – the 
names appear at the bottom – on the bottom of page 521. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As signatories to this report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Compilers of this report.  
Essentially we were asked to address what would be our view on the 
accelerated delivery of 300 locomotives per year?  Without going 
through the details of the report which is quite expensive – extensive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Extensive I would highlight the 
pertinent comments which were.  As a strategy we would have to fast 
park old locomotives with a caveat on the organisational recognition of 
the technical nature of this work.  Parking and locomotive is not  
parking it in an underground parking garage and leaving it for a couple 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 100 of 247 
 
of years.  There are actions which have to be performed to park a 
locomotive to ensure that after six months’ time or a years’ time it is 
either usable for service or if one is not go ing to use it for service in 
the future what one does with that locomotive?  It is not just 
abandoning a locomotive.  We needed to ensure and I am on – read – I 
am back on page – on paragraph 118.2 my paragraph page 29.  We 
needed to ensure that the market was there to support the additional 
tonnages given that the original business case ramp up was there to – 
was largely matched to the tonnage if we were accelerated the 
locomotives was the market available?  Could we adjust the wagon plan 
10 
accordingly?  In 118.4 the linkage to major projects.  Several major 
projects were affected here and it would have to be an adjustment in 
the capital cash flow to fast track certain projects to achieve the 
aggressive tonnages per the time lines stipulated.  And that would 
particularly address customers, lines to those customers, loading and 
offloading capabilities.  It is not just bring more locomotives it has to 
be matched to the market, to the wagons, to the total infrastructure 
component.  And those major projects would have to be accelerated.  
The delivery and we make – made quite a point that our T – the 
Transnet Engineering’s delivery promise for an aggressive start -up was 
20 
April 2015 maybe – for an aggressive start-up that is to start 
production. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  It was Freight Rail’s view this 
could be between three months to over a year later depending on 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 101 of 247 
 
whether it was diesel or electric locomotives and a known or an 
unknown supplier.  I make the point there that when one is setti ng up a 
production line for a supplier with whom one is familiar a lot of ground 
is already covered. If it is an unknown supplier it is a lot more 
complicated.  The critical point was that TE start -up of the local 
manufacturer of previous contracts had not  been visibly managed as a 
project and under a dedicated and accountable programme manager 
according to a [indistinct] visible and a communicated project plan.  
This was the cause of the delays experienced and we have highlighted 
those and the delays assoc iated with the 95 locomotives.  And in effect 
10 
this 
was 
building 
on 
those 
delays 
which 
we 
knew 
about.  
Commissioning. It commissioning a locomotive one requires staff with 
certain expertise and the ability to commission and we do not have that 
many staff that could deal with that many locomotives coming in in such 
a short period of time.  There was insufficient skilled staff.  In 
operations we did not have sufficient train drivers.  It takes between 
two to three years to train a train driver.  They just were  not readily 
available to deal with this number of locomotives and we would need to 
review our crew requirements with an aggressive intake in the 2014/15 
financial year.  The maintenance interventions of the current 
20 
locomotives would have to be adjusted an d or curtailed.  We also put 
forward the control of locomotives be moved to logistics integration to 
consolidate to control introduce proactive planning tech monitoring and 
develop an enforced key performance indicators.  And lastly we 
highlighted all the risks in the business plan around this rapid delivery 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 102 of 247 
 
of locomotives.  Long story short we sent this report to Mr Gama, Singh 
and Ms Roper on the 12 February 2014.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the gist of that memorandum is 
acceleration is not advisable?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  A sound reading would say tread 
very carefully before accelerating these locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may continue. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Perhaps tread carefully is not the 
right phrase but we highlighted  the risks as we could to warn off this 
accelerated delivery. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I perhaps summarised this best on 
the 26 February and I am ready paragraph 120.  
“When responding to Mr Singh on various scenarios I 
explicitly stated this was in an email that we Freight 
Rail could not absorb more than 300 locomotives per 
year 
due 
to 
marketing 
and 
commissioning 
constraints.” 
And that is in Annexure 57 which is on page 534.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I just take from there?  There 
were three scenarios.  40 locomotives per month versus the original 
plan.  48 locomotives per month versus the 300 per year and 300 per 
year versus the original.  Also factored in delivery to production.  The 
last point. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 103 of 247 
 
“Please note NB we cannot absorb more than the 300 per year due to 
market and commissioning constraints per the earlier note.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the acceleration would have increased 
that, the number of locomotives for you to absorb from 300 to?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This was around the – potentially 
around the 300 mark. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that was still above what the business 
plan had originally planned?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I went – go back to the point 
that the business  plan had posited per paragraph 117.1 a maximum rate 
10 
of 230 locomotives per month. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Please continue. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From paragraph 122 the above 
notwithstanding Pillay and I were requested to present a view updated 
for aggressive delivery of 480 peak per year.  We did – redid this 
report.  It followed the same format as the previous report but it was 
more detailed in the links to major projects.  Most of the projects had to 
be completed within two years with a caveat that not all the projects 
were fully funded.  This added emphasis to the risks and delivery and 
commissioning sections.  If I may just outline that?  Recognising that 
20 
increasing the rate of locomotives to 480 per month would require 
additional cash flow.  We were already well aware of the constraint 
budgets and the budget limitations.  So moving money to procuring the 
locomotives would take capital away from the capital projects which 
were required to support the locomotives particularly in terms of the 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 104 of 247 
 
infrastructure and the like.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just perhaps you might – I should find out 
from you. When you and by you I mean plural you the team was 
requested to consider accelerating delivery what was the reason 
advanced for the need for acceleration?  If one ever was. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We were given a reason post 
event. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the time it was not stated what – why they 
need to accelerate – a reason? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have nothing in writing as to why 
10 
we needed to accelerate. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But to – the person who requested you 
consider acceleration whether in writing or verbally was a reason given 
you? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The nature of the reason given to 
us was that accelerating the locomotives woul d save forex costs into 
the future. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And was it demonstrated how that 
could be achieved? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was left at a statement it was 
20 
not demonstrated how it could be achieved.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not that I am aware of.  So we 
prepared this report and I am at the bottom of paragraph 122 and we 
sent it to Mr Gama for input on the 6 March for onward transmission to 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 105 of 247 
 
Mr Singh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Per paragraph 23 Mr Gama 
responded on the 10 March 2014 please that is a correction there, 
allocating specific responsibilities to various projects.  We outlined all 
the work which had to be done and he allocated responsibilities to 
those projects. He stressed that we had under emphasised the Transnet 
Engineering and should update the report before sending it to the 
Group Chief Financial Officer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We updated the report and on the 
11 March I sent it to inter alia Mr Gama and Mr Singh with a covering 
note that the very aggressive delivery poses an overall risk as it 
requires very tight simultaneous coordination of markets, customer 
capacity, material supply, developing infrastructure capa city and 
wagons. And this is Annexure 58 page 536.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the – the detail of the 
report and without dwelling on the report in detail just on page 536 the 
index details the items which we cover in deta il. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And before you leave that point you introduce 
through your supplementary affidavit – statement at paragraph 10 
thereof page 3 Annexure 58. – 58A and you say it is an email dated 11 
March 2014 from yourself to Siyabonga Gama and Anoj  Singh.  This is 
the covering note referred to in paragraph 124 of my statement.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 106 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that email is the covering note to when you 
sent the document which is Annexure 58?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The upshot of this report was an 
extensive workshop on the 27 May 2014 and an allocation and 
deallocation of tasks and responsibilities to address the de facto 
10 
situation.  I state de facto situation because now on the 27 May 
contracts had already been signed and accelerated delivery was now au 
fait accompli.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the – we know from records th at the 1064 
contract was signed on the 17 March 2014?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On which timeline were the contracts signed 
to your knowledge?  Was it on an acceleration basis or on the original 
seven year? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No it was on the accelerated basis.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that was a contracted position already?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then therefore – sorry at 125 you hold the 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 107 of 247 
 
workshop that is what you mean – you hold the workshop after the 
contract is concluded and therefore?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The contract had been concluded 
we have this delivery staring us now in the face, how are we going to 
deal with it?  We hold this workshop to address the de facto situation 
how we are going to manage these locomotives?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And Annexure 59 on page 554. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Is my email to multiple colleagues 
10 
addressing a meeting we had on the 27 May and if I turn to page – if we 
may turn to page 555 please without going through the detail.  It sets 
out what we have to do and the variety of tasks that have to be 
performed and the individuals assigned to those tasks to address the 
situation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I take it further that by July the 
2014 strategy and business planning had taken over coordinating all 
the responses and actions emanating from this 27 May workshop.  
Loosely they used the framework of the report.  Strategy and business 
20 
planning preceded to use the responses and actions as the basis of the 
first iteration for the 2015/16 business plan and that is indicated in 
Annexure 60 page 558. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And we accept annexure is there.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The annexure is there and it is 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 108 of 247 
 
from strategy and page 559 says it is from the strategy and business 
planning and it practically mirrors where we were.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  So – and what happened to this report 
after it was concluded?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well on the – I go to the – 
paragraph 127 that on the 10 July strategy and business planning had 
shared and I have addressed that in my supplementar y we are ready to 
share that is in fact had shared a presentation on the accelerated 
locomotive delivery plan with Mr Gama per Annexure 61.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Where they say they had shared it.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On the 16 July for the presentation 
by strategy and business planning to the Transnet Group EXCO I sent 
the following concluding slide.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This presentation to Mr Gama was 
updated with minor amendments but I sent the following concluding 
slide.  There was an addition by Mr Pillay that did not make it to the 
slide but I would like to quote that.  
20 
“In order to ensure there is a reliable system it is required that rail 
network makes the required investment in line with how the locomotives 
are deployed into the TFR system.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Did not make it to the pack. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 109 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: So the report draws certain conclusions and 
makes recommendations? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right.  The concluding slide to this 
pack that I drafted was conclusion.  Between the three scenarios there 
was no significant financial difference between the three scenarios.  
The three scenarios gearing and debt interes t breach Governance in all 
cases.  The prospect of delays in locomotive delivery has not been 
addressed however real.  Volumes for the accelerated delivery of 480 
locomotives per annum are at risk.  Capital and OPEX that is 
Operational Expenditure related to the 1064 and 160 locomotives can 
10 
be phased but not negated. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I added the recommendation that 
the locomotive delivery be rephrased – be rephrased to between 250 
and 300 locomotives per annum with 400 be ing the upper limit.  The 
shareholder and treasury be approached to approve the short term 
breach in cash, interest, cover and gearing.  The concluding slide to 
that presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And these recommendations were shared with 
Mr Gama then? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say that they were shared 
with Mr Gama but they made their way into the final report into the 
presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The presentation was made to whom?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The presentation I believe was 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 110 of 247 
 
then made to EXCO I say I believe I gave it to strategy and business 
planning.  They took it forward.  I cannot say how they took it forward.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And who in particular in strategy and business 
planning? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well the executive manager in 
strategy and business planning at that moment – at that time was Ms 
Sandra Gertenbach. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ms? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sandra Gertenbach her details are 
per 61 I take you to Annexure 61. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Here is 61 the annexure. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Page 562.  She was Executive 
Manager in the office of the Chief Engineer, Chief Executive Strategy 
and business planning. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now as we [indistinct] the two 
recommendations you make do you know whether the re-phasing you 
recommend was carried out?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.  No the re-phasing – there was 
no re-phasing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the expectation was still to deliver – to 
20 
take delivery of 480 locomotives per annum?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct and in fact that ties 
in with my paragraph – with paragraph 129. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The pressures on the accelerated 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 111 of 247 
 
delivery programme were intense. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On the 30 October 2014 I received 
the following sms from Mr Gama.  I do not quote:  
“I do not change my mind daily.  You and JD agreed to 480 max a few 
months ago make it work.”  
I do not recall the exact circumstances that gave rise to  the sms but it 
was symptomatic of the pressure at the time.  It is possible and I stress 
it is possible that it was related to the recommendations above.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now that sms indicates that you and JD and I 
10 
take it that is Mr Pillay as you indicated? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Had previously agreed that you can absorb 
480 max a few months ago, did you ever?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That would be a reading of the 
sms. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We did not agree to 480 a few 
months ago.  Ala because that would be in direct contradiction to my 
email to Mr Singh which I referred to where I said we cannot absorb 
20 
more than 300 per month. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And which is – you referred us to earlier as 
Annexure – at 534. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At . 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 534. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 112 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As Annexure 534. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And your position has always been that you 
can – you can absorb maximum up to 300?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you – your position is that you never made 
that agreement with Mr Gama?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We did not make that agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The – and the fact that we may – 
we prepared a report on the aggressive delivery highlighting all the 
10 
risks and actions to be taken if we were to go to 480 did not say that 
we agreed with 480.  It pointed out extensive organisational risks and 
impacts.  We said if you want to do this this is what has to happen but 
we did not agree to it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words you made your position quite clear 
but to the extent that you may have been under instruction to do what 
somebody higher up you know thought should be done you would play 
your role as long as your position was known?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the way it works. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Callard from paragraph 
130 you then move to a slightly different topic.  Transnet Engineering 
preparedness. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  This is a – another 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 113 of 247 
 
matter on this one as to why – yes.  From one paragraph 130 Transnet 
Engineering was I believe ill equipped to handle the accelerated 
locomotive delivery.  In February 2014 Mr Pillay and I accompanied Mr 
Singh and others to meetings with Price Waterhouse Cooper referred to 
here in the documents as PWC to discuss Transnet Engineering’s 
preparedness to manufacture/assemble locomotives.  It is my correct 
recollection that we full appraised them of our concerns based on 
Transnet Engineering’s late delivery of the 95 20 E locomotives.  The 
time it took to get the GE that is the General Electric assembly line up 
and running this was for the dies el locomotives and in our view the 
10 
structural and cultural deficiencies in Transnet Engineering to rapidly 
transform into a world class manufacturing and assembly facility.  PWC 
had prepared – or prepared a report that is extensive and detailed.  It 
highlights significant risks in TE’s capability.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you go past that point.  There is 
something you need to point out to the Chair on this paragraph 132 that 
is significant and in particular I am referring to what you state in your 
supplementary statement at paragraph 11 of your supplementary 
statement Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes.  Paragraph – I refer there in 
20 
paragraph 132 to Annexure 62A.  It is but one slide setting out the risk 
of attempting to compress the delivery sc hedules. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you get there.  Let us deal with your 
first statement.  You say PWC prepared a report that is extensive and 
detailed. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 114 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Also highlights significant risk and TE 
capability.  I am pointing you to your paragraph 11 in your 
supplementary statement where you seek to introduce a document 
which is not currently or is not part of your original statement.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, correct.  And that 
document is on page 21 of the supplementary. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you indicate at your paragraph 11 that 
this is the PW slide you refer to?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is the PW slide I refer to yes.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Annexure 62A is not that PW slide?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So Chair if you could – the Chair could 
just scribble at 132 that that slide that Mr Callard refers to at 132 is 
included through his supplementary statement paragraph 11 to be 
marked 62B.  Thank y ou Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Thank you.  And if I may then just 
add that Annexure 62A belongs to paragraph 138 because it refers to a 
20 
Transnet Freight Rail risk in the ramp up.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – come again that all these 
concerns of one in Transnet Engineering preparedness are also 
expressed in the reports on the preliminary view of expediting the 1064 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 115 of 247 
 
locomotives and which was Annexure 56  and the report updated for the 
aggressive delivery of the 480 peak per year.  We highlighted these 
risks in that report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So do we understand then from what you are 
saying that you highlighted the risks pertaining to Transnet Engineerin g 
preparedness and PWC drew similar conclusions that there is 
significant risk …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As per Annexure 62B?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And both these were shared with senior 
executives within Transnet?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right.  In paragraph I mention 
there that the detailed concerns of a technical colleague and his team 
as set out in the email of 6 June 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have already alluded to those 
emails and the photographs.  I highlight that they give expression to 
20 
this concern. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now to your – to your knowledge was here – 
no – was there ever – I will repost that.  Was three ever a response – a 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 116 of 247 
 
formal response to your report highlighting these risks?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, not that I am aware  of. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is it your …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have no trace of it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is it your understanding that although – that 
these risks were in fact brought to the attention of the senior 
executives within Transnet?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The reports were brought to the 
attention – both reports and I have mentioned that they were emailed to 
Mr Gama and Mr Singh.  Ms Rita Roper was a co compiler of the first 
10 
report.  The second report was also specifically addressed to 
Ms Nomfuyo Galeni who was the Chief Financial Officer of Transnet 
Freight Rail.  She – sorry we are dealing now with the Aggressive 
Delivery Report? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  She undertook certain 
actions and compiled certain meetings which gave rise to it being taken 
into strategy and planning.  She initiated those first series of meetings 
as an upshot of the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Were these risks shared with the Board 
20 
at any point?  Do you know?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say definitively.  From 
what I have read of Board minutes they do not appear to have been.  I 
cannot say definitively. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you.  I interrupted you when you 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 117 of 247 
 
were dealing with your 135.  If you may take it up from there. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sure.  My 135 is a comment that: 
“It is regrettably common cause that many of the 
1 064 locomotive deliveries are running late.  The 
media report from the Chairman of the Transnet 
Board on 4 December 2018 reported to Parliament 
that only 497 of the 1 064 locomotives had been 
delivered so far.  When in terms of the delivery 
schedule all of them should have been delivered by 
now.” 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So by now meaning by the date on which the 
Chair appeared before …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  By the date of 4 December 2018. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now in any given year was the target of 480 
locomotives per annum ever met?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I did not track it specifically but I 
would be extremely surprised if it was ever met.  I would say with a 
high degree of confidence it was not me.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now in your - to your knowledge and in your 
experience when then the delivery is accelerated does that have any 
20 
impact and if so what kind of impact on the r ate of payment for the 
deliveries? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Well 
accelerated 
delivery 
accelerates the rate of payment. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 118 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Insofar as we have seen and will 
see in apart from the down payment the balanc e of the payment is then 
spread across the locomotives.  So the higher the rate of delivery the 
locomotives the greater the cash flow in any particular year.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – you get into your – to the next topic of 
procurement strategy.  If you – you do not have to read that part.  I am 
sure you can summarise what is under that heading.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – I would summarise 136 through 
to 139 as follows:  that the business plan highlighted the need to adjust 
the rate of delivery in line with risk as it materialised.  Risks being 
10 
either an acceleration of the market or a slowdown in the market growth 
and that we needed to be able to adjust the locomotive delivery 
accordingly.  The upshot of the accelerated locomotive delivery 
contract was that it negated all the protection we sought in the 
business case for being able to adjust the rate of delivery of the 
locomotive either by extending it if the market did not materialise as we 
have seen or by accelerating it should the market have reall y grown 
further.  That mechanism which we saw in the business case was not 
taken forward and in fact entirely negated by the rapid acceleration 
procurement strategy that was followed.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then I think that takes us to advance – 
the issue of advance payments at – starting at your paragraph 141. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja and it was my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at paragraph 140 is that not quite important – 
that conclusion? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 119 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We can place it on records please …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What you state at 140 please consider that 
and … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  140 yes.  It is my conclusion – I 
conclude that: 
“It was a pity that the worst case volume shortfall 
identified in the business case is exactly wha t 
freight rail experienced that the market - in essence 
– that the market did not materialise as were 
10 
deposited in the MDS with its doubling of freight.  
Further this occurred without the benefit of a 
flexible procurement and contracting strategy that 
allowed locomotive purchasers to be accelerated or 
throttled back without undue penalties.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  We turn then to the 
question of advance payments and you deal with that from your 
paragraph 141. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sure.  Again I open this with a – 
with a conclusion: 
20 
“That 
it 
is 
my 
considered 
opinion 
that 
the 
contracted payment schedules negatively and non -
necessarily impacted Transnet.  The 1  064 business 
case deposit upfront payments on signing the 
contracts of 250 million for the diesel and 350 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 120 of 247 
 
million for the electric locomotives.”  
And we have dealt with that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “These upfront payments 
were incorporated into the financial models.  The 
table 
below 
on 
144 
is 
extracted 
from 
10 December 2013 report of the Cross Functional 
Evaluation Team.” 
That was Annexure 83 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And it may be found on page 659 
of the bundle. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is where you say the table comes  
from? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is where that table comes 
from. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But for the moment you confine yourself to the 
contents of the table (intervenes)?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For the moment I confine myself to 
the contents of the table. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The contents of the table – we will 
see that that deposits that bidder one which is Bombadier had a total 
payment before acceptance of 24 percent.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 121 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder two which was CSR of 1.62 
percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder three – and I recall that one 
offhand – 24 percent. Bidder five, 1.62 percent, bidder seven which was 
Mitsui was 1.62 percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In essence I use this to illustrate 
that the position taken in the business case of upfront payments of 300 
million for electric locomotives were not out of line.  That they could be 
10 
expected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that column or table you said Mitsui was which?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bidder seven. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then let us deal with bidder two – CSR.  As 
at the bid stage CSR had offered to accept an upfront payment of 1.62 
of the total price? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was at the end of the 
document, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then what happens after these are 
received? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 122 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Now that was for the electric 
locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Table one on paragraph 145 – the 
following table is the same extract but from the diesel locomotives .  It 
may be found on page 699 but it is extracted here.  That bidder one 
which was CNR, bidder two which was CSR.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder three was EMD which I – 
Electro Motive Division … 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Short for EM – abbreviated to EMD 
and bidder four was General Electric – GE. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We will see that CNR was 1.08 
percent.  CSR – 1.43 percent, bidder three was asking for 25 percent 
and bidder four – 10 percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So insofar as CNR and CSR – at least 
– are concerned they were – they both proposed payment of – below 2 
percent. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I make the point on per 1.46 
that the above table showed the deposit or APG payments in the order 
of one to 2 percent on (indistinct).  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 123 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So - and what in reality then happened?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In reality what happened the table 
below is compiled from Annexure 17.  Now Annexure 17 was a – a file 
which I received from – may I just turn to Annexure 17.  This – on page 
275.  The file was – it was a spreadsheet of copies of cash flow finals 
on 17 March when the …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Payments were finally contracted.  
I give extracts of that and this table is compiled from that spreadsheet.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Work us through the table so we 
10 
understand please. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The essence of this is that this 
was the payment guarantees and payments to be made over the nature 
of the contract.  If I make take us to Bombadier.  We had a payment 
now of 9 percent, a design review of 9 percent and a payment after 6 
months of 8 percent giving a total advance payment before and I stress 
that this is before a locomotive is delivered of 27 percent.  This is an 
increase of 3 percent from what they put forward in their original bid 
document referring to the table on page …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  34. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  34. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They had originally proposed 24 percent.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And it went up to 27 percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And their contracted position is 27 percent?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 124 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Or would … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does …? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Be contracted position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does the table at 35 remind who the other bidders 
were that you could not remember earlier or not really?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well table 35 was the – table 35 - 
the first one was Bombadier – bidder one was Bombadier.  Bidder two 
was CSR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder seven was Mitsui and the 
10 
detail is here – bidders three and five were between Siemens a nd 
Alstom.  I will reflect that in a moment.  Bidder three was Alstom and 
bidder five was Siemens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Now you – you had just taken us through 
Bombadier. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I had taken us through – thank 
you.  If we look at CSR the total advance payment is now 30 percent 
before delivery of a locomotive whereas in the bid documents it was 
1.62 percent. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For General Electric it remains the 
same 10 percent to 10 percent comparing the table at the top of page 
35 with the table on – against one – paragraph 147 10 percent remains 
10 percent.  For CNR whereas in the bid documents it was 1.08 percent 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 125 of 247 
 
it now increases after the negotiation at award stage to 1 5 percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am ignoring the CSR 100 and the 
GE 60.  They are not part of the 1  064.  They were just – I make the 
point then on paragraph (intervenes).  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry, please explain why you are exploring 
the others. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have already dealt with the 
CSR 100 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Locomotives … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is what the final two columns relate 
to? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is what the final two columns 
relate to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The conclusion I make from this is 
paragraph 148 but from the above table the  advanced payments before 
20 
a locomotive is delivered for three bidders increased from their initials 
bids.  This was a slight increase from a high base and CSR having the 
highest increase by CNR.  I have deleted the words in my 
supplementary.  I have changed … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 126 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If you look for three bidders and I 
have deleted GE remained the same.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now what we have at that table at paragraph 
147 this was the position post negotiation or …?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is the post negotiation 
position and I make the point in paragraph 149.  The increases beg the 
question as to how the final negotiations were conducted.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we have no understanding of how 
notwithstanding the fact th at CSR offers to accept 1.62 percent of the 
final price in advance payment how that jumped to 30. Do we have an – 
10 
any understanding of how that came about?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Others may have (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may then continue overleaf.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have already dealt with item 50 
and the … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  GE upfront payments.  Under 151 
as previously mentioned a consequence of the agreed advance 
payments was that on contract initiation of 17  March 2014 Transnet had 
to pay an upfront advance payment of 7.37 billion before 1  April 2014.  
This was so that the payments would be reflected in the 2013/2014 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 127 of 247 
 
financial year. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  One of the consequences of the 
payment schedule was that Transnet had to increase its foreign 
borrowings. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I refer you here please to 
Annexure 63 and 64 and these are on pages 569 to 573.  569 – if I may 
give it in context – highlights a series of emails that I – between myself 
and other individuals which just say t hat the Group had to apply to the 
10 
Department of Public Enterprise for an increase in the following funding 
limit.  Could I please assist with my interpretation of …?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Your - if I may just say – your 569 you have 
taken us to Annexure 63. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  569 Annexure 63. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I am reading from the middle 
of the email.  I address it to various parties and I say:  
“Hi all, Group have applied to DPE for an increase 
in the following funding limit.  They have come back 
20 
with additional questions and they relate around to 
the 1 064 and the like.” 
The point which I want to make is that the slides which – the work 
which I returned to the – to Group around this it can be found on page 
574 and 575. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 128 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is your Annexure 64?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is Annexure 64. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at 575. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May we just do 574 at the moment 
please? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The first one and you will see 
there under total where the required funding for the 2014/2015 
corporate plan is given at R15.1 billion as required funding.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am not addressing the source of 
the funding how it is made up.  Just the quantum.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we may turn over please and this 
slide addresses revised funding requirements and the left hand column 
is the budget for 2014/2015 Rand million and  it talks to a funding 
requirement of 15.073.  It is normal that one has a rounding and that …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of course. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  15.1 to 15.073. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What they then do is they deduc t 
the foreign funding requirement occasioned by the 1  064 locomotives 
on the initial cash flows we had put forward.  They then add back to 
that the current locomotives cash flows occasioned by the accelerated 
delivery. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 129 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We will see that the funding 
requirement increases by six – a figure to the order of R6 billion in the 
201t/2015 financial year. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh and – and that 6 billion we – we 
achieve by deducting from the total of 21 billi on the funding 
requirement in the third line of your table?  That is the adjustment?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I go back?  It is perhaps 
slightly differently. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have the funding requirement 
of 15 billion.  That is the third line left hand column.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We remove the cash flow as 
occasioned by the 1 064 against the earliest …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Cash flows which drops the 
funding requirement to 13.755 billion.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We then add back the funding 
20 
requirement of the revised cash flows given the accelerated delivery 
and if we add those figures of being 482  412 261 320 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we add that back to the 13.755 
which is the funding requirement of 21.125 billion.  Comparing that with 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 130 of 247 
 
the initial 15 billion gives us the increase of 6 billion …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Because 
of 
the 
increased 
accelerated delivery increased funding requirement of the organisation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As we work through the remaining 
columns we will see there are also signific ant increases in funding 
requirements based on these cash flows.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do qualify that while my response 
10 
might not have been definitive because like any set things may have to 
be tweaked I was not the  final arbiter but I believe this illustrates the 
quantum of the increases that were in effect.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – we then turn to the evaluation process 
… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the 1 064 locomotives. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which you deal with from – from your 
paragraph 153? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you suggest that you are going to deal 
with this in two phases?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The first being the bid process – the receipt 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 131 of 247 
 
of the bids up to and including selecting the final suppliers?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  The second phase deals with the 
negotiations with selected suppliers?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Let us turn first then to your first 
phase which you begin to talk to from your paragraph 154 at page 37?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  You express a view at 154  that you 
believe that the process …  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I quote. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “I believe that the 1 064 
evaluation process was flawed.  It – it was more 
than administratively flawed.  It was flawed.  The 
MNS Report into the 1 064 Locomotives Volume 1 – 
14 August 2018 
in 
the 
Executive 
Summary 
concludes that the results of all of the above 
(except 
the 
price 
increases) 
renders 
he 
procurement of the 1 064 locomotives the subject 
20 
susceptible to judicial review for failure to adhere 
to the applicable legal framework.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will complement the above 
finding with detail not covered in the MNS Report.  I will draw – in this 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 132 of 247 
 
section I will draw on material to which I have had access through my 
work with MNS and material made available through the Zondo 
Commission and documents in the public domain.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will cover the following to support 
my contingence that the evaluation process was flawed.  I again I 
delete the word “administratively”.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “The first is prescribing 
the role of TE as a subcontractor when it is not 
10 
supported by documentation.  Secondly, using the 
prescription of TE as a mechanism to adjust the 
price 
for 
evaluation. 
 
Thirdly, 
inconsistently 
applying 
the 
prescription 
of 
TE 
– 
Transnet 
Engineering – across the bidders and finally it is 
more as a conclusion than a contention but as a 
consequence of the above the BAFO – Best And 
Final Offer - prices to the 1 064 Locomotive 
Steering Committee were not a reflection of the real 
cost.” 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You state here it is not a true reflection of the 
real cost? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Were not a true reflection of the 
real cost. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then you provide – you give us a 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 133 of 247 
 
sense by way of background and context at 157 and paragraph 158 the 
– the timeline that is relevant to this aspect of your testimony and the 
documents you will be relying on? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
May 
I 
just 
for 
ease 
of 
understanding …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Just highlight the timelines there 
because they place things in context. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 16 July 2012 the Request For 
Proposal Part 1 was issued.  This was primarily technical of nature.  On 
11 December 2012 the RFP Part 2 was issued and I will deal with that.  
That dealt with the evaluation process, local content and the like.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 30 April 2013 the bids closed.  
On 
3 September 2013 
PFMA 
approval 
was 
received. 
 
On 
2 December 2013 letters were sent to selected bidders asking them to 
clarify Rand impact of TE to selective bidders.  This clarification closes 
20 
on 4 December 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 12 December 2013 we have the 
reports of the Cross Functional Evaluation Team – I refer to those quite 
extensively. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 134 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 20 December there was a 
request to breakdown an explanation of Annexure E costs in the RFP 
with a closing date of 23  December 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 4 January 2014 there was a 
request for Best And Final Offers – BAFO – with a closing date of 
10 January 2014.  On 15 January there was the - there were the 
memorandums from the CFET.  That will become clear later.  It is Cross 
Functional Evaluation Team Finance to the 1  064 Locomotives Steering 
10 
Committee. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In January 2018 I performed an 
analysis but I will come to that later.  The dates up to there are the key 
pattern points. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we leave that part of your evidence 
please go back to your paragraph 157.4.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  157.4. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You state there 3 September 2013 PFMA 
approval? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It has just been brought to my attention that 
you might want to reconsider that date.  Please have regard to 
Annexure 82 at page 637. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 82 of page 37. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 135 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is the approved – the Ministerial 
approval we referred to earlier and if that is the PFMA approval you 
refer to in your statement at 638 it appears to be dated 3  August and 
not 3 September. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would like to correct that please. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To correct that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  3 August and not 3 September. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With that change Chair it has brought us to 1 
o’ clock.  Might this be an appropriate time to break for the lunch?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will take the lunch adjournment and 
resume at 2o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Mr Callard before we broke for lunch we had 
20 
just dealt with your timeline which is at 157, you then follow that up 
with a list of documents which you list at paragraphs 158 and 159 which 
as you state are relevant to this pa rticular subject, and that we will be 
referring to fairly frequently.  Please take it that we have taken note of 
your list, of those annexures and I think we may then proceed to 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 136 of 247 
 
paragraph 161, and we deal with the specifics of prescribing the role of 
Transnet Engineering as a sub-contractor. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Thanks very much (indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Your mic Mr Callard, thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you very much.  If I may 
draw an analogy and the analogy is to t he argument here, I invite you 
to a meeting, I say we will be holding a meeting at a date and time in 
the future, two months later I ask why did you not attend the meeting, 
and you respond but you didn’t give me the date and time, that will be 
the essence of thrust which I am putting here, on the impact of the role 
10 
of TE as a sub-contractor.   
 
We may be start off that Transnet Engineering, as it was then 
called, is an operating division of Transnet.  The accounting of TE as a 
sub-contractor is problematic and in my opinion contributed to a 
potentially flawed evaluation process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     You are at your 161. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I’m at 161. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And I’d even go so far as to say, 
contributed to a flawed evaluation process in terms of what we had said 
20 
earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     The request for proposal, and 
may I take us there please to page 634 Annexure 81.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 137 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Annexure 81 was from the 
request for proposal part 2 and I have only extracted, essentially the 
page 1 and page 3 of the documents.  Page 3 is the critical page and it 
is 365. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     635? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     635 apologies 635 and I take us 
through to the second paragraph TRE sub-contracting, TRE standing for 
the later name Transnet Rail Engineering.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    If I may quote, 
10 
 
“Participation of TRE in this locomotive procurement process 
 
will be prescribed and further details will follow after the 
 
issuance of part2 of the RFP”, 
 
This is part2, it’s saying, further details will follow.      
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So part1 of the RFP did not include sub-
contracting of TFE read alone as a part1.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Correct, part1 of the request for 
proposal primarily dealt with technical consideration and it enabled 
bidders to get to the nitty gritty of the technical consideration of the 
locomotive, this dealt with other aspects of evaluation and if I may take 
20 
us through, particularly to that point it was the – ja the evaluation 
procedures...(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So it is part2 that introduces the concept of 
using TE as a sub-contractor?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 138 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And you say this is what part2 tells us at 
point 2 of…(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so we understand that it will be 
introduced in some future time and that further details will be provided 
as regards the inclusion of TE as a sub-contractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is as it stands here yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay yes, you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:     May I add from 6 – 163.1 the 
wording in the RFP part2 for the supply of 599 electric – new electric 
10 
locomotives is identical. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay let me just – at Annexure 81 is part2 of 
the RFP in respect of the diesel locomotives.     
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And you are saying if we have regard to the 
RFP part2 of the electric locomotives the provision is identical?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It’s identical. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     We’re with you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is that identical to part1 what are you looking at that 
20 
you say is identical what are the two things you are comparing?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     What I’m saying is identical Mr 
Chair is that claus e TRE sub-contracting on page 635 is identical in the 
electrical and diesel locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Let me ask a different – another question 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 139 of 247 
 
and see perhaps will help clarify for the Chair.  Were two RFP’s issued 
in respect of diesel and electric respectively? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I would imagine that at yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So each one had a RFP1. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Were they – can they be regarded as two separate 
RFP’s or should they be  regarded as two parts of one RFP?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     They were two separate RFP’s, 
one for 599 electrics and another for 465 diesels.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright and you say that the wording of the - 
10 
in regard to the RFP is identical in reg ard to both? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     In this respect in part2 of the 
RFP for both the electricals and the diesels are identical.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     So this clause applies to both 
electrics and diesels. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you Chair, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I have found no record that the 
“further details” referred to were ever issued or formed part of the RFP 
20 
either for diesel or electric locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     As contemplated by item 2 of part2 RFP.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     As referred to - yes as part2 of 
the RFP. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 140 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I go to my paragraph 163.3, in 
the absence of the further details the participation of TE, Transnet 
Engineering, in the locomotive procurement process cannot be 
considered prescribed, no details have been issued.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     That’s a view you express?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That’s a view I express yes .  I 
then go further to my paragraph 164, the PMFA approval letter from the 
honourable Minister dated 3 r d August 2013 talks to, and I quote from 
that letter – and this is Annexure 82, 
 
“The critical role of Transnet Engineering in developing 
10 
 
strategic and industrial capabilities relevant to the Rail Supply 
 
Chain”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     We’ve already seen that the 
letter grants approval for the procurement of the 1064 locomotives 
subject to inter alia the following condition: 
 
“A clear statement by Transnet with regards to TE’s vision in 
 
the locomotive supply chain and what capabilities will be 
 
needed to make this revision a realty”.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Now you say this Annexure 82 is dated 3 r d of 
20 
August 2013, when did the bids close, when were the bids submitted?   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The bids closed per the comment 
I made earlier, the bids closed on the 30 t h of April 2013.  The point of 
this is that this PMFA approval of 3 r d August is received after the bids 
closed. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 141 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I make the point there, that is the 
point I made…(intervention).    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     At 164(1). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :    164(1) but I would add to the 
point so that the PMFA approval could not reasonably be prescription to 
the bid process as the bids had already closed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Do you know whether this was known to the 
Minister at the time of him granting the leave, namely that the proce ss 
10 
was not waiting for his approval they had actually issued the RFP and 
gone ahead in the meantime, you don’t know that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It is my understanding Mr Chair 
that the RFP’s were issued, they were issued with a qualification that  
award would be subject to PMFA approval during this process there was 
considerable correspondence between Minister and the National 
Treasury as well around aspects relating to elements of the RFP 
process particularly local content and – sorry not local content, 
particularly relating to the evaluation criteria of the bids.  I have not 
included that here, that can be dealt with by others, I was addressing 
20 
myself solely to the role of Transnet Engineering in the process bid.  
CHAIRPERSON:     There would have had to have been something 
quite urgent for the to do things this way isn’t it because if you issue a 
RFP in the circumstances where you need the Minister ’s approval 
before you issue but you issue before you get the approval on the 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 142 of 247 
 
understanding, on the condition that the RFP is issued subject to the 
approval of the Minister being obtained.  If you then subsequently get 
the Minister ’s approval but it’s subject to conditions that you might not 
have expected, then you might have to do the whole thing.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     That would be a reasonable 
process yes.  One would say, I’m sorry I did not get the requisite 
approval I was seeking I will have to cancel this bid process and re -
issue 
given 
that 
my 
superior 
authority 
has 
imposed 
certain 
requirements yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If I may just follow up on that Mr Callard 
please have regard to your Annexure 82 which is the Ministerial 
approval and you stated that the bids had closed by 30 t h April 2013. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CA LLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If you have regard to the opening paragraph 
of that letter the Minister states:  
 
“I refer to the PFMA section 54 application dated 2 n d May 2013 
 
regarding the acquisition of 1064 locomotives”,  
 
So when the RFP was iss ued the approval had not been sought 
at the time that the bids closed the approval still had not been sought 
20 
as per that letter that approval is only sought on the 2 n d of May. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I believe that was the point I 
made when I said that the bids – the first RFP was issued on 16 July 
2012 that was per my item 157.1 yes that attest to that point.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay you conclude on this point to 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 143 of 247 
 
say…(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     My conclusion on this. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Is that if the use of Transnet 
Engineering was to be prescribed then the detail should have been 
provided timeously before the closing date of the tender or the tender 
should have been re-issued. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes and then you lead on to your next sub -
heading which is the use of the prescription of TSM it is a mechanism 
to adjust the price for evaluation.  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Correct.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Can you take us through that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Certainly, may we please have 
ready Annexure – we will be referring to Annexures 83, 84, these are 
two reports 10 December reports 2012 from the CFET Finance that is 
the Cross-Functional Evaluation Team Finance and covers t he use of 
the main sub-contractor in detail and its Annexure 84/84.  I – if we 
could go please to Annexures 83/84 pages 651 and 691 respectively.  
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry what pages?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Page 651 – 651 is Annexure 83, 
20 
may I just then first take you to page 640.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Before we get into the detail of that, just so 
that we find where we are, is it correct that Annexure 83 is a report of 
the Cross-Functional Evaluation Team Finance in respect of the electric 
locomotives? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 144 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct, as it states on page 
640. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes and Annexure 84 is the same report 
except in respect of the diesel locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, then please proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Thank you, if we then turn to the 
relevant pages of 651 of 83. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And at the same time have 
10 
available 691 of 84. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Both of those have headings, 
“using TE as a main sub-contractor” and I would quote from this - and I 
quote from this under my paragraph 167 – sorry under paragraph 161.1 
under the heading “using TE as a main sub -contractor” it states, inter 
alia that, 
 
“The RFP part2 dictates as follows, participation of TRE in 
 
this locomotive procurement process will be prescribed”  
 
That is in the first bullet point on 651 and the first bullet point 
20 
of 691. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     This statement was not qualified 
and under the same heading of “using TE as a main sub -contractor” on 
page 
12 
it 
reads 
– 
and 
this 
holds 
for 
both 
diesel 
and 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 145 of 247 
 
electric…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And the page 12, sorry if I may, is a 
numbered page 12 but on the pagination is 651.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Sorry number page 12 but it is 
still on 651 and 691 it is – and I’m quoting there from the second bullet 
on those pages, 
 
“SCS which we should read Supply Chain Services in 
conjunction with TFR CE and Transnet GCE, reading Group Chief 
Executive and GCFO, Group Chief Financial Officer, decided that clarity 
should only be obtained from those bidders…(intervention).  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   I’m sorry Mr Callard I’m looking at the sec ond 
bullet point at 651 am I looking at the right place?   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I’m sorry – my apologies chair 
it’s the third bullet my apologies.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes we found the third bullet yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes you can continue, thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And I repeat from there SCS in 
conjunction PFR CE and Transnet GCE and GCFO decided that clarity 
should only be obtained from those bidders who included the TE as the 
20 
Main sub-contractor.  The clarity request was to establish what 
proportion of the bidders price related to the use TE.  I move on to the 
next bullet, 
 
“Accordingly the methodology provided to CFET Finance was 
 
that all bidders should be evaluated excluding the use of TE as 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 146 of 247 
 
 
the main sub-contractor in order to normalise the base on 
 
which to evaluate price”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Before you comment on these, on the bullet 
points you’ve read into the record, can I get an understanding here 
reads, 
 
“Accordingly the methodology provided to CFET Finance”, 
 
Do you see that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Do we know who provided that 
methodology? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    I – in answer to that I would go to 
168.2.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Where I say from the wording of 
the report it is reasonable to conclude that CFET Finance were directed 
in the pricing methodology, who directed this pricing would reasonably 
only come – would reasonably come from Supply Chain Servic es in 
TFR, Transnet Freight Rail.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So in response to my question definitive 
answer can only be obtained from Supply Chain?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     From Supply Chain Services and 
the head of Supply Chain Services.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you, you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you, I’d just like to cover 
point 168 that in both the reports referred to above under heading of, 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 147 of 247 
 
matters of approval of the Steering Committee, the CFET Finance 
request, inter alia “came from the report”.  The approval of the price 
methodology provided to the CFET Finance for evaluation purposes to 
include the impact of price. My interpretation of this is that the CFET 
Finance team said, we understand this directive you’ve given  to us, but 
it should be taken as a matter for approval to the Locomotive Steering 
Committee.  I have deleted the paragraph 168.1, I subsequently found 
that there was an approval for this.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     An approval? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     There was an approval. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :    My understanding, there was an 
approval.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And approval, just for completeness is by 
the Locomotive Steering Committee?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     No the approval I pick up was 
from the Board Acquisitions and Development Committee in it’s meeting 
on – in February 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:     That’s the Board Acquisitions and Disposal 
Committee? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:     I think you said Development. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Development, my apologies.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If you turn to page 665 and I’m doing this 
because I’d like to have an appreciation of what the process is, at 665 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 148 of 247 
 
item 4 – no before that the heading  says, “matters for approval of the 
Steering Committee’, the CFET Finance requests as part of this 
evaluation and based on the contents of the report  above then I go to 
4, approval of the price methodology provided to the CFET Finance for 
evaluation purposes to exclude the impact of TE on price.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So this was a request from CFET Finance to 
the Steering Committee. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Correct.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     My question is, do we k now whether the 
10 
approval by the Steering Committee was obtained?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I do not know, I have not found 
it, I do not know. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    All you know is that the Board approved it.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I have traced documentation that 
there was a BADC approval. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And would you know how it – the matter 
came to be before BADC?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There Was a memorandum to 
BADC outlining all the increase in anticipated price of the tran saction 
20 
and it, if I recall correctly, it was included in that because that is how 
BADC came to approve it.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   In that context okay thank you.  Then you 
express your view at …(intervention).   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I express my view in 168.3 that I 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 149 of 247 
 
believe this direction to the CFET was wrong as according to my 
reasoning the role of TE was not prescribed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes now overleaf you seek to then 
demonstrate to us how this TE pricing methodology was actually 
applied to the bids. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Before that what would you say were the 
implications of TE not being prescribed, in particular the practical 
implications, if any in this whole project?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     If TE were not to be prescribed 
10 
there are a number of facilities in South Africa or bodies which could 
provide complete locomotives.  If I may use an example Mitsui could 
assemble and provide a complete locomotive without using TE other 
locomotive suppliers like General Electric, if I may use them, were 
providing Transnet Freight Rail with locomotives but they were using TE 
as a sub-contractor.  They could have used alternative sub -contractors 
as part of their final assembly and commissioning work.  I refe r back  to 
the discussions which we had with the – as a team with Mr Singh when 
we were debating on whether the role of TE or not should be included 
in the process documents or not we held that, if I may recall that we 
20 
held we should be neutral on that.  I f the role of TE was to be 
prescribed, then it would have a implication on the OM’s as to directing 
them to only use one sub -contractor and that would be Transnet Rail 
Engineering and they would not be able to use facilities and/or 
organisations of their c hoice they would be obliged to use Transnet Rail 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 150 of 247 
 
Engineering if it was prescribed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The use of an alternative to TE could it push the 
costs up or not, the use of an alternative or not, in other words not 
using TE? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     It could push the costs up Mr 
Chairman but I think as we’ll be seeing from here it would have led to a 
reduction in costs if Transnet Engineering were not used.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay so at a practical level the fact that TE may 
not have been prescribed wouldn’t have any adverse effects for the 
project as such if the entities could use alternatives?  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     I submit that if the entities could use 
alternatives we could have procured the locomotives at a lesser price 
than by using TE as a main sub-contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now before we apply this TE pricing 
methodology, let’s just take a step back to the RFP’s in respect of 
electric – let’s deal with electric locomotives, how many bidders 
submitted bids? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I have highlighted, there were 7 
bidders for the electric locomotives.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now did all bidders cater for the inclusion 
of TE as the sub-contractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    No not all of them.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So some included TE and some did not?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Some included TE and some did 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 151 of 247 
 
not, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Do you know why that difference, why some 
did not include TE? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I cannot talk to that definitely 
but bidder 7, that was Mitsui had a fully -fledged manufacturing facility 
they did not need TE to deliver a locomotive and I read, I interpret that 
they were comfortable with their own facilities.  Other bidders did not 
have access to manufacturing facilities and said – approached Transnet 
Rail Engineering to see if they could build a locomotive or assemble the 
locomotives for them. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Now the material facilities you speak of are 
they facilities in South Africa? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes they are. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Not in Japan? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Not in Japan no, they are 
facilities in South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:     The fact that some bidders included TE as a sub -
contractor, others didn’t does it not point to the possible correctness of 
the view you express at 168.3, namely that TE was not prescribed 
because if they were not prescribed they would have felt that they were 
20 
not obliged to include TE as a sub-contractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I relate that to my earlier 
opening analogy Mr Chair which said TE would be prescribed, details to 
follow, the details did not follow by the time the bids closed am I 
prescribed to you as TE? You invited me to the meeting but you haven’ t 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 152 of 247 
 
told me the date and time therefore I do not feel prescribed to use TE, I 
equated to that analogy. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you Chair.  Okay then let’s turn to 
the application of this TE pricing methodology to the bids.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Right I’d like to first address the 
599 electric locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 12 of Annexure 83 described 
how Freight Rail Supply Chain Services normalised the bid price 
10 
between those who used TE as a sub-contractor and those who did not 
use TE as a sub-contractor.  Could I direct us then please to Annexure 
83 page 12 which is 651 in the bundle.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you referring us to …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:  Page – to 651. 
CHAIRPERSON:  651? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I did not close that page so I thought you 
were referring us to another one.  Okay.   
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  If I may I will take it first through 
as I have it in the statement of my statement 169.2.  This normalisation 
resulted in three bidders who used TE as a sub -contractor being asked 
to specify without apparent qualification the amount they would save by 
not using TE as a main sub-contractor. That is directed to bullet point 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 153 of 247 
 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – the 5 t h bullet point which reads on page 651.  
“Based on this decision clarity responses were only 
issued to bidder 1, 2 and 5 those bidders who 
indicated the – that should read those bidders who 
indicated the use of TE as a sub-contractor what 
would be their impact of not using TE as a sub -
contractor?” 
MS THABILE FUHRMANN :  Before you proceed may I refer to the 4 t h 
bullet 
point and 
that 
is 
for 
purposes 
of 
understanding 
what 
normalisation – normalising the bid price me ans?  The fourth bullet 
10 
point states that the – accordingly the methodology provided to CRET 
Finance was that all bidders should be evaluated excluding the use of 
TE as a main sub-contractor in order to normalise the base on which to 
evaluate the price. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  The implications of that 
being in mind the understanding that follows from this is if you did not 
use Transnet Engineering as a sub-contractor what would your price 
have been?  And we are going to evaluate on what your price would 
20 
have been if you did not use Transnet Engineering as a sub -contractor. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And so then the – your 5 t h bullet point follow 
up that based on this decision clarity  responses were only issued to 
bidder 1, 2 and 5? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 154 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Those bidders who indicated the use of TE as 
a sub-contractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4,6 7 did no? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to remind me going back to the Minister’s 
approval by the way did he say TE must be used as a  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sub-contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sub-contractor? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it did not? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It did not specifically say that and 
if I may just go back to that for absolute clarity Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And was the reason for including 
this.  The PFMA – I am reading back from my 164.  
“The PFMA approval letter talks to the critical role of 
Transnet 
Engineering 
in 
developing 
strategic 
individual capabilities relevant to the Supply Chain 
20 
and it gave inter alia the following condition:  
A clear statement by Transnet with regard to TE’s 
vision in the locomotive supply chain and what 
capabilities will be needed to make this vision a 
reality.  The PFMA approval which I state does not 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 155 of 247 
 
prescribe that TE will be a sub-contractor.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It actually specifically said that is not being 
prescribed.  TE is not being prescribed as a sub -contractor. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It asks for a lot of deal around it 
but it did not prescribe TE as a sub-contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  So - so what was being done now 
when the bidders were being asked to say what their price would be if 
TE was not a sub-contractor was this being done in the light of the 
Ministerial approval not including a prescribed – that TE be prescribed? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not be sure?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will jump to the conclusion Mr …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  But I believe that this process was 
flawed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And because of this process by 
20 
asking selected bidders who would use TE  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To quote without qualification  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What will be your price if you did 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 156 of 247 
 
not use TE  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
FRANCIS 
QUENTIN 
CALLARD : 
 Artificially influenced 
the 
evaluation of the bid price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is where this is leading to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Yes you – we were dealing 
with a – with page 651 your annexure 83 having dealt with bullet points 
4 and 5. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  If I may come – revert 
back then to my statement of 169.2 my paragraph 169.2.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And repeat again.  This 
normalisation resulted in three bidders who used TE as a sub -
contractor being asked to specify.  Without apparent qualification  the 
amount would save by not using TE as a major sub -contractor. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 13 of that same report and 
that is Annexure – page 652. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Describes confusion r elating to 
bidder 2 that is CSR using TE and whether the amount was – where the 
amount they would save was R3.48 million or 5.490 million.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 157 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  To clear up this confusion page 13 
further describes a telephon ic conversation with bidder 2 on the 
evening of the 4 December 2013.  Which resulted in a 2.01 million 
difference that is the difference between 5.490 million and 3.480 million 
being declared a discount.  That 2 million was declared a discount.  
Supply Chain Services then based on discussions with the Group Chief 
Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer advised the CFET team 
that the evaluation should proceed excluding this potential discount.  I 
will show later and take later that this discount was later taken back 
and in fact included in the evaluation and later – it was later included 
10 
in a price evaluation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But I would for the moment then go 
to page 13 – sorry my 169.6 page 13 states that the  impact of excluding 
TE from the normalised base pricing as follows:  And we will see there 
that bidder 1 that was Bombardier was afforded a …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Callard let us be consistent with the page 
numbers. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you using the report page numbers.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or [indistinct] paginated one?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The report page number – sorry my 
statement page number 44 I am referring to the  table there which is the 
same table is at the bottom of page 652 I have extracted the same 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 158 of 247 
 
table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What this table shows is that 
bidder 1’s was now favoura bly influenced by 1.9 million rounded figures 
and bidder 2’s CSR by 3.48 million in the price evaluation process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So are we then to understand that to the 
request that they exclude the cost for using TE as a sub -contractor.  
Bombardier indicated that their price would drop by 1.9 billion.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And CSR indicated the price would drop by 
3.4 billion. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If they did not use TE as a sub-
contractor. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If they did not use TE. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now insofar as CR is concerned if you go 
back to your 169.4 no 169.3 and 169.4.  The table you refer asked you 
at page 43 for CSR indicates a reduction of 3.4 billion.  Where  does the 
figure of 5.4 billion as a potential amount to deduct come from?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I refer that 5.490 million comes 
from 652. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It comes from the 3 r d bullet point. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 159 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry the 2 n d bullet point the 3 r d 
paragraph and if I read from that – sorry may I backtrack – may I 
backtrack?  It is the last bullet point on page 651.  The last bullet point 
on page 651.   
“Bidder 2 provided the requir ed information however 
we noted that their new submitted bid prices 
excluding TE as a sub-contractor did not reconcile to 
their original bid price.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   
10 
“The 
difference 
noted 
was 
2.01 
million 
per 
locomotive.  This posed a potential risk to the 
evaluation of the price and the CEFT Finance 
subsequently consulted with Supply Chain so this – 
to explain their concern as the impact of this 
difference was significant in relation to the final 
scoring on price.” 
The next bullet describes how they resolved this that they engaged with 
a telephone call with bidder 2 on the evening of the 4 December 2013.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The second bullet and the third 
paragraph then indicates that bidder 2 indicated that the difference 
related to a discount offered on their original price.  It was then 
explained and I paraphrase that this was not where clarity had been 
sought.  Subsequent to the telephone phonic conversation bidder 2 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 160 of 247 
 
submitted a new clarity.  It was noted however that this clarity seemed 
to have reflected the discount in the TE portion of the new bid price.  
This indicates confusion as to this process.  Bidder 2 originally 
submitted a reduction in bid price to the TE portion of 3.4 mi llion per 
locomotive and a subsequent submission from them indicated to be 
5.490 million per locomotive.  I take to the next bullet.  CFET Finance 
then further engaged Supply Chain Services to provide guidance on 
their [indistinct] as we were unable to det ermine the appropriate rate 
forward.  The main concern from the CFET Finance was the uncertainty 
of whether or not bidder 2 may have subsequently have included this 
10 
discount portion of 2 million in their price thereby having the potential 
impact of a fairly prejudice thing other bidders in the evaluation 
process.  The next paragraph deals with how they evaluated it.  CFET 
Finance was advised by Supply Chain Services that based on 
discussions with the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief 
Financial Officer that the evaluation should proceed on the basis 
excluding this potential discount and as such the CFET Finance utilised 
reduction price of 3.480 for the evaluation.  That is where the 5.9 
comes and I think what this does demonstrate is there is signific ant 
confusion in the interpretation of what does – is meant by an impact of 
20 
a TE price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And as we have seen and the 
CFET Finance team correctly point out the potential impact this could 
have on the price evaluation.   
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 161 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The CFET team then completed 
their analysis and the result of that is the table which we have at the 
bottom of page 652 and the bottom of my – and at the top of my 
statement page 44. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Those two tables are one and the 
same and it shows the price impact that they were taken out or that was 
brought into consideration. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To show what this means sorry… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry before you move on you will recall that 
from your Annexure 83 at page 651 we read that based on the decision 
to seek clarity so as to normalise the base on which to evaluate price 
the responses were only – were sought only from bidder 1, 2 and 5.  At 
your page 44 that table…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You indicate a sum provided by bidder 1, 
bidder 2 and under 5 you have zero.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Under bidder 5 I have zero yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Why – was there no response from bidder 5 or 
what was the position? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No the point was made that if I 
may take you through there to page 651.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 162 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The second last bullet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The sub bullet point? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The sub bullet point.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Bidder 5 provided the required 
information and indicated there would be no impact on the bid price per 
locomotive if TE was not used as a sub-contractor. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In fact what he is saying no 
change. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So bidder 1 is Bombardier, bidder 2 is CSR.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CSR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And remind us please bidder 5 is?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay we will track it down. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We will track it down I think. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But we know that there is no change whether 
or not they used TE? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then you may proceed thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  If I may then take us to how this 
20 
was used and I deal with this in page 44 my paragraph 169.7.1.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The TE component subtracted by – 
sorry correction, correction.  May I go to 169.7 page 40 of the CFET 
Report and page 40 is page 769. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 163 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  679. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  679. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of the pack. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair and Mr Callard at paragraph 12 of your 
supplementary statement you state that you introduce a legible copy of 
that page Chair and it is in the supplementary bundle marked just as 
Annexure 83 page 679A.  And that would Chair  appear at page 23 of 
that supplementary.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Got it.  So that is a clearer copy.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is a clearer copy of 679. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of Annex – 679 of Annexure 83. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Now reading from 
20 
page 23 of the supplementary and this is Annexure headed A nnexure E 
reconciliation of price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Amongst other things it details the 
whole makeup of a locomotive price and impacts of a – some hedging 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 164 of 247 
 
and escalation which were put in but the point I would like to t ake us 
through please is to the third line from the bottom subtotal 3 total price 
of 4TE adjustment. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is third line from the bottom.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Third line from the bottom. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In bold right? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Third line from the bottom yes.  
Subtotal 3 total price before TE adjustment and that is in bold.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay we have located it. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have the – if we have that line 
10 
the next line says the impact of not using TE as the main sub -
contractor.  And we will see there that bidder 1 now has an advantage 
in its price evaluation of 1.9 million per locomotive where it is 
subtracted from the figure above. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think you have lost me. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am sorry Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you on the supplementary affidavit?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Supplementary affidavit the left 
hand column bidder 1. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 23 that legible copy Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you started from the bottom and you say 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 165 of 247 
 
we should look at the bottom of that table third row from the bottom.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Subtotal 3 total price before TE adjustments.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then you can take it from there please.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we look at the first column 
bidder 1 it is 34.7 million rounded.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We then have the next line which 
reads the impact of not using TE as the main sub -contractor. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And in there we now  have minus 
1.9 million rounded.  We then have a line which is called price used for 
evaluation which is now 32.8 million rounded.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that price – that price for impact for not 
using TE is subtracted from the original bid price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To get a new price. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Evaluation.  Okay. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  A similar process follows in column 
2  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is for CSR now? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Just for CSR.  With a total price 
before TE adjustment is 38 million rounded.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 166 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Subtract 3.48 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Giving a new price of 34.7 million 
rounded.  The important part I wish to highlight here is that this is now 
a price used for evaluation and it will seem to be carried forward in 
subsequent documents and conveyed further into the organisation 
which I use this to illustrate the point which I make on 169.8 my 
statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Still on page 40 comparing lines 
subtotal 3 total price before TE adjustment with price used for 
evaluation shows how the impact of not using TE as a main sub-
contractor favours bidder 1 Bombardier and 2 CSR as these prices are 
taken forward and as stated here prices used for evaluation.  I take this 
forward to my earlier point where I argued that TE was not a prescribed 
sub-contractor and I contend tha t it was therefore incorrect and flawed 
to bring TE in for evaluation processes when they were not as a band 
retriever as to bring TE in for evaluation when they were not a 
prescribed sub-contractor. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said earlier on that it was on ly some and 
all the bidders who were asked to revise their bids and to indicate what 
their pricing would be if they did not use TE as a sub -contractor, is that 
right? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 167 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So not all – not all of them – not all the bidders 
had said they would use TE as a sub-contractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if 3 had put in their pricing on the basis of using 
TE as a sub-contractor are you suggesting that maybe only two instead 
of three were asked to revise or are you – when you say not all or some 
or are you simply saying all those that had used TE as – had included 
TE as a sub-contractor were asked to revise?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  On the Elec – on the electric 
locomotives those who indicated that they had used TE as a sub -
10 
contractor were asked to revise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without exception all of them those?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Without exception on the electric 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The nett result to that if I may call 
it bidder 5 said whether we use TE or do not use TE no change.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidders 1 and 2 said if we do not 
have to use TE we can reduce our prices as I have indicated here.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The impact of that on bidders 3,5 
and 7 if I may take you please to the supplementary 23 again.  Total 
price before impact of TE adjustment and we go down to the price used 
for evaluation there is no change for bidders 3, 5 and 7 in the price 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 168 of 247 
 
used for evaluation.  Whereas for bidders 1 and 2 may I repeat?  There 
is a significant change in the price used for evaluation because of this 
impact that they have said – because the impact of using TE as a sub -
contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would – you accept – do you accept that 
where out of for argument sake 6 bidders 3 had prepared their bids on 
the basis of using TE as a contractor – as a sub-contractor whereas the 
other three had not used TE as a sub-contractor.  If all the three who 
had used TE as a sub-contractor in preparing their bid – their bids if all 
those three were asked to revise their bids on the basis that they were 
10 
not going to use TE then after they had revised their prices based on 
that that on its own did not result in any unfairness to any of the – to 
the bidders who had not used TE as a sub -contractor in preparing their 
bids. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I make the point [indistinct] Chair 
that and I hold I do not know whether it would have made a difference 
or not.  I cannot say whether it would have made a difference or not.  
The point I wish to highlight that it was an incorrect principle that was 
being used for price evaluation.  Whether it may or may not have made 
a difference is a point I think for furthe r evaluation and examination in 
20 
terms of all the criteria.  I think from a first point glance at the pricing I 
could take and I refer to page 23 of the supplementary that bidder 7’s 
remained the same 33.6 million to 33.7 million remained at 33.7.  
Bidder 8 – sorry bidder 2 which before the adjustment was at 38.2 
million rounded taking that adjustment now comes down to 34.7 and 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 169 of 247 
 
bidder 1 comes from 34.7 after that adjustment to 32 making it the 
lowest so in the price evaluation – price used for evaluation it brings 
them below other bidders who did not use TE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well I may be missing something.  I am just trying 
to understand because it seems to me on the face of it that the request 
to in my example to you to the three who had previously used TE  as a 
sub-contractor in giving their prices the request that they should revise 
their bids or prices and put in prices based on not using TE as a sub -
contractor it seems to me on the face of it that it is something that it 
seeking to put all of them on the same level.  All the six in my example 
10 
– all the six bidders because the – what has happened is bidders have 
put in their bids on different understanding.  Some have put it on the 
basis of using TE as a sub-contractor others have put in their bids on 
the basis of not using TE and that means it seems or to me on the face 
of it that it means these bidders are not competing on the same basis 
because there is this situation that the ones have included TE as a sub -
contractor because maybe they understood that i t is prescribed but I 
remember your example about come to the meeting without telling you 
the date.  But they have included it but others have taken the view that 
look because we were not given the details it means we can regard TE 
20 
as not prescribed therefore we will use other sub-contractors or 
alternatives.  So I am trying to get whether there is a point you seek to 
make where – with regard to the fact that prices were revised by those 
that had used TE as a sub-contractor in terms of pricing.  And I want to 
understand that point if there is a point you seek to make?  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 170 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There is a point Mr Chair.  It is not 
that the prices were revised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You are absolutely correct that 
they sought to normalise the prices by excluding TE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The point I make is because TE 
was not a prescribed sub-contractor in the bid process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To normalise it on this basis of not 
10 
using TE was a flawed process because the evaluation is now done on 
a price difference between using TE and not using TE.  As I said…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is before – that is before the revision of the 
prices in regard to those who had – who had they would use TE?  I 
understand the last point that you have made I understand it insofar as 
you are applied to the situation before some are requested to revise 
their prices.  I understand it there.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But to the extent that you may be meaning to apply it 
to even after that is where – after they have revised their pricing that is 
20 
where I am trying to get clarity. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair with your permission if I may?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I pose a couple of questions. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 171 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To Mr Callard perhaps it might assist in us 
[indistinct] question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might help ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let us go back to the bid documentation Mr 
Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To the best of your knowledge was the use of 
TE as a sub-contractor provided for directly as a line item with a 
specific cost to it by the bidders?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the bid just indicated that it has taken into 
consideration using TE as a sub-contractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The bids are in fact silent on that 
as a line item.  In addition in a documentation that accompanies the bid 
they indicate whether they would or would not have used TE as a 
subcontractor. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when the request is made to indicate the 
20 
impact of not using TE as a subcontractor Transnet does not know wh at 
percentage of the total price to expect to be deducted because it was 
not stated up front what that cost is?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And my second question then is Bombadier 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 172 of 247 
 
said it would reduce their price by 1.9 millio n.  CSR said it would 
reduce their price by 3.4 million.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were those to figures verifiable independently 
by Transnet?  Could Transnet determine that if CSR does not use TE I 
see how their price will reduce to 3.4 million – by 3.4 million? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Those prices were to the best of 
my knowledge not verifiable.  It is – it was almost the same as I have a 
quote from A, I have a quote from B.  Tell me the difference between 
quote A and B but I ask that – I give you an answer but you do not 
10 
verify that by going to A and/or B to verify that.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So I could have given you any 
figure as a difference between price A and B.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Transnet did not have the actual quote 
from – from TE to Bombadier if ever there was one or to CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What TE says it would charge for being a 
subcontractor on this acquisition?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They certainly should not have had 
20 
that because in that – they should not have had that – no they should 
not have had that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So are you suggesting then to the Chair that 
those figures provided by CSR and Bombadier respectively – for lack of 
a better description – are arbitrarily? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 173 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is – they are arbitrary and 
unverifiable.  I know of no way which they could be verified.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And yet they are applied to the bid price to 
reduce that price …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For evaluation purposes?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that – that then gained CSR in this 
instance which has got the biggest reduction of 3.4 a significant 
advantage.  Whereas it was higher than bidder seven when it 
10 
introduces what it says is a DE impact cost it reduces to almost – not 
below – but same level as bidder seven who was by then the cheapest 
bidder? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now the question is in that process is there a 
particular advantage that is then suffered by bidder seven?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well significantly – there is 
definitely a disadvantage suffered by bidder seven and all the other 
bidders in that basis because  the price – and I take it to the bottom line 
– the price used for evaluation they are then evaluated – bidder seven 
20 
who did not use TE is evaluated against another bidder who used TE 
with this arbitrary discount and who may then come into a lower price.  
So if I am evaluating on price and then I would choose and I am 
choosing the lower price and it has a percentage waging into the final 
evaluation.  I would be advantaged by the fact of my lower price that is 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 174 of 247 
 
used for evaluation.  So the point I am making h ere I am advantaged by 
this lower price because of whatever arbitrary non -verifiable – to the 
best of my knowledge – non-verifiable deduction that I have planned 
through the use of TE.  If the deduction had been verifiable and/or 
quantifiable in other terms here it might have been a different story but 
it is an unverifiable, unquantifiable and TE was not prescribed as the 
use of a subcontractor.  So the point I am really – I wish to make here 
is that we are evaluating the price using a condition which was n ot in 
the bid documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the end the evaluation is not – is not made on 
10 
the basis of a factor that was not supposed to be taken into account.  
The factor that was not supposed to be taken into account is what 
happens if you – was you must use TE as a subcontractor - as I 
understand your evidence.  The – the – Transnet was not supposed to 
make an evaluation made on the basis that a bidder was obliged to use 
TE as a subcontractor, okay?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now some put in bids which included that – TE as a 
subcontractor? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Others did not include TE as a subcontractor?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now how would – how do you rectify this?  Le t us 
suppose that you realise at Transnet that a mistake was done because 
information was sent to bidders which suggested maybe that TE should 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 175 of 247 
 
be taking into account or would be used there but just more information 
was not sent or you just realise that due  to maybe some mistake on the 
part of Transnet and one or another some bidders may have been 
misled into thinking they have to use TE as a subcontractor.  You want 
to rectify this.  See it seems to be the easiest thing to do to say maybe 
rather than start the whole thing afresh let us say this factor which they 
should not have put in should not be put in and let us then evaluate  
everybody on the basis of not using TE as a subcontractor.  Of course 
when they take TE – the TE factor out they might put an alternative and 
then revise their price on that basis.  Now on the face of it that does 
10 
not appear to me to be something unfair but it may be that it is.  I am 
just not seeing the point you – you are making. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Could I perhaps try th e flipside of 
the coin Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The basis for evaluation of the 
bids … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Should be for a purpose or 
transparency and fairness. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Should be clearly stated in the bid 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That we all know the level playing 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 176 of 247 
 
field … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We are playing on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If the bid documents stated that 
the role of TE will be prescribed and that documentation be in you will 
use TE for assembly of the locomotives.  Let me use that as a simple 
example – for the assembly of the locomotives.  Then everybody would 
know that and everybody would include a price from TE for that.  What I 
am putting forward here is that that condition was not in the bid 
10 
documents – because it is not in the bid documents it is unreasonable 
to put that condition in after the bids have close d, after the tenders 
have submitted their conditions and evaluate them on that bid without 
telling all the bidders that this going to be how they are going to be 
evaluated.  We find no correspondence to say that this is how the 
bidders are going to be evaluated.  So the evaluation process which 
was set out in the bid documents of what the tenderers had to comply 
to – sorry – they are evaluating the bidders on conditions different to 
that which was in the bid documents and that is the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will move on just now so that we are not 
20 
detained on this issue.  You advertise a position for a job and you say a 
Bachelor’s Degree is required – is an essential …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say well if you have got an Hono urs Degree 
or even a Masters that will be a recommendation but it is not essential 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 177 of 247 
 
… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But actually the idea was from whoever your 
superiors were we will evaluate on the basis of a Bachelor’s Degree 
only.  If you have seen anything higher we will not give it any points, 
okay.  So you – you realise that now okay that is the position people 
have applied but they are under the impression that if they have 
something more than a Bachelor ’s Degree that will count – that may 
count for something.  So you then say well maybe there was a mistake.  
We just want to tell everybody that actually we will not take into 
10 
account anything above a Bachelor’s Degree.  Then you make sure 
everybody then knows that.  If they are hap py to continue and the – 
their candidacy is evaluated on the basis of a Bachelor’s Degree only it 
does not appear to me that there is unfairness on those who had only a 
Bachelor’s Degree that those who have something higher that is not 
taken into account anymore.  It just seems that it is then fine because 
you.  You make sure that they know this will not be taken into account 
anything higher because if you do not tell them and you evaluate hem 
on the basis of a Bachelor’s Degree only they – they will be entitled to 
say but you told us it would be a recommendation if I have got an 
20 
Honours Degree and now you did not give me any points for my 
Honours and my Masters. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I – using those example 
Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 178 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And just turning it the way around.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We advertised the position saying 
for Bachelor ’s Degree and saying Masters and Honours are a 
recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But in the – so we get some 
applications which have Bachelor’s Degree …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And some applications which have 
10 
Honours and Masters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In the evaluation process …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We change our mind and we say 
we are only going to evaluate if you have an Honours or Masters …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And we are not going to tell those 
who have a Bachelor’s Degree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that I understand.  I see …  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me how – how that applies here because that – 
that is – just tell me how that applies to this situation.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In the first – well – we advertise a 
bid … 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 179 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It does not say – it does not 
prescribe the use of TE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I tried to demonstrate.  It does not 
prescribe the use of TE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We then come to evaluate the bids 
and we say and we are now evaluating the bids on the basis that they 
should have used TE which is what when we come to this – this price 
10 
used for evaluation.  We are using evaluating them on the b asis that 
they should have used TE.  We do not tell everybody else that this is 
the revised basis of evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe I have misunderstood something.  I 
thought that after somewhere those who had used TE – who had 
factored in TE for the – for – in their bids and they were asked to revise 
their bids in – on the basis of not using TE.  I thought that - that meant 
that the evaluation would have no place for TE in the sense that the 
fact that you used TE or not use TE or rather that everyb ody would be 
evaluated on the basis of not using TE.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is – that is the subtlety of 
this.  They do bring that in as everybody is evaluated on the basis of 
not using TE.  Their point – impact of not using TE as a subcontracto r.  
The difficulty in this is that when I was asked how – by how much would 
my price reduce if I did not use TE and said I could use an arbitrary 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 180 of 247 
 
figure to give to you for your evaluation.  Here is no way I will be 
evaluating this 3.48 million or 1.905 and  … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see the arbitrariness of the figure is a 
different point as I see. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think let us – let us move on.  It is okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay Chair.  I am happy to move on.  Perhaps 
somehow we will get back to this point in a different manner.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I hope it will come up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes because we are now at evaluation stage.  
10 
We know Bombadier and CSR intend to use TE.  The question 
Mr Callard I will pose is that figure of 3.4 million representing impact of 
using TE by CSR. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Does it make its – its way in any form or 
shape back to the price of the locomotive when we progress?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, it does.  In the later part at 
the end of the negotiations we will see that that 3.4 million is added 
back into the price.  So …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we are getting back to the actual price 
20 
now? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We are getting back to  the actual 
price paid for the locomotive.  It is taken out of here for the evaluation.  
It is later added back into the actual price of the locomotive.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 181 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No at that point that I can understand.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja that I would understand.  This other one would 
need more consideration. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair.  I think and you will correct me 
if I misunderstood.  At this point of evaluation when the one bidder 
takes off 3.4 million and  drops significantly they will score higher in 
their scores on price and that is the advantage they gain and that 
amount they have removed as TE impact and they are successful they 
go forward then finds its way back to the price.  So they actually came 
10 
in at a higher price than the lowest bidder but somehow they ended up 
being the successful bidder.  That – that is the system that is at play 
here.  Remembering Chair that bidder five did say I will – I have taken 
into consideration the possibility of using T E but whether with T – with 
using TE or any other subcontractor my price remains the same.  So it 
may very well be and we will see as the evidence becomes – more 
evidence becomes available whether the proper interpretation of RFP2 
was that you may choose to use a subcontractor and in so doing you 
may choose to use TE.  If that is your choice the – what it costs you to 
use TE as a subcontractor ought to be a responsibility you take onto 
20 
yourself.  So when you come in at a price of 38 – 3.8 – 38 million 
including TE that is how you structured your bid.  To then be asked to 
take out TE presumes that there is an adverse impact on your price 
with the use of TE and perhaps that is not a debate to be had with this 
witness.  Those who propagated for a consideration of a price without 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 182 of 247 
 
the TE subcontractor might explain to us the logic behind the thinking 
because I think currently we are – we are struggling with that approach.  
All we know is that it – it appears to positively benefit some bidders 
and it adversely impacts those who did not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I will listen more and …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will (indistinct) for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand the one where they bring it back the 
unfairness much better than the one  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Than this one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where they take it out, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let us see if it improves Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Put it back. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As we go along.  Thank you.  So you – you 
deal from paragraph 170 with th e – an exercise undertaken in respect 
of the diesel locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is more or less the same?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is more or less the same.  It is 
20 
more or less the same. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You however in your supplementary statement 
– you however in your supplementary statement at page 3 paragraph 14 
in respect of your paragraph 170 in your original statement – you 
introduce further documentation in light of the fact that the – the diesel 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 183 of 247 
 
evaluation followed the same process as in electric and there is no 
need to go through that detail.  I would like you to explain the 
relevance of introducing those documents to your paragraph 170 when 
dealing with the evaluation. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made are reference to the supplementary 
statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Supplementary statement page 3 Chair 
paragraph 14 and it indicates at paragraph 170 which is the paragraph 
we are dealing with in the main statement and at  paragraph 14 
10 
Mr Callard says he wishes to introduce three emails in respect of 
clarification letters relating to the impact of TE submitted by CNR in 
respect of diesel. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may take that and it is in 
respect of CSR Diesels. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  CSR Diesels, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CSR Diesels, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CSR also bid for diesel. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then let us look at our paragraph 14.  We say 
20 
submitted by CNR.  Must we correct something at page 3?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Paragraph 14 – sorry.  My 
apologies for that slip up.  That should read definitely CSR.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That should read CSR. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 184 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will correct that accordingly, thank you 
and then that series of documents starts from supplementary page 26?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly, thank you.  If I – it starts 
on 26. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  27. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may go to 27 please. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  27 and if would could look at the 
middle of that page.  It is an email from Ms  Mdletshe to CSR supplier 
426 - supplier 465 new diesel locomotives.  
10 
“Dear tenderer, please find attached for your 
information…” 
And that is on December, the 2 n d. 
CSR respond on 4 December with a clarification to TFR and this is in 
response to that letter. 
“Please give us the impact of your price for not 
using TE.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The attachment to Ms  Mdletshe’s email is 
– is it the one immediately after that email?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Immediately – this is the reply.  
20 
This is the reply received on 4  December at … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  11:57. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where – where is the attachment first? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Oh, her letter which we dealt …  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 185 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I did not attach that.  This is the 
important part was he reply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before I see a reply I need to know what went to – 
what is being responded to. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We can add to that.  We will have 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is not here? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you know what it said?  Are you able to say 
10 
what is said? 
MR FRANCISQUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  It was …  
CHAIRPERSON:  The gist of it. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The gist of it was the two tables on 
page 28 it asked them to complete the two tables on page 28.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On supplementary 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What would be the impact – what 
would be the Rand impact on your price per locomotive if you did not 
20 
use TE as a local subcontractor but used an alternative local private 
sector subcontractor? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And the second question was what 
would be your price per locomotive if you did not use TE as a local 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 186 of 247 
 
subcontractor but used an alternative local private subcontractor.  It 
was essentially those two questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the difference between the two questions?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  One – what – the first one was 
what would be the Rand impact on your price …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the difference would be somewhere towards 
the end of the question but I am not sure what it is. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – are the two questions not completely identical?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The one … 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The first question we are saying if 
you did not use TE what would be your – if you did not use TE how 
much would you save.  The answer to that …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Would be I would save R100,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The second question is well if you 
saved this R100,00 what is the new price of your locomotive.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the first one related to the overall price and the 
20 
second one related to the price for each locomotive.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The first one related – the first one 
related Mr Chair to how much more expensive TE is than a private 
subcontractor. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 187 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the first one relates to what we have been 
dealing with namely …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you – if you disregard the use of TE what would – 
what would be your price. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In effect. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The first one Chair if you disregard TE how 
10 
much should we deduct from your price.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but if you know what you – must be deducted then 
you know what the price would be.  Is it no?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja, then that is the second question.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So therefore … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The new price will be ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The second – in the second block. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the – what would be the Rand impact on your 
price.  Oh, the – the first one is also per locomotive?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your price per locomotive if you did not use to TE 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 188 of 247 
 
as a local contractor but use as an alternative local private sector.  
What would your price per locomotive be if you did not use TE as a 
local?  No, I am not sure.  I thought I was seeing what the difference is.  
I am not sure right now what it is.  Okay.  Let us – let us look at it 
again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Perhaps if we …  
CHAIRPERSON:  What would be the Rand …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Look at the first one – impact on your price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever – whatever impact – oh, the one wants an 
impact. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On your price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other one wants an actual price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The actual price now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But actually by using - if you answer the first one you 
can (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It becomes a mathematical …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Answer the second one …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
The 
second 
one 
should 
20 
automatically follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Automatically follow. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But they elected to pose the two questions.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 189 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And perhaps as we shall see it is not so 
obvious that if you remove the impact of the price you can 
automatically calculate the other as I think Mr  Callard will now 
demonstrate … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For us. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And the purpose of these three 
emails Mr Chair is if we look at 27 – page - supplementary page 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the top we see this first email 
comes in on Wednesday 4  December 2013 at 11:57.  That is the second 
print line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The top one, ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And we have this very formal letter 
all very complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So that top email at page 27 is the one that is 
accompanied by the letter at page 28?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It also has an additional comment 
which I cannot explain and that is in paragraph 4 and I read:  
“Despite 
the 
aforementioned 
and 
in 
specific 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 190 of 247 
 
response to your queries we provide hereunder an 
estimate of the information requested by you based 
on 
the revised 
figures 
furnished 
to 
you 
on 
29 November 2013.” 
I am not sure where that comes from at all.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is to – this is in respect – in respect 
of the bids that closed on 30  April 2013 or 2014? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2013? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may then – so we have letter 
one coming in at 11:57.  If we could go to supplementary 30 please.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 30? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 30. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Supplementary page 30. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry before we go there. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are still at 28. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That mathematical exercise the Chair asked.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You will notice that under point 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 191 of 247 
 
one there at paragraph 4 in their table one.  What would be the Rand 
impact of your price?  That is then given at 6.6 million rounded figures 
per locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which would be the Rand impact 
on their price.  This does not accord with any of the other figures we 
have seen and it is – it is a higher figure to reduce the price of your 
locomotive or go to give a Rand im pact. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So do we interpret that to mean it is 
suggested you take my bid price, you deduct 6.6 million and you arrive  
10 
at the price now of 32 million which is my bid without using TE?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That would be the …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the logic of …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The argument we have followed 
yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then you wanted us to go to 30.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 30. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Now this is from the – the same 
individual also addressed to Ms Mdletshe. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Also on 4 December but it is 
received a 18.21, that is twenty one past six in  the evening. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 192 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It comes in alter than the first. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Later than the first. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We will see that the top part of 
that email, in fact it’s just a follow on from th e first email because the 
first email we see there at 11:57 we see another email, which is not 
referenced here at 12.03, we don’t know the detail of that email, then 
we see this email of 18:21. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And exactly the same contents, 
10 
please find the attached, request a clarification letter for your urgent 
attention, exactly the same wording as the 11:57 email.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we refer then to the attached 
letter which is page 32 of the supplement we see exactly the same 
formal letter. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  We find no retraction of the 
original letter, no reference to the original letter, but just a brand new 
letter, but if we look at paragraph – their paragraph 4 and the bullet 
20 
points and the table one, table one still says Rand impact at 6.6million 
6.7million rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And now the price per locomotive 
at point two in the table has changed t o 29.4million rounded which is 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 193 of 247 
 
some change from the 32million, 32.9million of the previous letter.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we still deduct the same amount, that’s 6.6 
but in the first letter they say that then results in a new price of 
R32million, 32.9.  In the second letter they say removing the same 
amount this time it comes 29.3million.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we can’t say this is a continuation of what we saw 
with regard to what was happening within Tr ansnet in regard to the 
kinds of mistakes that we talked about when, you talked about when 
10 
you gave evidence about your memorandum where you were asked to 
make changes and what we talked about in the morning where this 
seems to be obvious contradictions of  things that should be quite clear 
but what is put is different, it’s the same thing but happening with CSR 
now what was happening with Transnet is happening with CSR now.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Well may I take you through the 
third letter Mr Chair and if we could bring address your point after the 
third letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  We then have a third email and 
20 
this is on page 34 of the supplementary.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Also the 4 t h of December on the 
second line, it’s now received at 19:44, the previous one was received 
at 18:21 we’re now at 19:44 so we’re about an hour and ten minutes, an 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 194 of 247 
 
hour twenty minutes later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And interesting if we look at the 
trace of emails we see an email at 6.21, that’s the – on page, 
supplementary 34.  We then see an email at 638 of which I have no 
detail at the moment in this, we then see this email of 1944 which 
reads: 
“Please find the attached once again  and apologies for the 
inconvenience.” 
So we now have a third letter and if we may go to that third letter 
10 
please, which is on supplementary 36.  Again refer to – and may I 
highlight a further significant difference Mr Chairman, if we look at 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Callard I know the Chair laughed but 
it must still go on the record. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please address yourself to page 36.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I’m addressing myself to page 36, 
paragraph 4, the above paragraph 4 notice that there has been a subtle 
change now in that whereas I previously highlighted 29 t h of November 
20 
2013, paragraph 4 now reads despite the aforementioned and in 
specific response to your queries we provide hereunder an estimate of 
the information requested by you based on the bidding figures 
furnished to you on 30 April 2013, which was when the bids closed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 195 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Changed from the 29 t h of 
November of the first letter, I wish to highlight that.  Then we come to 
point one in the table and the Rand impact figure now becomes 
1.5million rounded.  The price per locomotive is now 29.4million 
rounded.  Your first, your point you made before I came to this Mr 
Chairman is this the same, I submit that this illustrates the point you 
were making that ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean it’s quite strange, the questions under 4.1 the 
questions remain the same and they are responded to in a letter that 
save for the figures seem to be ide ntical save for the figures and 
10 
maybe some few words. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question in regard to the first one, the answer 
to the first question is that it’s six million, 6.6million rounded to the 
nearest figure, and then the seco nd figure, the answer to the second 
question is 32.9million rounded and then you go to the next, that was at 
28, then at 32, same questions, one under four, the answer given is 
6.6million rounded to the same question number two, the answer is now 
different, it’s 29.3 rounded, you go to the last one at 36 – answer to the 
first question is very, very different now, it’s 1.5million rounded and 
20 
then you go to the second question the answer is now different, oh the 
answer is the same as in the second question, s o in effect if you look at 
28 they say if you deduct 6.6million from their price their price will be 
32.9 and then in the second one at page 32 they say if you deduct 
6.6million from their price their price will 29.3 and in the third one they 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 196 of 247 
 
say if you deduct 1.5million from their price their price would be 29.3.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That’s the mathematics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Chair if I may add the point, these 
are all official, appear to be official letters dated, stamped by the  
appropriate authorities, they’re all dated the same day, not one letter 
refers to a retraction or cancellation of a previous letter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And they are written by the same person, is that 
right? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They are, they all come  from the 
10 
same 
email 
addressed 
individual 
at 
a 
first 
glance 
I 
would 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the author seems to be the same.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  ...submit that the – I am not an 
expert on Chinese signatures if I may put it that way.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but the name that is given. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  AT least the company is the same?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The company is the same, the 
signatures at first glance appear to be the same.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chinese. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja.  Ja, no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then if I may just roundup on that you 
indicated that these clarifications were in response to a further 
telephone call to CSR of the 4 t h of December when they appeared their 
first clarification created problems and that is at page 692 which is 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 197 of 247 
 
Annexure 84. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is ... 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the first bullet point there so we know the 
conversation took place on the 4 t h of December according to that 
report, between Transnet and CSR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess it has to be clarification in quotation 
marks?  Because they don’t bring any clarification, instead they 
compound the confusion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then perhaps Mr Callard might be able to give 
us this clarification, if this conversation tak es place on the 4 t h, the 
10 
evening of the 4 t h of December, well you can’t explain why, do you 
know notice that all these letters are dated the 3 r d of December 2013, 
so presumably before the telephone call was heard.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  It is an anomaly that I cannot 
explain. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Chair might this be an appropriate time 
for that short break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes I assume you spoke to Mr Callard?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair may I place on record ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume you spoke to Mr Callard about us going up 
20 
to five? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is acceptable to you?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes fine Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Alright, we will take a short 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 198 of 247 
 
adjournment now, because we will go on until five, we will take a short 
adjournment and resume at five to four.  Thank you, we adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may proceed Ms Sello. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Callard getting back  
then to your paragraph 170 I note there under paragraph 170 you have 
a table that you indicate you extracted from pages 12 and 13, typed 
pages 12 and 13 of Annexure 84 and that would be paginated 692.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I see there and I depart from the premise 
that bidder 1 is Bombardier, am I correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  This is on the diesel locomotives 
no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh yes this is diesel my apologies.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder 1 is CNR 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  CNR.  Bidder 2? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Is CSR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you recall Bidder 3?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bidder 3 was EMD.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  EMD. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And Bidder 4 was GE, Gene ral 
Electric. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then under bidder 2 CSR I see the figure 
that comes through into the report to be deducted for TE is the figure 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 199 of 247 
 
given in the third of the series of clarifications you pointed us to.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know on what basis that figure was 
chosen over the other two figures of R6 million?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Perhaps the creators of the report 
might guide us then. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would have to refer to them.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then move onto your – the observations 
you make of the impact on TE pricing on the electric locomotives and 
10 
you start with that at your 171. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes thank you.  And for 171 which 
talks to page 23 of Annexure 83 which is page 662 of the bundle I am 
dealing here with elec – the electric locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  662.  And I am quoting here from 
bullet point – sub bullet 1, 2 the bottom of the third sub-bullet point. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which has the heading bidder 1 
and 3 have not quoted using TE as a main sub -contractor.  No clarity 
20 
was obtained from these bidders as mentioned in the report ab ove.  If 
clarity and this refers to the debate which we were having.  If clarity 
was obtained from these two bidders and they indicated there was no 
change in price whether TE will be used or not as with the response on 
bidder 5 then the impact on the eval uation scoring result could be 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 200 of 247 
 
significant.  This was the conclusion of the CFET team acknowledging 
that the impact on the scoring could have been significant.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard let us just look at this.  Should we 
be working on 83 or on 84?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For the… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  83 you are correct.  Oh then we are back to 
the electric locomotives yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was my conclusion on the 
electric locomotives yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed okay I follow you now not the diesels.  
10 
And you make the same point that I think you had previously made to 
the Chair at 174 which is that if is accepted that the role of TE was not 
prescribed then applying the impact unfairly favoured Bombardier and 
CSR? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the conclusion of all of this 
in this process yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we are still…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is at what – at what page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Statement page 45 at paragraph 174.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The statement at…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay yes now I can see. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair.  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we will hopefully before we complete with 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 201 of 247 
 
your statement be in a position to demonstrate to the Chair tha t the 
opinion you express at 174 is correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Now... 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That relates to the… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then if we could in the meantime then move 
to the next which is under the heading correlation.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes this is just to show where it 
10 
comes – if we refer to page 40 of Annexure 83 which – which is page 
679 where we have a legible copy under  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Supplementary? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Under the supplementary which 
legible copy is at – supplementary 20 – supplementary 23. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 23? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 23 of the supplementary. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we could then while holding that 
open refer to Annexure 65 please.   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 65.  And that will be at 577.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 65 which is at 577 and to 
give context Annexure 65 is a rep ort from the cross function evaluation 
team dated the 15 January 2014 to the locomotive steering committee – 
steering committee.  And the purpose if I may say – the purpose of this 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 202 of 247 
 
memorandum is to provide the steering committee with an update to the 
results of the best and final offer from bidders 1 and 2.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I use the words best and final offer 
with deliberate emphasis because I am sure to the normal reader that 
they have a certain connotation of what is meant by best and final offer.  
I then – we then go down if we may to their point 5.  The table below 
outlines the buffer prices received by bidders 1 and 2.  Bidders 1 and 2 
in this case being Bombardier and CSR respectively.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may take – refer now to 
supplementary 23 left hand column bottom line price used for 
evaluation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And under bidder 1 that is 32.8 
million rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You referring us to Annexure?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Supplementary 23 that is…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 578. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Supplementary page 23.  Is that where you 
referred us to Mr Callard?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes that is the page headed 
reconciliation of price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 203 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which was the final page of the 
CFE – CFET report of the 10 December. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is our Annexure 93 in the main 
statement? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct and this is the legible copy 
of the page. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were – were you reading just now from page 
578 that is Annexure 65 at the bottom?  Because that is where I was 
reading. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was reading from 578 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So let us just find our place.  You referred us 
to Annexure 65  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 578.  We keep that page open. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Keep that page open please. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you want us then to go to supplementary 
page 23? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is that what you want us to do now?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I thought you said let us keep them open 
and then you came to Annexure 65.  Are you done with Annexure 65 or 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 204 of 247 
 
not yet? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.  I wish to correlate between…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Between these two please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we – must we still be holding 679?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  679. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  679 – 23 is a clear page of 679. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of 679. 
CHAIRPERSON: So we do not need to …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  23 is the clear page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes we now go to 23 – page 23 of the 
supplementary.  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Left hand column. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Price used for evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  32.8 million rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes for bidder 1? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For bidder 1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 205 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Left hand column. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page supplementary 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I that is where I am. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not reading at the top?  You say price per 
loco as submitted by bidder is that where you read just now?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No I am reading at the bottom of 
the column. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where it says impact – just read what it says where 
you are reading? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am reading the very last line 
price used for evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Then for bidder 1 32?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  .8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And you will note that this is after 
deducting the impact of TE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   They are now using this price for 
evaluation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  32.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  While holding that price in our 
mind if we now go look at pag e 578 that was Annexure  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 206 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  65. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  65 
CHAIRPERSON:  65 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 578. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Table 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN C ALLARD:  And we will see on that table in the 
middle price previous evaluated price.  And it says 32.833325, 32.8.  I 
10 
would just wish to demonstrate the correlation between those two 
figures. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So the figure which comes from 
the CFET evaluation team finds its way into this formal document to the 
locomotive steering committee meeting as a best and final offer price.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I want to make that correlation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And then when it uses the words 
price used for evaluation as a best and final offer price.  
 CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The normal reading I would posit 
of a best and final offer is what you see is now what you getting.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 207 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the ultimate not to be changed, not to be amended 
before evaluation? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But the – which will be 
demonstrated later is that this TE is act – TE impact price is actually 
added back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So this is not the actual price 
which we are going to pay for these locomotives.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is posited as being best and 
final offer what you see what you get.  
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not what we are actually going 
to pay for those locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  A similar point holds for b idder 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – I mean the one that is the best and final offer you 
mean it is without the TE factor?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is without the TE factor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you say it will be brought back later?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLA RD:  Be brought back later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And part of the point you intend making which you 
have not necessarily made is you cannot have – you cannot have a 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 208 of 247 
 
price higher than your best and final offer?  Your best and final is the 
last price? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Exactly that point.  The normal 
reader reading this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Would say thank you I assume that 
is going to be the price that I am going to pay?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The small exclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may refer to point 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On page 579. 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which says this memorandum must 
be read in conjunction with the CFT Finance report dated the 10 
December.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The normal reader of this report 
would not go into the depth of detail.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which we have just been here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To pick up the nuances around this 
pricing. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 209 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And would take it I submit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At face value – thank you I read 
that – that is the price we are going to pay when in fact that is not the 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That we are actually going to pay.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then you do the same correlation for the 
diesel locomotives at your paragraph 176.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought I saw something that I thought you 
would come to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I thought Mr Callard was going to come to 
shortly before moving away from this.  Okay I think it has gone.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ag I hope we can…  
CHAIRPERSON:  It may come…  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Somehow get to address it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may come back. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will come back to more… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see that is why sometimes when I – when 
something occurs to my mind I want to …  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 210 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To deal with it immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deal with it there and then before it escapes ja.  
Okay alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if – before we leave your Annexure 
65 578 it states as its purpose to provide the steering committee with 
an update of the results of the best and final offer response from 
bidders 1 and 2.  Do we know when those best and final offers came in 
and this memorandum is dated the 15 January 2014?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  My apologies your question was 
onto 65? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  578? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  578.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That memorandum we just – you just took us 
through. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. Ja.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 65. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 65. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. I look at…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 65 I see it is dated the 15 January 
20 
2014. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is from the cross functional evaluation 
team. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 211 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is going to the 1054 locomotive 
steering committee? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It has as it – it states as its purpose to 
provide the steering committee with an update of the results of the best 
and final offer BAFO responses from bidders 1 and 2.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. Now you will recall that the report we 
have been working through of the CFET Finance.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is dated the 10 December 2013?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is at page 640. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This memorandum is dated almost a month 
later the 14 – 15 January 2015? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  My question is, do you know when these best 
and final offers were received that are reflected in this memor andum? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes and I believe that I highlighted 
20 
that when I gave the time line of events which if I may go back to?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of my – paragraph 157.8 of my 
statement which is page 38.  The – and that was on the 4 January 2014 
there was the request for the best and final offers BAFO with a closing 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 212 of 247 
 
date of 10 January. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So they would have been received by 
the 10 January and then they are followed by this memorandu m on the 
14 January to the 1064 steering – locomotive steering committee. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I point out one further point 
on this.  What I have illustrated on bidder 1, column 1 a lso applies to 
bidder 2.  But remember if you would recall we were talking about the 2 
million odd discount from bidder CSR that differentiation between the 5 
10 
million and the 3 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Could I draw our attention – could 
we go have a look please at page 580 of – which is again still the same 
annexure 65.  And page 580 is a reconciliation between the BAFO 
evaluated price and the previous evaluated price.  The previous 
evaluated price which we see there th at middle line for bidder 2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we do so. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Excuse me Mr Callard perhaps we might – we 
20 
will make a note.  We should consider providing a more legible copy of 
580. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  580 apologies there is a legible 
copy at 582. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  582.  Thank you.  Then let us work through it. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 213 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  If we may take the – 
and again we need these various documents open before us.  
Supplementary 23 which was the reconciliation of price which was the 
last page of the CFET report.  The second column price used for 
evaluation is 34.7 million rounded.  That price is the same price as at 
under bidder 2 of page 578. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say instead of looking at 578 we can look at 
582? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No first 582 please.  I just wish to 
establish the linkage between…  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I Mr Callard because I think it was in 
response to my question that you referred to 582.  You originally 
referred us to page 580.  I made the point that 580 is not a very legible 
copy. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Mr Callard indicated that a more legible 
copy should appear Chair in your – at you page 582. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes but I thought that he was saying that one is a 
better copy of 578. That is actually not what he said hey?  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No it is a better copy of 580. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right.  Of 580. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  If I may I would like to refer to 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 214 of 247 
 
three separate pages. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think I had – I had understood correctly.  Ja 
no, no, no, I – now I understand the [indistinct].  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I got confused in the process.  Yes now you want us 
to look at what? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The first page  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Is the supplementary 23. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Recall that this is the table of the 
CFET report of the 10 December. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The second column the last line 
price used for evaluation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For bidder 2 CSR 34.7 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That figure is the same figure that 
appears on page – in the report to the locomotive steering committee 
page 578 their report of the 15 J anuary as the previous evaluated 
price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 215 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have a correlation between this 
price at the 10 January and what they refer to as the previous 
evaluated price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The report of the 15 January 
referred to the figure above it gives the current what they call BAFO 
evaluated price of 2.4 million rounded.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There is a difference of 2.2 million.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we could turn holding that 
difference of 2.2 million please – if we could turn to the legible copy of 
the reconciliation which is page 582.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is a reconciliation of the 
difference between the figure in supplementary 23 and the BAFO price 
here.  We will see the 34.7 million on the second column 1, 2, 3 the 
fourth figure from the bottom the 3f4  716. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Price used for evaluation before 
20 
BAFO. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We will see the BAFO which they 
include here at bidder 2 and it is marked there in bold just above it at 
the 2 – 32.4 million. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 216 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The immediate table below that 
gives us the difference between those two prices.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You will – may recall that when we 
spoke on the CSR and the impact of TE there was the confusion 
between the 3.8 million and the 5 million and the 2 million and whether 
that was a discount or not and should be taken into a discount.  I would 
just like to highlight here that the difference is now made up of a 
discount on price.  That 2.01 million finds its way in – finds its way 
10 
back here as a discount on the BAFO price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that is the discount – it is the discount on 
the price used for evaluation to arrive at the BAFO price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To arrive at the BAFO price 
presented to the board. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The first which is on that table 
under bidder 2 32.4 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which is presented as the BAFO 
20 
evaluated price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Reading through that column it 
says there is a difference of 2.2 million.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 217 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2.25 million.  What I wanted to 
point out was that difference of 2.25 million is made up inter alia o f the 
2.01 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That came through in the 
confusion of the impact of TE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this where you say earlier they deducted an amount 
that they said would have to be deducted if they did not use TE? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now you are saying they  up – they have brought it 
10 
back now.  Is this where you say they have brought it back?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not yet? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am giving a more – slightly more 
complicated picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For CSR when they – when there 
was confusion around the price to deduct for the impacted TE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Whether it was 3 million round 
20 
figures 3.4 million or 5. Something million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And through discussions with 
Supply Chain Services and the various bodies it said use the 3.4 
million. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 218 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN C ALLARD:  And the 2 million was not taken 
into account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  However now subsequently later 
after we have requested an updated BAFO on the 4 January it finds it 
way back into the figure here as this 2.01 million as a discount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So initially been told to ignore it it 
now finds it way back here as a discount.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the problem is it being given as a discount.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is here now reflected  as a 
discount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Creating the impression that what Transnet would be 
getting here as – this discount. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Whether this is a real or a 
fictitious discount is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is [indistinct] but you – is part of the point 
that you are making that it creates that impression that Transnet will 
benefit because there is this discount?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just for the record and please confirm for 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 219 of 247 
 
me that debate of 5.3 million and 3.4 million would – for the TE impact 
that discussion is heard in the report at page 652?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And second – third – second bullet point of 
that page where it is indicated that two prices were received of 5.8 and 
3.4 and a discussion then follows thereafter and Transnet or the team 
decides to use the 3.4 million?  At page…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Absolutely correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  652. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  652 and the second bullet point it 
10 
confirms that discussion exactly where the bidder 2 may have 
substantially included this quote “discount” unquote portion of 2.01 – 
2.01 million into their price thereby havi ng the potential impact. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it says there it was firstly 5.4 then 3.8 and 
they described the difference as a discount and they do so in the third 
bullet point and that discount is 2.010 – 2 million odd. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now it is that 2 million discount and I say that 
in inverts that find its way to page 582 and is reflected as a discount on 
the price? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  An identical figure is reflected 
there as a discount yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Now this report 
I see at 578 Annexure 65 where you originally took us.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 220 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 579 it reflects a number of signatures 
and a number of names and are those the mem bers of the cross 
functional evaluation team?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I understand those to be the 
members of the cross functional evaluation team by their signatures to 
this report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So that would be Mr  Mohammed Moola, 
Mr Yusuf Laher, Mr Zunaid Vally, Mr Danie Smit, Mr Thabo Seapi and 
Mr Tsietsi Tlaletsi? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is that team that is then seeking – is it 
– is it seeking approval or it is this submitting information to t hat 
Committee?  Is it updating the committee on progress …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  By – by … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In the negotiations? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
By 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
memorandum it was to provide the Steering Committee with an updat e 
of the results of the best and final offer BAFO response from bidders 
one and two for the purpose of this report and how the locomotive 
committee - Steering Committee may take this further.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  What then transpires after this memo is 
submitted? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not a – after this memorandum 
is submitted it finds its way into a memorandum to the Board 
Acquisitions and Disposals Committee Meeting which takes place on 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 221 of 247 
 
24 January. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And these figures find their way 
through into that memorandum.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you do not have that memorandum as an 
annexure to your statement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I did not include as an annexure to 
my statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is available but it is not in. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  So whichever witness we then next deal 
with we take this – this report from this juncture and see how BADC 
dealt with it at that meeting of 24  January. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and if we may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  I would like for a 
moment to pass over my points 175.2 …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And 176.2 because they deal with 
some detailed spreadsheets and I would rather deal with them as an 
20 
entity … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Rather than introduce them now. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is fine. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But to address that – the similar 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 222 of 247 
 
issue of TE across the diesel bidders while we are dealing with this.  
So if I may come back to those later and go to 177.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What I commented earlier on 
bidder one for diesel locomo tives not being subject to the impact of 
pricing.  I am not sure if I specifically stated that but if I could just take 
you through please to 170 – my – paragraph 170 page 44. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The application of TE pricing 
methodology for the 465 diesels followed a similar pattern and we have 
10 
effectively dealt with that table …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And the inconsistencies of bidder 
two in that table. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Coming to bidder one for the 
diesel locomotives not being subject to impact at TE pricing and I 
believe this could be an inconsistent application of this prescription 
across the bidders. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Per 178 we have almost exactly 
the – I set out exactly the same process as I did for the electricals and 
I may be permitted not o have to go through that again.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would then go to paragraph 179.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 223 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Where CNR was bidder one for 
diesels.  An extract from their RFP submission is set out below …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And this … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Could you read it into the record please? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will read it into the record.  This 
is extracted from their RFP submission and paragraph 2.1:  
“Local content plans for supplier and components.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
“Reiterating 
our 
commitment to Transnet’s Supplier Development 
requirements it needs to be mentioned that the CNR 
Consortium has entered into an agreement with 
Transnet Engineering as its major local Supplier 
Development (SD) partner for the manufacture of 
certain components and the assembly of the 
locomotives after delivery of an initial quantity of 20 
fully built up units.  Based on this above the 
assertion by Supply Chain Services that bidder one 
20 
not specify the use of TE as main subcontractor is 
incorrect.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is a conclusion you draw when – we 
did not work through paragraph 178.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry and that … 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 224 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where you give reference to where CFET 
indicated that CNR had not – had not specified TE as a subcontractor 
and in this regard you refer as to page 12 of Annexure 84 read with 
page 691? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct and …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Second bullet point if you could have regard 
thereto. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And if I may just read that as well 
because it is the pertinent part of this?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On page 12 of Annexure 84 – 
10 December 2013 report of the Cross Functional Evaluation Team on 
the locomotive tender evaluation for the su pply of 465 new diesel 
locomotives under the heading of “Using TE as a Main Subcontractor 
“Inter Alia”” states:  the bullet.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “Supply Chain Services – 
SCS – however advised CFT Finance that the 
supplier development files submitted by bidders 
indicated that bidder one – read CNR – did not 
20 
specify the use of TE as a main subcontractor and 
this could have a potential price adjustment …”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “…implication.  Supply 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 225 of 247 
 
Chain Services also mentioned that bidders were 
likely to make different assumptions in the use of 
TE as main subcontractor including the percentage 
that would be subcontracted.  These assumptions 
were not specified by TFR in the RFP process and 
could differ significantly between bidders.”  
That is my bold. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  So if I may that is what the report 
claimed? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what you seek to draw attention to at 179 
is that contrary to what the report suggests CNR had actually …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indicated TE as a subcontractor?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And indicated that it has concluded – has 
entered into a consortium with TE to partner on local supplier 
development? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct and …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you draw your conclusion at 180.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And my conclusion based on the 
above: 
“The reported assertion by Supply Chain Services 
that bidder one did not specify the use of TE as a 
main subcontractor is incorrect.”  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 226 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now that error – if it is an error – by CFET of 
what relevance is it to this whole process in the diesel evaluation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The relevance of this is that bidder 
one – CNR were not asked to give – provide the impact of not using TE 
as a main subcontractor.  Unlike other bidders who had specified they 
were using TE they were asked to provide an impact as we ha ve seen 
in the table - previous table of bidders one, two and etcetera but bidder 
one was not asked for. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please go ahead. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From this clear statement in their 
10 
RFP that they were using TFR as a main subcontract or it is unusual 
and I cannot explain why they were not asked to submit the same 
clarification that the other bidders had been asked when they clearly 
said here they were using TE and this is the point that I was making 
that this is an inconsistent applica tion or inconsistently applying the 
prescription of TE across diesel bidders …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that is the first point around 
this. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The failure to ask CNR to clarify – CNR, yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that CNR was adjudicated on a higher price 
which reflected a TE component and was not given the opportunity to 
deduct the TE component from its price to – so as to determine a price 
for evaluation? 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 227 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Along with the other bidders who had used 
TE. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may reflect that.  CE were then 
evaluated in the CFET Report on their original price.  That their original 
price was substantially higher than the other prices so be it but they 
were not asked or they were not given – asked and/or given the same 
consideration as the other bidders to state the impact of their TE price 
and that was the inconsistency that I referred to.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now going back to the point I think the Chair 
10 
asked earlier that – you know – engagement you had with the Chair.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You conclude that the – this acted to the 
prejudice of CNR.  Do you draw that conclusion  – this inconsistent 
application of the TE impact?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It may have acted to the prejudice 
of CNR.  If CNR were to have come back and said there is no impact on 
my price (indistinct) as one of the electrical bidders did.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would not be to their prejudice.  
20 
If they said that TE was going to be cheaper it would have been 
prejudicial – sorry – it would have been – whichever one it is going to 
be. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  It is late in the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well prejudicial or non-prejudicial. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 228 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prejudicial or non-prejudicial. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I could have been prejudicial or 
non- prejudicial depending on the answer.  If th e answer had been as 
per what the (indistinct) there is no impact.  It would have had no 
impact on that price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now just remind us as far as the diesel 
locomotives are concerned who were the successful bidders there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The successful bidders were CNR 
and General Electric. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So clearly it does not seem that even 
that inconsistent application of the TE impact does not seem to have 
prejudiced CNR. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not at that stage. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  On the issue of inconsistencies 
overleaf you then want to talk about inconsistencies again on the 
interpretation of BAFO across the diesel bidders?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then you can take us from paragraph 
181. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  181 and all the documentation in 
this subsection was through MNS with the exception of Annexure 66.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You do – sorry – you did indicate that 
NNS engaged you to provide assistance in their investigation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 229 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So are you suggesting you – you became 
aware of these documents in that process – during the course of that 
process? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In the course of that process. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I became aware of the existence 
and the importance of these documents, yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright.  You may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
“It was on 20 December 2013 that CNR and the 
10 
other diesel bidders were requested to provide a 
breakdown of their RFP – Annexure E – costs.” 
Which is Annexure 101. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May we just turn to Annexure 101 
please? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  That we find at page 791. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 791 and this is the letter to 
CNR – this time we have the letter to CNR Mr  Chair.  The letter is dated 
20 December 2013.  It is addressed to …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter is on what page?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  792. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  792. 
CHAIRPERSON:  792? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 230 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 101 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you - and it asks for an 
explanation of their – the Annexure E costs per their RFP.   Now the 
Annexure E is a document which all the bidders have to fill in, in their 
RFP and it details certain costs under the headings which we have here 
being their manpower costs, factory overhea ds - which includes rental, 
depreciation and amortisation, utility costs, consumables etcetera - and 
thirdly administrative overheads and mark -up which includes marketing, 
insurance, financing etcetera – financing, interest etcetera.  CNR had 
10 
given the figures indicated here in the Annexure E.  We will see from 
page – from page 792 that that was actually a cut -out – an extract from 
their RFP and the table was pasted into this letter.  Please provide an 
explanation of these costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well we notice that these costs are 
quite significant and quite high and we are talking about here 5 billion 
in respect of the – their request for a proposal. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CNR replied on 22 December 
20 
which is Annexure 102 which is page 795.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
And 
they 
breakdown 
their 
manpower costs of – I will not go through the – the full – describe the 
amounts at the moment but they breakdown their manpo wer costs as a 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 231 of 247 
 
budget expense.  They describe their factory overheads as been a type 
test warehouse training in China mock -up bogie factory and equally the 
– on page 796 overleaf – they give their administrative overheads and 
mark-up – which we will see in the billions and importantly this includes 
insurance, transport, import duties, mark -up and for mark-up I will read 
profit – in my interpretation – warranties, interest costs etcetera a list 
of what they include in that price.  I put this to give context to what 
follows next. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On 4 January all the diesel bidders 
10 
were invited to submit Best And Final Offers.  The letter to CNR is 
attached as Annexure 95 and if we could go to that one please it is 
page 775. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is a letter of 4 January to CNR 
and it refers to their tender.  I would take you through to the second 
last paragraph – third last – third last paragraph. 
“In order to achieve the above objective and 
conclude the final stages of the evaluation process 
Transnet is requesting that you provide a Best And 
20 
Final Offer.  The Best And Final Offer must focus on 
commercial aspects of your bid only.  We suggest 
the following guidelines be used.  Best price 
excluding hedging and escalations.  Best price 
using subcontractors of your choice - not Transnet 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 232 of 247 
 
Engineering.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “Disclosure of foreign 
amounts and what exchange rates used.  Your local 
content target as originally committed will not 
change and reconciliation of current best and final 
offer price to the submitted price with reason for 
changes if any.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You see and I read that – you can 
10 
give a discount but just tell us that this is your discount.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
By 
virtue 
of 
this 
letter 
or 
responding to this letter CNR responded on 6  January – sorry – on 
4 January requesting a 14 day – first requesting a 14 day extensi on and 
again on 6 January 2014 requesting a 21 day extension.  This may be 
seen in Annexure 96. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  778. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  778 and there are two emails.  The 
first one is 4 January which is to be found at the bottom of 778.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which requests an extension of14 
days followed by the email of 6  January which is at the top of 778 
requesting an extension of 21 days and the reason for this request is 
after the series of discussions betwe en members of the CNR 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 233 of 247 
 
Consortium an Incorporated Joint Venture – I will skip to the point. 
“As you are aware during the tender process CNR 
used prices from Transnet Engineering as its local 
subcontractors for building locomotive bodies as 
well as the assembly of the locomotives.  As the 
period for the submission of the tender price is by 
Transnet Engineering was in the excess of three 
months it will be impossible for CNR to obtain a 
quotation from an alternative local subcontractor by 
10 January 2014.” 
10 
Hence the request for extension. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hold that point please as we look 
at 186. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  186, where are you? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry – my point – Annexure 97. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Where GE replied on 4 January.  
Sorry GE replied … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry we – I am sorry we were at page 778 …  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And we are now going to page 782.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you go to 782 with reference to your 
paragraph 186 in your statement a page 48?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 234 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Please do that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is where – from my statement 
186 – General Electric replied on 10  January. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And they give there: 
“Following the guidelines…”  
First paragraph.  It is addressed to Mr  Singh. 
“Following the guidelines suggested GSET has 
prepared the responses that follow.  Best price 
excluding hedging and escalation.”  
10 
And they give a price. 
“This is …” 
But the – what follows is pertinent. 
“This is the best price excluding hedging escalation 
as per our proposal of 30 April 2013. This best price 
assumes the use of Transnet Engineering as a 
subcontractor for the scope is to find in our 
30 April 2013 submittal and is based on the pricing 
TE provided to GSET at the same time.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The second paragraph: 
“Best price using subcontractors of GSET’s choice  
and not Transnet Engineering.”  
And they give an alternative price there.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the price there reduces …  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 235 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  By … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Say of a million to 24 million. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  About by - reduce it by about 1.2 
million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
I 
believe 
that 
price 
to 
be 
consistent with the price quoted in their original table on the impact of 
not using TE. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  TE, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I have not checked that 
10 
exactly but it is certainly appears to be of the same order.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Over leaf if I may on 783 they set 
out all the conditions – not the conditions – but how they complied with 
the original letter. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is presented as a BAFO price 
strictly in accordance with the request.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now you referred to GE – the purpose 
being? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To establish a concept of what a 
BAFO is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I now take us to 187 – my 
paragraph 187. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 236 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CNR replied to 4 January request 
on 10 January.  This is Annexure 98. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Recall that they have applied twice 
for an extension. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have not found whether the 
extension was granted or not granted.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But I just take us to their letter of 
10 January and we read from their letter.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So hen if I understand the letter addressed to 
the bidders on 4 January they first ask for a 14 day extension then a 21 
day extension.  Which would mean that their response would come 
somewhere towards the end of January or February for the reasons that 
they stated? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when you send us to Annexure 98 that 
letter is dated 10 January? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They seem to have been able to comply with 
providing the necessary information – notwithstanding their request for 
extensions? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They respond notwithstanding their 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 237 of 247 
 
request for an extension. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is the nature of their response.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then I read their documents correctly, thank 
you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In the nature of their response 
they state: 
“Considering the guidelines suggested in the above 
mentioned letter …” 
That is the letter of 10  January 2014. 
10 
“…we would like to present to you our Best And 
Final Offer for (intervenes).”  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am a 788.  Is that where you are 
reading? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Seven – 785. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  785 Chair, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Were we at 788 and I have – I did not go 
back.  You left me behind or what?  I thought you said 788 there.  I 
went there.  Okay.  785. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  785. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay.  I would read again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 238 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  “With reference to your 
letter etcetera on 4 January.  Considering the 
guidelines suggested in the above mentioned letter 
on 4 January we would like to present to you our 
best and final offer for the tender.  We have 
reduced our best price in the TCO Model – Total 
Cost to Ownership – that you refer to in your letter 
of 4 January from 39 million – 39.7 million rounded 
– to 27.36 million rounded.  This price relates to the 
cost of manufacture and does not include training 
10 
costs, logistics, royalties, technical support, service 
charges, finance costs and contingencies etcetera.”  
The point I wish to make Mr  Chair is that these qualifications do not 
make it a BAFO price.  It is qualified in respect of being a BAFO price – 
very qualified in respect of a BAFO price.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In particular what are the qualifications that you say 
render it not to be a BAFO price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I take from their paragraph 1 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have reduced our best price 
20 
and the last sentence …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This price relates to the cost of 
manufacturing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 239 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And does not include training costs 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Logistics, royalties …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Technical 
support, 
service 
charges, finance charges …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And contingencies etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder what you exclude when you say etcetera. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is – that is my concern 
Mr Chairman.  It is open ended.  What is meant by etcetera?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In contractual terms etcetera can 
mean a host of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, yes.  So that – that is the one 
qualification.  Is that the only qualification?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, it is in fact all those 
20 
qualifications before that.  Training, logistics, royalties …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, what I mean is the qualificati on in 
paragraph 1 that you have just read.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 240 of 247 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the qualification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you go further then in that response.  
What we have at 785 … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is in response to the letter of 4  January 
requesting a Best And Final Offer as appear at 775?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now when I go to 775 I – I note that it 
requires the bidders to provide a Best And Final Offer focusing only on 
10 
commercial aspects of the bid. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As a guideline it is indicated what - what they 
must do? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now in reading those sub – those bullets - no 
– those numbered paragraphs at page 775 from one to five – you see 
them at one to five? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would submit that they do not 
comply with the request to give us a BAFO price  focusing on 
20 
commercial conditions only. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when – when CNR indicates that my price 
has reduced from 39 million to 27 million because it excludes those 
items that you listed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 241 of 247 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where would I fit that into one to five at page 
775?  What are they responding to there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot answer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is a reduction but I cannot 
answer how they fit in. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is an impromptu reduction but it is not – 
it does not arise from the request at 775?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It certain does not appear to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you – you have drawn our attention to the last 
part of paragraph 1 of the letter at page 785 and have said that renders 
the price not to be a BAFO price – a best and final price, right?  Is that 
right? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just confirming that I understood you correctly 
namely that the – you have said that the last part of paragraph 1 at 
page 785 renders the price that CNR gives not to be the best and final 
price. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The exclusions render it not at 
Best And …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Final. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Final Offer as could be used in 
interpretation to be taken forward.  
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 242 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no I accept that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted to confirm that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Confirm that is the (indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not mention to is there a special reason 
for that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why two is – does not also disqualify it from being 
above one. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because if we refer it to page 775 
… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The letter of request it said best 
price excluding hedging and escalations.  So two would exclude – two 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Accords with their one and three 
also accords with the additional – with the first letter excluding hedging 
20 
and escalations, so two would exclude two accords with their one and 
three also accords with the additional, wit h the first letter excluding 
hedging and escalation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But okay no I understand that but isn’t the whole 
concept of a best and final offer necessarily, it doesn’t necessarily 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 243 of 247 
 
mean that that’s your final inclusive of everything?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   It could depend how the operative 
request it Mr Chair because the bids are closed at a particular date, 
they closed as I recall it was April 2013, when we were now 
adjudicating much later forward escalation or escalation up to contract 
date and forex exchange movements up to contract date are sometimes 
– are derived variables from the base price, so that is why it’s asked 
give it to us on your base price, we would work out these, the 
escalation and forex differently, and given the different bi dders may 
have different assumptions around forex and escalation, it is – and 
10 
that’s, the normalisation process it is easiest to ask work it on your 
base price only.  What was our over the counter price at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay then staying at page 785 under one 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that, before that, then at 775 where it 
says the best and final offer must focus on commercial aspects of your 
bid only.  Is that a normal requirement when you talk about  a best and 
final offer? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes I would submit that it would 
20 
be, asking the best final offer is we’re not asking you to change any 
technical specifications, if I may use a simple example I wish to buy a 
motor car, and the dealer says it’s going to cost me R1 500 000 for this 
car, with all these options and I say is that your best and final offer and 
he might say yes or he’ll say we will give you a further R10 000 on it 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 244 of 247 
 
but that does not change the makeup of the car, the options, s o there’s 
no technical change for it, it’s not changing the repayment period, it’s a 
simple straightforward I can offer you R10 000 off the final price and 
that is what would normally be understood by a request for a best and 
final offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you Chair, now on paragraph one did 
the bid or the RFP require the bidders to indicate the training costs, or 
to cost the training requirements to provide for logistics, for royalties, 
technical support and the lik e?  Is the costing for all those elements 
10 
expected to be found in the original bid?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Indeed you will find that similar 
points are, because if I could then take you to the supplementary page, 
page 23 of my supplementary Annexu re E which we’ve been dealing 
with the reconciliation of price, just to highlight.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    And I’m reading now from the 
supplementary 23.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That table gives an indication of 
20 
how a locomotive price is made up, the base price submitted by the 
bidder, and then there’s additional items to get to the capital 
acquisition cost, you will see there we have special tooling, 
engineering support, capital spares,  consumables, special holding and 
a list of items including set up costs, insurance rounding and all those 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 245 of 247 
 
if I then may read to the line price per locomotive submitted as per 
Annexure F the capital acquisition cost of a locomotive.  To deliver a 
locomotive requires all of those elements. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay so in order to get, to present this 
reduced price CNR then deducted those very parts of the cost of the 
locomotive itself that they had originally costed in their bid?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay.  Which if they were to meet 
specification and were to succeed they would have to incorporate in the 
execution of the contract?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :   That is my understanding and 
interpretation of this yes and I will as we look at the what CNR included 
in their mark-up of Annexure, in their mark-up of F if I may just refer 
back to that previously because that was an item – sorry if I turn back 
the page, if you’ll give me half a moment, and I responded on the 4 t h of 
January, Annexure E, the breakdown of their Annexure E.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Give us a page number please?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Annexure E, Annexure 101. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay, at page 791? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Sorry may I go to the breakdown 
20 
on Annexure 102 in their response, page 796.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Where under their heading of 
admin overheads and mark-up of their significant billions there they say 
this figure is made up of insur ance transport costs, import duties, mark -
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 246 of 247 
 
up, warrantees, interest cost, performance bonds, consulting fees, 
contingency, and on the ...(intervention)      
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     785? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    And on 785 a bogey factory, type 
test TE warehouse, TE training in China, TE mark -up, manpower costs, 
many of the figures one would expect to find in this set up here they 
have now taken out so all or some but there is such a reduction that 
these figures would be significantly impacted here in wh at we call the 
additional items for the locomotive have been removed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes Chair, it’s been brought to my attention.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think that last point please just let refresh our 
minds on it when we meet next time, that last t ime that you were 
making. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s one minute past five, we will adjourn now and we 
are not sitting tomorrow and on Wednesday because the owner of the 
building needs the venue and in terms of the lease we agre ed to give 
them that opportunity to use it for their purposes but we will resume on 
Thursday and on Thursday I see counsel wants to say something about 
Thursday? 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes please Chair, we had scheduled another 
full day witness for Thursda y, not my witness, the witness is ready, Mr 
Callard I have not finished, we need about two hours to finish and I 
fear if we start at ten o’clock we then will impact the next witness in 
that timing. 
20 MAY 2019 – DAY 96 
 
Page 247 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    May I request that perhaps we consider 
starting at nine o’clock on Thursday and Mr Callard and I will try and 
finish by tea time, then that witness can then run form half past eleven.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be fine with you Mr Callard?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That will be fine Chair.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we will start at nine on Thursday.  We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 23 MAY 2019
