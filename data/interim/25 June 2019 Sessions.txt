PROCEEDINGS ON 25 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Good morning Chair. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.  Thank you.  Are we ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair with your leave would we need 
to just remind the witness that she remains under oath as of yesterday. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know we have not been reminding them because 
it is the same oath. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Especially when it – they are just continuing the 
following day.  So it is the same oath. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
CHAIRPERSON:  After all she knows that she is still under that oath. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Loock your evidence concluded on 
page 8 of the bundle and to that extent you were referring to two letters 
that have been shown to you by the commission’s investigators.  In 
order to appreciate the gravity and also the consequences of these two 
letters we need to just highlight certain aspects of the evidence that 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 3 of 130 
 
you gave yesterday.  And so please correct me if I am wrong when I put 
the following to you.  It was an operational requirement of SA Express 
that with its route from Cape Town to Pilanesberg its aircraft required 
to be refuelled in Pilanesberg in order to complete a return journey 
from Cape Town to Pilanesberg, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you also confirm that it was this 
that then triggered a request of instruction from Mr Allanby to you to 
find a solution for this problem and in doing so you were not in a 
position to use the fuel from the existing licenced fuel service provider 
10 
at Pilanesberg which was RSI Fuel because the fuel was found to be 
contaminated, Is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so in order to leverage from the 
economies of scale you were informed at the time that SA Express 
Technical was in the process already of engaging a company called or 
trading as EML Fuel regarding its maintenance requirement which was 
specific to defueling and refuelling two particular aircraft, is that 
correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And off the back of the economies of 
scale benefit you approached EML for a quotation to transport fuel from 
Johannesburg to Pilanesberg and the specific requirement of SA 
Express as you communicated to Eric Motlhake of EML was that you 
required 8500 litres per week to be transported from Johannesburg to 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 4 of 130 
 
Pilanesberg which translated to an approximate amount of 442 000 
litres per annum, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was really the end of your 
involvement in that particular process when you then handed over to 
Doctor Vilakazi who was the Chief Procurement Officer. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes that is correct.  According to the emails my 
GM Dave Allanby advised Doctor Vilakazi of our – the unearthed EML 
yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And was it then Mr – Doctor Vilakazi 
10 
who became the custodian of dealing with this requirement as far as 
you are aware? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Based then on the two documents 
that were provided to you not these letters but more particularly the 
Whatsapp resolution documents and also the memorandum of deviation.  
The Whatsapp resolution which was taken on the 1 July 2017 and the 
memorandum of deviation which was submitted on the 5 July 2017 
according to the date of 1 – which accords to the date of the award 
letter you ended off with yesterday and which was signed by Mr Victor 
20 
Xaba at least on the 1 August was confined to a very particular scope 
of service to be sourced.  That scope of service was twofold.   
1.  It was the supply of jet fuel to the Pilanesberg airport and 
2.  It was to service the maintenance requirement of SA Express 
Technical specific to the defueling and refuelling of its two 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 5 of 130 
 
aircraft. 
Do I understand your evidence correctly on this aspect? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So the scope was there for no 
different at the time that the Whatsapp resolution was taken and at the 
time that at the very least the memorandum of deviation was 
considered on the 5 July.  Now if we look at quickly the award letter 
which you spoke about yesterday I can ask you to first turn to page 91.  
You there?  So page 91 appears to be an enclosing email to the actual 
letter which you addressed yesterday being the award letter on page 
10 
93.  Just for the record this email is sent from Sibongile Vilakazi on the 
5 July 2017 at 12:32 to Eric at EML Energy.com and copied on this 
email is Samuel Vilakazi.  The subject matter is “award letter, fuel 
supply”.  And it simply reads: 
“Good day Eric kindly receive attached letter for your 
signature.  Details are enclosed.  Regards Sibongile 
S Vilakazi Contracts Management.” 
Who does Sibongile Vilakazi report to? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Sibokngile Vilakazi forms part of the 
procurement section that reviews and negotiate the agreements in line 
20 
with legal – together with legal.  But at this stage she reported to Sam 
Vilakazi. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And so the letter on page 
93 is the award letter that you referred to yesterday? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 6 of 130 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Based on the evidence that you had 
given in relation to this award letter and so to the letter addressed to 
whom it may concern on page 96 if you could just go page 96 – thank 
you.  It was your evidence yesterday that the – the contents of this 
letter is certainly beyond your understanding of what the scope of 
services was up and until this stage, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you must just… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me rather… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might – you might not be alive I think if you say 
10 
beyond it might mean one thing but I think what you mean is does not 
accord with her understanding.  Am I right? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you want to say. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me rephrase that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me rephrase sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the context of the scope of service 
– services which were outlined on the request for quotation that you 
20 
sourced which was outlined in the Whatsapp round robin resolution and 
which was outlined in the deviation memorandum which was specific to 
those two operational requirements alluded to earlier are the contents 
of the award letter and the letter addressed To Whom it may Concern 
true and correct? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 7 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Not in line with the deviation and the 
Whatsapps Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so would the contents of the – of 
both of these letters misrepresent the true state of affairs? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I would believe so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in that – in that regard if any 
reliance were placed on these facts contained in these letters would it 
possibly prejudice anybody who relies on the contents of the letters in 
your view? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes it would Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you know whether or not these 
letters were used or not? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Used in what context? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you know – do you know anything 
about the use of these letters? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I do not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance can I ask you to 
please go to page 9 of your statement.  Because what you do know are 
certain communications that were provided to you by the commission’s 
investigators relating to IDC funding that was requested by EML from 
20 
the – from the IDC which for the record is the Industrial Development 
Corporation.  You deal with a series of communications and that is 
documented from page – from paragraph 30 to 39 of your affidavit.  
Were you aware in your own knowledge whether or not Doctor Samuel 
Vilakazi had communication with Mr Eric Motlhake in relation to funding 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 8 of 130 
 
sort by EML from the IDC? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I did not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in line with what you stated in 
your affidavit the communications on this topic is really what was given 
to you by the commission’s investigators? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could ask you to turn to page 11 
please oh sorry not page 11 page 98.  Chair you will recall that this is 
the page that was not included as part of the witness’ bundle when she 
attested to the affidavit but she has since considered it.  It is really an 
10 
enclosing letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not recall. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the context? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The context is that this was really 
just page 98 in particular is an enclosing email to page 99 which is a 
pricing schedule.  The pricing schedule forms part of the witness’ 
affidavit when she deposed to it.  She did not have sight of the page 98 
at the time she deposed to the affidavit but she certainly has since 
looked at it.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not there yesterday? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes it was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 9 of 130 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Loock … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no it is okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Loock at page 
98 appears an email from Eric of EML Energy sent on Friday 14 July 
2017 at 15:49 and it is sent to Vimal Rama copied on this email is 
Tshenolo from EML Energy and the subject title which is a forward is 
Jet A1 Fuel Prices July.  There appears to be two attachments to this 
email. For the record Chair the email reads: 
“Best Vimal.  I have sent same the SA Express pdf 
for approval. The spreadsheet is our document with 
10 
differentials and overheads.  Please note that the 
differential is a total of R1.  Differential and mark-up 
on transport and into plane prices.  Best regards 
EML Motlhaka.” 
Below that is another email which outlines Jet A1 fuel prices for EML 
Engineering but more particularly on page 99 appears a pricing 
schedule.  Is that right Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you know who Mr Vimal Rama is? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I do not Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The email at the bottom of page 98 is it 
not the one to which the prices at page 99 were attached? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Excuse me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email at the bottom of page 98. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 10 of 130 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not the email to which the prices at page 99 were 
attached? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It appears to be so Chair.  And it 
appears to be the string of emails relevant to that attachment.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the email at the bottom of page 98 is from Mr 
Marius Nortje and it is addressed to Mr Eric Motlhake and Mr 
[indistinct] Charlie is copied and then it has got the prices below it and 
the attachment – the letter attachment at page 99 belongs to it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no it is just that you read the – you read first an 
email that was sent on 14 July 2017 and read – looked last at the one 
dated 3 July.  And then you went over to the prices.  But if the prices at 
page 99 are where an attachment to the email at the bottom of 98 then 
that is fine I understand. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Loock if I could 
ask you to look at page or sorry to just to follow up on Mr Vimal Rama.  
On page 9 which is at paragraph 31 of you affidavit it informs that Mr 
Vimal Rama was an employee of the IDC and so when we go to page 99 
and look at this document on closer inspection the first striking aspect 
20 
of the document is that it is unsigned.  In your view Ms Loock what 
exactly would this document – does this document describe? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  This document contains all the airports that 
were SA Express was operating to.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your voice a bit. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 11 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The document contains all the airports that SA 
Express operated to Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And when you say all the airports 
that it operated to are you then including the ACSA airports as well? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And just then for the record the 
airports as listed in this document on the far left hand side is 
Bloemfontein, 
Cape 
Town, 
Durban, 
East 
London, 
George, 
10 
Johannesburg, Kimberly, Port Elizabeth, Richards Bay, Pilanesberg and 
Denel aviation.  Below appears to be another tag on table which reads 
to Denel aviation and alongside that details a pump back per hour 
defuel per hour and a storage per day.  Let us first deal with this aspect 
before we deal with the – all the airports.  What in your understanding 
with the bottom part of this table represent where it details the Denel 
aviation and detail? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I am not that technically advanced on the – or 
can comment on a technical side that much however this looks like it 
relates to the requirements that technical had on the defueling and the 
20 
refuelling of the aircraft. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so that would be the one 
operational requirement that EML was required to provide services on 
to SA Express Technical, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 12 of 130 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then when we look at the 
balance of this table which is dated July 2017 in the second column 
reading this table from left to right there appears an IATA code for each 
airport, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the next column talks to – well it 
is titled SAX being presumably SA Express and it details a long list 
alongside – sorry not a long list – it details numbers alongside each 
airport, do you see that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I do Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What would that mean to you? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In this context it seems like the litres of fuel to 
be supplied Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct that this table 
represents litres of fuel to all of the airports including the ACSA 
airports? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who did SA Express obtain its 
supply of fuel at the ACSA airports? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  We obtained via SAA Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was in line with an existing 
agreement that was in place? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So just to highlight two of these 
quantities. What is the quantity for Johannesburg? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 13 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  21 200 000 litres. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the quantity for Pilanesberg? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  436 800 litres Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How does the number 436 800 align 
or not align with the actual operational requirement of SA Express at 
Pilanesberg airport? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It does not align with the calculations that we 
did Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Alongside the next column appears to 
be an index and then the following column lists… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Ms Loock you indicated that you do not know 
the technical side that is required to deal with this document but you 
can talk to certain things, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Now I just want to make – to make sure that 
where you give evidence about it it is something that is not speculation, 
it is something that you are confident of, you are sure of okay.  The 
figures that appear under the column that has got SAX can you see 
those? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us start first. SAX do you know what it stands for? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  SA Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that the – the numbers that are written there at 
the bottom there is R which appears to be – that is Denel aviation this 
is R1 000,00, is that right?  Is that R1 000,00? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 14 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Ja that is what I also saw Chair so it confuses 
me slightly it states R1 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It states R1 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Under that column that is why I do not 
understand the reasoning behind that and I cannot comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and interestingly while at the bottom the number 
that appears there is R1 000,00 it has got R for rands.  The other 
numbers that appear above it do not have a R.  So I do not know 
10 
whether they are meant to be prices to be rands or whether it is meant 
to be something else like litres.  Are you able to throw any light on 
that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No Chair it is the same for me.  There is no 
rand value next to it and there is no litre indication on it as well Chair 
so you cannot confirm establish with the table at the bottom Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is it that you are able to say about this 
document? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  If I relay to the – the amount of litres that SA 
Express used with – within a year it relates close to the let us say an 
20 
average of 24 million litres a year for the Johannesburg route so I am 
well aware of that quantities which then indicates to me that the table 
refers to litres.  If I read 21 200 for OR Tambo or Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say that – that figure next to Johannesburg is 
close to the amount of litres of fuel. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 15 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That SA Express used for Johannesburg over what 
period? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  During this period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the period?  Per year, per month, per what? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I had a review.  The calculations was based 
on the 2017 January to December usage which was around about 21 to 
24 million litres.  So if I look at this table it relates close to litres for 
me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do not know about you but I see that there is a 
10 
reference to July 2017 but I do not know whether the intention is to say 
all this information here related to July 2017 or whether that is just 
indicates when this document was produced and other than that 
reference to a date I cannot see anything that indicates whether we are 
talking about one month or we talk about a year, we talk about six 
months, are you able to throw any light on that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No Sir those were my comments as well to the 
team that there is no indication is this per annum, is this per month?  
So yes it is a very vague document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay what else are you able to say about this 
20 
document other than that the – well that figure next to Johannesburg it 
is actually 21 200 000 is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you are saying that figure is quite close to 
what you understand SAA to use – to have used in terms of the amount 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 16 of 130 
 
of fuel for Johannesburg over what period? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  A period from January to December 2017 it is 
fuel used… 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the year?  Ja for the calendar year. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  For Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of 2017. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  For SA Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms September. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  If we could then just look 
at this table quickly.  It is at then page – we still on page 100.  Sorry 
just lost the page.  Is it correct that this – the numbers that align – that 
is reflected in here is for Pilanesberg is nowhere near what the 
operational requirement was at the Pilanesberg airport however so 
calculated.   
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  If you look at the calculation that we did at 
8 500 litres per week it comes to 442 000 litres per annum.  In – 
because there is no clarity on this document from EML specifying if it is 
litres or rands the quantity indicated next to Pilanesberg is 436 800 
20 
which is slightly less than the litres that was worked out Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Thank you.  But this document 
was in fact unsigned, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and just one last point.  The 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 17 of 130 
 
literage ali – the literage that appears next to Denel Aviation pump 
back and defuel.  Is it correct that in providing the service of defueling 
and refuelling actual fuel would need to be provided to refuel the 
aircraft after it has been fixed? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Under my understanding on the defueling not 
because then you remove the fuel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  But obviously with the refuelling or fuelling yes 
there would be fuel required Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 
10 
102 please.  At the bottom of the page – Chair this is again a string of 
emails which reads from bottom to top in line with the sequence of 
emails provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at least if you read them bottom to top that shows 
how they happened in reality. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I have a problem with is if you read first an 
email that came later and read last an email that came earlier.  So but 
if you read bottom to – bottom to top that – that ensures you read first 
the email that came first and then the response.  Is it not? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Loock the email at the bottom of 
page 1-0-2 is an email from Eric – EML Energy – sent on Thursday July, 
the 13 t h 2017 to Sibongile Vilakazi and Ms – Dr Sam Vilakazi appears to 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 18 of 130 
 
be copied on this communication as well in addition to Tshenolo from 
EML Energy and its subject title is “Award Letter Fuel Supply”.  It 
reads: 
“Best Sibongile, please note that the scope of work 
is on the proposal but I have tried to summarise 
under correction on volumes and locations it as 
follows.” 
EML scope of work is then documented on page 1-0-3 and it 
includes a range of services and if one were to look midway in this 
page it not only includes refuelling and defueling and on the ninth 
10 
question mark or bullet point it reads: 
“Monthly fuel price submission determined by the 
variants basic fuel price of refineries plus a margin 
based on overheads, operating costs and profits.  
Prices to be submitted, negotiated and approved by 
the Commodity Manager and/or procurement.  A 
monthly forecast of volume is required from SA 
Express.” 
And then it goes on to inform that: 
“It also includes operate and maintain the fuel 
20 
farms, bowsers and trailers at specified locations.” 
Additional services below are informed to that which relate to 
diesel and petrol fuel and so on the last point under additional services 
it also records: 
“Monthly fuel price to be determined by the landed 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 19 of 130 
 
costs of depot supply plus a margin as determined 
based on overheads operating costs and profits.” 
And it is sent by – signed off by Mr Eric Motlhake.  In 
response to that email on page 1-0-2 or sorry a follow up email from 
Mr Eric Motlhake on the 14 t h which is the next day at 09:18.  He sends 
an email again to Sibongile Vilakazi copying the same people with the 
same subject title and it says: 
“Best Sibongile, please note the adjustments in red 
as per the requirement by IDC Funding which does 
require the drawdown for guarantees only done 
10 
one.” 
And a follow up email to that sent later on the same day is 
once again sent by Eric Motlhake to this time Samuel Vilakazi and 
Tshenolo is copied in on the email and it reads: 
“Best Sam, in light with our submission we have 
attached 
the 
SA 
Express 
Pricing 
Scheduled 
Proposal which we need signed off if approved.  We 
urgently need this document for submission for our 
funders to release guarantees.” 
And so if I can then take you to page 1-0-9 and you will note 
20 
there Ms Loock that this is an enclosing email by Dr Samuel Vilakazi 
three days later on 17 July 2017 at 15:57 which is sent to Eric of EML 
Energy and it forwards an attachment.  The email reads: 
“Mr Motlhake attached find the signed document as 
requested.”

And when you then go to page 1-1-1 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September let the witness give evidence. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  On page 1-1-1 
there appears a table.  Do you recognise this table relative to the 
documents that you have since seen? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is this table? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  This table is the same table that was provided 
for the IDC Funding and … 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it – please continue. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  And it has got a signature of Samuel Vilakazi 
on the document Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTMBER:  And the designation of Samuel Vilakazi 
as indicated on this document is? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The Chief Procurement Officer Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this table is dated what …? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  July 2017 Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how does this table compare to 
the previous table that you had a look at earlier? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It looks like the same table Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  By way of example if you look at the 
Johannesburg and Pilanesberg lines what is the litreage that is 
referenced in respect of these two stations? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Shall I read it Chair? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 21 of 130 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Johannesburg 21 200 000, Pilanesberg 436 800 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is then no different from the 
previous table.  Is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Are you aware as to 
whether or not an agreement was in fact concluded between SA 
Express and EML Energy? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Only at the later stage when it was sent to my 
10 
Divisional Manager that I was aware that there was a contract signed 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if I can then ask you to turn to 
page 1-1-5 what document appears there? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  This is an email from Sibongile Vilakazi to Eric 
from EML Energy copied in was Tshenolo from EML Energy.  The 
subjected was “Agreement EML” and there was an attachment which 
reads: 
“Agreement for EML 24 July 2017 PDF SAX Pricing 
Schedule.” 
20 
Obviously two attachments to it and then: 
“Good day again, kindly receive attached for 
signature.  Regards, Sibongile S Vilakazi.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this email is dated 24 July 2017 
sent at 14:23.  Is that right? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 22 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If one then turns to page 1-1-7 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to where the attachment is – is 
supposed to be? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-1-7 is that where we will find the attachment 
referred to in the email at page 1-1-5? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The attachment is not attached to 
this particular piece of correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have it in the pack? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am informed that it certainly the 
same document that was signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see that email saying kindly receive the attached 
for signature cannot be important for anything if there is no attachment.  
It can only be important if what is attached is important.  So I would 
expect that the attachment is there but I see that I do not see it here.  I 
thought maybe it is somewhere else in the bundle.  Otherwise that 
email is not significant for anything. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  These particular documents we 
accept that Ms Loock does not have personal knowledge about and so 
these documents were certainly presented to her by the Commission’s 
investigators.  Having said that though I am informed that the same 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 23 of 130 
 
signed document which appears at page 1-1-1 is in fact the document 
that is being referred to and I am led by the instructions that I have 
received from the investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but then why would we take her to an email about 
which she knows nothing?  You understand my concern? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I fully understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if the – if the attachment referred to in that email 
is in the bundle I think it would be important to refer to it but if also 
10 
depends whether that attachment is of any importance and whether she 
has any evidence to give about it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  I do not have the 
attachment to this particular email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us confine the witness to documents about 
which she can contribute something for the Commission in terms of her 
… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Agreed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Personal knowledge. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Agreed Chair.  If I can then take you 
to page 11 of your affidavit.  You mentioned at some stage – sorry – 
you mentioned earlier that you had subsequently learnt that a contract 
was in fact signed between EML and SA Express.  Is that right? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 24 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can ask you to then go to page 
1-2-2 of the bundle please?  Do you recognise this document? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  This document is the agreement Supply of Jet 
Fuel between SA Express and EML Engineers.  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I ask you to turn to 
page 1-2-4 please and at paragraph 2.2.2 the commencement date is 
indicated as what date? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  2.2.2 reads: 
“Commencement 
date 
means 
1 July 2017 
10 
notwithstanding the signature date.” 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to that end can I then take you 
to page 1-3-9?  On what dates were – was this agreement signed firstly 
by SA Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  This agreement was signed by SA Express on 
7 August 2017. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who signed on behalf of SA 
Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The – the name for the signature was 
20 
Victor Xaba as Acting Chief Executive Officer but the signature on here 
is Merriam Mochoele.  That I recognise Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is Victor Xaba – X-A-B-A, okay.  
Continue. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 25 of 130 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Xaba apologies Chair yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And you recognise that signature to 
be that of other than Mr Xaba? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes as there is a TP next to the signature which 
the signature looks like Merriam Mochoele’s signature. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who is Merriam Mochoele please 
– if you could remind us for the record? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  She was the Chairperson of the BAC and also 
the General Manager for the Legal Department at SA Express Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and then could I ask you 
10 
to – it appears that the signature for SA Express was not witnessed but 
if you could then turn to the signature on behalf of EML.  Can you 
identify who signs the document on behalf of EML please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would she know – would she know them? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would she know people at EML? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No, she could she read the names as 
it appears below the signature. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I can see the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it does not necessarily mean – mean that is the 
20 
same person. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The name as I can see it is Eric Motlhake – 
which I cannot read out – Legodi Motlhake Chief Executive Officer. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and that has been 
witnessed or rather those signatures have been witnessed and it is 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 26 of 130 
 
signed on what date? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It is signed on 24 July 2017 Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I ask you to turn to 
page 1-2-6 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 1-2-6? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  At paragraph 3 the scope 
of work and description of services as outlined.  Please read paragraph 
3.1 into the record. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  “To aggressively market SA Express 
with the aim of restoring the reputation of the brand 
10 
as set out in Annexure A which is attached hereto.” 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so can I then ask you to turn to 
page 1-4-0 which is Annexure A?  You will note there that there are two 
categories of scopes.  The first is highlighted as scope of work and 
below is a listing of additional services related to diesel and petrol fuel. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Under the first bullet under scope of 
work please read that into the record? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  “Guarantee the monthly availability of 
20 
Jet A1 product to the value of R67 million at all 
locations required by SAX.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the third bullet please. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  “Ordering, transporting and receipt of 
fuel from refineries into plane.” 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 27 of 130 
 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And two below that beginning with: 
“Refuel …” 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  “Refuel of aircraft at locations as 
determined by SAX.” 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the next one as well please. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  “Defuel of aircraft on call at a set 
charge for defuel and fuel storage costs.  Fuel 
stored will be credited to client.” 
10 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And having looked – have you looked 
at this agreement Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I have gone through this agreement Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you understand how the value of 
67 million is computed? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I do not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly if I could ask you to 
turn to page 1-2-7? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  1-2-7; paragraph 6 talks to the 
duration of the agreement. Please read paragraph 6.1 into the record. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  “This agreement shall commence on 
1 July 2017 and shall continue for a term of 36 
months unless terminated in accordance with the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 28 of 130 
 
provisions of this agreement or otherwise in 
accordance with the law.” 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now could I ask you to turn to page 
12?  Oops sorry – humble apologies.  Last main important point is on 
page 1-4-3.  Do you recognise this document Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes this is the same table that was sent to IDC 
and also then was the attachment – it is an attachment to the 
agreement this table Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and who signs this 
10 
agreement if you can recognise those signatures at all? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The signature here is a PP signature which 
looks like Merriam Mochoele.  The name under there is V Xaba – if I 
correct that and designated Acting CEO Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and just to look again to 
examples of similarity.  If you look at Johannesburg and Pilanesberg 
what litreage is referenced there under each station? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Johannesburg once again is 21 200 000 and 
Pilanesberg 436 800 Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I then ask you to 
20 
turn to page 12 of your affidavit please - paragraph 42?  What 
happened around July/August 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Because I and Gavin shared an office Gavin 
indicated to me during this period that he was requested by 
Dave Allenby to make a comparison of prices between the SAA Pricing 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 29 of 130 
 
and EML.  It was based on the EML Pricing Schedule that was provided 
by Mr Allenby to Mr Fourie.  They – Mr Fourie went through the – the 
same – similar table that we just referred to now where there was 
nothing on that table. 
It was an empty table with just all the - the numbers on and I 
can remember Gavin indicated by hand he did a pricing comparison on 
the right hand side of that table – SAA Pricing versus the EML Pricing 
and from that I know that Gavin concluded with that that there was a 30 
percent hike in the price Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 1-4-5 
10 
please?  Once again we have what appears to be exactly the same 
table.  Is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There is handwritten markings on the 
right hand side.  Do you recognise that handwritten at all? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes that is Gavin Fourie’s handwritten. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair for the – Chair for the record 
the affidavit of Gavin Fourie which forms part of this bundle under Tab 
three page 3 paragraphs 9 to 10 certainly corroborates what the – what 
the witness has said. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then go back to page 12.  
We are on page – paragraph 43.  What happens on 18 October 2017 
Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Around 18 October Mr Jacques Beck which is 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 30 of 130 
 
the Divisional Manager for Airport Operations received the EML 
Contract as an attachment from Sibongile Vilakazi and then Mr Fourie 
printed this contract because he was also copied in on it and which I 
then saw basically for the first time that it was fully signed off and that 
reviewed the scope of service that was on the table that was signed off 
for SA Express Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And was this – had you seen the 
contract before this date? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I did not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So your involvement in this process 
10 
ended after you requested the quotation – a copy of the quotation you 
have never seen if one was ever received at all.  Is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this is then the next occasion 
that you learn of any documentation in relation to this process? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  What was your problem 
if you had a problem at all with this contract? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The problem with this was that the services that 
were required was only two which was on the technical side after 
20 
refuelling and defueling and obviously on the Pilanesberg side where 
fuel was required for operation.  However this contract contained every 
single station that SA Express operated to which was a concern as I 
was already – I was aware that there was an SAA Agreement for fuel at 
that ACSA airports.  However all of those were included in this 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 31 of 130 
 
agreement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were two of the problems with regard to this contract 
that one it had not – its conclusion had not been preceded by 
compliance with any procurement processes and two the discussion had 
been in regard to only two stations but the agreement included all 
stations.  Were those two of the problems that you – you highlight 
about this contract? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The biggest problem in this agreement that it 
contains other stations other than what was deviated for Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja that is – that is the second one that I 
10 
mentioned. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the first concern also applicable or not applicable? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The concern of …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of whether procurement procedures were followed 
before the contract was concluded? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Whether the correct procurement procedures 
were followed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes Chair that is correct ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that one of your concerns … 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About it? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That was also a concern yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Are there other concerns that you want 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 32 of 130 
 
to articulate or to highlight about this contract other than those two? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Maybe just to amplify how does this 
agreement affect the SAA – SA Express Jet A1 Fuel Agreement if at all? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Personally for me is that not – may I say the 
word “breach of agreement”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you speak a little louder please? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Can I say “breach of agreement” perhaps 
because we already have a service provider providing fuel through SAA 
10 
to our ACSA stations.  On to – on this agreement it puts all those 
stations on this agreement but supplied by EML which does not make 
sense.  You cannot have two service providers providing the same 
service Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So another concern was not that – not simply that it 
went beyond two stations but actually that it created duplications? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have situations where you have got two people 
how must do the same thing? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then another concern was it not that in 
relation to either prices or litres of fuel required these were inflated 
either in all cases or in some cases? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just think carefully in terms of what you have said.  I 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 33 of 130 
 
am trying to recall what I thought you said.  If you did not say that you 
must just say no, no that is not my understanding.  My understanding is 
the following. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Chair how I would also have it is the 30 percent 
increase in the pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Second is the provision to stations where we 
already had an agreement with SAA … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  And obvious – ja the escalation – the – the 
10 
price the services to stations that were already supplied by SAA.  Yes 
that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So after you learnt about 
this agreement what steps did you take - if any?  Did you raise anything 
with anyone within SA Express about this agreement? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes.  I had discussions with my General 
Manager – Dave Allenby – about the concerns and as my affidavit 
states as well sharing an office with Gavin – Gavin Fourie also had a 
communication with Dave Allenby.  We – concerns were raised with the 
20 
pricing comparison especially on the 30 percent and there are emails 
confirming these conversations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On that can I then take you to page 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 34 of 130 
 
1-4-8 please which actually begins at the bottom of 1-4-7?  Were you 
aware of this email communication exchange Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 1-4-7? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  1-4-7 Chair and we will be reading 
the emails in – in order of sending not in order of print.  In fact let us 
start rather on page 1- … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just repeat the question in relation to 1-4-7? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  Can I perhaps let us start on 
1-4-8 Chair?  In the middle of the page is an email sent from 
10 
Jacques Beck on 18 October 2017 09:04 am and it is sent to 
Gavin Fourie.  Subject title EML Contract and it appears to only read: 
“EML Contract, signed.” 
Ms Loock the next communication in response starts on page 147 at the 
bottom of the page, can you see that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    That is correct, that’s the email from Gavin 
Fourie to Dave Allenby Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes and it’s sent on the 18 t h of 
October 2017 at 9.57 am is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the next page, whose copied on 
this email? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    It would be Ian Finlay, Captain Ian Finlay and 
Jacques Beck is copied on this email Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please read the contents of the email 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 35 of 130 
 
into the record. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    “Hi Dave, what am I missing here, with the 
 
price quoted in Annexure B, surely we can’t enter into a 
 
contract like this.  Prices are approximately 30% higher than 
 
what we are currently paying at SAA, Regards Gavin”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Then if you go to page 147, there 
appears an email from Mr Peter Culver to Matsietsi Mokholo on 
February 21 s t, 2018 at 10.52 am can you please read this email into the 
record 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    This email is only Peter Culver that forwarded 
10 
all the below emails to our new acting CEO which was Matsietsi 
Mokholo which states, 
 
“For your information madam”, 
 
Below that was the email from Dave that responded to Gavin’s 
email that was dated on the 18 t h of October at 1.30 pm Chair, should I 
read that email? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes please. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    “Afeternoon Gavin, before this concern grows 
legs allow me to clarify on what I have gleaned.  1) I too was taken 
aback but have subsequently seen the date of signature.  2) This was 
20 
an approved contract via a Saturday Exco round robin in order for 
SACS to use the services of EML to defuel CRJ200 standing at Denel 
(the normal service providers required 24 hours’ advance notice in 
order to supply the dedicated bowser).  3) You will see that Peter 
Culver is to manage the relationship.  4) This is not a carte blanche 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 36 of 130 
 
change of fuel service provider countrywide. 5) There are, however, 
ongoing discussions with EML with regards to the possible supply of 
fuel at our problematic stations NTY and HDS, NTY standing for Sun 
City and HDS standing for Hoedspruit.  I hope this allays your fears, 
Regards Dave”.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Does that email communication talk 
about the supply of fuel at all in relation to the world – sorry not the 
world, the countrywide supply of fuel to all stations at which SA 
Express operates? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    No it does not Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you and Mr Fourie have any 
discussion about Mr Allenby’s email? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Yes we did ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what was it about? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    We were both concerned and regarding the 
reply and I remember that we said that we weren’t happy with the reply 
especially with the table that we saw, we weren’t happy Chair. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
Were 
you 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation of this – or would you have been involved, sorry, in the 
implementation of this agreement? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    No Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And then lastly did you do anything 
or take any steps after learning about this agreement? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Yes I did, at the time then, after me and 
Gavin’s discussions I took this matter further to Mr Timothy Ngwenya 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 37 of 130 
 
who is our head of security at SA Express and I advised of the 
document and our concerns relating to the matter and requested that it 
be further investigated Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And did you raise any concerns to 
him about verification of invoices? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Yes I advised then – I advised my General 
Manager Dave Allenby that I would not be verifying any invoices for 
EML. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you were then, in fact involved 
somehow, in the implementation of the agreement. 
10 
MS 
ESTELLE 
LOOCK: 
 
 
 
Yes 
in 
some 
sort 
of 
way 
because…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she was saying she would refuse to be part of 
the implementation, that’s what she’s saying. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me rephrase then, the role that 
you held and that you hold which is Airports Coordinator does that role 
require verification of any invoices that arise out of this agreement? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    As part of my duties, I verify invoices which – 
in this case because it’s a privately owned airport Chair, the invoices 
20 
for the fuel would have come through operations who would have been 
me to verify which would then be going to our General Manager, Dave 
Allenby for authorisation and with this regard and notifying Timothy 
about the problem I advised my General Manager that I will not be 
verifying any invoices for EML Chair. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 38 of 130 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Is Mr Xaba still part of 
SA Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    No he’s not he’s left SA Express Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who became the acting CEO 
after Mr Xaba? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Around November 2017 a Ms Matsietsi 
Mokholo became acting CEO of SA Express. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and then do you know 
whether or not anything has arisen following your complaint that was 
laid to the head of security, Mr Timothy Ngwenya what was the outcome 
10 
– was there any investigation conducted? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    I did not get feedback as this investigation 
would have been on a higher level, for me I have advised them that 
they need to look into the matter, a couple of times I did touch base 
with Timothy to find out and it was indicated that they are busy looking 
into the matter and that is where I left it Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Had there been any steps taken 
against any individuals arising out of this contract? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Yes some of the people that had been 
involved in this were suspended from SA Express Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And lastly what has happened to this 
particular contract, that we’ve spoken about today concluded between 
South African Express Airways and EML? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    For my own – for myself, after I reported the 
matter I did go to our finance department to double check and see if 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 39 of 130 
 
there were any payments made to EML Chair and it was assured to me 
that there was only one payment around R90 000 I’m talking under 
correction R80 000/R90 000 that was made to EML with regards to the 
defueling and refuelling of aircraft, other than that no further payments 
were made Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair, Chair that is 
certainly the evidence of this witness which is augmented by the signed 
affidavit of Mr Gavin Fourie found under tab 3 of the bundle and it’s at 
least corroborated to the extent of where Ms Loock refers to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well any affidavit that you want as corroboration will 
10 
have to be 1) at least it’s important features must be publicly read out 
or mentioned and to the extent that it may affect anybody else, it would 
have to be – copies would have to be sent to such persons so that they 
can comment or say if they want to dispute anything that he or she 
corroborates by way of an affidavit, then in that way if we don’t call that 
person then we are able to say, those it refers to was given an 
opportunity to indicate if they have anything to challenge and they 
didn’t but that’s – the legal team is aware of that, it’s not something 
new, I think Ms Hofmeyr wants to assure you that it will be taken care 
of. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can address you on the second 
point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Although it may have been – I don’t 
have the particular dates with me right now, it may have been shorter 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 40 of 130 
 
notice than the 14-day period, notices have certainly been sent to 
persons who are or may be implicated by the affidavit of Mr Gavin 
Fourie. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So we as the legal team are at least 
satisfied that those persons have been notified. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I’m guided by you as to how you wish 
the affidavit to be read…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    No, no, if that’s been done, it’s okay, I’m simply 
10 
saying that those affidavits where the intention is not to call the person 
to come and give oral evidence, at some stage they need to- the public 
needs to be told of, at least the main features of the affidavit that may 
not be done now, arrangements can be made for it to be done – for that 
to be done at a later stage. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    As it pleases Chair, in conclusion 
then it’s our submission that through the evidence that has been led 
through this witness, the three questions certainly arise, as I alluded to 
and the introduction…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Before that, let me just say – you said that – did you 
20 
say it’s Mr Xaba who is no longer with SA Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    That is correct Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened to him, did he resign, was he 
dismissed? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    He did – yes he did resign sir 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 41 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he suspended at any stage before he resigned? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    No sir no he resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Dr Vilakazi is he still there? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    No Dr Vilakazi was suspended sir – Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
How 
long 
ago 
was 
that 
– 
you 
can’t 
remember…(intervention). 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Beginning of 2018 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Beginning of 2018? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What has happened to that, has there been a hearing, 
10 
has there been no hearing, is he still on suspension, has he resigned 
has he been dismissed, do you know? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Chair that is our Human…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t know. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    No I don’t, the Human Capital can actually 
respond to that request Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No then that’s fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted to say something? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just one concluding remark and that 
20 
is through the evidence of Ms Loock together with evidence that is yet 
to be led the question shall remain as to whether or not the 
procurement processes relevant – relative sorry to the supply of jet fuel 
and the conclusion of the agreement with EML was borne out of 
fraudulent of even corrupt activities to the extent that proper 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 42 of 130 
 
procurement processes were not followed or any other actions may or 
may not have been taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Loock thank you very much for having come 
forward to give evidence, thank you very much you are excused. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it’s time for the tea break so the change over 
can happen during the tea break, we’ll take the tea adjournment, it’s 
twenty past now we’ll resume at twenty five to twelve, we adjourn.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we have Mr Mark Vaughan as our next 
witness on the topic of jet fuel procurement.  If I may for record 
purposes request that we enter his bundle as Exhibit DD11 into the 
20 
record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch containing Mr Mark Vaughan’s 
statement and annexures will be marked as Exhibit DD11. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  And then if I could request 
the witness to be sworn in we can proceed? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 43 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please swear in the witness or administer the 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Mark Edmund Vaughan. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so 
please raise your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Vaughan just to orientate 
you in relation to the two files you see in front of you at the witness 
table. The bigger file in front of you which I will refer to as Exhibit 
DD11 contains your affidavit and annexures and then next to that is the 
20 
bundle from the preceding witness Ms Loock.  I have asked that it 
remain there just because there was an aspect Chair in the evidence of 
Ms Loock where she indicated a limited personal knowledge of certain 
documents.  Mr Vaughan expect will be able to fill in that gap for us 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 44 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we will just take him there at the 
appropriate point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan if you open up your file which is 
Exhibit DD11 you will see at page 1 and the pagination you will find at 
the top right hand corner of the page is a document headed “Affidavit” 
and it runs to page 21 of that bundle.  Can you confirm that that is your 
affidavit deposed to on the 7 June 2019? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan I know that there is at least one 
10 
correction you wanted to make on the affidavit which I propose to take 
you to when we get there in the evidence.  But over and above that are 
there any other changes you wish to make? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No, no other changes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we can then begin on page 1 Mr 
Vaughan.  Could you explain to us what your position is at SAA and the 
period for which you have been in SAA’s employ? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I am currently the head of fuel at 
South African Airways and I have been in the employment of SAA for 36 
years. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You probably do not know any other employer? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You absolutely right.  I joined SAA 
straight out of school and started as an apprentice aircraft mechanic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Vaughan for what period have you held 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 45 of 130 
 
the position of head of fuel management? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It has been for five years now if I am 
not mistaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think at paragraph 1 you say you occupied it 
from the end of 2013, correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Absolutely. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then in paragraph 3 on that first 
page you detail what the functions of the head of – well the functions of 
fuel management are generally.  Could you take us through those? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so fuel management manages 
10 
the fuel for South African Airways and the groups which will be Mango 
and SA Cargo as well as there is a contract in place to administer the 
fuel for SA Express and when we talk about the process that it involves 
it is to ensure the quality or the oversight of the quality of the fuel that 
is the main thing.  Thereafter security of supply.  Getting the fuel at the 
best prices and then of course paying for the fuel thereafter.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you mentioned in your evidence a moment 
ago that there was some arrangement between SAA and SA Express in 
relation to fuel.  If you turn over the page to page 2 as I have it you 
pick that up from paragraph 4 where you start to describe the nature of 
20 
that relationship.  Could you please explain it to us? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so the relationship with SA 
Express as I say it is – had an administrative role Chair.  There was an 
agreement the last agreement was signed in August of 2011 by my 
predecessor.  There is a clause in there that it does renew on a yearly 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 46 of 130 
 
basis if there is not any significant change to the management of this 
fuel and that admin fees that is just for the administration portion of the 
– of fuel will be reviewed on a yearly basis as inflationary pressures or 
the change in the – in the operation requires.  If there is as I said if 
there is that is just on the payment on a yearly. If there is so significant 
change both parties can just carry on with that 2011 agreement which is 
in place to this day. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you mentioned a moment ago that the 
agreement governs the administration of aviation fuel.  If you look at 
paragraph 4 of your affidavit though you also indicate there that it 
10 
includes the procurement of aviation fuel.  How does that work? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so it is – does include the 
procurement.  So we look at that as part of the administration so the 
procurement process.  So what we would do we procure for the group 
including SA Express we have got the economies of scale there.  We 
come to an agreement with the most competitive fuel suppliers.  We 
then give SA Express that fuel at the same price as what SAA gets it at.  
There is no mark-up or anything.  The recovery of any funds for the 
work done is done through the administration, the administrative 
agreement. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just if you may expand a little more on the 
economies of scale available to SAA? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does that mean ultimately for the price at 
which you can procure fuel? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 47 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Well SA Express – SAA procures 
significantly more fuel that SA Express.  So with them coming or 
latching onto our contracts it gives them – it gives us the opportunity to 
negotiate better with the suppliers because of the volumes which would 
be a better price for SA Express as well.  So they benefit from that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we go to paragraph 6 
on page 2.  You indicate precisely which stations the SAA and SA 
Express agreement applied to.  Could you also explain that to us? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes Chair I can do that.  So the intent 
of the agreement from the beginning was for SAA to procure for SA 
10 
Express at the ACSA locations and also airports that SAA also flew to.  
And that would be obviously so they shared locations.  Any location 
that SA Express might have decided to go on their own for instance 
Pilanesberg, Mafikeng or – and Hoedspruit they – anything that was – 
came on afterwards they – SA Express went alone on that – that 
particular process.  They did not – it did not form part of the SAA 
process.  I do not know if that answers Chair? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Thank you.  And so if you just go over the 
page to 3.  As I have your evidence you have indicated at least three 
locations where SA Express was required to do its own procurement.  
20 
That was Mafikeng, Hoedspruit and Pilanesberg but over the page at 3 
you indicate the locations where they could rely on SAA as I have your 
affidavit, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct.  Would you like me 
to… 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 48 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Mention the stations so… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you would just give us those. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It is OR Tambo, it would be Richards 
Bay, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, George, Cape Town, 
Bloemfontein and Kimberley.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did check to read that you got all of those.  I 
noticed you did not need to read them you did it purely from memory. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you have not left out any of them. 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do not think I have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At paragraph 6.  So we are indebted to you.  Mr 
Vaughan if you do go over the page to page 3 you will see there a 
heading in your affidavit and that I understand it is where you would 
like to make one correction.  Could you just tell us what you want that 
heading to read as? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair.  I would like that 
heading to read as SAA Pushes for Transformation.  There were 
obviously parties that were part of that transformation EML being one 
of them.  So it was SAA pushes for transformation. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we can just delete… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry is that the heading/ 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay how should it read? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I would say SAA pushes for 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 49 of 130 
 
transformation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pushes for transformation? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: In other words deleting EML and… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  EML would probably form part of that 
transformation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  But there is also other parties that 
Chair that form part of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we go to paragraph 7 
on that page.  You start to deal with what you describe in paragraph 7 
as huge pressure from the board in a push for transformation.  Can you 
tell us about that and which board you speak of when you make these 
comments? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay first of all the board that I refer 
to is the Ms Meyene board, Doctor Thambi and Ms Kwinana. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is a particular board and that 
would be from 2013 – the end of 2013 when I took over as head of fuel 
through to the end of 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh Mr Vaughan we will come back to the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 50 of 130 
 
change that occurs in the board in late 2016 but can I just get clear 
from you as chair – so far a chairperson of the board is concerned you 
mentioned Ms Meyene did she occupy that position for the period that 
you describe? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I believe so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will come back to the positions of Ms 
Kwinana and Doctor Thambi because as I have it from later in your 
affidavit there is a change, they do leave at a point in 2016.  So they 
are not there for the full duration to the end of 2017 that you have 
described. 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I believe so with – ja I believe so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well we will go to it at the appropriate point if 
we may? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I – the board – you are quite right with 
the change of board I think Ms Meyene only left towards the end of 
2017 if I am not mistaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just to get the evidence clear if I may.  Ms 
Meyene occupied the position of chair for the period that you 
20 
describe… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are quite right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In paragraph 7.  You however reference two 
other members of the board who occupied positions on the board for a 
substantial period within that, is that correct? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 51 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But there is a change that we will come to in 
due course towards the end of 2016, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And you go on at paragraph a8 to 
talk about the significant barriers to entry for new participants in the jet 
fuel market.  Can you take us through that?  What are the issues? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The barriers of entry that I am 
referring to there are for a – if you have a look at the jet fuel industry 
across the world in actual fact you will see it is the big players that 
10 
operate in this space.  In other words the refiners, the big traders of 
the world and you see very few small companies that operate there.  So 
the barriers to entry really for small companies is because they do not 
have the economies of scale.  So that is the one thing you do not -  the 
margins are so small for jet fuel that you generally have the big players 
there.  So for a small company the barriers of entry would be first of all 
to get agreements in place to get the licences to operate at an airport 
so that comes at a cost which eats further into your margins which are 
very small in the first place.  There is also a billion dollar insurance 
that is required to indemnify the – your person that you are contracting 
20 
with.  So that comes at a substantial cost as well.  Then there are of 
course you also have to insure that you have the correct – the correct 
specification of fuel and the quality and there are agreements that need 
to be got as far as that is concerned in the form – well there are 
agreements that are needed and that comes at a cost as well. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 52 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we just pause for a moment on that one 
billion insurance.  What is that required for? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so the billion dollar insurance as 
I said it is in order for you to indemnify the party that you are 
contracting with in the event of a total loss of an aircraft due to sub-
standard fuel or even the delivery of the fuel to an aircraft where you 
might have a fire.  So if you have a look at an airline like South African 
Airways that operates large aircraft like the A3 40-600 the – in the – if 
you have – the insurers obviously look at what it would cost if there 
was any claim in the case of negligence and that would in most cases 
10 
for an aircraft that size would equate to a billion dollars and sometimes 
even more depending on the passengers that you carrying and what the 
form of loss was.  So that is where it is.  So in order – so with SAA SAA 
hold third party liability insurance.  We then expect through our legal 
and our procurement process that anyone that we contract with 
indemnifies us so they would have to hold the billion dollars and then 
going down the line it is goes further down the line.  So it is the 
indemnification of the person that you contracting with in case of a 
claim. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It sounds from your answer that there are some 
20 
risks associated with providing jet fuel to aircraft, is that the case? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  There are risks and that is why there 
is a lot of rules in place and legislation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you mentioned fires, is that – is that one of 
the things that can happen? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 53 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That could be. As I mentioned fire and 
of course – because that would be – that would result in a total loss of 
an aircraft.  So total loss of an aircraft would result of sub-standard 
fuel you have a flame out and the aircraft potentially crashes or on the 
delivery of fuel you working with volatile substances or liquids and if it 
is not delivered correctly and it is not earthed properly you could set 
the aircraft alight. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair we will in due course in Mr 
Vaughan’s evidence go through that whole process of how you get jet 
fuel into an airplane.  It does have some significance just to 
10 
understanding the types of agreements that were being entered into but 
we will come to that in a moment if we may?  Mr Vaughan at paragraph 
10 on page 4 you do indicate there a sympathy on SAA’s part to try and 
get new entrance into this field.  Can you tell us about the origins of 
that sympathy and what was done to try and open up this market? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair there was sympathy from SAA’s 
side on transformation.  It was from I think a two tier approach 
obviously we wanted to see transformation in South Africa.  Secondly it 
is also SAA’s BEE scorecard was really bad if you look at it as a – and 
I think there was also pressure – there was pressure on to improve 
20 
that.  With jet fuel being one – the largest spend it takes – it is either 
salaries or jet fuel depending on the oil price but jet fuel being the 
largest procuring spend there was pressure on that we have 
transformation on who we are contracting with so that we could improve 
our scorecard.  There were proposals made at various juncture where 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 54 of 130 
 
we would speak to suppliers to see – because obviously that would be 
the one so if you have a look at who we procure fuel from is normally 
the oil majors or the big traders.  So we were talking to the oil majors 
that have refineries in South Africa to encourage them to improve their 
scorecards so of course that helps SAA but it does not help us to the 
full extent because it is only a contracting party that has got a level 1 
or a level 2 or a level 3 compared to what we were.  So we did engage 
with them although – I mean I must say the oil majors had put a lot – I 
mean they have been looking at this for a long time and improving their 
BEE status.  So it would be for – so it made sense for us to do it for 
10 
instance on the transport side that is where a small player SMME – 
SMNE can operate and very successfully and which a lot of the 
suppliers I think all the suppliers actually have that in place. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have referred in your evidence to the oil 
majors. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell those of us who are uninitiated in 
the jet fuel world who the oil majors are? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so if we look in South Africa so 
there is oil majors all across the world but the big oil majors in South 
20 
Africa are Total, Sasol, Shell, BP, Engen, Chevron which is now Astron 
they have changed name to Astron so those would be the oil majors 
that we talk about and then the big traders would be for instance that 
are operating in South Africa is Puma under Traffic Euro so they would 
be also looked at as an oil major because they have refineries overseas 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 55 of 130 
 
where they import from those refineries overseas. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  At page 4 you have a heading 
midway down the page entitled 2016 SAA Tender.  Before we get into 
the detail of it and just jumping ahead in the evidence Chair if I may we 
will hear from Mr Vaughan as I read his affidavit about this tender 
process.  As it so happens the tender is never awarded by SAA but we 
submit it is still relevant for the commission to hear about this context 
because it plays a role in due course on the IDC leg of this 
investigation and I just prefaced it so that we do not come to the end of 
the story and question why we have been told about it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It does have a significance in relation to later 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we can begin at paragraph 11.  You 
indicate there a decision by the board in January 2016 in relation to jet 
fuel procurement.  What was that decision? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The 2016 was – 16 decision by the 
board was to set aside fuel for small entities for SMME’s. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How much fuel? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It was at that particular if I am not 
mistaken was 15%. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does that mean?  Set aside 15% of 
fuel? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So the way I understood it was to say 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 56 of 130 
 
that we will still procure fuel from the majors but 15% of the domestic 
fuel requirement would go eventually to small entities. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well just – just help us understand us that if 
you may because as I understand your evidence thus far.  You are 
going to source your fuel from the oil majors who have refineries, is 
that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But some portion of that fuel that will come 
from the majors must be set aside so that other parties can come in 
and participate, is that right in providing jet fuel to SAA? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you – you would do is will only allow majors 
to give us fuel up to 85% and 15% will be what we will get from smaller 
companies, is that a good understanding of what you are saying? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That would be correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I just clarify with a follow up point.  
Who would the small entities get their fuel from? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So the most logical place that it would 
come from especially in the beginning would be from the oil majors 
20 
from the refiners in South Africa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understand the model the refiners are 
going to sell 85% of their fuel to SAA directly. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They will then sell 15% of their fuel to the new 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 57 of 130 
 
entrant who is then going to sell that fuel again to SAA, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct and it would come at a 
– obviously at a premium. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if you compare the price at which SAA can 
get the fuel from the oil majors as compared with the price that it will 
get it from the small enterprises what is the distinction there? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so if I understand you correctly 
Chair if what – are you asking for what percentage or are you asking… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am asking for what the difference would be?  I 
guess to be fair Mr Vaughan let me ask it this way.  Would it not be 
10 
cheaper for SAA to get a 100% of the fuel from the oil majors? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Of course most definitely Chair 
definitely. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why is that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Because the small companies would 
be purchasing that fuel from the oil majors and I believe at the prices 
that SAA gets their fuel from the oil majors the oil majors would not be 
able to give a discount any further to a small owned entity and that 
then – so there would definitely be – they would have to put a mark up 
to obviously cover their costs and to make profit. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So there would be a cost implication for 
adopting this approach to jet fuel, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  There – there would be. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Thank you.  And if we go to paragraph 
13 on page 5 of your affidavit.   
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 58 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems logical that on that approach of obtaining the 
15% of fuel that was needed SAA would have to be prepared to pay 
more? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words would have to be prepared to pay for 
that fuel to smaller companies at a higher price than it did with regard 
to fuel it obtained from the majors. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
Did 
SAA 
consider 
that 
in 
order 
to 
advance 
transformation that was justified? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I would believe that was the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.  But I am wondering whether it is the best 
way because – because really does it not amount to the major selling to 
you that 15% at a higher price via the smaller companies? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So I believe that would be the case 
Chair.  So – with that being said if you developed the small owned 
companies eventually they possibly would have been more competitive 
and I believe that is probably what the transformation was looking at.   
20 
But you are quite right that would have come across. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No there is no doubt that for a good cause you 
know certain measures may have to be taken you know to advance a 
good cause and – and sometimes there may be inconvenience, 
sometimes there may be costs involved but if the good cause is worth it 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 59 of 130 
 
that maybe fine.  But I am just wondering the way this would work it 
seems a little unusual.  I wonder whether it would not have been better 
but you might not know to say – to require the majors to accommodate 
smaller companies within themselves in terms of BEE as opposed to 
having smaller companies separate and then they can – they can have 
some arrangements or was that explored and was found not to be 
sustainable? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja I believe Chair that the majors do 
engage with small companies on many fronts and of course that was a 
consideration if they had taken a company under their wing if you – in 
10 
that sense but at the end of the day I do not believe it would have 
benefitted SAA’s scorecard and I think that was really the drive behind 
is to improve the BEE scorecard of SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not understand that part of your evidence 
and I think it is the second time you mention it at least as I understand 
it.  My understanding of improving BEE scorecard would it not be that 
you bring them within your business as SAA which I think you were not 
doing as such.  What you were doing you were just doing business with 
them as opposed to bringing them within – where to be part of… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever SAA does they are part of that.  If you want 
to explore new businesses you are – they are your partners. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Sure.  I think the best person to 
answer that would be the transformation manager at SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that is fine but certainly do – giving them 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 60 of 130 
 
business is an important part as well it is just that in the context of jet 
fuel the way you say SAA decided to do it seems unusual but it might 
well be that if it is properly explained it was a good thing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will certainly pick up if we may on 
that point? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because with respect the aspect that you have 
highlighted is the one that does trouble one immediately when you look 
at this arrangement for transformation because it is the same fuel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That you getting from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the same source. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From Engen or Total it is exactly the same fuel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are adding a mark-up and you are 
paying more for it so that somebody an participate in a context in which 
Mr Vaughan as I have understood your evidence there were other 
efforts made to seek to make this industry more accessible, is that 
correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The one I have from your evidence and correct 
me if I am wrong is engagements directly with the oil majors to require 
them to transform themselves, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To up their BEE status, is that correct? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 61 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The second one I have from your evidence is 
the point also referenced by the Chair that you would involve – you 
would ask the oil majors to involve them somewhere else in the value 
chain, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the example as I have it that you gave was 
that transportation was quite an effective aspect of the value train when 
new entrants and transformed players could enter the market, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Chair my suggestion would be in due course 
that we must look at this whole field and – and assess where the 
important pursuit of transformation by State Owned Entities can take 
place effectively and then look at where it might have been attempted 
in circumstances that may not have been as effective and this story will 
play out precisely why it was not effective in the jet fuel context. 
So much so that when this very same tender comes back in 
2018 that requirement is omitted but we will get to that in due course - 
if we may. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I just want to mention this and if you – you can 
– Mr Vaughn indicate whether you – you share the observation.  On this 
approach that SAA was going to adopt the – those who have previously 
monopolised – if you like – the business of providing fuel to SAA are 
not prejudiced in anyway by this arrangement. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 62 of 130 
 
Instead they benefit more because although they do not – the 
– SAA has negotiated with them certain prices in terms of the 85 
percent fuel that they will continue to provide to SAA when it comes to 
this 15 percent that SAA must add via smaller companies they get even 
more.  It is – it is even a better arrangement for them – I would think. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  This is true … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if they – I am sorry. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they provide 100 percent fuel to SAA as they had 
always been – as they had always done before for that 100 percent fuel 
10 
they changed at lower rates which have been negotiated with SAA but 
they provide 85 percent of fuel direct to SAA but provide the 15 percent 
via smaller companies they make more money because when they sell 
to the smaller companies they are not bound by this arrangement on 
prices with SAA. 
Whereas when you look at transformation and that is part of 
the reason why some companies that have been enjoying – you know – 
monopoly of certain business in the past that is why sometimes they do 
not want transformation is that now that the cake must be shared they 
begin to get less because part of what they were getting needs to go 
20 
somewhere else to others who have been excluded but in this 
arrangement those who have enjoyed benefits and monopoly just 
benefit from this arrangement. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So Chair to answer your question from 
my perspective is if they – the fifth – they would have been supplying 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 63 of 130 
 
100 percent of the volume they wanted to SAA.  By them taking 15 
percent and supplying it through SMME and they supply to SMME at a 
higher price and obviously they would have benefitted from that but 
what I believe and especially in the 2018 tender they were prepared to 
give the SMMEs the fuel at the same price as they were give it to – 
give it to SAA. 
So it was no benefit to them as far as that is concerned.  So 
where the – where the premium came from was obviously the handling 
of the fuel and the invoicing of – of a SMME thereafter.  So that is 
where the premium came from. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they did not charge the SMMEs more than they 
charged SAA?  They charged them at the same … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct especially in the 2018 
tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is just that what it amounted to is in terms of the 
money that came to them for the 100 percent fuel.  85 directly to SAA 
15 to SAA but via SMMEs they got the same as the arrangement they 
had with SAA? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just one follow up point there.  
Back to the Chair’s point about well you do not break up the monopoly 
though by this arrangement.  Do you because …? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 64 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The five or six oil majors are still supplying 100 
percent of the fuel.  You have not by this method enabled anyone else 
to take a portion of that market.  Have you? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are quite correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They still have the whole cake. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They do and SAA is paying a little bit more for 
10 
one of the pieces. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It would appear to be. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan if we then go to the affidavit at 
page 5 at paragraph 13 you talk about some of the requirements of this 
tender that was to be awarded in 2016.  The one that I would like to 
pick up on is that second bullet under paragraph 13 because there you 
tell us about what the envisaged duration was for this jet fuel supply 
arrangement.  What was that? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  The period is three years. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how does that accord with previous jet fuel 
procurement until this point? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  With procuring of jet fuel 
because of the volatility of the market and also fluctuations generally 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 65 of 130 
 
fuel suppliers are reluctant to contract for period longer than a year.  
Although there have been periods where a supplier is pretty confident 
on their pricing and the market where they would give extended of up to 
two years and to my knowledge I have seen one for three years as well 
but that is really out of the ordinary.  It is normally a year’s contract 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what did you make of this period of three 
years? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The period of three years I believe 
would be to develop the – would be – because it is talking to the 20 
10 
percent there and it is – well okay.  It is – it is talking to the set aside 
and that would be in order to develop the supplier Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to be clear there the – when the RFP went 
out – as I have your evidence – that three year duration would apply to 
everyone.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes that would apply to everybody 
correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – and what I understand from your 
evidence is that that would be unusual in the market … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Absolutely. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As it was at the time? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But nonetheless that is how the RFP went out.  
Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 66 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then at paragraph 14 on that 
page you indicate the number of parties who responded to the RFP as 
well as those who met the criteria to be a supplier.  Can you give us 
those figures? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  So 96 parties and 74 
responded satisfactorily. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And tell us what made them satisfactory 
respondents?  What I am interested in here is what were the critical 
criteria for this particular RFP and for that purpose just to enable you 
to refresh your memory I propose that we go to page 54 – 5-4 of the 
10 
papers.  You will find it under Tab three in EXHIBIT DD11. 
Chair and Mr Vaughan I have picked it up in the section which 
sets out the RFP requirements but I understand this not to have 
changed at the stage of submission of the bids.  Is that correct 
Mr Vaughan? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what were those requirements? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The requirements Chair was a valid 
Fuel Wholesale Licence from the Department of Energy, a letter to 
confirm product allocation from a refiner or supply – a jet fuel supplier 
20 
for Jet A1. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry let us just stop there.  Not everyone 
knows what Jet A1 is.  What is Jet A1? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Jet A1 is a specification of jet fuel 
used for jet aircraft. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 67 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  And then also indicate how they would 
approach getting the third party liability insurance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could we pause there?  You indicated earlier in 
your evidence that this requirement to have $1 billion of insurance is 
necessary in order to be a jet fuel supplier.  Did I understand the 
evidence correctly? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now this requirement as I read it did not 
stipulate that the bidder had to be in possession of that insurance.  As I 
10 
read point three in the table on page 54 it says: 
“You had to provide an indication how you would 
approach the third party liability insurance.” 
And then in brackets: 
“(This will not necessarily be a qualifying criteria).” 
Can you explain that to us?  How could you ask for bids from 
entities who did not yet have the insurance that – I understand you to 
say – is a prerequisite to supply jet fuel? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair the insurance comes obviously 
– a billion Dollar insurance comes at pretty hefty cost.  So if the 
20 
requirement was for a SMME to procure that insurance and you are 
looking for 74 of these entities to procure that insurance and they do 
not get a drop of jet fuel that would be a problem.  That could bankrupt 
them alone just by putting that type of money out to procure that type 
of insurance. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 68 of 130 
 
So we envisaged was that they need to show that they had 
done their homework – in essence – and grant to an insurer and a bank 
to say - and get a letter of reference to say that they were able to 
procure that type of insurance and if they were at any stage given the 
contract they would have to purchase that insurance before they could 
deliver the first drop of Jet A1 to South African Airways and the group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that I understand.  What was required 
of the small companies to do under this requirement?  To go to an 
insurance company and get a letter to say if they are granted the 
tender they would be provided with R1 billion insurance? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  $1 billion.  You are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One – one - $1 billion – US$1 insurance? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the idea was not that they should secure the 
insurance before but to say if they are granted – awarded the tender 
such an insurance would be provided? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words the – some homework would have had 
been done in advance so that the insurer – insurance company all that 
it would require is if you are granted - you are awarded the tender you 
20 
are assured of this amount of insurance? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How different was - was that to how – to what was 
required of the majors … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The majors … 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 69 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In this type of situation? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair - sorry.  The majors would 
require the billion dollar insurance because they are already in 
business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So they would be required to – or they 
would have it ja. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  They would have it physically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if there was an - well I do not know – if there was 
a major who had not been doing business with SAA.  So it is a major 
elsewhere other than at SAA you would require that they should have it 
10 
before you consider their bid? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I just ask what is stated here under 
three is an indication how you would approach the third party liability 
insurance.  Do you see that Mr Vaughan? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that – with respect is slightly different 
to what I understood the proposition from the Chair to be to which you 
agreed because in your debate with the Chair you said they would need 
20 
to have some letter – for example – from an insurer that said they will 
be given $1 billion insurance if they get the award. 
That seems to me at least to be different to simply requiring 
of them an indication about how they would go about seeking to secure 
it.  Do you see that distinction? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 70 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I see the distinction Chair but I 
believe that they did produce letters from the insurers to say that they 
would be able to get it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay, thank you and – and is that part of this 
process that you know for a fact? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do not know it for a fact because we 
got a cross functional team that looks at that documentation … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  And did not specifically look at that 
documentation. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You – would you agree with me that reading 
simply the words might have indicated that it would be sufficient to set 
out a sort of plan of action by a bidder as to the steps it would take to 
procure the third party liability insurance short of an actual undertaking 
from an insurer that it would be provided? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do see that in the wording Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So that is the third requirement as 
you indicated it.  If we then go to the forth … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr and Mr Vaughn.  
The distinction that Ms Hofmeyr puts to you becomes even more 
important if you bear in mind that under number two it is clearly stated 
that under that a letter confirming is required.  Whereas under three 
the requirement is not put in those terms.  You see you would think that 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 71 of 130 
 
assuming that it is the same person who wrote these requirements you 
would not think that after under two having set out that a letter would 
be required if under three a letter as also required he or she would 
decide to say something else other than the same thing that he said 
under two subject to a variation of the wording.  You understand that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I understand that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you - you might not be able to assist … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I cannot.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we go to the fourth requirement then at page 
10 
54 what was that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  There was also a fourth 
requirement as per this that they would need to put their value chain 
together.  In other words how they would be – the way they understand 
it is the way they would be supplying the fuel to SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go over the page to page 55 if you 
will take us through the fifth and the sixth requirements there. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Confirmation of the B – the BBBEE 
compliance certificate - copies of that - and – and a valid original tax 
clearance certificate – point six. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it is original tax clearance certificate. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  What did I say? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think you might have said regional. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Originally - I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No that is fine.  If we can then just go to the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 72 of 130 
 
note on that page.  Can you recount what those notes – there are two 
notes there – record and what your understanding of them were? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The submission by companies owned 
by military veterans – okay and then submission of companies owned 
by people living with disability. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did those two things mean in the context 
of this RFP? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I believe from what I read over here it 
would be I suppose beneficial that it would – well that would be - that 
would be one of the criteria that we are looking at is companies owned 
10 
by military veterans and people living with disability. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan if we can pick that up later in the 
actual recommendation that went to the Board and as it is contained in 
the RFP.  You will find that at page 1-2-1.  That is under Tab six.  You 
indicated earlier that you understood the split for this RFP to be 85 
percent/15 percent.  Do you see that in the table on the middle of page 
1-2-1 the split is actually 80 percent/20 percent?  Do you see that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are quite correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do I take it that you correct your earlier 
statement that it was 15 percent set aside? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No initially the RF – the Board 
Resolution stated 15 percent and this states 80/20.  Where that comes 
from I cannot – I do not know where – where the change came. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But are you confident that as far as the RFP 
was concerned it involved a 20 percent set aside as we have been 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 73 of 130 
 
describing that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if you read below that table 
it talks about this very point.  Who was going to be given preference 
and what the criteria for that preference would be.  Can you take us 
through that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  So if you look on the – on this 
over here the RFP process.  51 percent majority or more Black owned 
companies.  A 30 percent majority or more Black women owned 
companies, Black youth owned companies.  Companies owned by 
10 
military veterans and companies owned by people with disability. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is your understanding of that criteria?  
How would they feature in the decision of who to grant the 20 percent 
set aside to? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  In - what I read out of this over here 
is that that is that - the preference would be made according to that.  I 
do not (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am lost where you are. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair.  We are at page 1-2-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-2-1 okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we are actually now looking at the final 
RFP as it was issued because I wanted to pick up with Mr Vaughan this 
point about how preference was to be given in the allocation of the 20 
percent because as we understand the scheme at the moment you have 
got 80 percent going to the majors. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 74 of 130 
 
20 percent will be set aside for new entrants – SMMEs – and 
we were looking at page 1-2-1 to understand well how amongst those 
20 percent are we going to select the successful bidders and 
Mr Vaughan was taking us through the five bullets there which as I 
understand your evidence Mr Vaughan were indicators of preference 
criteria that would – should we say – increase the chances of a bidder 
for the 20 percent.  Is that a fair description of it? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I would believe so reading this yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – and when you say I would believe so 
reading this I just want to understand what you can speak to in terms of 
10 
your responsibilities in this process and what you cannot. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  My responsibilities - as I say - 
it was a cross functional team that evaluates this and puts this 
document together and signs it off eventually and my responsibility as 
Head of Fuel is to ensure that we get the correct specification fuel Jet 
A1 as per DEF STAN 91/91.  That this fuel is delivered to our aircraft 
safely. 
That we have security of supplies the next thing and it is 
given to us at the best price possible.  That is what it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would you have been involved in the 
20 
selection of the particular entities who would qualify for the 20 percent 
on the basis of these criteria that we see at page 1-2-1? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No I would not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that somebody else in the team’s 
responsibility? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 75 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who was that person? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  Mr Sogwazile would be 
involved on that.  There would also be Mr Nico Moletsi who was the 
Transformation Manager and I think Mr Lehase Head of Fuel – of 
Transformation at SAA would also be involved as far as that is 
concerned. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we then go over the page in your 
affidavit if we can return there to page 7 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms – Ms … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May I with those – probably all of those names a 
spelling will be helpful …. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the transcriber. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I can assist there.  Mr Sogwazile you will find 
20 
his name appearing back at page 55 and that surname is spelt S-O-G-
W-A-Z-I-L-E.  You mentioned – I think second – Mr Lehase. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is L-E-H-A-S-E … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 76 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As have it from elsewhere in your affidavit and 
I forget the name of the third person. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Moletsi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Moletsi? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is M-O-L-E-T-S-I? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I believe so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will – we will make sure we 
pick that up Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In case there are any variations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we return to the affidavit at page 7 you are 
there at paragraph 23 talking about something called throughput status.  
We are at page 7 paragraph 23.  Do you see that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I am going to ask that we come 
back to that in a moment so that you can explain to us precisely what 
throughput status is and what licencing is required in relation to that 
but I want to jump ahead so that you can give us a bit more insight into 
20 
this process of jet fuel procurement.  Chair and Mr Vaughan you will 
see at page 7 there is a diagram that has a big heading “Conclusion” 
that Mr Vaughan provided for the purposes of his affidavit. 
That is not particularly clear as a document.  So what we 
have done if you just turn over the page there is unnumbered page but 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 77 of 130 
 
it just provides that picture in colour so that it could aid the evidence 
today and if you go over to page 8 you will see another diagram again 
probably even worse in … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Its decipherability but we have a better copy 
over the page again.  So my suggestion Mr Vaughan is that we deal 
with the coloured pages that have been inserted in the bundle when you 
take us through what we are looking at there.  So could we start with 
the diagram that appears at page 7 of your affidavit which if you turn 
over the page you have got the colour version?  What is that showing 
10 
us? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN: 
 
Okay. 
 
With 
this 
what 
I 
am 
endeavouring to show over here is the supply chain to deliver jet fuel 
into the wing of South African Airways aircraft.  So which would be 
South African Airways, SA Express and Mango which is the group - they 
are all part of the group.  So what we were requiring from our suppliers 
and that would include the SMMEs is that they would procure their fuel 
from a refinery or that they would ship it in from overseas. 
So that is what it is showing over there.  It would then be into 
storage and then of course they needed to take part – they needed to 
20 
take – they needed to take part in the transport or contract in the 
transporting of that fuel either themselves or by any other party.  That 
then would be into the storage of the air - airport and thereafter 
delivered to the aircraft. 
Now looking at into the storage of the airport from where it 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 78 of 130 
 
goes into storage at the airport that must be understood that that is 
owned by ACSA.  There is then a pipeline or a hydrant system which 
runs underground.  Now they call it a fuel hydrant system because that 
delivers fuel from the airport storage to each of the hardstands where 
the aircraft park. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could we for that explanation go to the second 
diagram … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Sure, okay.  So that is … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that will – what I understand 
Mr Vaughan is that where we see airport storage on the diagram at 
10 
page 7 we in a sense must go to the next diagram which appears at 
page 8 to better understand how it works from storage into plane.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is quite correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can you take us through that second 
diagram which appears at page 8 of your affidavit but we are looking at 
the better version over – overleaf. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  So that is – you will see over 
there in the – there is a storage.  The green tank is the storage.  Let us 
take an airport like OR Tambo.  So that is the storage at – at the airport 
20 
and from that storage the fuel is filtered and then pumped into an 
underground pipeline which is called the hydrant – a fuel hydrant. 
That fuel hydrant then as – as I said the pipeline that goes to 
each of the hardstands where the aircraft are standing as you will see 
there and then there is special equipment that would connect to the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 79 of 130 
 
hydrant system that is at high pressure and would then meter and filter 
that fuel that goes into the aircraft.  There is also special equipment 
that is required for that Chair. 
Then of course there are – there is also another way of 
delivering fuel to an aircraft which is through – so that one on the 
hydrant is called the hydrant dispenser.  The one – the other one is 
called the refueler and that refueler is will uplift fuel at the depot from 
the tanks. 
Also through a filtration system and then deliver fuel to 
smaller aircraft that are on the hardstand that do not necessarily have 
10 
a hydrant pit connection and it is generally aircraft that requires 
smaller volumes.  The – the equipment there is also much specialised 
because it is specialised filtration on there.  There is metering and 
generally that equipment is about 20 000 litres. 
So of course an aircraft that is flying to London that requires 
over 100 000 litres is not suitable to be refuelled with a refuel that is 
why you would need a hydrant system with a dispenser. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can you then explain to us 
probably with reference to this diagram at page 8 what a throughputter 
is or why throughput status is relevant to jet fuel supply? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  So ACSA in South Africa – 
Airports Company South Africa own the facilities at the airports.  So 
they own the storage.  They own the hydrant system.  They then lease 
this to – to service providers and that is generally the oil majors that 
have got these agreements with ACSA.  So the throughput status would 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 80 of 130 
 
be that you need – that you need is to have that licence with ACSA to 
put a product or Jet A1 through their system.  I am not sure if that 
answers your question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let me just explore it a little bit further.  Is 
there one pipeline network? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  There is one pipeline network. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you could have at any point in time various 
parties putting fuel into it.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is quite correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what – what is the licence driving at then?  
10 
Is it – is it a quality control mechanism? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It is a quality control mechanism yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Explain how that works, if you will. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    Any airport you want to have – you 
need to have fuel that is on specification and delivered to the aircraft 
safely so in order to have – to operate to have a through-put status at 
an airport there’s also critical criteria that ACSA requires which is not 
dissimilar to what SAA requires so there would also be the billion dollar 
insurance, there would also be that the through-put adheres to certain 
standards and those standards are set out in African and Europe and 
20 
most of the world under JIG, which is a Joint Inspection Group, if we 
move to the US they’ve got their own set of standards which isA4A 
88103 as they call it but for Africa and most of the world and Europe 
there JIG requirements involved there.  Now JIG stands for the Joint 
Inspection Group which is relevant at any airport that is operated by 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 81 of 130 
 
multiple suppliers, so in other words joint ventures. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And again is that driving at a, sort of, quality 
assurance for the fuel? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understand it there would need to be 
JIG compliance, Joint Action Group compliance in order to be eligible 
for through-put status, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    That would be – yes they would – 
they need to comply. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who is the licensing authority for through-
10 
put status? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    Is ACSA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, if we could then move to page 9 of 
your affidavit, there you deal with the last of the requirements for he 
2016 RFP and you describe an end-to-end process of fuel delivery, can 
you explain what that means? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    End-to-end delivery would be that 
the company that we were entering the agreement – into a contract with 
to supply fuel to SAA would have to procure the fuel or manufacture the 
fuel, they would need to transport the fuel, they would need to store it, 
20 
they would need to have the agreements with ACSA in place and they 
would also need to have equipment or an agreement to deliver this fuel 
to our aircraft and invoice us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how would an agreement work for that last 
part of the process? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 82 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    For the into plane portion? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    The into plane portion, they would 
either – the entity would need to enter into a further license or 
agreement with ACSA or they could use the companies or company that 
has that agreement to perform that process for them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just get clear, if there was an SSME 
who benefited from the 20% set aside, might you have a scenario where 
they purchased fuel from one of the oil majors, they then had some 
arrangement to transport it into the airport but then depending on 
10 
whether they were licensed themselves or not, they might have to re-
engage that oil major at the end to actually do the into plane servicing, 
is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that would still, in the terms of the RFP be 
compliant with it’s requirements, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And for that purpose SAA would pay a premium 
for that fuel, is that right? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    That is correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, if we go to the bottom of page 9 you 
commence a section entitled, The Bid Evaluation Process and EML 
Energy, and if we pick that up over the page, you detail on page 10 
from paragraph 30 how EML Energy came to be one of the proposed 
successful bidders in the 2016 evaluation process, can you tell us how 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 83 of 130 
 
that worked and how it was selected? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    Okay it’s – ELM at the time of this 
particular tender to my knowledge didn’t have a refinery so they would 
be procuring fuel from one of the majors, what EML did have, they had 
storage and they had some equipment at the Denel facility, there was a 
– there is a small fuel farm, I can’t give you the exact size of it but it is 
much smaller, well minute compared to the one at OR Tambo but they 
have got a fuel facility, that storage facility with some equipment where 
they operated on the eastern side of the airport precinct if you want to 
put it that way with the runway.  So if you look at OR Tambo, OR Tambo 
10 
has got a north/south runway, two of them, to the east of it is Denel and 
their facilities and to the west of that is SAA and also where all the 
hired stands are and where the commercial flights take place, so that’s 
on the western side.  So the runway really splits – well it splits the east 
from the west, so EML has got a facility at Denel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you make a point at paragraph 31 on that 
page about whether EML would have been able to transport fuel from 
the Denel fuel farm to where the planes had to be fuelled, what are 
your comments there? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    Okay so on that, it was unlikely that 
20 
EML would be able to transport fuel from that side because obviously 
you’d have to use public roads to do that and it’s impractical and also 
given the large volumes they didn’t – well the equipment to do that from 
that particular side, so it would make sense for them – or that they 
would have to go into agreement with a JV which had the facilities on 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 84 of 130 
 
the correct side of the runway to deliver fuel at – on that scale. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan you’ll correct me if I’m wrong, but I 
understand the point that you make there, to be that there wasn’t an 
advantage created for EML by the fact of it’s Denel fuel farm resources, 
is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    Well I believe so to my knowledge ja 
but that could have been a consideration by ACSA I’m not sure of that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In relation to what, would it have been a 
consideration by ACSA? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:    Possibly because they had a facility 
10 
already. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But what in decision making, in the licensing by 
ACSA…(intervention) 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     No I couldn’t say by the licensing by 
ACSA because that’s different. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay but as you understand it, if I have your 
evidence correct, EML notwithstanding it’s Denel fuel farm was going to 
be utilising the hydrant system on the hard side on the west of the 
runways, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, and if we go down to paragraph 33 
on that page you talk about the pricing that EML was able to  achieve, 
what was that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Again I maybe need to just give a 
bit of background as far as pricing is concerned.  Jet fuel in South 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 85 of 130 
 
Africa is not regulated but it’s still based on BFP which is Basic Fuel 
Price which all our fuels in South Africa are based on as at the moment, 
because it’s not regulated each company publishes their own Basic 
Fuel Price on a monthly basis.  There is inherent imbalance if you want 
to put it that way because you have a refinery in Joburg or in Sasolburg 
which is called Natref.  Natref Refinery produces about 60% of the fuel 
requirement for OR Tambo it is owned jointly by Sasol and Total and of 
course with it being 80 kilometres away and it’s got a dedicated 
pipeline at the airport they have an advantage as far as transport is 
concerned.  If you have a look at the entities or refiners that operate 
10 
from the coast which is Sapref which is jointly owned by BP and Shell, 
they have to rail their product to Johannesburg and I’ll get back to that 
now and then you’ve got Engen as well that’s also got a refinery in 
Durban and the Puma who imports their fuel through Richards Bay at 
the moment but previously through Matola in Maputo in Mozambique, 
also have to rail their fuel in.  So the railage of the fuel versus the 
dedicated pipeline from Natref gives you that their fuel comes at a 
slightly more expensive rate.  Now given that you’ll see EML parted 
with Total which is a refiner in Sasolburg and they would have – well 
their prices would have been better than anybody – anything coming 
20 
from the coast. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you explain at 33 how the arrangement 
would work between EML and Total so how would that work, the second 
sentence begins, 
 
“EML would therefore purchase from Total”, 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 86 of 130 
 
 
Take us through how the pricing would then be reflected on the 
SAA side. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Okay so they would then – they 
would purchase from Total, they would add their administration costs on 
to that, in other words whatever they needed for transport, for storage, 
for administration costs of the invoicing and – so they would be using 
the Total pricing and then add on their costs and then give that to SAA 
at a premium it came at a premium – it came at a premium, if you took 
– if you compared it to Total. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that’s the point you make at paragraph 
10 
34, you say, 
 
“At the end of the day the price EML charged SAA would be  
 
higher than what SAA would pay if they procured directly from 
 
Total”,  
 
Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is quite correct.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is your understanding of the impact of 
the 20% set aside, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:   The point was in the submission that 
was given we showed what we were purchasing fuel from the majors at 
20 
and what it would cost us – additional cost that it would cost to 
purchase the 20% from the SSME’s. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, and then if you go over the page to 
11 you recount at paragraph 36 who the proposed successful 20% set-
aside bidders were, who were they? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 87 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Okay they were EML, Dikopani and 
Infinity Energy Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in the end, Mr Vaughn were – was that 
proposal of those three successful 20% set-aside participants approved 
by the Board? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     I don’t believe so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what happened after the procurement 
processes had completed themselves? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     The recommendation was made to 
the Board with what I said, just setting out what the cost of the 80% 
10 
would be and the 20%, it went to Board and by that time we had a new 
Board in place and the Board didn’t approve it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, if we could just take a moment 
before we get to the final status of it at Board level, because at 
paragraph 38 at page 11 of your affidavit you indicate there that a 
change was made in relation to the duration of the supply agreement 
that would be concluded, what was that change? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     The change was made – the 
approval was for three years and the recommendation was for – giving 
them five years to the BBEE companies or the SSME’s. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan you said in your answer there that 
the approval was for three years. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just query that, as I understand it, it was 
the terms of the tender that it would be a fuel supply arrangement for 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 88 of 130 
 
three years, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because we didn’t ever have approval, did we, 
ultimately? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     You’re absolutely right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, just to be clear.  So you had a 
tender for three years but at a point in the evaluation process what I 
understand you to be recording here is that there was a proposed 
increase to five years for – was it confined to the participants in the 
20%. 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     It was confined to the participants 
in the 20% and who they would be getting their supply from. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh so for example if they were getting it from 
Total then Total would be in for the five years insofar as the SSME was 
contracted for five years, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So that means you might have had a situation 
where Total has a three-year arrangement insofar it supplying directly 
to SAA but a five year insofar as it’s supplying through an SSME is that 
correct? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     I believe so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair with respect it does take us back to your 
original point which is there is certainly on that description a further 
benefit to the monopolies for want of a better description, those that 
dominated the market if they were to be the suppliers through the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 89 of 130 
 
SSME, do you accept that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     I accept that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you have any input on this increase to five 
years in this decision making? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     I didn’t have input per se it was a 
recommendation from the transformation – head of transformation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was it that recommendation that went to 
the Board for approval? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That was part of the – yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did anyone raise concerns that if you’ve gone 
10 
out to tender for three years it may not be appropriate to award for five 
years? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Not to my knowledge. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just to jump ahead to evidence that will 
come in due course the fact of that increase from three to five years 
had a substantial impact on the IDC funding that was ultimately 
obtained and so it’s for that reason that we focus on it in this evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:     No that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I we can then, Mr Vaughan, just pick it up at 
your point about whether this was ever ultimately approved by the 
20 
Board, what is your evidence on that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     This was not approved by the Board 
there were (indistinct) that took place. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what happened, you mentioned extensions, 
take us through that? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 90 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Okay so the – to my knowledge 
there was a lot of back and forth in the company but the Board – the 
then Board did not approve this with the 20% set-aside and there was 
an extension that was granted from the first and I’m just speaking – I 
just need to – it’s off the top of my head but from the beginning of 
January 2017 there was extension granted until – for six months, up 
until the end of June 2017 so that’s what happened there was extension 
on contracts that we had at that stage with the majors excluding the 
SSME companies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And did that have any financial implication for 
10 
SAA? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     There could have been – yes there 
was but not at that point we had been going through month-on-month 
extensions so suppliers were adjusting their prices we hadn’t gone out 
to market so we couldn’t see if we were getting a fair price, I believe 
just due to the relationship that we had with our oil majors in the years 
that they didn’t increase their prices unduly and in most cases, not in 
all cases but in most cases where there were – because there were 
some companies that didn’t increase anything but there were 
companies that increased – but it was less than what inflation was. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And for what period did that extension 
arrangement persist? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Well if you take the six month 
extensions plus the month-on-month extensions, it was close to two 
years, if not slightly more.

Page 91 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you we’ll pick it up with the new Board 
that I said we would get to just to be clear on who was populating the 
new Board from September 2016 but before we go there, Mr Vaughan, 
I’d just like to ask you for your comment.  I asked if you were involved 
in previously in the decision to extend the three years to five years and 
as I have your evidence you indicated you weren’t involved in that, is 
that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was your view on the feasibility of a five-
year period for these agreements? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     On the face of it for developing a 
company it might have made sense but from the volatility of the market 
and the small margins that there are in this business, I know that the 
majors most probably wouldn’t agree to anything more than a year and 
if anything more than a year not much more than that.  So what you’re 
doing is you’re putting the companies at risk that you’re entering into 
an agreement with for so long because you must remember one thing 
the fuel price – 95% of the fuel price is linked directly to the oil price 
so it fluctuates on a monthly/weekly basis.  There’s a very very small 
percentage that is a supplier’s margin and because of unknowns in our 
20 
industry to sign a contract and lock yourself in at those small margins 
for longer than a year is actually being foolish. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to conclude that for our benefit, is that 
because of the volatility in the oil price? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     No, no that would be volatility in the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 92 of 130 
 
market, oil price is one of them because it is your refining margins 
playing to that but it would be volatility in our labour market in, we 
don’t know what’s happening with inflation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I understand the evidence, the risk lies 
in being tied into a price that then reduces any profit that you may have 
in your business ultimately? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Absolutely right Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, if we then go to page 14 of the 
affidavit at paragraph 49 you indicate there that a new Board took over 
in around early September 2016, I’d just like to go to the minutes of 
10 
that next Board meeting that appear in the papers, that’s Exhibit DD11 
and you’ll find that at page 204. 
CHAIRPERSON:     What’s the page number? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  204 Chair it’s under tab 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now this document Mr Vaughan, as I have it, 
are minutes of a special meeting of the Board of Directors of SAA held 
on Friday the 7 t h of April 2017, do you see that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And  in terms of the “new Board”  if – with 
20 
reference to this page who were the members of the new Board at that 
time? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Okay it will be Ms Ramano and 
please help me with the pronunciations, Mr Maluleka, Ms Tshabalala, 
Mr Malunga, Ms Sepamla, Mr Moosa, Ms Moola, Mr Thsisevhe and then 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 93 of 130 
 
the acting group CEO Mr Zwane, is that correct? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But there are also some apologies for that 
meeting and those persons are also, as I have it recorded here non-
executive directors of the Board that includes, as I read it, Ms Myeni, 
Mr Buthelezi, Dr Mbatha, Ms Mogoduso and then the interim CFO Ms 
Nhantsi, do you see that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are those names consistent with the persons, 
as you understood it who populated that Board from about September 
2016? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you’ve taken us…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m sorry would some of them not be members of 
the Board as such but be invited for specific issues to attend? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:   I believe so but that would be 
attendees if I’m not mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes so would it be, under where it says, in 
attendance? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     In attendance yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Everyone under that wouldn’t be a member of the 
20 
Board but would be invited to attend a particular Board meeting. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     That’s the way I understand it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair it’s a point that we’ll come back to in the 
evidence in due course but – and you would have seen it in the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 94 of 130 
 
15billion capital raising investigation, there’s a period of time in the 
Board of SAA where the Board is extremely reduced in it’s number, it’s 
the Board of three persons that Mr Vaughan mentioned earlier and that 
changes around September 2016 when a much fuller Board is then 
constituted. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, oh yes now I remember that three-member 
Board, Ms Myeni, Ms Kwinana and…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Dr Tambi 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So they were there for some period of 2015 
10 
and 2016 but then we have a fuller constitution of the Board thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That will be, Chair, an aspect that we will pick 
up in the second evidence session because there were actual 
engagements between National Treasury, in particular and SAA about 
the depleted nature of the Board at a period in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we return to page 14…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes I think it was during Ms Nhantsi’s evidence, 
during the interactions in regard to the issues that she covered there, 
20 
there were three members of the Board at the time, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That’s exactly right Chair, indeed, we’ve 
received that evidence already but now we’ve moved in time to 
September 2016, you’ll recall the 15billion story ends in about July 
2016 when they cancel the agreement with BnP, so if we move ahead in 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 95 of 130 
 
the life of SAA by about two or so months, you now have a much fuller 
constituted Board that is appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at page 14 Mr Vaughan, you take us 
through, really the evidence you’ve already given, which is about the 
series of extensions and the non approval of the Board of that 
procurement process.  Is there anything you’d like to add at that point? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:     Not at this point. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair, I see we are at one, and I’m 
about to move to another topic, so if it’s convenient we may take the 
10 
lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes we’ll take the lunch break and resume at 2 
o’clock, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you DCJ.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We were Mr Vaughan at page 15 of your 
affidavit before we broke for the lunch break and I had indicated that 
20 
we were going to start with the 2018 process for jet fuel procurement.  
But before we get there there are two aspects just to tie up the 
previous part of the evidence that I would like to deal with you on.  And 
the one of those relates to a document that was put to Ms Loock in her 
evidence this morning where she expressed some limitation to the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 96 of 130 
 
extent to which she could comment on it and I would like to ask you if 
you would to look at that document.  It is in the bundle containing Ms 
Loock’s evidence which is DD12 and you will find it in that file at page 
99, 99.   
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Got it Chair.  Got it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And if you will just – this was a 
document that Ms Loock was being asked about by my learned friend 
Ms September and she had some limitations in her personal knowledge 
of these sorts of schedules.  Could you take us through what your 
understanding of this pricing schedule is?  What is it denoting in the 
10 
left hand column for example? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair what we have in the left hand 
column is the location so that would be Bloemfontein, Cape Town, 
Durban, East London and so on.  The second column will be the IATA 
code which is a three letter code that is published by IATA.  In the case 
of Bloemfontein it is BFN, Cape Town is CPT and that is allocated to - 
so that is a three letter code that is allocated as per the International 
Air Transport Association.  So every airport has got its own three letter 
code across the world.  Then you have over there in column number 3 
where it says SAX it says there it gives the indicative volume per year 
20 
at those different locations.  So if you go down to Johannesburg JNB 
for instance it has got there 21.2 million litres is what is indicated 
there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we just pause there.  So just to be clear.  
Those are litres as specified there, is that correct? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 97 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that applies over a year, is that right? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is that the literage to be supplied to or 
required at the locations? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Well it is worked on an indicative 
volume.  So it is indication of what SA Express would have needed 
there at that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So generally that is done – well how 
10 
we do it in the industry we look at historic uplifts and then what we do 
then we have a look at any schedule changes and then work that into 
that but it is important to note that it is an indication of the volume. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It is not a fixed number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not exact? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It is not exact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The reason – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the indication is based on? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  On historic data plus how your 
schedule is going to work into the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Why you work on historic data is 
because what you uplift is very dependent on weather and then 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 98 of 130 
 
secondly also on the pay load that you carry.  So if you got a full 
aircraft all the time you would obviously need slightly more fuel.  If it is 
an aircraft flying at only 50% load factor it would be less.  And that is 
why you always – you – we go to the industry and say it is an indication 
of volume.  But obviously to the next best of our knowledge because 
the industry would need to although the suppliers would need to have 
an indication to know what they need to produce. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you could take us to that column 
reflecting base price, what do we understand that to mean? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so if you have a look at the 
column the index before that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It would be a [indistinct] so let us take 
Bloemfontein for instance they were saying there they were using a 
NATREF price so the NATREF refinery pricing and the NATREF refinery 
pricing as I understand this sheet that is in front of me was for the July 
2017 and then they give a figure what the price would be, the base 
price in this case R6.06 for Bloemfontein. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I just clarify.  The top of that column 
20 
indicates it is a rand per litre amount, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 99 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  And then the price basis in the next 
column it goes to what is the invoice frequency so how often will they 
be invoicing.  They would be invoicing on a weekly basis.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  With giving 30 days credit.  So from 
every week they would for instance invoice on a Monday and then give 
30 days’ credit so SA Express would only need to pay within 30 days. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then amount? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  On day 30 at least.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does the amount reflect? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay the amount there comes to – 
amount including VAT let me just see here – that is a little bit sketchy 
with that I – it is not clear to me but there is amounts.  There is 
obviously add on costs onto that and then – so that would be – I would 
from this table here I would say that there is a base price of – let us 
take the first line R6.06 in Bloemfontein.  They would be charging SA 
Express R7.98 so that would include transport, supplier margin, storage 
or whatever they added on to that.  And then they gave an amount as 
well with the VAT because obviously 14% at – in 2017 would then come 
to R9.09. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we just go to the bottom of that table 
that you have read across on we were also querying in the evidence of 
Ms Loock what that pump back per hour defuel per hour and storage 
per day signifies, can you assist there? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so my understanding of this 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 100 of 130 
 
table again if I read this correctly is that SA Express if they require 
defueling at their maintenance facility EML Energy would extract that 
fuel from the aircraft and they would charge them R1 000,00 per hour in 
the defueling process.  Then they would charge them R251.00 per day 
to store the fuel if they had to store it over any length of time and then 
pumping that fuel back onto the aircraft again after the storage they 
would charge that at R1 000,00 per hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so there is significance in the absence of R for 
rand in the amounts on the third column because they relate to litres as 
opposed to R1 000,00 at the bottom and R251,00 because that is 
10 
money and the other amounts are litres of fuel? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just that they did not write … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Litre at the top unlike where in the column where you 
have got Rands/litre. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair I would believe if I understand 
what you saying correctly is it would have been better to separate 
those last two lines from the rest of the table put it – let it stand 
separately. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Because at the moment what you are 
looking at you are looking at it rand per litre and then it is showing you 
storage per day.  So it should be disconnected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that might be another point but the main point is 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 101 of 130 
 
if you look at column 3 where you have got in regard to Johannesburg 
21 200 000. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in regard to Bloemfontein. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 1 700 000 there is nothing that tells the reader what 
those are?  Is it money or is it litres? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are quite right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas when you go to the fourth or fifth column at 
the top at least it says ZAR/litres you know rands per litre you know 
10 
then you can understand.  So it caused at least me some confusion 
earlier and the previous witness was not sure also.  So that is the one 
point.  The second point therefore is that at the bottom you have got LR 
because that is now what you charge per hour and you have got per 
hour there. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which makes it easier for us to understand. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You quite right Chair.  You know the 
only reason why I know that it is litres because I have got a good 
knowledge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Of what SA Express uses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  At the different locations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you.   
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 102 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Vaughan.  And then I would like 
to take you if I may just to the end of your evidence bundle which is 
DD11 because there are a few documents that were inserted right at 
the end of the bundle from page 310, 310 which we received this 
morning and which I understand was not part of your affidavit or its 
annexures.  But Mr Vaughan are they documents that you are familiar 
with? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  They are Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Once we have all got there I will 
ask you to take us through them.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  310? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  310 indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just before we go there just so we 
orientate ourselves in time in your evidence Mr Vaughan I have it 
before the break we concluded at the end of 2017 because your 
affidavit at page 15 at paragraph 53 talks about a further extension that 
occurred on the 11 December 2017, do you recall that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so now we move just a few days later in 
20 
this correspondence at the 5 December as I see it there. What is this 
correspondence about? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  On the 15 September… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  December I have it. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Of December. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 103 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I am sorry.  15 December Doctor Sam 
Vilakazi sent me an email with a letter attached to it stating that SA 
Express had been contracted with EML since July on fuelling matters 
not necessarily all over the place – not in all areas and that he was 
informing or notifying once approvals had been gained that he – that SA 
Express would like to move 1.8 million litres if I am not mistaken to 
EML Energy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to that letter if we may? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it may be useful to look at it.  It is at 
312. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja so… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can you confirm this is the letter attached to 
the email? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct.  So the letter – I got 
the letter in front of me and this is what – this is the letter that was 
attached to the email sent to me.  So in that letter just specifies it says 
there 1.822357 monthly volume.  So it does not say litres or whatever, 
that is what it says there.  So 1.8 cubic meters, 1 822 cubic meters so 
20 
going back to Doctor Vilakazi in an email that I went back to him on… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you do not mind just before you go there. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Sorry. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 104 of 130 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I do not have it yet from your evidence what 
precisely Doctor Vilakazi was communicating to you about their 
intentions in relation to that 1.822… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So from the letter his intention was 
that he would – SA Express would like EML to supply their volume in 
OR Tambo or at Joburg. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is what the intention was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go over to your response. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So in my response to him I just 
10 
wanted some clarity on what the 1.822 was.  I was assuming that it 
would be million litres 1.82 million litres or he need to specify whether 
it was volumetric as in cubic meters or whatever the case might be so 
we knew exactly what we were talking about.  So that was just getting 
clarity on that and I said if it is 1.82 million litres that would equate to 
about 90% of the volume in Johannesburg just getting – just giving 
them that clarity and that we were in the process of an extension and 
we then would have GSM, the Global Supply Management [indistinct] 
Sogwazile would need to – would need to notify or take that our of the 
letters of extension that we were going to be giving to the suppliers 
20 
that supplied SAA, SA Cargo and also then of course SA Express we 
would have to take their volume out of there if they were going to go 
alone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just get clarity on page 313 the last 
sentence there you say – in addition as per Tamies I take that to be a 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 105 of 130 
 
reference to Mr Sogwazile, is that right? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mail we would need to exclude SA Ex volume 
from the LOE is that letter of extension? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Letter of extension. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That are going to current suppliers for 
extension 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2018.  Mr Vaughan is that a 
reference to the evidence you have just given about the extension that 
happened in December 2027? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just unpack that for me, why would you 
exclude SA EX Volume from the extensions if this were to go ahead? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Because they were asking that they 
get supplied through EML. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I see.  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go to 315 there is a response 
from Doctor Vilakazi.  What was that response? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so he says it should be litres 
that is the first thing.  So to my first question.  Can I revert back to you 
20 
shortly about the timelines taking into account the holiday season or 
the holiday period which being December. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happens after that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I am not sure what happened after 
that.  There was correspondence between GSM and SA Express I do 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 106 of 130 
 
not – well I believe I know that this did not go ahead. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It did not? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what – what did you think about the fact that he 
provide – about the clarification he provided that it should be litres?  
Did that say anything to you? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Well it does not really say anything to 
me because 1.8 litres is not very much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja so it was 1.8 million litres.  But it 
10 
was volumetric so it gave me a good indication.  And given the fact that 
I had gone back to him and saying it was 90% of the SAA volume that 
would have given that it was – so he was – in my opinion from this he 
was saying that is litres and I am correct with the 90%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If – if – it might just assist Mr Vaughan when 
we were looking at that pricing schedule a moment ago we – there was 
an indicative volume annually for each of the locations as I had it that 
was at page 99 of Ms Loock’s evidence which is in DD12.  If we look 
across at Johannesburg which I understand the engagements between 
20 
yourself and Mr Vilakazi – Doctor Vilakazi were about, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see an indicative annual volume as I 
understand the table through your evidence to indicate 21.2 million 
litres, is that correct? 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 107 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct but you must remember 
I never had sight of that table. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed but you do I understand from your 
evidence have a sense of the indicative volumes at each of the 
locations. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Absolutely because I manage the 
accounts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you know if you times 1.8 by 12… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is exactly what it comes to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It will come to about 21.2, is that right? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is that a further indication that you were 
speaking on the same terms when you went back and said well that is 
about 90% of the full volume requirement for SA Express at 
Johannesburg? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Thank you but as I have your 
evidence that extension did not take place, is that right to EML? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The award to EML did not take place. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And if we then return to your 
20 
affidavit at page 15 you will see a heading there the 2018 RFP, do you 
have that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is on page 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  15, 15 Chair. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 108 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And again to orientate ourselves in time we 
learnt of the extension of December 2017 which would have taken SAA 
to June 2018, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so if we pick it up at paragraph 54 what 
happens in May in relation to jet fuel procurement in SAA? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay on the 3 May a RFP was sent 
out for jet fuel supply and that would have been from – for the period 
from the 1 July 2018. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Until? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  For one year. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So up until the end of this month, next 
week. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And in the next paragraph you talk to us 
about the differences between the 2016 and the 2018 RFP that has 
gone out in May.  What were those differences? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so the differences really 
between 2016 and 2018 is that a billion dollar insurance was needed at 
20 
that stage.  There was also the difference between the two RFP’s was 
that this time around it was purely on a commercial basis.  So SAA was 
looking for the best priced fuel we were not looking at any 
transformation agenda at this stage we were looking at the best price.  
There was also that it will only be sent out to companies that had ACSA 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 109 of 130 
 
throughput approval so that was the – and the billion dollar insurance 
was a critical criteria.  The other critical criteria was not mentioned in 
the RFP because with a company having ACSA approval they would 
have automatically have had – had the correct specification of fuel.  
They would have had the ability to put it into the wing of the aircraft 
and so forth. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And would they also have had to be JIG 
compliant? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Absolutely. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Joint Inspection Group compliant? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As you described earlier.  Thank you Mr 
Vaughan you have indicated the differences I suspect it is an obvious 
difference but I would like your comment on it.  The other one that 
occurs to me is that 2016 was for a period of three years it then of 
course became five but this was only for a year is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand your evidence earlier that 
year accords with your experience in the industry of the length of time 
that fuel supplies will be willing to bind themselves, is that accurate? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happened with that process? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so the RFP was sent out and we 
had respondents – we had respondents know we must just bear in mind 
this was across the country.  So we had respondents from let me just 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 110 of 130 
 
think now the 6, 7, 8, 9 – we had 9 respondents.  Of the 9 respondents 
there were 8 in Johannesburg.  There in Johannesburg at OR Tambo 
you typically have – you would have had – well I will tell you what we 
had.  In Johannesburg we had Total, Sasol.  We had BP, Shell, Engen, 
Puma, Waza and EML that applied and they were licenced with 
ACSA.ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and there if you go over the page 
to 16 there was an evaluation of that tender as I have it from the 
heading there above paragraph 60 and what was the outcome of that 
evaluation process? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The outcome of that evaluation 
10 
process is that Sasol came in with the best pricing.  Thereafter we had 
Waza was in second position.  Third position was Total and fourth 
position was EML.  Then we had Puma Energy, we had BP, Shell and 
Engen coming in after that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what steps did you take in particular in 
relation to Sasol and Waza on the one hand and Total and EML on the 
other? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay so I think it is important to 
understand as we said earlier in the evidence today is that inherently 
the inland refiners have got an advantage because of where they are 
20 
placed in relation to Jo – to OR Tambo.  So we had Waza came in 
second because they were on the back of Sasol.  Sasol being the best 
pricing with their mark-up onto that they still came in ahead of Total 
and Engen and so on.  So what we did is because we were looking for 
the best pricing and we that Waza’s fuel was coming from Sasol we 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 111 of 130 
 
then approached Sasol directly.  Sasol had bid on 13 million litres for 
SAA and for well SAA and SA Express which is a very small portion of 
that but for the group that we were negotiating for we said to Sasol are 
they prepared to give us the 2 million litres that they had allocated to 
Waza directly at the price that they had told us and they said they 
were.  So on grounds of that we excluded Waza.  We did exactly the 
same with Total.  We went to Total, Total was prepared to give us 4 
million litres and 2 million litres to EML.  We said to Total are you 
prepared to – exactly the same as we did with Sasol – we asked them 
are they prepared to give us the 2 million litres instead of giving it to 
10 
EML, they said they were not.  So we enquired why they were not they 
said that they were already at the ceiling limit because companies also 
look at the exposure to SAA and to any other company but to SAA and 
they said the 4 million litres was the exposure ceiling to SAA and – so 
we said but then why can you give it to a small company like EML which 
is possibly risky they said it forms a different risk profile and that is 
why they are prepared to give to EML that would supply to us in any 
case.  I think that basically covers that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The reason for that.  So we – so in 
20 
other words you still had Sasol was in first place, Total second, EML 
was still the third best in pricing and we gave it to them on commercial 
terms. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we go to a document 
further on in your bundle DD11 you will find it at page 273.  It is a 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 112 of 130 
 
document dated 25 October 2017 that is Chair page 273 under Tab 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to just spend a bit of time on this 
document with you Mr Vaughan.  What is this document? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  This is the throughput agreement that 
EML had received from ACSA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just help us to place it and its relevance in 
the context of the 2018 tender.  I recall your evidence to be that you 
only issued the RFP to entities with this throughput status, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So was this a document that you saw at the 
time of the evaluation? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I did not see this document. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is has subsequently been given to you by 
the commission’s investigators, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is quite correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it have been a document that served 
before another group within the decision making or evaluating 
committee? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I believe so yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Vaughan just wait for Ms Hofmeyr. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To finish her question before you answer. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 113 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise.. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Will do Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transcript will look quite bad.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there tend to be square brackets inaudible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja inaudible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Cross speaking or some such that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just wait for… 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Sorry about that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just wait for her to finish her question okay.  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If we go to page 273 which I 
have as the beginning of the letter could you read to us what appears 
at paragraph 1 and 2 on that page? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay. 
“Reference is made to the application submitted by 
EML to become a throughput at OR Tambo.  We 
confirm that same was considered and submitted to 
the airports’ manager committee meeting AM MANCO 
which commenced – committee sat on the 19 October 
2019.” 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry 2017 as I see it. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  17. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:   
“We are pleased to announce that EML application to 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 114 of 130 
 
become a through-putter has been approved by the 
AM MANCO.  According to EML – accordingly EML 
will be able to provide service to the airlines you 
have and or will contract with.  This approval is valid 
up until the 31 March 2019 which can be extended at 
the sole discretion of Airports Company South 
Africa.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Vaughan.  What I am interested 
in receiving your comment on is just clarify for us what was the period 
for which this fuel supply agreement was going to be concluded with 
10 
successfully tenderers in the 2018 tender process? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  From the 1 July 2018 up until the 30 
June 2019. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And with that in mind Mr Vaughan do you see at 
paragraph 2 that this letter is indicating that the throughput approval 
from ACSA will be valid until 31 March 2019? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That on my calculation is short of the year for 
which the tender was going to be awarded, is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are quite correct. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is this an issue that to your knowledge was 
engaged with by the evaluators of the bids? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I would not think so – they would have 
looked to see if they had approval at time of award. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would that have been an appropriate approach 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 115 of 130 
 
to adopt Mr Vaughan? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Possibly not but it is done – well up 
until now that is – it has been done because if you take – if I can just 
give you an example if you do not mind Chair?  The JV members which 
is Sasol, Total, Shell, BP and Engen their licence I – as far as I know 
have lapsed in – or would have lapsed in December which would also 
have been halfway through the contract, the SAA contract and it has 
been subsequently renewed.  So it is in my view it is so – you know to 
line up contracts that SAA or airlines go out on with licence agreements 
is sometimes difficult.  Whether that is prudent or not we need to 
10 
review that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just I would be interested in your comment on 
it.  It – it appears at least at face value to create some risk in your 
selection of successful bidders … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Absolutely … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It is a risk. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I read paragraph it is in the sole discretion 
of ACSA whether they are going to approve beyond 31 March.  Do you 
see that? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That clause there makes it very risky. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the upshot of it is this maybe common 
practice I understand your evidence to be it is but what would be your 
comment if I said there is an inherent risk that there will not be 
extension beyond the point that the approval is valid for at the time of 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 116 of 130 
 
the tender? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are quite right Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that an issue that has arisen in the past at 
all? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Not at all. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if we then move to your page 18 
Mr Vaughan in your affidavit you commenced at paragraph 71 there 
indicating what occurred on 12 June 2018.  What was that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Is that point 74? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Seven – 71. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  71. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  71. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We start at 71. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay sorry.  Okay.  On 12 June there 
was a recommendation made to the BAC approving EML as one of the 
suppliers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did the BAC take that forward? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  13 June Chair … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what …? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  2018. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was their recommendation? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  Their recommendation was to 
approve BP, Shell, Chevron, Sasol, Protel, Puma, EML and Engen as 
fuel suppliers for a period commencing 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what ultimately happened at Board level in 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 117 of 130 
 
relation to that decision? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  At Board level they approved 
it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and on what date was that?  You will 
find that at paragraph 73. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Thanks so much.  That was 29 June. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And 2019 is that right? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No that cannot be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That cannot be correct. 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  2018. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is – we will need to make a … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A correction there.  Are you comfortable with 
that sentence reading: 
“In their meeting dated 29 June 2018 …” 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Absolutely.  That is the right date. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “…the Board took a decision.” 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  otherwise we would have been in a 
time … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or we teleported ourselves … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Forward in time right.  If … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course it is a meeting of the 29 t h? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 118 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not a meeting dated the 29th. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed.  That is – that also we should have 
said in their meeting of 29 June.  Is that accurate … 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Vaughan?  Thank you.  At 74 you talk about 
an article that appeared prior to that recommendation of EML being 
appointed from the BAC will you please tell us what that article 
indicated and what approach was taken to it within SAA? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  On 28 May 2018 there was 
article that appeared in one of the Sunday papers stating that EML had 
10 
got – they got – they were awarded by SA Express – they were awarded 
a contract by Express irregularly – irregular award it was a lucrative - 
that is basically what it said … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you aware of the article at the time? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I was aware of it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you take any steps in relation to it? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I did not because it said that it was 
irregular.  There was not a proper procurement followed by SA Express.  
My question was to the team our process was regular.  It was a tender 
process that took place and that we had evaluated EML – evaluated 
20 
them with everybody else and they had come out with a competitive bid.  
So I did not take – I did not take that or I took it into account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go over the page to page 19 can you 
clarify was the article brought to the attention of the Board at all? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No it was not.  Not to my knowledge 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 119 of 130 
 
(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you would not know if any of them had 
independently been aware of it? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you attend the Board Meeting at which the 
decision was finally made? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and at page 19 you have a heading 
there “EML Performance”.  Can you take us through after award the 
extent to which EML performed under the agreement? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  EML with the other majors were 
awarded from 1 July 2018.  EML started supplying us for the first 10 to 
15 days of July.  Thereafter they were unable to supply for the rest of 
the month.  The reason being that we understood was that there was a 
deposit that needed to be paid to the JV in order to put through or to 
have a throughput and they had not paid that yet.  So there they could 
not supply for the rest of the month. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happened thereafter? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  In August EML approached us and 
said that they would be asking an IDC guarantee to be moved to Shell 
20 
from Total because they wanted to change suppliers from Total to Shell.  
So that took place in the month of August – I believe.  September and 
October they supplied us through Shell through the JV and in August in 
well when they approached us when they were moving it to Shell they 
wanted to meet with us to negotiate terms. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 120 of 130 
 
We did meet with them.  We told them we cannot negotiate 
terms as the Letter of Award was given on the basis of them – well on 
the pricing that they had given and also the terms.  So in other words 
payment terms and everything and we could not negotiate that midway 
through a contract.  The supply then was given for two months on the 
pricing that was agreed to in the award – in the Letter of Award for 
September and October. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happened thereafter? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  After September they approached us 
again and said that they would be moving their supply back to Total and 
10 
they had approached the IDC I believe to then move the guarantee back 
to Total which was required before Total would give or supply fuel to 
them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were they able to supply fuel after that 
point? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Well since that point up until today we 
have not received anything from EML.  So EML supplied fuel to SAA for 
two months and – call it – 15 days (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Since their award in – that ought to have 
commenced from 1 July 2018.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if you go over to page 20 
at paragraph 84 there you talk about an interaction that occurred with 
the IDC.  What happened there? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  In the process of EML wanting to 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 121 of 130 
 
move their guarantee back to Total we were informed by EML that the 
IDC would like to meet with us and on 30 November there was a 
meeting that took place where the – where employees of the IDC came 
to see us. 
What they were asking for - they were asking for the 
performance of EML as well as were they invoicing us correctly.  So our 
response to – to the IDC at that point was that we told them exactly 
what I have said now is that EML supplied us for 15 days in the first 
month of the contract. 
August no supply and on 31 November for the month of 
10 
November they had not – they had not supplied us either.  On the point 
where they said was E – EML invoicing us correctly we said they had 
invoiced us correctly.  So when they did supply they gave us the correct 
pricing and they charged us the correct amount. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Vaughan from paragraph 86 on that 
page you deal with the impact of EML’s non-performance on SAA. Can 
you describe us – describe for us what that impact has been? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Okay.  So if you look at SAA at the – 
when we out on tender it was for – I speak correction – it was four 
about call it 40 million litres.  EML was supplying two percent - ag – 2 
20 
million litres per month which is less than three percent of the total 
volume.  Now bearing in mind that when we talk about volumes it is 
indicative volumes so the R swings up and down. 
There would not – if EML could not supply from a security of 
supply point of view it would not be a big problem because we could 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 122 of 130 
 
spread that that those 2 million litres amongst the rest of the suppliers.  
That is also a reason why airlines generally around the world especially 
at their hub airport like Johannesburg – OR Tambo is would spread the 
risk amongst the multiple suppliers. 
So that if one supplier cannot supply you can get the volume 
from other suppliers or get it easily but in – if you have a look at that – 
so there was from the spreading of the risk the 2 million litres was not 
an issue and to aid with it as well SA in this period has cut back on 
routes due to the position we are in at the moment. 
So we have cancelled non-profit making routes and so our 
10 
volumes are also lower than – that we had out on tender.  So to replace 
2 million litres in short was not a problem Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – and if I could just pick up a point there.  
I meant to actually ask it earlier.  If you look at that ranking of the 
prices in the 2018 tender it does occur to one to ask well why did you 
not give the full volume to the cheapest provider or supplier of fuel.  I 
understand you now to have explained that there is a need to spread 
the risk of supply.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct.  So what you do is – 
how do I answer this?  First of all you have – you have multiple 
20 
suppliers.  You would like to have more supply than demand because 
then you can give to the most competitive suppliers.  So in the case – 
and which we do – I mean we give to the – the first thing you look at it 
is security of supply. 
Given the case of Johannesburg all the suppliers are – are 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 123 of 130 
 
reputable suppliers.  We have got security of supply from them.  So the 
person who comes in or the company that comes in at the most 
competitive price for instance – Sasol – would get their full volume that 
they bid for.  So in the case of Sasol they got 15 million litres and then 
you go down the scale and at the end the company that has got the 
most expensive falls off. 
So that you will see that we do not supply – we do not – we 
do not award to – we do not award to all the companies that bid. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you also I understand your evidence – we 
do not award to a sole supplier? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That would increase your risk too much.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is (indistinct) yes.  So on all – all 
occasions where there are very small volumes where there only sole 
suppliers you then award to but you are quite right Chair you are quite 
right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I just follow up on the point about the 
impact of EML’s non-performance I understand you to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Where you spread your risk as you say to 
different suppliers would the agreement be generally that you are one 
of our suppliers.  That does not mean we are obliged to get fuel from 
you all the time.  We have a number of suppliers and we ask anyone of 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 124 of 130 
 
them at any particular time to give us so much and obviously we will try 
and spread that because you do not want – want to be - on the panel as 
it were – but not get anything. 
Would that be the basis so that no – no one can claim that so 
much must be – so much fuel must obtained from them no matter what?  
In other words is there – is there a minimum or is there no minimum 
that you have got to get from each one or it is simply that you are on 
the panel and during the period when you are on the panel sometimes 
we will ask you for fuel sometimes we will not ask you. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Chair if I can maybe explain a little bit 
10 
more … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It might give clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So what happens is we ask – we say 
this is what – this is the volume that is required.  We then go out to the 
panel of companies – if you want to put it that way and we say to them 
please bid on the volume and give us your pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So with their appetite risk towards 
20 
SAA or the airline they – and all what they have got available as well 
they would bid a certain volume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Now with that been said we would 
then – we go through the price or through the evaluation process … 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 125 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  And see who is the most competitive 
in their pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So the most competitive company then 
would get the full volume that they bid for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So it is indicative volume.  So they do 
not get exactly the same every month … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  But they would get the full volume 
they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Bid for.  Company number two then 
would get most probably they would also get the full volume they bid for 
and so on down the list until we have made up the volume that was out 
on tender and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until you make up …? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The last company would fall off or last 
20 
two companies would fall off the list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that would until you make up 100 percent of 
what you need? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 126 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That would make – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  I spoke before you finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is it on the basis that during the period of the 
agreement we expect you to have available to us at different intervals 
maybe different amounts but at the end of the period what we 
undertake to do is get from you not less than so much? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So it is not – not less than case Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  It is an – an indication … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the exact amount? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja.  So it is indication.  So at the end 
of the period there could be slight a fluctuation month to month … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  But at the end of the period for 
instance it may … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is more or less? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAGHAN:  Yes more or less.  Within – whether you 
20 
can call it a five percent swing up or down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – but you – you – the volume you get from – 
you agree upon with a particular supplier is an – is a volume for the 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 127 of 130 
 
whole period? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And each month you might be asking for a portion of 
that? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Different portions? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as at the end of the period what you have 
asked from them is more or less the indication that had been agreed? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and that that – that helps among other 
things that if the one supplier has a strike you are not stranded.  Your – 
your aircrafts continue to fly because you go to anyone or more of the 
other suppliers? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  So if there would be a strike or a 
shutdown or a – not a scheduled shutdown … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Anything like that or if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  If a pipeline failed or if … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  A rail accident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and if you had one supplier then you would 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 128 of 130 
 
have a problem in that situation? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Very true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then to follow up on the impact of EML’s 
non-performance I understand your evidence Mr Vaughan to be in 
summary that it did not have a negative impact.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But as I understand your evidence that is 
dependent on two conditions.  The one was the small percentage of the 
total volume that they were going to be supplying.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is it fair for me to say it would follow from that 
that the greater the proportion of the volume that they were suppling or 
any non-performing supplier was allocated would have a greater 
negative impact/ 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the second factor as I understood 
your evidence was that it so happened in the period that we are looking 
at here that SAA had cancelled certain routes and so its actual 
requirements were less than what you had estimated as the indicative 
20 
requirements.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so similarly if you had not – I will not call it 
– had that fortune because it may not have been a fortune to SAA to 
cancel routes … 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 129 of 130 
 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  You are right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But if – if it had been the case and a given 
here that you had increased routes in fact then the impact of 
non-performance on any of the allocated suppliers – I assume – would 
have been greater? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that and then the current status 
of that contract with EML if you can just conclude to give us a picture 
of that. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  The current status of the contract is 
10 
still running.  It expires in a few days’ time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was not cancelled? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  No it was not cancelled. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But there has not been performance as I 
understand your evidence since November 2018.  Is that correct? 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Those are the questions from 
our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I indicated at the outset of Mr Vaughan’s 
20 
evidence it plays an important part in linking what then happens in the 
later evidence that will be presented of the investigation on the IDC 
Funding side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you very much Mr Vaughan for coming to 
give evidence.  If you required to come back we will ask you but 
25 JUNE 2019 – DAY 120 
 
Page 130 of 130 
 
otherwise you are excused. 
MR MARK EDMUND VAUGHAN:  Thanks so much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Is that what we have for today? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My proposal is that we should be comfortable 
to complete within the course of tomorrow with tomorrow’s witness and 
so starting at 10:00 am should be convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  We will adjourn the 
proceedings for the day.  We will adjourn the proceedings for the day 
10 
and tomorrow we will start at 10:00 am.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 26 JUNE 2019
