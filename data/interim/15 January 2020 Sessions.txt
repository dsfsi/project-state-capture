PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 15 JANUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I am ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please give me an outline of what this witness will 
testify about.  I have had a look at the affidavit and then let us take it 
from there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Chair the next witness is Colonel Van 
Loggerenberg and he is going to testify about his role in the 
10 
investigation of the Panday matter and he is also going to testify as to 
how that investigation was stopped and the blocks put in their way as 
to continue with this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Amigos matter? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He is not going to testify with regard to the 
Amigos matter another witness will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that with some – another witness? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  He will testify… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is only the Panday matter? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Only the Panday matter yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I think it is another – the other witness who refers 
to both. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Panday matter and the Amigos matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 3 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  A Mr Trevor White is a forensic investigator. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And he will testify about both matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is he – is he the next witness? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No he – he… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is the next witness after this witness? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The next witness is General Lebeya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  My – my – my recollection when I read the 
statement suggesting – oh my impression was that we might not take 
more than three hours with this witness.  Is that too optimistic? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think that that is too optimistic Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think it will take a little bit longer.  I – I 
expected to be most of today with this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well what I want.  A lot of things will not be 
controversial I think that he will be testifying about. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want us to move fast on issues that are not 
controversial. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether it is this witness or another 
witness where I realised that out of everything said in the affidavit 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 4 of 162 
 
there could only be one that could possibly be controversial.  The rest 
could not be disputed by anybody because they are very much about 
correspondence and about things for which there seems to be 
documented proof or just procedural issues on investigations.  So – the 
bottom line is that we must do justice to every witness where this is 
evidence but we do need to try and move with speed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have all the time.  So – so do your best in 
regard to making sure we move with speed.  Things that are unlikely to 
be undisputed you must not stay too long on them. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But nevertheless let us do justice to the evidence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Are you ready that the witness be 
sworn in? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Johannes Van Loggerenberg. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
20 
oath? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 5 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be 
the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise 
your right hand and say, so help me God. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Van Loggerenberg have you deposed 
to an affidavit which you have submitted to the commission? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the affidavit in front of you is that your 
affidavit and if you look at page 18? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should we not admit this exhibit first? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not think it has been admitted before? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No I was going to do afterwards but you are 
correct I should do it before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If I might place this exhibit into evidence 
Chair?  It has been marked subject to your approval Exhibit RR1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the affidavit of Mr Johannes Van Loggerenberg 
together with the annexures to his affidavit contained in the lever arch 
file will be marked Exhibit RR1.  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 6 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Van Loggerenberg the affidavit in 
front of you, is that your affidavit and on page 18 is that your 
signature? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And are you satisfied that the contents of the 
affidavit are true and correct? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Van Loggerenberg could you please 
tell the Chair about your history in the South African Police Services? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I joined the South African 
10 
Police Services in 1975.  I left again in 1977 and I re-joined in 1982.  
Up until the late’80’s when I was at the Commercial Branch during that 
period I was the [inaudible] staff.  I was at the Commercial Branch and 
then after that I went to the Heath Commission.  Judge Heath and I 
worked there for eighteen months and then I came back to Department 
of Justice.  It was the Directorate of Serious Economic Offences which 
opened in KwaZulu Natal.  And then I started there and then it became 
the Scorpions and then up until the Scorpions were closing pushed 
back to the Police Force.  And I retired in 19 – 2015 sorry and about 30 
– 35 years’ experience in commercial investigation.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  You – you might wish to raise your 
voice a little bit when you speak so I can hear you clearly. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Okay I will try to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Van Loggerenberg 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 7 of 162 
 
how did you come to be involved in the criminal case involving Mr 
Thoshan Panday? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair Brigadier Kemp who was the 
Provincial Financial Head of KwaZulu Natal came across irregularities.  
His guard of accommodation and he submitted an interim report to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat who – who was the financial 
head? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is a Brigadier Kemp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Brigadier Kemp. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Brigadier Lawrence Kemp. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay yes  Lawrence Charles Kemp. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Kemp that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay he was the financial head. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Of Provincial of KwaZulu Natal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And then he put all his findings in a 
report and he handed his report to the Provincial Commissioner at the 
time it was Lieutenant General Mkubeni who gave it to General 
Booysen.  There were other generals who – he also gave it to.  And 
then he asked General Booysen to look into the matter.  Then General 
20 
Booysen handed the report over to Brigadier Lategan which in turn 
handed the report over to Colonel Soobramoney Wassserman who was 
the first in this [inaudible] ops in this matter.  It was an inquiry at first 
and then two or three months after he started the inquiry… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry when you say it was an inquiry first. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 8 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  We did not open a CAS number 
immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just talked to find out certain information. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  To find out more evidence what – 
you know what is alleged to get more evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And then after that two or three 
months the – we heard Colonel Wasserman and Soobramoney resigned. 
Then I took over the matter.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So before Colonel Soobramoney resigned was it the 
10 
two of you, you and Colonel Soobramoney who were tasked with doing 
the inquiry that you talk about. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he resigned and then you took over? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I took over Chair and then also I 
got onto the team Colonel S Y Govender and Colonel Phillip Herbst.  
The initial investigators on the investigation.  We started investigating 
the matter and the allegations made by Brigadier Kemp in his report 
20 
and to our knowledge it was a cut and clear case of corruption and 
fraud.  After we attained some evidence from financial office.  We then 
opened up a case that is [inaudible] CAS 781.  And then we started 
issuing bank subpoena’s for banks alluded first a ground the 
investigation and then… 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 9 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just to help everyone understand.  At that 
stage this appeared to be a case of corruption relating to what and 
involving whom at that stage? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair it appeared that the 
corruption was that police members at Supply Chain Management 
Colonel Navin Madhoe and Captain Naran Vissan were used by 
businessman Toshan Panday to acquire tenders in respect of 
accommodating police members and also for the 2010 soccer world 
cup.  We did some preliminary inquiries at hotels and bed and breakfast 
places. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And then we noticed that the prices 
charged by Toshan Panday’s companies and the price of the B&B 
actually charged Toshan Panday’s companies is 200 to 400% more than 
what the police actually paid for the stuff.  And then from that we 
started investigating – a full investigation onto this matter.   
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage you said it was now yourself and who? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Myself, Colonel S Y Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And Colonel Phillip Herbst. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The three of you? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The three of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is doing the investigation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And to whom were you reporting at that stage 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 10 of 162 
 
in terms of the investigation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  At this stage Chair we were 
reporting to General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But I must also inform you Chair 
that we – we at that stage were at the anti-corruption task team ACTT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And the head of the – well our local 
head of the Provincial – ah from the ACTT was Colonel Jones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you can – you may continue. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Colonel Van Loggerenberg you 
have said that all cases were registered which were linked to this 
investigation.  Could you give the Chair an outline of each of the cases 
and explain your involvement.  So if we could start with Durban Central 
case 781.  Who was the investigator in that case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I was the main investigator, 
the project manager in this case.  And this case when we fully started 
to investigating the matter we saw that Colonel Navin – Colonel 
Madhoe was responsible to attain accommodation for members of the 
police force in respect of the 2010 soccer world cup.  Then we started 
20 
digging into that and what we discovered that Province had meetings 
for different sections which was required for the 2010 soccer world cup. 
And there was a meeting it was known as the Section 4 meeting.  That 
was for the acquisition of the goods and accommodation for the soccer 
world cup.  And the chair of that commission Section 4 was Brigadier 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 11 of 162 
 
Govender from Province Head Office.  What we found in the minutes of 
every meeting is that Colonel Madhoe was responsible to acquire 
accommodation for the members.  But these meetings started twelve – 
fifteen months before the 2010 soccer world cup.  They were preparing 
now for the soccer world cup.  And at the end of the day as their 
meetings progressed and progressed and it came to number 99 at every 
meeting Colonel Madhoe had an excuse that he could not get any joy 
from head office to assist him obtaining this accommodation.  But as far 
we could gather that each province was responsible and they could 
approve the accommodation for the police members in their province.  
10 
And then we discovered that at number 99 Colonel Madhoe used 
Regulation 16 – Chair I am not sure if it is 16A4 or 1614 from the 
Treasury [inaudible] that he can nominate supplies without proper 
tenders and things like that.  What he then did is he supplied a memo 
to head office stating that he has got these companies Gold Coast 
Trading and he mentioned other few companies that can supply 
accommodation for the police members that is required for the soccer 
world cup which is going to start in a couple of days.  And they actually 
said okay fine you can go ahead.  But if you look at what Supply Chain 
did – Colonel Madhoe did now with Colonel Madhoe there was another 
20 
Captain Narain Prasad working with Colonel Madhoe.  They in advance 
issued tenders to B&B’s and hotels in KZN for the accommodation of 
the members for the 2010 soccer world cup.  There was a hotel that the 
police always use in KZN it is Coastlands.  It is called the Coastlands 
Hotel and we approached them and we approached all the others and 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 12 of 162 
 
they said yes they did get tender documents.  They did tender.  They 
sent the tenders back but nothing happened when they sent these 
tenders back to Supply Chain Management to Captain Narain Prasad.  
And at the end of the day it was discovered that although they received 
these tenders they just kept them under the carpet.  And they did not 
mention anything to the committee or to anybody we have received 
tenders but you must push through this emergency application for the 
accommodation to be approved by Supply Chain Management. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was your – I am sorry.  So did you form the view 
10 
that there was an illegitimate reason for not telling anybody about 
these so that ultimately they would say this was an emergency so we 
were justified in not going out to tender? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair during our investigation at 
the end of the day we could prove that Colonel Madhoe and Captain 
Narain Prasad deliberately kept that information from the police.  
Because if you can see Toshan Panday purchased them some goods 
and sent them on holidays and he wined and dined them and they got 
something for their favours that they did for Toshan Panday. And you 
could see that in the Minutes of the Meetings.  I mean I can also say 
20 
that during our investigation at Head Office Supply Chain we came 
across a letter where Toshan Panday faxed to our Supply Chain 
department in Pretoria where at the time Madhoe wrote that letter 
requesting this [indistinct] point at number 99 in terms of this 
regulation Toshan Panday in a fax quoted to our head office that he has 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 13 of 162 
 
20 hotels block booked for members at that point in time.  But when we 
actually physically did an investigation we never had one room from 
any hotel or any B&B for any member.  So that was a blatant lie.  And 
once that was approved by head office then we heard from the B&B’s 
and the hotels that we approached that no Toshan Panday came around 
and okay it was you know they were cut out of the deal but they got to 
make the best of it and eventually they gave us some business and that 
is the – how it ended up that Toshan Panday got the contract for 
accommodation.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel could you tell the Chair did this 
10 
Coastland Hotel that you referred to, did they respond to the tender? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair I personally went and 
saw them. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I saw the Director.  They showed 
me the tenders that they received.  The showed me the tenders that 
they forwarded to Supply Chain Management and yes they did respond 
to the tenders they received and actually in fact sent it back to Colonel 
Naranka to Captain Naranka Sir. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And were they ultimately used to provide 
20 
accommodation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Toshan Panday actually used 
them to provide accommodation for the police. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was the difference between the 
tender – I mean the invoices he charged the police for accommodation 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 14 of 162 
 
at this hotel and the tender that had been provided? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  You see what Toshan Panday did is 
he – if the hotel or the B&B asks him – I quote take an example.  
R1000.00 a room for two members.  He would charge the police 
R2000.00 a room.  And that is what he did with all the accommodation.  
Sometimes more than double.  Sometimes 400% more than the actual 
price of the room.  He charged the police.  And those invoices were 
signed off by Supply Chain Management Narain Prasad and Madhoe 
and he got paid for them.  I mean during our searches in [inaudible] we 
also applied for searches and seizes, warrants.  All the premises of 
10 
Toshan Panday.  The premises of our Supply Chain Management at 
Province, finance at Province, the members who were involved, their 
personal homes.  Supplied – we got search warrants, search and 
seizure warrants.  Toshan Panday offices.  We did all the searches and 
seizers and in Toshan Panday’s one office we came across an A5 hard 
cover black book.  He has got a – his company names and it is all with 
columns this tender he would know okay Ballitones got the tender.  
Then he would say there okay Gold Coast did not get the tender.  Then 
you got the actual price and then he says okay this is Ballitones price.  
If you can see the price you [inaudible]. He kept actually – kept a 
20 
record of that in his possession and [indistinct] all handed over to Price 
Waterhouse Coopers who did the financial investigations into this.  And 
then Chair we also discovered that – I actually took an affidavit from a 
company in Pinetown who supplied what do you call it?  Generators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you can look at your statement to refresh your 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 15 of 162 
 
memory if you need to do that. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  Chair I approached the 
company where Toshan Panday bought generators for the soccer 2010 
world cup but it is small generators, it is not big generators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And the price he paid for each 
generator was R4,900.00.  I took the affidavit of that company.  And 
then I checked up and followed up on what did he charge the police for 
the generator, that same generator.  And he charged the police between 
R92,000.00 and R97,000.00 for one generator.  And that was signed off 
10 
by Supply Chain Management and Toshan Panday got paid for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he – he would have paid about how much to – for 
the generator? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:    R5,000.00 per generator. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then he charged SAPS about R92,000.00. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  For one and the police paid them.  
It is ridiculous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm to say the least.  Shoo.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Ms Wentzel.  Yes you may continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you explain to the Chair how Mr Panday 
used his various companies to carry out cover quoting to make sure 
that whichever of – would you just explain it in your own words? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 16 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Okay Chair in the beginning what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is better that you let him just explain.  Do not 
lead him. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair in the beginning Toshan 
Panday approached Supply Chain Management with I think it was five 
or six companies.  It was Gold Coast Trading, Unite Mzantsi Trading, 
Valotone, Bavosat then there is one – if I can just refresh my memory 
here.  Kaseev Traders.  Now Gold Coast Trading was the only CC – he 
was the only member of Gold Coast Trading.  The Valotone and all the 
others were in his wife’s name or his sister’s name and his brother-in-
10 
law’s name.  Those documentation from CIPS he gave them to the 
police.  And once these companies were registered on the police data 
base what he did he changed the founding affidavit of the CC’s with 
CPIS and he made that he was the only director.  He changed it so that 
he is the only director of all those companies which he had given to the 
police.  So the police at head office never got that information from 
Panday that this was changed or even our Provincial.  But our 
Provincial with the policemen there they knew it was Toshan Panday’s 
companies.  But – so he controlled each and every company at the end 
of the day.  How it can be [indistinct] by Trevor White from Price 
20 
Waterhouse Cooper as well.  He controlled all the finances.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did these companies purport to compete 
for tenders? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair they did and at the end 
of the day he actually kept note which companies competed for a 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 17 of 162 
 
specific tender and he also made note of which company won the 
tender.  And the next tender he would use another company and that is 
how he would play the one off against the other.  But he would get all 
the tenders at the end of the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he recorded all of this? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Was that in the black book that was 
discussed? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  That is in the 
10 
book we seized. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were these – I am sorry.  These various entities that 
he was using did they maybe use one of his – shed of his – were they – 
were the addresses given for them, was it one address?  [Indistinct]. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair it is – all his one address and 
that is Toshan Panday’s business address in Umhlanga Rocks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They used one address? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  They had used one address ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you explain to the Chair how 
Colonel Madhoe… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am sorry.  That – that should suggest that 
anyone who considered their bids should have found that suspicious, is 
it not? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 18 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair but the thing is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if the … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  In the proper sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If companies that are competing for a bid are sharing 
the same address. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes but you see they did not know 
that.  That did not know that.  But the policemen knew. 
CHAIRPERSON: But would not the tender documents – would they not 
reflect the address of the company that is bidding for the work? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sure Chair that was all dealt with 
10 
by Colonel Madhoe and Captain Narain Prasad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the ones who were – who would have seen this 
were people who were working with him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But – but talking generally nobody who had to 
make those decision could not have picked it up if they did their job 
properly? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  And could you just explain to the 
Chair how Colonel Madhoe helped Mr Panday get his companies 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 19 of 162 
 
registered on the data base for the police Supply Chain Management? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair what we discovered is that 
once Toshan Panday… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the way to ask that question Ms Wentzel is 
whether Colonel Madhoe had any role that he played in – did you say 
registration? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then how he helped? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair what happened there is that 
10 
Colonel Madhoe supplied him with the applications for the registration 
on the Supply Chain Management data basis.  Once Colonel Madhoe 
received those documentations from those companies from Toshan 
Panday he gave it to a member who drove up to Pretoria by vehicle – 
not putting it through the normal channels – drove up by vehicle to 
Pretoria Supply Chain Management and arranged for it be put on the 
data base asap, like the next day.  So it never went through the proper 
channels to put on the data base in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what would have been the proper channels? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So you normally send it by post. 
20 
The receiving memo’s I do not know what the internal provincial and 
national Supply Chain – how actually they operate but I – I presume 
nobody will drive up every day with applications to Pretoria and say put 
this on the data base immediately.  I mean I do not think it works that 
way. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 20 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well maybe he thought the provincial people are 
too slow. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Maybe they were too slow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I have been approached to ask for a 
technical adjournment.  Apparently there is a problem with the 
transcription. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us take a – hopefully a five minutes 
10 
adjournment to allow the technicians to attend to the problem.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Colonel Van Loggerenberg, 
did you involved forensic investigators in the investigation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, what we did from the outset 
20 
and we saw the (inaudible) of documentation and work that has got to 
be done in this investigation.  I am talking about 781 itself.  We 
approached the Head Office and requested for a forensic audit to assist 
the investigation.  I have submitted the mandate to our Head Office that 
was put out on tender and a forensic auditing company was appointed 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 21 of 162 
 
which I did not know then.  From somewhere in KZN.  They came and 
visited us and it was sure that they could not do the job. 
Then we wrote the letter back to our Head Office put it on 
tender again and that is when PricewaterhouseCoopers was awarded 
the tender and then we met up with them and the mandate was given to 
them - explained what we wanted.  During the search and seizures all 
the stuff that was searched - all the - all the evidence that we got was 
handed over to them.  Everything was given to them. 
We served 205s on numerous bank accounts - numerous 
credit card accounts.  It was all given to them.  At the end of the day 
10 
781 - the forensic report is 372 pages.  The dockets have got over 220 
affidavits and the exhibit files for the forensic report is 20 lever arch 
files.  So it is a big - it is a big case and the evidence is over - 
overwhelming.  It is overwhelming.  I just want to mention that to you 
Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Could you tell the Chair what 
benefits you found people involved in this matter received from 
Mr Panday? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us ask that differently.  Was there anything that 
was received that motivated some of the people in the SAPS to 
20 
cooperate with - with Panday - Mr Panday? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair.  At the end of the day 
we discovered that - we start by the Provincial Commissioner.  She 
arranged a surprise birthday party for her husband. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 22 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  At the Dish Restaurant in Umhlanga 
Rocks.  Her husband was a Brigadier also in the police force at that 
time.  During our investigations we discovered that the Dish was paid 
for - a deposit was paid of R10 000,00 by Thoshan Panday.  The 
balance of the birthday party - that is everything inclusive a DJ. 
We discovered that that was paid by Thoshan on - on 
Thoshan Panday’s credit card and I went to the Dish Restaurant and I 
then have a letter from Mr Freddy Singh.  State in his affidavit as I told 
you now Chair and furthermore the birthday party - if I can recall it - 
was on 29 May, but Thoshan Panday came afterwards to the Manager at 
10 
the desk and asked him to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is 29 May what year? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair that was - it was 20 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  2010?  The World Cup was in 2010. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It was after that Chair.  Let me just 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I will get to the date Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But what Thoshan Panday also did.  
20 
He - after the birthday party he went back to the Dish Restaurant and 
spoke to the Manager and he asked the Manager to give him a new 
invoice in the name of the PC.  It is … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was now … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ngobeni. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 23 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The name of the Provincial Commissioner? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And he must also put his name by 
the - what do you call it?  As a - by the reference number on the 
invoice.  In other words what - what I could gather what it would show 
is that Thoshan Panday could use this as a benefit for tax purposes or 
it could show that the PC actually appointed him to arrange this 
birthday party to cover for that, but with PricewaterhouseCoopers 
investigation no money could be traced Paid from the PC or her 
10 
husband 
to 
any 
of 
Thoshan Panday’s 
accounts 
and 
then 
Colonel Madhoe went on holiday in Cape Town with his family and we 
discovered that Thoshan Panday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and around when would that holiday have been?  
Ms Wentzel you can guide him in terms of … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where he might find certain information. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you have a look at page 4 your statement. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just firstly just for clarity in paragraphs 5.7 
20 
and 5.8 you deal with this party and the date is 29 May 2010 … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But now you are dealing with 5.12 - 
Colonel Madhoe.  You can have a look at that to refresh your memory 
on page 4. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 24 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
Chair 
that 
is 
correct.  
Colonel Madhoe went to Cape Town with his family on holiday which 
Thoshan Panday paid for.  That was - that is also in the forensic report 
and then what Thoshan Panday also did.  He bought a vehicle for 
Colonel Madhoe.  We also got affidavits to that effect in the forensic 
report and Captain Narainpersad was bought a treadmill which was 
delivered at his house. 
We got that evidence in the forensic report and also 
Captain Narainpersad’s son was studying at the college in Durban and 
we discovered that Thoshan Panday paid for the college fees for 
10 
Narainpersad’s son and then also further on when we looked at 
Colonel (inaudible) … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do - do - do you remember what he paid in terms of 
college fees or … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do - do you not have that at hand? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sir, I think the college fees was in 
the region of R29 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and do you remember how much the holiday 
would have cost that Colonel Madhoe … 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Took to - to Cape Town? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, I do not have the exact 
figure with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you have got it somewhere in the documents that 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 25 of 162 
 
… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  I do.  It will be in the forensic 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  If we do not have it here.  If that can be 
obtained so that one gets a picture of how much was spent on … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair - Chair I believe the Forensic 
Auditor - Trevor White … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will deal with those things? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He is still coming to testify … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  He is coming.  Ja. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And he is the author of that report.  
So he will have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So he has got all of that there. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He will all - have all of that on 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  That is correct Chair.  Colonel could you 
now please tell the Chair about case number 386.  What did that relate 
to? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are now at page 5? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We are at page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, it was decided that we take 
the evidence of the surprise party.  The main docket - 781 - and 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 26 of 162 
 
register a separate case just for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the - the surprise party again is the … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Birthday party … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Birthday party of the Provincial Commissioner’s 
husband? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So a docket was registered just for 
that. 
 
The 
investigating 
officer 
appointed 
to 
do 
that 
was 
Colonel Phillip Herbst.  So he was actually the one dealing with that 
10 
matter as I was concentrating on 781 and from 781 different cases 
came about, but I kept on 781. 
The other investigators kept on the other cases, but what I 
know - the knowledge that I know of 386 is that the docket was opened.  
That evidence was presented to - it was Advocate Mzinyathi at the time 
when he was still here at the province in KZN and then it was - he 
agreed that there is enough evidence to prosecute this matter and then 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say the evidence of Advocate Mzinyathi? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
The 
evidence 
was 
given 
- 
Colonel Herbst approached Advocate Mzinyathi … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And his view was that there is 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 27 of 162 
 
prima facie - there is enough evidence to prosecute the … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But he resigned - or he no longer 
left - he left the office and then Advocate Noko took over - took over 
the 
office 
of 
KZN 
and 
then 
this 
docket 
was 
handed 
to 
Advocate Wendy Greef and at the end of the day she felt that there is 
not sufficient evidence to continue with this matter. 
We were obviously not sharing the same views as she was 
sharing, but there was nothing that we could do at that point in time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of the reasons would that be the reasons 
that were given to say there was not enough evidence there? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be covered by Mr White? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  That would - yes.  That is 
another report Chair.  She - she felt that there is insufficient evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She felt that there is not enough 
evidence … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So there is a report that … 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  It is in the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody else will … (intervenes). 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  It is in the docket Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright, but tell me your own 
understanding of what the reasons were that were given for that 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 28 of 162 
 
conclusion.  If you are able to. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, my view is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words when you were told what the reasons 
were why she said there was not enough evidence. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to understand what your own thinking was 
when you were told that. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you in agreement you are not in agreement 
or what were the main features of her reasons. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair my view is that I think all the 
dockets should stay one docket and we should make it a racketeering 
case.  If you take individual cases away the circumstances surrounding 
that individual case and what is going around in the racketeering 
docket is not there.  You understand what I am saying?  In the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you lose … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you lose the chain? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  If you separate them, but if you look at them 
20 
together … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  If you look at them together … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You will get the proper picture. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  You will get a proper picture of 
actually what was going on.  Ja. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 29 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That was my feeling about this 
case in the first place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So did - did you think that that may have been 
the reason why she might not have seen that there was enough 
evidence? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  I have - I have - I would say 
that.  Yes Chair.  That she could have thought about that and I would 
not hold it against her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  She would have known that the cases were 
10 
separated.  Is it not? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Yes.  She knew about the 
cases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if she was experienced enough would she not 
have known that looking at one and not looking at all of them could 
disadvantage her and therefore should not he - could she not have said 
look I want to see everything? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She - she - Chair she could have, 
but I cannot answer for her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, but you - you see you have been around. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have been in - in the police service for a long 
time … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have dealt with many prosecutors.  I have no 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 30 of 162 
 
doubt. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know and you have a - you know a reasonable 
sense of when there is a case and when there is not a case. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For most of the cases I am sure that you have dealt 
with. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now what I am asking is whether when somebody in 
her position looks at a case in isolation when with your own knowledge 
10 
you know that if somebody looks at that case alone.  They will not get a 
proper picture.  They will need to look at that other one as well. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody in her position who decides not to look at 
the other case … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that not say to you, but how could she confine 
herself to this case, because with her experience in that position she 
should know you cannot get a full picture by looking at one case. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  No.  I agree with you Chair.  
20 
She - she should have or she could have gone and looked at the whole 
picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Instead of just making a decision 
on this … 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 31 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  One - one case alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Van Loggerenberg just to give 
the Chair a bigger picture we will deal with it in more detail in due 
course.  What was the Provincial Commissioner’s involvement in this 
investigation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She was the suspect in this 
investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But why was she a suspect? 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Because it was discovered that 
Thoshan Panday paid for all these expenses and there is no way that 
she appointed him as an agent to pay for these expenses and it can 
only boil down to she is the Provincial Commander.  He got all the 
tenders. 
I mean she knew what was going on, because there is 
evidence that she actually tried to stop this investigation and yes.  She 
was the suspect in the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that - that is case number 386? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was she only the suspect or was Mr Panday also 
another suspect? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She and Mr Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were the suspects in the matter? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 32 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright and 781 was it only Mr Panday who was 
a - a suspect? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  Chair 781 was the PC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It was Major General - I will get to 
his 
name 
now. 
 
Colonel Madhoe. 
 
Captain Narainpersad.  
Thoshan Panday’s wife.  Thoshan Panday’s sister.  Thoshan Panday’s 
brother-in-law.  All the companies mentioned.  They were all listed as 
the suspects in the forensic report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that one - that case - case 781 related to the 
10 
procurement issues? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Supply chain management issues … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this one related to the birthday party and 
stopping of the investigation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But Chair, I - I just want to tell you.  
328 - the evidence from 328 was actually extracted from the forensic 
report in 781 to register a separate case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You are talking about 328 now.  You mean 386? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Three - which is the party docket? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I asked you about 386.  I just want to make sure … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are on the same page. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is page 5? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 33 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  386 is page 5. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The birthday party.  Yes.  The 
birthday party - 386. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So when you said 328 you meant 386? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  This evidence was taken from the 
forensic report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja of Mr White. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  From the affidavits we obtained in 
10 
781. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Then it is … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was like an offshoot of …? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then Colonel Van Loggerenberg just to 
clarify if you have regard to paragraph 6.12 of your statement.  Mention 
there is made of Advocate Mlotshwa.  What was his involvement? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He was then the - the Acting DDP 
at KwaZulu-Natal at that time and that is when Colonel Herbst went and 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 34 of 162 
 
saw him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was his view of the case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  His view that there was prima facie 
evidence and there was enough evidence to continue in this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when earlier on you told me that the evidence 
was presented to Advocate Mzinyathi who said there was enough case.  
Did that relate to case 781? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No sir.  That - no Chair.  Sorry.  
That relates to 386. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So under - in regard to three - case 386 you therefore 
10 
have like two NPA officials who said there is enough case - 
Advocate Mzinyathi and Advocate Mlotshwa.  They both said there is 
enough evidence.  Is that correct? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes, but those people left.  Yes 
Chair.  That is correct, but then at the end of the day it ended up with 
Wendy Greef - with Advocate Wendy Greef. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I - what I am saying is am I correct in 
understanding that in regard to this case namely 386 two officials - two 
prosecutors from 
the 
NPA 
- Advocate Mzinyathi at 
one 
stage 
Advocate Mlotshwa at another stage - both separately said there was 
20 
enough evidence to prosecute? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
And 
what 
was 
the 
involvement 
of 
Advocate Noko? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 35 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Advocate Noko actually became the 
Deputy Director Public Prosecutions in KZN and Mlotshwa was no 
longer there and also Mzinyathi - I think - resigned and he went to the 
private bar, but he was also not around at the time, Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
And 
was 
Advocate Noko 
prepared 
to 
prosecute the case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, I - I cannot say if the docket 
was given to a person to review the matter by Colonel Herbst, but I 
know there is a report which Advocate Noko submitted at the end of this 
whole saga.  Replying on all the dockets and saying that - including 
10 
this 386 - that there is no evidence whatsoever against anybody in any 
of these dockets including the PC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that it looks like you say Advocate Wendy Greef 
also said - also declined to prosecute in this matter and she is 
expressed - according to your affidavit - the opinion that the 
investigation was flawed.  I am not sure or the opinion of the SAPS was 
flawed.  So you had two prosecutors saying there is enough evidence 
and it looks like you had two prosecutors - Advocate Greef and 
Advocate Noko - saying there is not enough evidence. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair and when - when that docket 
was declined to prosecute.  I am talking about 386.  The PC’s husband 
was - as I mentioned - he is also in the police force.  He is a Brigadier 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 36 of 162 
 
at - he was a Brigadier at that time.  I believe he is promoted to a 
General today, but if I am not mistaken he was at Phoenix Cluster 
where Durban North resides under - Phoenix Cluster. 
Immediately when the docket was declined to prosecute.  He 
forwarded a letter to us requesting the docket and I refused point 
blank.  I said you are not getting the docket and eventually he just left 
it, but we never gave the docket.  He requested the docket.  I said no.  
You are not having the docket.  What do you want the docket for? 
He just said no and we kept the docket, because I could not 
see why - why should he ask for the docket.  For what?  What does he 
10 
want to do with the docket? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Colonel Van Loggerenberg could you tell 
the Chair about case number 466.  You deal with it on page 5 
paragraph 7. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, this case started with - when 
Colonel Soobramoney was still busy with the inquiry of this matter.  He 
sent a report to General Booysen - confidential report, but he did not 
date the report and somehow … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now we are dealing with case number 466? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  466. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair; and somehow this report 
ended up - as we discovered later - with Thoshan Panday and 
Colonel Madhoe.  As far as I can recall Chair Colonel Madhoe then in 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 37 of 162 
 
turn approached General Booysen with this report which he received 
earlier from Colonel Soobramoney.  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That report related to the inquiry that the two of you 
had done? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  The progress report.  That is 
what it was.  Colonel Madhoe then requested General Booysen to date 
this report, but he must date it in such a way that it looks that when we 
issued or when we applied for Section 205s that that was done illegally.  
10 
So in other words backdate the stuff before the case was registered 
even. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please remind me about Section 305.  Is that …? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Section 205. 
CHAIRPERSON:  205.  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So we use Section 205 of the 
Criminal Procedure Act … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  To append bank documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  For bank statements.  Okay. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
Yes 
sir, 
but 
he 
wanted 
General Booysen to date this report before the case was even 
registered in the case number.  Before CAS 781.  So that would show 
that we illegally subpoenaed the banks to obtain the bank information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So the report included - showed that you had 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 38 of 162 
 
obtained financial information from their bank accounts? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  (Inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two - Section 205 had not been complied with then 
you would have acted illegally? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what reason did he give to General Booysen 
for asking … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  They want to … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Him to do that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, they want to attack us civilly 
with regarding to the Section 205s we applied for in terms of the 
Criminal Procedure Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why would he think General Booysen would have 
agreed to that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I do not know what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To even backdating it.  Apart from the fact that it was 
not his report. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
Ja. 
 
No. 
 
I 
know, 
but 
20 
Thoshan Panday would use that in a civil matter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  To challenge our Section 205s in 
the Civil Court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 39 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  To say that that is unlawful … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And that is why he wanted the date 
backdated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was - was it - was the request made in such a way 
that General Booysen could have been misled into thinking that it was 
just a genuine and innocuous request to put a certain date and not 
know that there was - there was some … 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, General Booysen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Intentions? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Told us about it and we worked it 
out.  It was for the Section 205s we applied to at the courts.  That was 
the reason why they wanted that and then General Booysen told him, 
but if I do it that way there is not - nothing for nothing.  You must give 
me for something.  That is where the money came into the story and 
then General Booysen testified and the - they continued negotiating. 
I was not involved in that.  The investigating officer involved 
in that matter originally was Colonel Len Sherriff, but sadly sir he is 
20 
deceased today, but Colonel Peter Poi took the matter over and at the 
end of the day what happened is that the state applied for Section 252A 
in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act - to have a sting operation. 
That was arranged that Madhoe will pay the money over to 
General Booysen, but then Colonel Len Sherriff - as far as my 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 40 of 162 
 
knowledge goes - he arranged the operation.  He got the approval of 
the 252A from the - Advocate Gert Nel from Maritzburg.  Everything was 
in place.  General Madhoe came into the parking garage of the 
Provincial Office in KwaZulu-Natal. 
That is where he handed over - took the money out of his 
boot.  Placed it in General Booysen’s boot.  I was not present.  I was 
not there and as far as I know the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  General Booysen gave evidence about … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Ja.  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That piece of - ja. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is the - the charges case 
came about Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now with regard to that case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - I am - I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  The suspects in 
this one.  Case number 466 bribery/corruption were - were they Colonel 
or was it Colonel Madhoe? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
And 
- 
Colonel Madhoe 
and 
Thoshan Panday Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two of them? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright and it related to that - to - to the money 
in the boot incident? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  They - they were arrested on 
that … 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 41 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now who was the advocate assigned to that 
case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It was Bheki Mnyathi.  That is right.  
(Inaudible).  It was Bheki Mnyathi who was assigned to that matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that - is that Advocate Mzinyathi? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  Bheki Mnyathi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the same person? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was his view about the matter? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  His view that there was sufficient 
evidence.  I mean there is footage of it.  The 252A was legal.  The 
money was handed over.  There were witnesses and there is - he said 
there is no problem. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you say in your statement that: 
“Advocate Wendy Greef 
subsequently 
replaced 
Advocate Mnyathi.” 
What then happened to the matter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us start with is - is that true that 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 42 of 162 
 
Advocate Greef replaced …? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe the way to put it. It was - was 
Advocate Mzinyathi … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  He resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Removed from the case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  He resigned the Chair and 
then Advocate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  He resigned? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  That is right Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Advocate Greef was assigned the matter? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja and then - and I can recall the 
morning there were - they appeared in the Regional Court to apply for a 
date to get the case transferred to the High Court.  That same morning 
without anyone of us knowing or investigating that matter knowing or 
even Advocate Wendy Greef knew.  That is when Advocate Noko 
instructed her to provisionally withdraw the matter. 
Stating 
that 
there 
were representations 
made 
and 
it 
20 
concerned some investigations.  She mentioned there is a prima facie 
case in this matter - Advocate Noko and she also said it must be - as I 
mentioned - provisionally withdrawn and that - and that was it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if you have regard to the internal 
memorandum on page 20. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 43 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You will see this is an internal memorandum 
to Advocate Govender from Advocate Noko and it says: 
“Dear Advocate Govender, I have perused the files 
and the case docket in this matter where an 
accused persons are charged with one count of 
corruption, alleged to have offered and/or given a 
gratification to an officer.  I have been presented 
with representations in this matter which raise some 
concerns regarding justice.  Time is needed to 
10 
investigate to follow up on these concerns.  There 
is a prima facie case against the accused persons 
in this matter.  However in the interest of justice I 
have decided to provisionally withdraw the matter.  
It will be dealt with at a later stage after the raised 
issues have been attended to.  This case must thus 
be provisionally withdrawn on 11 February 2013 
when it appears again in court for reasons as I have 
advanced supra.  Kindly also inform the SAPS 
investigating officer accordingly.” 
20 
Is this what you referring to? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  That is the 
letter what Advocate Noko that morning … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Were you aware of any representations that 
had been made? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 44 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  Not at all.  Nothing 
whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Advocate Govender that is a member of SAPS that 
was or that was a member of the - a prosecutor in the NPA? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Advocate K D Govender. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he a prosecutor of - she a prosecutor? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  Ja.  She is in the NPA, but she 
is a - the … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the court? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  She is sitting at the - not at 
court itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She is like a Section Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Organised Crime Prosecutors.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she is a prosecutor? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  She is a prosecutor.  Yes 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Could you then tell the Chair 
about case number 122? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  122. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we get there.  This was withdrawn and what 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 45 of 162 
 
happened?  This particular one. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was many years ago.  We are now in 2020. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, as far as I can recall that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it ever reinstated? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  As far as I know now it has 
been reinstated and Advocate Wendy Greef from the KZN Commercial 
Crime Court.  She is dealing with the matter - with this specific matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the trial has not - has not started.  As far as you 
know. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  Not yet.  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She is still busy.  She is still busy 
with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So it looks like many years have lapsed … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Since it was provisionally withdrawn. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair, because it 
was only looked at again after Advocate Shaun Abrahams gave the 
instructions … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The prosecution must continue in 
these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Only then something happened 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 46 of 162 
 
again with these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I see that the memorandum from Advocate Noko 
to Advocate Govender where she gave instructions that the matter be 
provisionally - be provisionally withdrawn is dated 7 February 2013. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So seven years later the trial … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has not happened. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and Chair perhaps just it - it is quarter 
past 11.  I do not know if you want to adjourn or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us take the tea adjournment. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On my watch it is about 18 minutes past.  We will 
resume at 25 to 12.  We adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Ms Wentzel, are you ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.   Colonel van Loggerenberg 
I am now referring to page 6 of your affidavit, paragraph 8, could you 
give the Chair an idea what Durban Central case 112 was about? 
CHAIRPERSON:   112 or 122? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 47 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   122 I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 122. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Just a correction before the tea 
time I said Advocate Wendy Greeff was doing 466, it’s Advocate Wendy 
O’Brian that is prosecuting 466. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is 7.13 of your affidavit. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Ja, it is Advocate Wendy O’Brian 
that is busy with the prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She is the one who replaced Advocate, Ms Nyati? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No, no she is the one busy with 
10 
this matter, Durban Central 466 at this point in time, she is the 
prosecutor appointed to do that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   386? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No, 446. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, I am sorry, there are so many of these 
case numbers.  466? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   It’s Advocate Wendy O’Brian, not 
Advocate Wendy Greeff. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said 466, she was involved? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s right, Advocate Wendy 
O’Brian is the prosecutor involved there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and Advocate Greeff, Wendy Greeff related to 
another matter. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 48 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair Wendy O’Brian is the currently today 
the prosecutor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the matter? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes in the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   If you could now just tell the Chair what you 
know about Durban Central case 122. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair this matter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we refer to 122 but the actual case seems to be 
10 
122/04/2012. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but we say 122, and the – and 466 the one we 
refer to as 466 is actually 466/09/2011 and the one we refer to as 386 
is 386/09/2011. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then earlier on than that yes there was case 
number 781 when we referred to 781 we were referring to case number 
781/06/2010. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the record will capture the correct case numbers. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Sir in this case Durban Central 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 49 of 162 
 
CAZ 122/04/2012 I can recall is that General Booysen has placed a 
stop with financial department to pay further monies to Thoshan 
Panday.  Thoshan Panday then launched this civil application to sue 
this outstanding amount from the police, but what he needed 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To sue the police SAPS for not paying him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, that’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   What happened there is Thoshan 
Panday and Captain Narainpershad approached another member, 
10 
Captain Stevens.  They requested Captain Stevens to – let me just go a 
step back so with the searches and seizures seized documentation from 
different departments from our provincial office and some of those 
documents were invoices and call up instructions issued by Brigadier 
Hunter for the members to assemble for the ...[indistinct] or wherever 
needed. 
 
They approached Captain Stevens to reprint some of these 
invoices which they didn’t have in their possession at that point in time 
and also to falsify call-up instructions and Captain Stevens would have 
to falsify Brigadier Hunter’s signature on the documents, endorse to 
20 
say yes it’s been approved, services has been rendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is payment for payment purposes? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is to show in the civil matter 
that services has been rendered and it has been authorised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so that Mr Panday, his claim would succeed. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 50 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s right, that’s right Chair.  
And that is where this case occurred of, and also there if I can recall 
correctly is that approval was obtained and Captain Stevens negotiated 
with these people, the recording made, there were visual reports made 
and this matter was given to Advocate Dorian Pather from the 
Pietermaritzburg DDP’s office, but the audio recordings between 
Captain Stevens and Panday and Narainpershad is actually in an Indian 
street language, so a person that does not know that slang or whatever, 
to put it that way, wouldn’t know or understand exactly what they mean 
and what they say,  so there’s a bit of a problem with the audio of that 
10 
thing and is trying to rectify that at this point in time, so that they can 
continue with that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was Captain Stevens supposed to do, what was 
his role?  I see you refer to him in paragraph 8.10. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes Captain Stevens was in the 
section at Brigadier Hunter’s division where they – he worked for 
Brigadier Hunter in his section.  Brigadier Hunter was responsible for if 
they needed 20 policemen say at point A Brigadier Hunter will authorise 
a call-up instruction, the members names, authorise it and then it will 
go – Captain Stevens will see to those documentations, send it to 
20 
Supply Chain and see that people get there and everything is arranged 
for them.  That’s where Captain Stevens fit in because they needed 
those documents, those call up instructions and some of them they did 
have it, some of them they did not have, and that’s why they 
approached him to fill in the gaps where they didn’t have them. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 51 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was cooperating with Mr Panday and the 
group? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, he first approached General 
Booysen regarding this matter and then General Booysen approved 
them then it ran from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, do you know what was in it for him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Did he? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know what was in it for him, why was he 
helping Mr Panday? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   They promised him a million Rand 
10 
Chair if he can do that for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he assisted them? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes Chair, they bribed him with a 
million Rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And is that what you found out as the investigation 
was happening? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair this happened actually after 
781. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Because this was now for Panday 
20 
for his civil matter, not for the criminal matter, he tried to use this 
information for his civil matter, to get the police to try and get the 
money released. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and what happened to the civil matter? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair we don’t know – but I know 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 52 of 162 
 
it is still pending. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was payment made to facilitate it? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No Chair, never. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not paid? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that because of the decisions taken by General 
Booysen? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That there should be no payment? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so in terms of what ultimately happened with 
the civil action you don’t know. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has not been finalised as far as you know? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if it had been finalised you would have known? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes Chair we would have known, 
yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it must have been pending for many years is that 
right? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Ja, no that’s – it’s a lot of years 
ago yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 53 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.   Now we are again dealing 
on page 7 of your statement and now in particular to what is now 
colloquially called case number 781, could you tell the Chair about the 
interference you say in your affidavit you experienced with your 
investigation? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair we were informed by 
General Booysen on many occasions, I would say three or four, to stop 
the investigation in Durban Central CAZ 781/06/2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, tell us first what that investigation was about. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Excuse me Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me first what that investigation was about under 
case 781 ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   781 was the corruption charges, 
we had all those people involved, the PC, Colonel ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh that’s the one we started with from the beginning. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, that’s our accommodation one 
and all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now I remember, that’s the one we started with 
early in your affidavit. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you say General Booysen gave you an 
instruction to? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Stop the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He got the instruction from the PC, 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 54 of 162 
 
that’s now General Ngubene. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The PC, Lt General ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I just to make sure I hear what the last bit 
is that you were saying, did you say he got instructions from General 
Ngubene? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  From now Lt General Ngubene the 
Provincial Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  To stop the investigation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  781. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and did he then pass that instruction over to 
you? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  We did not stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not stop? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The documents that we had we 
made copies of it and gave him the file back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   But we did not stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 55 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   We carried on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So as you understand the position the Provincial 
Commissioner instructed General Booysen that the investigation must 
be stopped, General Booysen passed that instruction over to you. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You handed back the file to General Booysen, kind of 
pretending that you have stopped. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you actually had not stopped. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you kept some documents. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you continued with the investigation. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you.   Brigadier, I mean Colonel Van 
Loggerenberg can you please have regard to an affidavit of Laurence 
King on page 22. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Sorry, 22? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I’m there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   What is your knowledge of this affidavit? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair my knowledge of this 
affidavit is that we used this affidavit as an A1 to firstly open up a 
case.   He was the complainant in 781, and his affidavit covers 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 56 of 162 
 
everything he discovered, and also that the PC phoned him and his 
second in charge, Colonel Moodley, was also present when the 
Provincial Commissioner instructed him to tell General Booysen to stop 
the investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And who requested this affidavit from him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair I approached him for an 
affidavit after I have gone through his initial internal memorandum, he 
refused to give me an affidavit, and I knew why he refused to give me 
an affidavit because he wanted something to cover himself that nobody 
can put the blame on him that he gave an affidavit freely and 
10 
voluntarily so at the end of the day what I did, I obtained a Section 205 
of the Criminal Procedure Act, I served it on him and then he gave me 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that he could say I was obliged to give it to him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes, to cover himself. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and this affidavit was it included in the file that 
you handed back to General Booysen? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No, not this one Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you already had it with you when you handed 
that file but you didn’t include it in the file? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I don’t think so Chair because this 
affidavit took a while, it was the enquiry file that we actually gave back 
to – to ...[intervenes]  
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 57 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   General Booysen. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   General Booysen ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you got the affidavit later. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Later yes, this took a while to take 
this affidavit ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, as part of the investigation that you were doing 
without the Provincial Commissioner knowing. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   But at this point in time when we 
10 
were told how many times to stop Colonel Subramoney phoned Colonel 
Drahmat ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, were you ever told why the Provincial 
Commissioner was saying this investigation must be stopped, and do 
you know whether anybody ever asked her why must this investigation 
be stopped and if so what did she say? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair I don’t think anybody asked 
her why this investigation must be stopped but everybody knew why she 
gave the instruction, because she is implicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That, but I didn’t ask her 
personally, I don’t know if General Booysen asked her personally but I 
don’t think anybody asked her, she just said stop this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have been interested to know what reason 
she would have given. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 58 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   Thank you, I interrupted, you may 
continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair I was at where Colonel 
Vassan Subramoney phoned General Drahmat.   He was the National 
Head of the Hawks at that time, and then he told us to have a meeting 
with him in Pretoria, so Colonel Subramoney and myself drove up to 
him, we had a meeting with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now you said General Drahmat, who was the 
10 
head of the Hawks at the time, yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes, that’s correct Chair.  We 
showed him all the evidence that we’ve got and also that we’ve got 
evidence again the PC, we’ve got evidence against General R S Pillay, 
against Captain ...[indistinct] the whole story and at the end of the day 
he said first of all General Ngobeni hasn’t got the authority to stop this 
investigation and he told us to continue with the investigation, we don’t 
stop, we continue and then it was arranged, he said well the best would 
be that the office of serious economic offences in Pretoria would deal 
with the matter and we had a discussion with the office of serious 
20 
economic offences but at the end of the day they agreed that we must 
just carry on with the investigation and we must report directly to 
General Drahmat and that’s how we continued with the investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Dealing with this affidavit if you could go to 
paragraph 18 on page 28. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 59 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And this is what Colonel Kemp says, on 
Wednesday the 5 t h of May 2010 at about 15:25 while myself and 
Colonel Moodley was at Jacobs Garage attending to work related 
matters I received a phone call from the Provincial Commissioner, 
Lieutenant General Ngobeni.  The Provincial Commissioner informed 
me that the investigation pertaining to the procurement procedures of 
the detachment duties must stop and I must inform Deputy Provincial 
Commissioners Ntanya and Booysen.  I first phoned General Booysen, 
however the General’s phone was on voicemail and I left a message 
10 
informing the General of the Provincial Commissioner’s instruction.  I 
then contacted General Ntanya and informed the General of the 
Provincial Commissioner’s instruction, his response was that I am 
telling him that while it is raining and the roof is leaking we must not 
repair the roof.  As I wasn’t directly involved in the investigation I 
considered that I have complied with the Provincial Commissioner’s 
instruction.   Can you comment on that?   Is this what was told to you 
by Colonel Kemp? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes that is right ja.  That he did 
receive the phone call from the Commissioner, General Ngobeni, to 
20 
stop the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that’s what he told you? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not there yourself. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No, no I was not there, no Chair, 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 60 of 162 
 
that’s what he told me, this is what I recorded what he told me in the 
statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And did you record this statement? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes I did Chair.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes.  He then says in paragraph 19 on page 
29: 
“On Saturday the 8 t h of May 2010 at about five o’clock I 
received a phone call on my cell phone from the Provincial 
Commissioner.   The Provincial Commissioner enquired about 
the detachment expenditure and the procurement processes 
10 
thereof.  I highlighted and raised my concern about the high 
expenditure of detachment duties and indicated that if the 
current expenditure for detachments continued it will have a 
very negative impact on the Provincial budget.  I also raised 
my concern about the expenditure of certain detachments that 
was exorbitant.  I gave the example of expenses of obtaining 
accommodation of 850 per night per person for detachment at 
Escourt, which I was of the opinion, was far too expensive.  
This call lasted some time and the Provincial Commissioner 
also asked me about procurement procedures but I refrained 
20 
to give an opinion and focused on my responsibility 
pertaining to the budget and the high expenditure for 
detachment duties.   The call was concluded when the 
Provincial Commissioner indicated that the matter would be 
discussed in her office on Monday the 10 t h of May 2010.” 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 61 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct yes, that is what he 
told her. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And then paragraph 20. 
“On Monday the 10 t h of May 2010 at about 8.30 I was 
informed to go to the Provincial Commissioner’s office.  On 
my arrival at the Provincial Commissioner’s boardroom the 
Provincial 
Commissioner, 
the 
three 
Deputy 
Provincial 
Commissioners, Masemole, Njanyana and Booysen as well as 
Colonel Maddock of Provincial Supply Chain Management 
was present.   The Provincial Commissioner indicated the 
10 
purpose of the meeting was to look at the expenses of the 
detachments.  Colonel Mdu was asked to explain the 
procurement process but hardly started when the Provincial 
Commissioner asked me to highlight the details of my 
information note.  I told the meeting about the expenditure for 
detachment duties and the high expenditure as well as raised 
my concerns of the high expenditure incurred pertaining to 
certain detachments.   I again referred to the example of high 
costs for accommodation at Escourt.   While I was giving my 
concerns the Provincial Commissioner interrupted on a few 
20 
occasions and some of the deputies like General Njanjana 
was given an opportunity to comment.  At one stage in the 
meeting a letter received from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Ms Wentzel, it doesn’t look like this witness 
attended that meeting, why are you reading this minute? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 62 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Just to confirm that this is what was told to 
him by this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was subsequently told after the meeting? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, he was told this when he took the 
statement, this witness took the statement from that witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, oh, from Mr Kemp? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kemp oh okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   In the middle of page 30 it says: 
“At one stage of the meeting a letter received from Head 
10 
Office which was forwarded to the Provincial Commissioner 
and myself and the Provincial Head, Finance, and requested 
the Province to supply information was discussed.   I 
indicated that I am in the process of compiling the feedback.  
This upset the Provincial Commissioner who indicated that 
these direct lines we have with Head Office must stop.  The 
Provincial Commissioner was very angry with me.   This 
became the main issue and not the issue of the high 
expenditure for the detachment duties.  I was given to 
understand that I must know what I must do and use the 
20 
correct communication channels.   I felt and got the 
impression that I was at the wrong and must not have 
compiled 
the 
information 
notice. 
 
The 
Provincial 
Commissioner was very upset with me.  At that meeting, as 
the 
meeting 
was 
becoming 
unpleasant 
Major 
General 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 63 of 162 
 
Booysen requested whether myself and Colonel Mdu cannot 
be excused as core management discussed the matter 
further.  The two of us were then excused.” 
Is that in line with what you were told? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but why is it not enough for – is there anybody 
who is going to dispute that this statement was made by Mr Kemp, why 
is it necessary to get this witness to confirm that what is written here 
was told to him? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair because it I believe will give 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it prior to the statement being done?  Well he 
took the statement from Mr Kemp, is that right? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is what the statement says. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why does he need to confirm anything that is said 
here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair in a sense to give the picture as to the 
further documentation that will be shown to you ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should be enough to say did you take this, draft 
this statement or take a statement from Mr Kemp? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should be enough. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 64 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have we confirmed that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It’s fine, we don’t need to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   We have confirmed that and we can deal with 
that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because obviously if he drafted the statement he 
was told what is in the statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, it is also Chair just to avoid having to 
10 
call every single person involved to confirm these facts but it is 
confirmed and the confirmation is there and it is on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s that part, it is an important part.   I think 
General Booysen testified about the same meeting. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it doesn’t help to say this witness who took the 
statement must confirm that what is in the statement is what he was 
told by the person who signed the statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, thank you.   If we can then just refer to 
Colonel Melanie Moodley’s statement, you will find it at page 72 or the 
20 
statement itself is at page 73, who took this statement? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair the statement was obtained 
by Colonel S Y Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the statement at page 73? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It is the statement – it is Annexure JVL3. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 65 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it at page 73? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   At page 73 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You see even there you know unless there is 
going to be, unless you know that there is going to be a dispute 
whether that statement, the signature there is so and so’s signature, 
the person who gave the statement, unless you know that there is going 
to be an issue about that, there is not much point I think in asking to 
confirm that he took the statement, but if there is going to be an issue 
about maybe that the statement doesn’t reflect what the person who 
signed the statement says happened then it might become necessary 
10 
then to say okay who took the statement, and what was that person 
told, did that person correctly put in the statement what they were told, 
but if there is going to be no issue about that we can move on. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And – yes the two aspects I only wish to draw 
to your attention in the statements Chair which may prove to be 
controversial and are also important because they explain why some 
surveillance and monitoring was conducted later in this matter.   If I 
can just refer you to page – sorry it’s page 76, I hope that you can see 
that clearer than mine because the writing seems to go over the page 
number. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve got what looks like 76, does it start with the 
words “from SCM”? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes it does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is that a statement by somebody? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   This is the statement by ...[intervenes]  
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 66 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Moodley? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It was taken by Mr Govender. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I am just going to read the second paragraph 
on that page.  It says: 
“The next day 6 t h May 2010 ...” ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why are you reading it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Only because it confirms this handing back of 
10 
documents and the closing of the case on instruction of the PC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So it is just that paragraph Chair, and there’s 
that and one further paragraph, that’s all that’s needed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say, well you can, even if you don’t read you 
can just tell me that this is what this witness, the person who signed 
this statement says and then he or she will be called later on if she will 
be called. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If that is necessary to connect, to make us 
20 
understand this witness’s evidence better. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is not for that purpose we can deal with it 
when that witness comes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair I think you might be able to understand 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 67 of 162 
 
this witness better if it can just be pointed out that what is stated in the 
statement is that Brigadier Lategan stated that he’d received the 
instruction from the PC that he must hand back all the documents and 
that the case was closed, and as far as he was concerned that was the 
end but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   How does she know that’s what – I take – ja how 
does she know that that’s what Lategan was told? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Because she says that Lategan told her this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s hearsay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, and ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why do we read hearsay from somebody when we 
are hearing the evidence of another witness. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair we do not need to have the – to 
deal with that further except to say that as is stated in the affidavit 
what you say in paragraph 9.12 is that Colonel Moodley said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ask him to give the evidence.  Ask the witness to give 
the evidence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Could you please tell the Chair what is 
stated in paragraph 9.12? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on let us put that differently.  Who is the he 
20 
referred to in paragraph 9.11.2 Ms Wentzel?  The he there refers to 
whom? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is Brigadier Kemp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is Brigadier Kemp. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 68 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Brigadier Kemp Chair ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you will be calling him is it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We have not as yet said that we would call 
him but we certainly can make attempts to consult with him and call 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why would he not be called if he is one of the 
people who got a call from the Provincial Commissioner saying the 
investigation must be stopped?  The only reason I can think of is if 
there are enough witnesses who have corroborated that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think there may be enough witnesses but I 
10 
will make sure that he is contacted and perhaps his evidence can be 
led as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just continue and tell – and tell me more about 
case number 7881 what happened?  You were instructed to close the 
investigation, stop the investigation.  You handed the file back to 
General Booysen and – but you continued with the investigation.  Just 
continue there? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair ja we continued with the 
investigation and after it became known by the PC KwaZulu Natal that 
General Dramat gave the instructions for us to continue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She did not attempt to – or 
interfere with the investigation thereafter to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were no further attempts by her to stop the 
investigation? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 69 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know how she came to know that General 
Dramat had given instructions that the investigations should continue? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I do not know.  I think the – 
she may have received the information from General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL 
VAN 
LOGGERENBERG: 
 
Because 
she 
must 
have 
approached him to say but the investigations continuing and I told you 
to stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And I am just – you know he could 
have just told her but no it is the instructions from General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay continue and tell me everything that you 
might not have told me yet about that investigation relating to 781? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair from the outset the case was 
assigned to an Advocate Bromley Ganks in Durban to deal with 781.  
But she resigned and then the matter was handed over to Advocate 
Abby Letsholo from the Commercial Crime Courts.  And he was also 
appointed in this Amigos matter as you are aware of.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  During this investigation from the 
outset Advocate Letsholo knew that there was an Act 70 on the matter.  
On the matter pertaining to the threat of our lives. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So let us just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 70 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can we… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair during our investigation we 
as I said we got threats on our lives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is during your investigation. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In case number 781? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were threats made on your lives? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is now yourself and? 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Colonel Phillip Herbst and Colonel 
S Y Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And the threats coming from whom or 
anonymous? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I received a phone call from 
a lady informed me that she is working for Toshan Panday and she 
overheard him in a conversation to somebody else that they want to 
take me out and my team.  She was concerned and she phoned me and 
I make there a note there of in my diary, official diary and I left it at 
that.  And then a month or two thereafter I received another call from 
20 
her.  She said she is getting worried now.  She heard the – overheard a 
conversation from Toshan Panday to another person again threatening 
us.  And then I thought okay what I will do.  I also recorded that 
conversation with my diary.  She did not want to give me her name or 
tell me where she is phoning from or what – she phoned me on my 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 71 of 162 
 
landline so I could not actually see where she was phoning from.  So I 
submitted a reported to Brigadier Lategan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And can I just confirm that the – the pages of your 
diary where you recorded these – what she said is that part of what is 
here or is that not here? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair that is with IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is with IPID? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is with IPID yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Yes continue. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I then made a report to Brigadier 
10 
Lategan who was the Provincial Commander for the Commercial Crime 
Courts.  He then wrote the request to General Moodley from Crime 
Intelligence and asked him to – for one of his members to look into the 
threats, into the investigation to see what they can see and [indistinct] 
the investigation and see what they can find out about the threats 
against our members.  Colonel Padayachee from Crime Intelligence was 
appointed to do this investigation and he applied for an Act 70. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What is an Act 70? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Act 70 is – put it in plain words 
Chair is to tap the lines. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is – the Act 70 is to monitor 
people’s telephone lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 72 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And he did an application and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one where you apply to a judge? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For permission to do that. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He did that and the Judge approved 
it and then he was doing that side of the investigation.  Against the 
threat of our members and myself.  That Act 70 had nothing to do with 
10 
781.  This – I am talking about the investigation nothing at all.  
Advocate Abby Letsholo was aware of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was now – this was you said Colonel 
Padayachee who was conducting this exercise of listening to – 
monitoring. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These telephone conversations. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And when Advocate Letsholo was 
20 
appointed – was given this matter we told him he was aware of it and 
Advocate Willie Miller he was also there, also from the Commercial 
Crime Courts and then the Advocate Vannie Govender she was aware f 
it.  And what… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Who was Vardie – Advocate Vannie Govender 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 73 of 162 
 
where was she from? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She is also from the – actually the 
head of the Organised Crime Prosecutors at Provincial of KwaZulu 
Natal. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And there were meetings between 
us to discuss 781 and 466 but everybody knew from the outset and I 
told them I do not need an Act 70 because what do I [indistinct] the Act 
70 for.  I have documentation and that is all I want.  And everybody was 
happy and eventually at the end of the day Colonel Brian Padayachee 
10 
actually picked up some conversations which relates to CAS 466 the 
corruption matter of General Booysen.  And I know that was used for 
that specific case only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say the corruption matter of General 
Booysen you are referring to the money in the boot case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  To the – that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That is case 466. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  Ja that is 
correct.   And we carried on the investigation and we submitted all the 
20 
evidence that we received from seizes and searches and banks and 
what not we gave that to Trevor White – Trevor White from Price 
Waterhouse Coopers and he was busy with the forensic report.  He 
drafted the forensic report.  We carried on the investigation and we had 
come to a point we had a draft forensic report in respect of 781.  And 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 74 of 162 
 
we had a meeting in I think it was in January with Advocate Letsholo 
and myself, Advocate Vannie Govender, Colonel S Y Govender where 
we went through the draft report and we spoke about the evidence 
against each person that is mentioned in the draft report.  From the PC 
to Madhoe, Nairan Prasad, Toshan Panday his wife, his sisters, his 
brother-in-law, the companies and we all agreed and they all agreed 
this is overwhelming evidence. As I said there is 370 pages of forensic 
report that corroborates that.  There are affidavits that corroborates 
that.  But when it came to the PC Advocate Letsholo told me I have got 
my reservations.  I was – I was shocked I just looked at him.  And 
10 
Advocate [indistinct] also got my reservations.  And I looked at him I 
said well what reservations have you got?  They could not answer me.  
I said but the evidence against the others is 200% according to you, 
according to the forensic report, according to affidavits.  There is 
evidence against the PC.  It has got carbon copies exactly the same.  
You have got the forensic report corroborating that.  We got the 
evidence corroborating that.  We have got the evidence from the 
[indistinct].  We have got evidence – bank statements.  Toshan 
Panday’s card has been used.  No there is not enough evidence against 
the PC.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now with regard to the PC the conduct for which she 
was sought to be charged or prosecuted was it the fact that she gave 
instructions to stop the investigation or was it that – or was it anything 
about her role in Mr Panday paying for her birth – her husband’s 
birthday party? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 75 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is – you right Chair that is her 
gratuity that she received from Toshan Panday the businessman he 
paid for her [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it was also the receipt of money. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Mr Panday. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it was the receipt of that money and the 
10 
argument must have been that it was corrupt. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Corruption. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  There is a corrupt relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bribery. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then was the instruction to stop the investigation 
also part of the conduct that was… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes it is obvious. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Why did she instruct then to stop 
the investigation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She knew… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she got the money. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 76 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She knew she was going to be 
exposed at some stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Advocate Letsholo was saying he had reservations 
but you asked him to tell you what the reservations were and he could – 
he did not tell you. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He could not tell me, neither of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So out of frustration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I told them, look if you do not want 
to charge the PC why do you want to charge rest? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And what was the answer? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It was quiet Chair.  Because I was 
really – I was close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the analysis of what was before them Advocate 
Letsholo and whoever and on the basis of the discussion did you form 
any view as to whether the decision or his view that he had 
20 
reservations about whether the Provincial Commissioner should be 
charged whether that was based on good faith grounds that you might 
not agree with? Or did you think there was something untoward about 
it? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair my gut when I left that 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 77 of 162 
 
meeting, my gut told me this is a political – this is a political decision.  
Everybody knows what – well we the investigators knew that Toshan 
Panday had a business relationship with the ex President Zuma’s son 
Edward.  And then for Advocate – Advocate Lethsolo the asking me well 
why is the Act 70 in case number 781?  I said the Act 70 has got 
nothing to do with 781.  But then he told me but re you seen that one to 
compile this docket – the 7 – the case 781 – I said there is no evidence 
from the 781 was used for this docket.  And we did not use anything 
because I did not need it.  As I say we searched, we seized, we got the 
bank information.  We searched the Province, we searched premises.  
10 
The forensic report is there.  Corroborate what we have got in the 
affidavits.  Everything is in front of you.  Ja I knew it my gut was – it 
was a political decision and then when he told me afterwards that well 
the Act 70 is the reason I just said well you can do what you want.  You 
show me in 781 or in the forensic report any piece of evidence coming 
from the Act 70 I will agree with you.  I got Trevor White from Price 
Waterhouse and Coopers he wrote a memo confirming all the evidence 
in the forensic report and in the docket 781 – Act 70 had nothing to do 
with that investigation.  We never used anything from – we do not even 
know what was going on in the Act 70. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when you told Advocate Letsholo this and 
whoever he was with that we never used anything from what you call 
Act 70 for this investigation what was his response?  Did he have – did 
he say no but I can see you used it look at this? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair he could not get that far.  He 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 78 of 162 
 
told me that in previous cases he had before where the police told him 
the Act 70 was involved he never had Act 70.  His – I can still 
remember his words, he got egg on his face and but he never actually 
could have told me or could have shown me anywhere in 781.  He just 
kept on saying and I knew it now he used it as only an excuse not to 
prosecute the matter and also obviously the political decision as far as 
I am concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you able to say if he was basing his decision 
on what you had put before him then there really was nothing that 
connected this investigation and Act 70? 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  Nothing 
connected it, nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there was any – if he was – if there was anything 
he must have been – he must have learnt it from somewhere else but 
not on what was before him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Nothing Chair nothing whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  200%.  There was nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And all the other IO’s in this 781 
20 
can testify Price Waterhouse Coopers I believe is going to come.  
Nothing, nothing was used.  But he just, he was blunt in using the Act 
70 as an excuse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Because – your – apparently 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 79 of 162 
 
representations were made to him from Toshan Panday in respect of 
781 not to prosecute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever see those representations? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair, no we never saw that.  
We were not even aware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time that you were having this discussion with 
him. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he at that stage tell you that there were 
representations received from Mr Panday or is that something you 
10 
heard later? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No – no Sir that was something we 
heard later.  Because after this meeting we just left and then my wife 
got sick and during March that same year he held another meeting with 
Colonel Govender and with – and at that meeting was Advocate 
Letsholo as I can recall, Colonel Jones and Colonel S Y Govender.  And 
then he said well look he has made up his mind he is not going to 
prosecute.  He said presentations were made and in the presentations 
that is what is conveyed now to me by Colonel Govender because I was 
sick at home.  He phoned me during the meeting.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was the practice – would the practice not be that 
if the prosecutors receive representations from a suspect or from an 
accused person that they should not be prosecuted would the practice 
not be that before the prosecutors make any decision on those 
representations they would consult the investigating officer and say, 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 80 of 162 
 
this is what is being said, what do you have – what do you have to say 
on this? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair that is the normal practice 
and I agree with you, that is what happened.  Without the cases which 
we had.  But not with this one. We never knew about this 
representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And during that meeting with 
Colonel S Y Govender I was not present where Colonel Jones showed 
up the first time.  During the whole course of this investigation we 
10 
never reported to him.  We never told him the nitty gritty of anything in 
any of these cases.  We sidestepped him for reasons but we reported to 
General Booysen and General Dramat.  All of a sudden Colonel Jones 
is sitting here next to Advocate Letsholo.  Advocate Letsholo informed 
him Colonel Govender no representations were made and apparently it 
was heard from the lines that we can work out his defence and this and 
that and whatever the case may be but at that point in time there was 
not even a draft charge sheet.  There was nothing.  Thoshan Panday 
could have known at that point in time or at the point I am going to 
arrest him what the defence can be because we did not have a charge 
20 
sheet.  So that it is baseless information that he is trying to sell to S Y 
Govender.  Then we have been told that the representations were given 
to Colonel Jones.  Whether investigator that Colonel Jones investigated 
or not I do not know.  But we knew that it was given to Colonel Jones.  
Colonel Govender requested a copy of that.  They did not – they 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 81 of 162 
 
refused to give it to him and that was his decision.  Not the report he 
said that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you said that Advocate Letsholo as I – if I 
understood you correctly was of the opinion that in regard to the other 
people there was sufficient evidence but not against the Provincial 
Commissioner, did I understand you correctly?  In regard to the same 
case 781? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – is – was that the opinion he expressed that in 
regard to the other people, other suspects in the same case there was 
10 
enough case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But against the Provincial Commissioner? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now was not one of the other people Mr Panday? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Mr Panday, Colonel Madhoe, 
Captain Naran Pasad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The whole bunch ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so in regard to Mr Panday – Mr Panday was one 
20 
of those suspects in respect of whom he said there was enough 
evidence? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you then invoked to what you refer to as Act 
70 was he invoking it to say I am not going to charge anybody even 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 82 of 162 
 
those against whom I think there is enough evidence because of this 
Act 70 or he was saying, I am invoking Act 70 to say I will not charge – 
I will not prosecute the Provincial Commissioner but I will prosecute the 
rest of the people including Mr Panday? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair he used the Act 70 as an 
excuse not to charge anybody in 781. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Nobody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He used the Act 70 for all of them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And then he… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in regard to the Provincial Commissioner he was 
saying there is not enough evidence in any event?  That was his 
opinion. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Well he did not say that because he 
– the only thing he told me is that well I have got my reservations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And he could not answer me when I 
asked him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay.  Thank you.  You may proceed Ms 
Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If – you can now turn to page 99. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe to – okay – maybe that is where you are going.  
Are you completing as to the formal decision that was made or not – 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 83 of 162 
 
not really? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  This is an internal memorandum Chair dated 
the 25 March 2015 from Advocate Letsholo to Advocate Bimbane to 
explain why he believed that the Act 70 and these representations 
meant that he should not persecute? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  Let us – let us go there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So it is the 25 March 2014 and I am just going 
to ask you Colonel Van Loggerenberg did you then comment on this 
10 
memorandum? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair we did comment on this 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry the memorandum was addressed to 
Advocate Bulelwa Bimbane by Advocate T A Letsholo.  How did it get to 
you? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sir when I got back to work after 
sick leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  A copy was given to Colonel 
20 
Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then that is how you got it. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Because this must filed in the 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 84 of 162 
 
docket you see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  So you got to see it? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I got – ja I got to see this one ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair with your leave I propose going 
through what was said and then Chair if you then have regard to the 
document on page 106 the complete document Chair you will find – you 
will see that that document if you look at page 114 it is not complete.  
But a complete copy was obtained from the docket – I am afraid it was 
only attained this morning Chair and I asked that it be included in the 
10 
bundle.  You will find it at page 308. 
CHAIRPERSON:  First you said let us go to page 99.  Are you saying 
that the other documents are attachments to the memorandum at page 
99? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  So there is the memorandum at page 99 
and then there is a response which you will see as directed and if you 
look at page 106 and then inquiries Colonel Van Loggerenberg’s name 
is there.  And it is addressed to the Directorate for Priority Crime 
Investigation.  It was directed to General Dramat.  And it is the 
response to what was said by Advocate Letsholo as to the reasons why 
20 
he was going to withdraw the charges against everybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think what we need to do is – you read this 
memorandum from Advocate Letsholo at the time, is that right? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have had a chance to refresh your memory 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 85 of 162 
 
on it recently, is that right? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall what the main reasons he gave for his 
view that he should not charge the suspects in case number 781?  So 
in other words I do not want us necessarily to read this.  If you are able 
to say as I recall the main reasons were the following a, b, c d. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair the [indistinct] was that the 
Act 70 was used.  Information from the Act 70 was used.  He listed 
some cases here in the past where when Act 70 was used in a case and 
it was not known to the defence or whatever the case may be you know 
10 
that is what he told me – egg on his face.  And he tried to make out 
that I was personally going for the Provincial Commissioner which is 
not true because – in his report it said that the only reason why he said 
that is because what I told me in my meeting when I had with Ms 
[indistinct] if you do not want to charge the PC well why do you want to 
charge the others.  Out of frustration I said that.  So he was trying to 
use that to make out that I am persisting to just charge the PC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just on that one.  At your meeting where he 
expressed his reservations about charging or prosecuting the Provincial 
Commissioner did he at some stage talk to you on the basis that there 
20 
may be reason to charge the others but not the Provincial 
Commissioner? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair we went through the 
evidence of all the others first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and he said there was a case? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 86 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That there was a case but we – and 
then I said, well we done everything and then I told him well we have 
not spoken about the TC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The PC.  And then he said, well 
that is when he told me he got the reservations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About reservations.  Okay alright.  So he was now 
using that in the memorandum to say you were going for the PC for 
some illegitimate reason? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja personally ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore personal reasons. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Were those the main reasons as far 
as you can recall? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair and also other things 
about the presentations that we made but I cannot comment on what he 
wrote about the representations because I have never seen them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  You know for me it could be what 
he – I do not know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I cannot comment on that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Ms Wentzel you can highlight 
some of the reasons that the witness might not have mentioned which 
are in the memorandum. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 87 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without reading too much. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes thank you Chair.  Firstly can we have a 
look what is said in paragraph 3.2 on page 100?  It says: 
“It is important to note that at no stage whatsoever 
was I informed by the investigating officers in this 
case that there are tape recordings available in this 
matter.  The first time I became aware of this specific 
issue was as a result of their representations made 
on behalf of Toshan Panday.  Furthermore there is 
10 
nothing in the docket to suggest or indicate that 
there was an application made for the authority to 
permit the police to monitor certain telephone 
conversations …nature of the investigations of this 
matter is straightforward and there was no need for 
an application of this nature to be made.” 
Now firstly you said it was not true that he did not know.  Is that 
correct? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair that is a lie.  He knew about 
it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that he - he knew that an application had been 
made for authority to monitor certain telephone conversations. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He knew that he and he - did he also know that that 
related to threats to your lives? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 88 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair and also that 
some of the recordings there were used in 466. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He also knew that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He knew that because we just told 
him from the outset when he joined … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And now to say this.  He never 
knew that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is - it is an absolute lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when he says he was not told that there was an 
application for the authority to permit the police to monitor telephone 
conversations or when he says the investigators in this case did not tell 
him that there - there were tape recordings and that he became aware 
of this specific issue was as a result of representations made on behalf 
of Mr Thoshan Panday. 
As I understand it and you must tell me if my understanding 
is correct.  My understanding is that you as the investigators or nobody 
20 
applied to a Judge to obtain permission to monitor these telephone 
conversations for purposes of pursuing your investigations under 781. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That never happened? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That never happened. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 89 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The application to a Judge for authority to monitor 
conversations related to the threats to the lives of the investigators? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that being said Colonel Van Loggerenberg 
was there any reason for the 781 - I mean.  For the monitoring 
application to be in the docket in case … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In case number 781? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  No.  From the outset it 
10 
was known that I am not going to use Act 70 for 781, because it is not 
necessary.  It is not a murder case.  It is a - it is a paper trail.  It is a 
commercial case.  It is easy.  You - Forensic Auditor corroborates 
information.  Why would I use Act 70?  For what purposes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then it is also said in paragraph 3: 
“On 14 February 2014, I was provided with a copy 
of 
representations 
made 
on 
behalf 
of 
Thoshan Panday.” 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sorry.  Which page is that/ 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry.  It is page 100. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Paragraph? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Three. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Three? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 90 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3.3, is it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is three and I am actually going back up to 
three and 3.1 and it says: 
“On 14 February, I was provided with a copy of the 
representations 
made 
on 
behalf 
of 
Thoshan Panday.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  “In those representations mention is 
made of the recordings which were played to 
10 
Thoshan Panday 
during 
a 
meeting 
held 
on 
18 September 2011 
at 
KwaZulu-Natal 
SAPS 
Provincial Headquarters in General Dina Moodley’s 
office and in the presence of General Dina Moodley 
upon his instructions.  The recordings consisted of 
recorded telephone conversations Thoshan Panday 
had with various people including amongst others 
the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner and 
Thoshan Panday’s attorney.” 
Now you mentioned earlier that it is later and I - I will take 
20 
you to it.  Aver Chair, but this is one of the reasons it is another ground 
that was given by the advocate for not pursuing with - pursuing the 
matter and proceeding with the prosecutions was that there was this 
breach of attorney and client privilege and Thoshan Panday had been 
told that they knew what his defence was. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 91 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, first of all we did not see the 
representations.  So the correctness of what is written here I am not 
aware of it.  My comment on what is written here is that 
Thoshan Panday at that stage could not have known what the charges 
is going to be against him.  There is no draft charge sheet. 
How can he at this point in time or Thoshan Panday allege 
that everybody knew - according to the recordings which the 
presentation was made to him now that he can say that now we know 
what your defence is?  That is nonsense.  Nobody knows even what the 
charge is going to be at the end of the day.  How are we going to know 
10 
what your defence is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is the position not that if he knew what was 
being investigated namely that he paid money to the Provincial 
Commissioner.  He paid for the birthday party of the Provincial 
Commissioner’s husband.  He may have been able to have an idea what 
the possible charge could be even if it had not been draft - formally 
drafted.  That it would be … (intervenes) … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I agree Chair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Corruption. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I agree Chair that the person would 
20 
have an idea what he is going to be charged with, but it is just an idea.  
I mean to work out an idea is - and he has not received or he has not 
been served the - the charge sheet - the indictment.  Then surely only 
when you receive the indictment then you are actually aware exactly 
how to work your defence out and how you are going to handle this 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 92 of 162 
 
case in the first place, but trying to say that the ideas - I know what 
you are going to charge me for and so the idea of - I - I cannot - cannot 
get that together. 
That we know what his defence can be at that point in time, 
because there was no indictment at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if he - if he knew that whatever the charge is.  It 
- it revolved around either bribery or corruption.  Maybe - ja - 
corruption arising out of the fact that he gave money to the Provincial 
Commissioner.  He could think of what explanation he would give for 
why he gave that money and that explanation that he could think of 
10 
could be a defence to say there was nothing wrong with that money. 
You know.  She - she owed me a certain amount.  I can prove 
it or I owed her a certain amount.  I can prove it.  I was just refunding 
her.  So from that con - perspective … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  I agree … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may have been possible. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I agree with you it is possible Chair 
from that perspective.  Yes, but that is - that is just the way I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how you saw it.  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is - that is how I saw it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Now if we can go back to your 
affidavit. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 93 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought you were going to refer to another 
document where I believed you were saying this witness responded to 
the points made … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Yes.  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I did Chair.  So if you just bear with me.  I am 
going to get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us - let us cover that before you move … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go back to the affidavit. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will do that.  Yes.  Sorry Chair.  If you will 
just bear with me.  I just need to find my place and just my reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a document at page 106 and then I think you 
had referred to page 1-1-4 … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage.  I do not know whether that is the end 
of that … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Document. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That is what I was trying to explain to you 
20 
Chair before we went back.  Is the - is this document which is annexed 
to the affidavit as Annexure JVL6 and it is which the witness has said 
was 
the 
response 
to 
the 
averments 
that 
were 
made 
by 
Advocate Letsholo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying is … 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 94 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now this is incomplete … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you can see that it - it does not need.  So 
I ask that we obtain a complete copy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that was obtained this morning Chair from 
the actual docket and you find that document as an additional document 
which has been placed into your bundle Chair and it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us talk about … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At page 3-0-8. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Let us talk about what 
needs to be done.  Then we can … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look for the documents in the bundle. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the witness prepared a document that was in effect 
a response to Advocate Letsholo’s memorandum that we have just dealt 
with. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need to deal with that document. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witness needs to confirm that … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is his document and then he needs to - or you 
need to take him to the main points he makes in the … 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 95 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Document.  Even - even if you … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I intend to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not go through everything … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I - I intend to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you have a look at the document on 
page 3-0-8? 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I have - in the past asked that the legal team 
should tell the people who paginate bundles not to write on top of the 
red page numbers.  You see now on some of the pages you look and 
you cannot see what the red number is … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they have written something else on top of 
it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  I think to be fair to them that what 
has happened is that these documents have been taken out of the 
20 
docket and they paginated in - in the docket or in - in matters before 
court.  They are paginated.  They are scanned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the red pagination is ours.  Is it not? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The red is our and that then ends up going on 
top, but one cannot see it. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 96 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Oh.  Is it the red that is on top of … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the black? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I believe so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then whoever it is - is it not the same people.  
They must just make sure then the - the ones who put the red numbers 
should just make sure that they are not put together with something 
else because then we cannot see what the page number is.  I think I 
had asked that they do that in the past.  So … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and I - I under … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody can repeat that to them. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  I will and I am having exactly the 
same difficulty as you.  I often have to look at the following page to see 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What this page number is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It does make it very difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is common sense. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and we will - I will take it up with them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you have a look at page 3-1-6? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  3-1-6? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 97 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is that your signature? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And this a response that you compiled to the 
reasons provided by Advocate Letsholo why he was not going to pursue 
781? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair.  I was the author, but it 
was done with Colonel Govender and Colonel Phillip Herbst.  We all sat 
together and … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Tell us what the main points are that you 
put 
in 
this 
memorandum 
to 
express 
your 
views 
about 
10 
Advocate Letsholo’s memorandum. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, if I can recall is that I think 
we - we mentioned that there was no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No representations were given to 
us in the first place and also that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you say - if you say the points that you already told 
me earlier on why you were disagreeing with Advocate Letsholo are 
also included here.  You can just confirm that.  If there are there others 
that you did not mention earlier which are in the memorandum just tell 
20 
me those. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sir - Chair, what I mentioned 
earlier is in the memorandum here about the meetings.  Let me just go 
through here.  About the representations.  About the Act 70. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Wentzel … 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 98 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you can assist him … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I will assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is something in the memorandum, because … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I - I will assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not like you are telling him something … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he is not in the document. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is his document. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can highlight. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get him to confirm the main points. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Well if one has first you deal with what is - he 
says in paragraph 2 on page 99.  You can - so just keep your finger 
there.  Yes at the other one and then look at page - paragraph 2 on 
page 99. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say page 99?  Did you say page 99? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Page 99. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why are we going to page 99 now? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Because I just want to show you - Chair.  I 
will tell you why we are going to page 99.  Is the - the difficult that - 
that I have now and perhaps I can resolve this over the lunch break is 
that because we only obtained the complete copy of this document later 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 99 of 162 
 
- early this morning.  I worked on the incomplete document that is at 
page 99. 
So all my notes are there.  I then said to you we have 
obtained the signed copy which we now know is at page 3-0-8, but for 
me it might be of assistance if we could still work on the document at 
page 99, because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That is where I have my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be confusing.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If it is okay … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Perhaps in the lunch break what I will do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Use the lunch break so that you use the correct 
document. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe we should adjourn now, because … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Perhaps we could adjourn and that can assist 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we do not - you do not skip to another issue 
before we deal with this one. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I would appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment 
and we will resume at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 100 of 162 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Ms Wentzel, are you ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.   Chair before we continue 
with the evidence of Colonel van Loggerenberg, if you don’t mind an 
issue has been brought to my attention and I feel that I should address 
it. What has transpired is that at 11 o’clock today a letter was 
discovered by members at the Secretariat of the Commission, it is 
dated yesterday and apparently was sent, I thin, late yesterday 
afternoon but there’s an enormous amount of correspondence as I 
10 
understand, coming into the Commission and it was only picked up at 
11 o’clock today.  What the letter - it’s a letter from Mr Panday’s 
attorney, Kershnie Govender and what the complaint is, is that the Rule 
33 notice which was timeously served on the 19 t h of December 
contained the incorrect Annexures.   
 
So what happened is the Annexures that should have gone to 
Mr Panday went to his mother and the Annexure that should have gone 
to his mother went to Mr Panday.  He did – his attorney did write a 
letter to the Commission on the 19 t h of December asking for the correct 
Annexures, however, as a comedy of errors might have it, what 
20 
transpired at the Commission is that there was a lady at the Secretariat 
who was dealing with the emails that were coming in.  That person 
worked until the 20 t h of December, resigned and a new person 
commenced dealing with the emails from the 20 t h of December and it 
appears that, that email of the 19 t h of December wasn’t picked up, it 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 101 of 162 
 
wasn’t responded to and it fell through the cracks. 
 
What then transpired is because the Rule 33…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When the acting secretary came back she would 
have been expected to say to the people, bring me all the emails that 
came in while I was away and then that is when that email of 19 
December should have been picked up. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the right person. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I can give no defence with regard to that 
whatsoever I – it may well be that, that bit – the facts are that it wasn’t 
10 
picked up but Chair, what then occurred is on the 9 t h, because the Rule 
33 notices at that stage it wasn’t clear on what date the persons in 
respect of whom Rule 3 notices were served were going to testify.  On 
the 9 t h of January a notice was sent out saying that Colonel van 
Loggerenberg would be testifying and it was a notice sent to Mr Panday 
in respect of Mr van Loggerenberg and also in respect of Mr White.  
There has been correspondence with the attorney and the secretariat in 
respect of the notice of Mr White and at no stage, at that point was it 
asked, but you haven’t responded and we’re still waiting for something 
in respect of Mr van Loggerenberg and with respect, Chair, it although I 
20 
believe…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the conclusion of the letter of yesterday? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   The conclusion of the letter…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do they suggest should be done? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   The letter says you must draw, 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 102 of 162 
 
 
“I am prejudiced by the fact that I have got the wrong  
 
Annexures, you must draw this to the attention of the Chair 
 
before the proceedings commence and I demand that you put 
 
this 
letter 
before 
the 
Chair 
before 
the 
proceedings 
 
commence”, 
 
This wasn’t done, as I said because this letter was only picked 
up by the Commission at 11 o’clock.  And then enquiries have then, for 
the last few hours, have been carried on as to actually what transpired 
and obviously now I am drawing it to your attention as it has been 
drawn to mine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Panday got the Rule 33 notice in regard to this 
witness statement and got this witness statement or relevant pages 
thereof but just didn’t get Annexures, is that right or got – didn’t get the 
right Annexures? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Unfortunately he got the Rule 3.3 notice but 
the Annexures also, I understand, include the passages from the 
affidavit…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he get some of the correct Annexures and didn’t 
get others or did he get all the wrong Annexures? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I’m instructed he got all the wrong 
20 
Annexures, so he got his mother’s Annexures…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did that happen, do you know? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   The only explanation that I can think of is 
that the – there was a mistake made because the surnames were the 
same and when looking for the email addresses which would be 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 103 of 162 
 
provided to the secretariat to send Rule 33 notices that, that is how 
that error could – so instead of sending the ones to the mother that 
should have gone to the mother, the ones that went to Mr – Mr Panday 
got his mother and he got his mother’s, his mother got his. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I’ve previously said that the putting together of 
Annexures and the bundles – Annexures to a statement to ensure the 
correct sequence and to ensure that the correct Annexures are all 
attached that should be attached is the responsibility of the evidence 
leader or the member of the legal team who is responsible for that 
matter even if, later on he or she might not be the one to lead the 
10 
evidence.  At any particular time, there’s supposed to be a member of 
the legal team who is responsible for the matter…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair, and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I’ve said that if a member of the legal team 
takes the statement of the witness or determines the relevant portions 
of that statement that should be sent to an implicated person and 
identifies all the Annexures that should be attached, attaches those and 
then hands over to the rest of he staff.   In circumstances where 
nobody can – will meet at the admin office or the secretariat will need 
to make up their minds what Annexures go with what, they must just 
20 
know when it’s received, this statement is with these Annexures.  Then 
if this has been happening or if his happened here then this wouldn’t 
have happened I would imagine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair and Chair I must say that I didn’t 
prepare the Rule 33 notices in respect of this witness it was done by 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 104 of 162 
 
another evidence leader but at the same time I – there is whole process 
that seems to take place in order for – they call them extractions, which 
means taking the relevant paragraphs out of statements and extracting 
the correct Annexures and the legal team is required to identify 
precisely which Annexures go to which witness in preparing the Rule 33 
notice, that is correct but it would appear that the wrong Annexures did  
in fact go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and I think – well maybe what should be done is 
to make sure that before Rule 33 notices is sent off the relevant 
member of the legal team sees for the last time whether everything is in 
10 
order before it’s sent off because then they can pick up if there’s a 
problem. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even though they may have put in the correct 
Annexures, if something in the meantime has happened. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair I think a final check will probably 
be very advantageous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well you’ll need to be involved in assisting with 
the response to the letter.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I will. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And making sure that the correct Annexures are sent 
to him, without delay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Apparently I’m told it has now been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja just check. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And I will check. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 105 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether what has been sent is the right thing. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I’ll double check. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you were saying something about the date 
– him being told about the date when this witness would give evidence, 
is there an issue there or is there no issue? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No the… [intervenes 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s no issue there. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   There isn’t an issue with regard to that date, 
the issue – what was raised Chair was that, you’ve sent me a notice on 
this day but didn’t respond to what I asked you on the 19 t h. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   That was the issue about the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No okay, that’s fine get involved in the preparation of 
the response…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To that okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s continue then. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair before the lunch adjournment we were 
dealing with the response sent by the witness to Advocate Letsholo’s 
20 
reasons provided for…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry do you know why this Bundle is now opened 
on a page that has got a judgement, page 275, that’s not the page I had 
opened when I left here, did anybody touch here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 106 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wouldn’t know I guess. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I certainly didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well that’s fine, the security people will tell 
me, okay alright let’s continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you, we were dealing with the 
responses and during the course of the lunch adjournment I read 
through those responses and I don’t think I need to canvas anything 
particular in detail with you because a large part of it has now been 
dealt with by the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that’s fine. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   There is one aspect that I thought, perhaps, I 
should deal with and that is this.  It is the submission made at the end 
by Advocate Letsholo, it appears on page 103 and its paragraph seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph – page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   103 paragraph seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And there it is said, 
 
“It is submitted with respect that the issue surrounding the 
 
tapping of the phones is inextricably linked to the manner in 
 
which the evidence was obtained in this matter, that the 
20 
 
evidence as it stands at this point is irredeemable stained.  
 
To take this case to Court under these circumstances would 
 
mean, that I, as the prosecutor will have to turn a blind eye to 
 
the manner in which the evidence had been obtained and 
 
subject the judicial process in moral defilement, something 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 107 of 162 
 
 
I’m not prepared to do”, 
 
And he then refers to the cases and in paragraph 7.4 
concludes, 
 
“I am not prepared, as a representative of the State to go to 
 
Court with dirty hands, I do not want to be seen to be 
 
condoning improper investigative techniques by the police”. 
 
Chair if I might then just go to the witnesses’ response to this 
and that appears from page 314 Chair and if I might read it to you and 
ask you to comment Colonel van Loggerenberg.  In paragraph 4.12 this 
is what you say, 
10 
 
“Once 
again 
the 
evidence 
has 
been 
collected 
in 
a 
 
professional manner in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, 
 
there is absolutely no evidence to even suggest that the bill  or 
rights and the constitution has been violated.  We are of  
the 
opinion 
that 
Advocate 
Letsholo’s 
finding 
is 
based 
on 
 
information that is not at his disposal and which was not 
 
contained in the docket.  The investigation team take 
 
exception to the fact that advocate Letsholo is making 
 
serious allegations against the integrity of the investigation 
 
team, in that they have obtained evidence improper, illegally 
20 
 
which is a violation of a constitution.  The investigation team 
 
denies this accusation strongly, the National Head of the 
 
Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation, SAPS take these 
 
allegations against its members in a very serious light.  When 
 
its members are accused of obtaining evidence in an 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 108 of 162 
 
 
improper or illegal manner which violates the Act, bill of 
 
rights or the constitution”. 
 
And then in paragraph 4.13, 
 
“There is absolutely no link surrounding the tapping of the 
 
phones and the evidence produced to Advocate Letsholo.  
 
According to the investigation team he is not even concerned 
 
about the facts put before him but he would rather direct the 
 
attention to other so-called factors which he claims are 
 
influencing the case of which he has no sight, insight or 
 
knowledge of.  The impression is created by Advocate  
10 
 
Letsholo that the Act 70 and the evidence produced is linked.  
 
Based on the evidence before Advocate Letsholo and still 
 
suggest that the evidence is irredeemably tainted is an 
 
irresponsible statement based on no facts at all”. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you confirm that, that remains your position? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and as far as you know, did he ever become 
aware of your response to his memo? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I don’t know Chair it might be via 
20 
our head office and the National Prosecuting head office, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but was – since then has he ever, as far as you 
know, said what facts or what evidence emanated from the monitoring 
of the telephone conversations of Mr Panday could be found in the 
evidence of the case that you presented before me? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 109 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair not up until this day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   He’s mentioned anything that can prove or 
show that evidence from the Act 70 was used in [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And then on page 316 paragraph 4.16 in 
response to the last paragraph it is said, 
 
“The contents are noted, in light of all the explanations in the 
 
paragraph above, the investigation team has spent many an 
 
hour and expenses to date to gather evidence and to produce 
10 
 
that to a prosecutor for positive decision.  The investigation 
 
team is till of the opinion that there is a prima facie case and 
 
as informed by the prosecutor personally, that the evidence 
 
produced was good.  The investigation team disagrees to the 
 
prosecutor’s decision as he has based his decision on 
 
representations received from the defence and which we are 
 
of the opinion was never properly investigated and the 
 
investigation 
team 
was never 
consulted 
or 
shown 
the 
 
representation to give a comment”. 
 
You agree with that? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   I agree with that Chair and I can 
just further state that everything in 781 is done according of the law, 
every single thing.  To corroborate what I’m saying is that, after the 
docket has been handed over to IPID their advocates came and 
interviewed us and saw us with Mr McBride.  At no stage, whatsoever 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 110 of 162 
 
did they point to us, this is incorrect or this was obtained illegally or 
anything like that.  Even after that, Advocate Gerrie Nel, the case was 
given to him at some stage, he came and interviewed us in Durban and 
he agreed with us 200%, there is no evidence that something was used 
in [indistinct] in 781 and he still maintained that it was a good case and 
he was going to take it further.  At the end of the day it was taken away 
from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to this case, 781, had you been involved in any 
investigations where you took the docket to – or the docket was taken 
to this prosecutor? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No Chair this was the first time I dealt with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   this was the first time? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes Chair, this is the first time I 
dealt with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Then if we can go back to your statement, 
page 13 and I’m dealing now with paragraph 11 and we have dealt with 
the fact that you reported the withdrawal of the case to Dramat and the 
memorandum we’ve been dealing with was prepared by you, was that 
20 
on the instructions of Mr Dramat, to respond to the allegations of 
Advocate Letsholo? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now could you tell the Chair, how did 
Brigadier van Graan become involved, you refer to it in paragraph 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 111 of 162 
 
11.11? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Sir when we – when General 
Dramat received our responses to Advocate Letsholo’s letter he then 
appointed Brigadier van Graan who’s in our legal section head office to 
come down and to come and look at the investigation and the docket 
that we’ve got.  Brigadier van Graan did come down, I met him and he 
went through the docket and he went through the evidence that we 
presented to him and he was happy with everything that he saw.  He 
agreed that, you know, there’s a case here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I may have missed where you are Ms 
10 
Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair its page 13 paragraph 11.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 11 point? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   11. 
CHAIRPERSON:   11.11? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that still under the case 781? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, alright thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now what did General Dramat do after that? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair General Dramat then wrote 
to Advocate Vimbani and then he disagreed with the decision of 
Advocate Letsholo and he asked Advocate Vimbane she agrees with 
Advocate Letsholo’s findings on the docket. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Just stop, so for completeness if we have a 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 112 of 162 
 
look at the document on page 116 is this the response sent by General 
Dramat to Advocate Vimbani? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair, this is the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is that Ms Wentzel, again? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It’s page 116 to 117. 
CHAIRPERSON:   116? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the document we were on a little earlier? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh that’s a different one, yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So as I understand it, what has transpired is 
that Advocate Letsholo provides reasons for is decision not to 
prosecute there is – Dramat asks the investigators to respond, they do 
respond, he then goes to a legal person in the police and says please 
have a look at what’s happening, he’s told there is a good case and he 
then writes to Advocate Vimbani, and you’ll remember this is the other 
Advocate who was involved who – and says, 
 
“are you also in agreement that this matter shouldn’t 
 
continue”, 
20 
 
And do you confirm that, at paragraphs 116 to 117 the reasons 
provided are in line with what you had said in your representations? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja mention two or three important ones and then we 
can move on, in this document from Mr Dramat. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 113 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   In – I don’t know what he essentially says is 
that, in paragraph three that, 
 
“I wish to place on record that the above allegations are 
 
categorically 
denied, 
none 
of 
the 
evidence 
in 
the 
 
investigation pertaining to Durban Case 781 was obtained by 
 
means of interception and there’s no such evidence contained 
 
in the docket.  The evidence in Durban Central Case 781 
 
comprises 
straightforward 
documentary 
evidence 
ceased 
 
during lawful search and seizure operations.  Affidavits of 
 
witnesses and a comprehensive forensic report compiled by 
10 
 
Price Waterhouse Coopers. Since this was an ordinary 
 
commercial crime investigation of the Directorate there was 
 
no need for the Directorate to rely on interception as 
 
provided for in the regulation of interception and provision of 
 
communication related information Act.   
 
I’ll pause there, that itself is a correct – was what was said. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   From the outset. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   But that was also said by Advocate Letsholo. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I see that in the – that letter Mr Dramat also 
20 
points out what, I believe, you will say is the correct position, namely 
that interception related to the death threats and really was not in 
respect of the investigation in 781. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s pointed out. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 114 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think that’s enough we can move on ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you.  Did Advocate Vimbani respond to 
this letter from…[intervenes]? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Chair as far as I know she did not 
respond to this letter.  What she did, she actually forwarded this letter 
on to Advocate Lawrence Mrwebi, he was the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Advocate? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Lawrence Mrwebi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   He was, at that point in time, I 
think the National Head of this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Special Crime Commercial Courts ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes and we were told that there’s 
only one-line reply from him and is reply was that there’s nothing to 
state at this stage, that’s all nothing else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is nothing? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   He had nothing to state at this 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but we don’t have that email or document here? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   No that will be – we don’t have 
that but that will be on their files in head office Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so he said there’s nothing to state? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   At his stage yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 115 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and you saw that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes we saw that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so he did not respond to this substantive 
argument put forward by Mr Dramat, to say this decision not to 
prosecute, has no proper grounds? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Then if I might refer you to the document on 
page 119 and it’s a memorandum prepared by Advocate Noko dated the 
10 
21 s t of October 2014 to the South African Police Investigating Officers, 
have you seen this memorandum? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair I have seen this 
memorandum. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what is important is that it is stated in the 
opening paragraph that and we will recall your – the evidence that you 
gave and remember the letter where you – which you said was provided 
to Advocate – the Advocate at court for the hearing of one of the cases 
which said: 
“I believe in the interest of justice.” 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
“Something has come to my attention and in the 
interest of justice the matter must be provisionally 
withdrawn.” 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 116 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes that I… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you recall that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes I recall that Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So he is now referring to that in the first 
paragraph and he said: 
“I had previously provisionally withdrawn this matter on the basis that 
there were considerations of justice that I had to look into in order to 
arrive at a proper decision that is in the interest of justice.  These have 
been so looked into and my decision is indicated hereunder with 
substantiation.” 
10 
Now what is he referring to?  Is it the represent – were the 
representations made prior to the matter being withdrawn or not? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair we would – I would not know 
that because we received no representations as far as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes now by the way the case where she had said 
should be withdrawn – the case that she said should be withdrawn 
because there was something that she still needed to look into.  Was 
that 466?  Was that case 466? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have looked at this letter? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair I looked at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what – what was she saying in this letter? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair she goes… 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 117 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or memorandum. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  She goes through all the cases and 
trying to convince us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe just to go back 466 is the cash in the boot 
case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is it.  That is it, right Chair the 
corruption matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that relates to Colonel Madhoe. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes and then there was CAS 328 
that is a party docket from… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The party docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so she writes this letter to indicate what 
she has found in looking into the issues that she was going to look into 
and to say what she – what the way forward would be? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  In all these dockets yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what did she say the way forward would be?  
What was the conclusion into those issues that she had wanted to look 
into? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair to be honest with you I did 
20 
not put much weight in what she said in this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The reason being is that before we 
received the signed memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 118 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  This one – specifically this one.  
We were at our office and Colonel Jones came to the office and he 
called myself and Colonel Govender and Colonel Herbst and he asked 
us to come to his office or into some office there.  But we met with him 
and then he had a draft of this report unsigned – unsigned and trying to 
convince use to go through this and see if we agree with this and to 
see if all the CAS numbers are correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you say to see if all the case numbers are 
correct? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes that and also if we agree with 
10 
this stuff – the content of the – I just – and then furthermore he placed 
his phone in the centre of the table and it is not his common way of 
doing things.   But I just asked [indistinct] where did you get this letter 
from?  And he says well do not worry about that just read it.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in the conclusion she says she declines to 
prosecute both Colonel Madhoe and Mr Panday for corruption on – or 
any offence in the 466 case. She says this is due to lack of reasonable 
prospects of a successful prosecution as explained and substantiated 
above.  She says there appears to be agendas among the parties and 
20 
scores to be settled.  Unfortunately we appear to be used to assist 
whoever to settle those scores and push those agendas.  We are 
expected to act impartially and ethically in the execution of our duties 
as officials of the NPA thus my indication – indication that we are being 
used in a manner that flies in the face of our values at the [indistinct] 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 119 of 162 
 
code of conduct must be avoided and not be entertained at all.  That is 
your correction of what – is that your recollection of what the 
memorandum is saying? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I was just busy to tell you 
that Colonel Jones came with a draft of this letter to our office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before it was signed? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And I just wondered how did 
Colonel Jones get this draft in the first place. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is not natural to give a draft 
report from the NPA to the Head of the Unit to say approach these 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And go through them and see if 
they agree with that and if the case numbers are right have been – it is 
the first time in the history in my police career that this ever happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And again Colonel Jones what was his position 
again? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He was the head of the ACTT 
Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in Durban? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 120 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And just took us aback. That is 
why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  We had a – I asked him why have 
you got this thing – he says do not worry about how I got hold of it just 
go through it and – I actually refused, I did not go through it.  We just 
left the meeting. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why did you leave the meeting?  If you 
10 
can just explain that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Because it is – first of all it is 
improper.  I mean – and… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But you just – you said earlier that you say he 
put his phone in the middle of the table and that was unusual. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:   Yes he put his phone in the middle 
of the table trying to record us.  But when we noticed that and he told 
us what the purpose of his visit as in the meeting you know I just said, 
look I actually got annoyed and I got cross. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I said I am not interested.  I am not 
interested in reading it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  All of us and we just left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 121 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Then afterwards it came, signed 
and he said ja but this – no but – questions are asked how did – how 
did Jones get this letter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Why – who instructed him to come 
to us? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is unheard of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You said earlier in your evidence that you did 
10 
not involve Jones in this investigation.  Why was that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I was not – I did not trust him 
to put it bluntly.  That is why we never reported that matter – reported 
the cases to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if I can just show you what is said – 
there are just one or two things I would like you to – to comment on and 
if we can look at page 120- paragraph 2.3 please?   
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  2.2? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 2.3 and that deals with case 781 in 
20 
respect of which you were the lead investigator.   
“Case 781 was dealt with by the Specialised 
Commercial 
Crime 
Unit 
SCCU 
in 
Durban 
and 
disposed of recently with a decision not to prosecute 
anyone as there was no evidence to prosecute any 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 122 of 162 
 
person with any offence.  It has been revealed by the 
SCCU that the SAPS members who were charged 
with the investigation of the 781 case was gunning 
for the prosecution of a specific person Lieutenant 
General Mgubeni and Mr Panday and Colonel 
Madhoe were being pressurised to falsely implicate 
her in the commission of criminal offences with the 
promise that they will be exonerated in 781.  When 
the SAPS investigators realised that the PC cannot 
be charged in this case 781 simply because there is 
10 
no evidence against her one investigating officer 
reportedly said that the SCCU Prosecutor may as 
well just close the 781 case.  It appears Mr Panday 
and Colonel Madhoe featured nowhere in the 781 
then as the focus was on the PC.  One then may ask 
a question, why was Colonel Madhoe arrested in the 
466 case?  Was this a lawfully justified arrest or was 
it a way to pressurise him to implicate the PC as he 
Colonel Madhoe even mentions in his representation 
that he was being regularly interviewed by the IO’s 
20 
so he falsely implicate the PC which is flat – which 
he flatly refused.” 
Can you comment on that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I did not have words to 
describe when I read this paragraph to be honest with you.  She had 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 123 of 162 
 
access to the dockets, all of the dockets.  And if she had access to all 
of the dockets and she looked at all of the dockets in – how could she 
even say that there is no evidence against Panday and Madhoe in 781?  
The affidavits are there.  The forensic report is there.  Everything is 
there so to make this allegation I cannot add up here how she came to 
this conclusion.  And the PC as well. I mean the evidence is there – 
everything is there.  The reports are there.  The affidavits are there.  
But what we later discovered is that the PC’s contract was running out 
and the Commissioner at the time was Ria Beetge and it is obvious that 
she was aware of this investigation and all the other investigations. 
10 
She needed something from [indistinct] to exonerate the PC and 
anybody else to renew the PC’s contract for another five years.  And 
that was the purpose of this letter.  Why else would it be?  It is not 
normal that every provincial DPP writes to the police in respect of 
seven or eight case or – you know to our police headquarters – head 
office and specifically mentioning all these cases, mentioning the PC.  
There is no cases against anybody.  That this was purely done 
requested from the National Commissioner so that she could have 
something in her file to say, allegations have been made.  I have got 
this Advocate Noko she is satisfied there is no alle – there is no basis 
20 
of any allegations in any of these cases against any of these men so I 
am going to extend her contract for another five years with the police 
force. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was the contract renewed for the PC? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes it was Chair it was renewed. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 124 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then if we may continue on paragraph 
2.4.  It says… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I am sorry what page is that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh sorry page 120 the same page we were 
on.   
“The SCCU revealed the scheming and intercepting 
of phone calls of inter alia Mr Panday with a motive 
and agenda to falsely implicate certain people.  They 
allegedly even went further to even boast to Mr 
Panday telling him that they know what his defence 
10 
in 781 will be as they heard his discussions with his 
legal representative through the interceptive calls.” 
Which is what we have said we have seen here.  And then it said in 2.5. 
“Mr Panday was even promised by SAPS members in 
the 781 case that if he falsely implicates the PC they 
would get rid of the 466 case.  It was further 
explained to Mr Panday that the benefit of this 
sought incrimination of the PC for them will be that 
the PC will be forced to resign and then Major 
General Booysen will become the next KwaZulu Natal 
20 
PC.  Further Major General Dina Moodley would 
remain in control of the Secret Fund.” 
Can you comment on that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair this is absolutely nonsense, 
rubbish to put it that way in a stronger manner.  There is no way that 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 125 of 162 
 
[indistinct] anyone of us to allegedly state what she wrote in this 
paragraph here.  And there is no way that General Booysen wanted to 
become the PC.  There is no way that Genearl Booysen could get 
access to the funds, to the secret funds.  It is only Crime Intelligence.  
They have got a secret fund.  They are a different division from us.  
They are not within the Hawks. They are in a different – in a completely 
different division.  So he could not put his hands – get his hands on the 
secret fund. So I do not know where – how she got this?  What was put 
in front of her to come to a conclusion like this or is it thumb sucking? 
This is the only way I can see it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would have thought that the appointment of Ms – 
Ngobeni the Provincial Commissioner as Provincial Commissioner of 
SAPS in KZN would have been seen as very good step in terms of 
transformation, gender transformation in the whole country and within 
SAPS as a whole.  Do you know whether that is how it was seen when 
the appointment was made or is that something you would not have 
noticed 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I have – I am honest with you 
I do not have any knowledge of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I cannot actually comment on 
anything on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am just wondering do you know whether at that 
time there were any other female Provincial Commissioners in the 
whole country under SAPS? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 126 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I could not – I could not 
answer you on that I have got no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not know? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I would not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am just wondering to what extent it would been 
have – it would have been an easy thing in the context of gender 
transformation which the whole public service subscribes to that having 
found a female to put in a position such as Provincial Commissioner 
that if she goes you know there would – would go and take a white male 
and put him in that position.  I am just not sure what the chances are.  
10 
Obviously cannot mean that it was – it could not be done because if 
there were no people then there would be no people but I wonder what 
the chances are that such a thing could have happened. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair I hear what you are saying.  
But unfortunately these decisions are made in head office alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And us at ground level would not 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The reasons for appointing that 
20 
person to that position or that person to the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot comment ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Then it was also said in – or 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 127 of 162 
 
suggested in paragraph 2.3 on page 120 that Colonel Madhoe was in a 
sense offered a deal if he would implicate the PC.  Was – did any of the 
investigators ever offer a deal to Mr Panday or to Mr Madhoe to 
implicate the PC? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair no deals were offered to 
anybody.  The evidence is overwhelming.  The documentation is there.  
The forensic report is there.  Everything is there.  Why do you want to 
make a deal with the person?  Okay it happens in some other smaller 
matters that you know if you need some evidence you – you short of 
evidence you try – one to testify against the other.  But in this matter, 
10 
in this case 781 you never promised anybody or requested or 
approached anyone to come with a deal to testify against anybody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you ever get shown any statement signed by 
anybody to back up this allegation of a promise to him to say the 
investigators promised him something?  Was there an affidavit, a 
statement on which this allegation is based to say here is the source 
from which we get this information that the investigators promised 
Colonel Madhoe something? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Nothing Chair, nothing whatsoever.  
Nothing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing was ever shown to you? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Nothing ever was shown to us, 
nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and nothing that was within the docket 
contained that? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 128 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is right.  That is correct Chair.  
Nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the decision whether to prosecute or not to 
prosecute has to be made on the basis of the information in the docket 
and not outside the docket? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair.  200% correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there was any evidence that the investigators had 
made such a promise to Colonel Madhoe then there should have been 
an affidavit or statement signed by somebody who was present when 
10 
that promise was made and that should have been in the docket? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair.  That – that is the 
correct procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then if I might draw your attention and ask 
your comment to the further statements made by Advocate Noko.  If we 
can go back to page 121 and paragraph 2.6.   
“The 781 matter which forms the basis and reason for the alleged 
corruption of Major General Booysen by Colonel Madhoe was found to 
be non-existent by the SCCU.” 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No this is incorrect Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the reference to the case number is – 
should be obviously 466? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Because 781 is… 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 129 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  781 was the 2010… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Procurement. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The procurement and 466 was the 
corruption case with Colonel Madhoe and General Booysen. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So now I am going to just read to you why it 
is suggested that there is also no case in 466 and ask for your 
comment.  It says: 
“Major General Booysen is the complainant and the 
only witness in the 466 case against Mr Panday and 
Colonel Madhoe.  The very Mr Panday and Colonel 
10 
Madhoe who allegedly refused to pave the way for 
him to become the next KwaZulu Natal PC by 
refusing to falsely implicate the current Provincial 
Commissioner General Ngobeni.”   
Was Major General Booysen the complainant? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He was a witness in this matter 
Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is then said in paragraph 2.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Going back to paragraph 2.7.  It says: 
“The very Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe who 
20 
allegedly refused to pave the way for him to become 
the next KZN SAPS Provincial Commissioner by 
refusing to falsely implicate the current Provincial 
General Ngobeni.” 
Now the suggestion here is that Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe had 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 130 of 162 
 
been asked to implicate the Provincial Commissioner and they refused.  
And I take it that maybe they think the suggestion is that General 
Booysen asked them to do that or somebody asked them on behalf of … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Booysen. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No – Chair it is hard to believe 
really it is very hard to believe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Certainly you are saying that you did not do 
that. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No definitely not Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as far as you know whoever was involved in the 
investigation with you did not do that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my question then is in regard to this allegation 
did you ever get given any statement or affidavit made by anybody 
saying who it was that was said to have made this promise to or 
request to these two people? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever get given a statement, an affidavit 
where somebody says, I was present when so and so asked Panday, Mr 
20 
Panday or Colonel Madhoe to implicate the Provincial Commissioner.  
Or a statement by them or anyone of them saying, I was approached by 
so and so who asked me to implicate the PC.  Did you ever get given 
anything like that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Nothing Chair nothing whatsoever.  
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 131 of 162 
 
Nothing whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you ever see in the docket any document like 
that signed by anybody? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  Nothing Chair. Nothing 
whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what you never saw were maybe this might 
have been said was the representations that came from Mr Panday.   
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It could be possibly yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It could be I would not know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – it may be that in those reservations that kind of 
allegation was made but it should have been placed – put before you so 
that you could refute it if you – if that was your position? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair and it was 
never done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know of any reason why it was not done? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair I could not think of any 
reason.  It is just as I said at the end of the day my gut was it was a 
political decision.  The less we knew the less we close this matter, the 
better for everybody.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now by that time or even before you retired you had 
been involved in investigations of numerous cases over the years? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there must have been a number of cases where 
prosecutors received representations from accused persons or suspects 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 132 of 162 
 
about requesting them to withdraw or not to prosecute, is that right? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And over the years are you able to say to me almost 
invariably the prosecutors would give you as an investigating officer 
copies of such representations so that you could comment or are you 
not able to say that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair every case in the past 
that I have deal with where we receive the representations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Or the prosecutor receives the 
10 
representations.  The first thing that he will phone me, he says come to 
my office, look what we have got here.  We have got representations.  
Let us work through them.  Then we work through them and if need be 
we need to get evidence or obtain affidavits or what – that is how the 
way it is dealt with.  The prosecutor and the investigator they work 
through the report.  That is – it has always happened in the past, 
always, always, always. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you might not with regard to Advocate – oh this 
was Advocate Noko hey?  That was declining to prosecute? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Letsholo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Letsholo? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja Letsholo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you said you were dealing with him for the first 
time? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 133 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in respect of other prosecutors in that office, in 
KZN that you had dealt with did they also follow the process that you 
have just described. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely if there were representations from an accused 
person or a suspect they would call in the investigator and say, look 
what we have got let us deal with it? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair as far as I know all of them 
do that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know how long Advocate Letsholo had 
been a prosecutor as at that time?  Was it somebody new who had just 
joined? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair no he was not new.  I 
recall that Colonel Piet who I believe is going to come to the 
commission next… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Du Plooy. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Du Plooy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he was not new? 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He was not new.  No he was not 
new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would you have any doubt in your mind that he 
would know that this is the procedure based on his experience as you 
understood it? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 134 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes, definitely Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  If one has regard to paragraph 
2.8 page 121 which I just read to you.  Is it correct that Mr – is it 
Colonel – that General Booysen responded to these allegations and 
that document is found at page 128. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sorry. Can you just repeat ... 
(intervenes)? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry7.  I am sorry you said paragraph 2.8 and 
then? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So 2.8.  All these allegations is it correct that 
General Booysen 
responded 
to 
what 
he 
calls 
a 
missive 
from 
Advocate Noko and that document is found at page 128. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Hang on.  Let us finish with 2.8 first. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you move on. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
I want 
to 
put 
to him 
what 
- what 
General Booysen’s response to this was. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Before you do that.  Look at 2. - paragraph 
2.8. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  On page 121? 
CHAIRPERSON:  121.  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 135 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“The 466 case is investigated by the members of 
the 
police 
who 
fall 
under 
the 
command 
of 
Major General Booysen who is the complainant in 
the 466 case.  Their objectivity dealing with this 
case becomes questionable especially with the Cato 
Manor case cloud hanging over their heads.  This I 
believe would shake their credibility and the court 
would view all these in favour of the two - 
Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe.” 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How does that - you - did you - do you understand 
how the Cato Manor case becomes relevant for - for this purpose here? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of your investigation.  How would that affect 
… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  I have got no idea Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your credibility.  Do you understand?  I just want to 
make sure that … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  I do not understand Chair, but 
20 
the only thing I know is that it is common knowledge that 
General Booysen was the Provisional Head of the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
So 
automatically 
he 
is 
our 
Provincial Commander … 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 136 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But the other comment about the 
Cato Manor case.  I had nothing to do with that case or that 
investigation whatsoever and the people in my team was not connected 
to the Cato Manor case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
It 
is 
Colonel Govender.  
Colonel Phillip Herbst and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  We never worked at Cato Manor. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  We were never charged in the Cato 
Manor.  We were never … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were not suspects in the Cato Manor case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Never ever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I am trying to understand how that case - the 
existence of that case is said to have been something that the court 
would take into account against you in terms of your credibility.  So I 
am trying to see the rationality of these reasons given here. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, I cannot … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say you were not suspects in the Cato Manor 
case? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had nothing to do with - with it.  The only thing is 
that 
you 
were 
members 
of 
the 
Hawks 
in 
KZN 
and 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 137 of 162 
 
Major General Booysen was the Head. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is your only connection? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair before I - I go on, because I - I 
would just like to deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may go on.  I wanted to get … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Clarity on that.  You may go on in terms of … 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you were planning. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If I can just point out what General Booysen’s 
response to these averments we have just read and then I will go back 
to the further ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page is that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is page 131. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-3-1? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At paragraph 2.7 he says: 
“I am not the complainant in the matter of Durban 
case 466.  This is a disingenuous proposition by 
Advocate Noko so as to build a legend for her 
imputations contained in paragraphs 2.8 and 2.9 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 138 of 162 
 
infra.  For one the state is the complainant in the 
corruption matter.  I am merely one of many 
witnesses. 
 
Advocate Noko 
clearly 
does 
not 
understand my role in this investigation.  She also 
chooses to ignore the fact that the Durban Central 
case 781 investigation was initiated by none other 
than 
the 
Financial 
Head 
of 
the 
Province 
- 
Brigadier Lawrence Kemp.  It is inconceivable that 
Brigadier Kemp knew about my aspirations as 
alleged by Advocate Noko.  Unless he obviously 
10 
colluded 
with 
me 
to 
discredit 
the 
Provincial 
Commissioner. 
 
Had 
Advocate Noko 
however 
bothered to examine Brigadier Kemp’s statement in 
Durban case 781, she would have established the 
origin and source of this entire investigation.” 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that statement is the statement that we 
were dealing with earlier in evidence of Advocate - of … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Brigadier Lawrence Kemp. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Brigadier Kemp. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct - that is correct 
Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then as you quite correctly had pointed 
out as he says also in - at paragraph 2.8 on page 1-3-1. 
“Advocate Noko is mendacious in stating that the 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 139 of 162 
 
investigators officers’ objectivity are questionable 
especially as the Cato Manor case cloud hanging 
over their heads.  The investigating officers in 
these matters are as follows:  case 781 - 
Colonel Van Loggerenberg. 
 
Case 
466 
- 
Colonel Du Plooy.  Case 122 - Colonel Herbst.  
None of these investigating officers’ were ever 
attached to the Cato Manor Unit.  They are not 
implicated in the Cato Manor issue at all.  Hence 
their credibility cannot be questioned as implied by 
10 
Advocate Noko.” 
Which is what you have said. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And now let us see what is said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  In 781 were you the only investigator? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you had a team under you? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  I had a team under me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now in - back to page 121 at paragraph 2.9.  
This is said: 
“Major General Booysen being the complainant in 
the 466 case interfered with and exercised control 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 140 of 162 
 
in this case even going to an extent of determining 
and deciding on who visits Colonel Madhoe when he 
was detained in Durban Central Prison Cells in the 
466 case.  This is exhibited by the letter that was 
issued on his direct instruction to the Durban 
Central Police Station Command Brigadier Stokes.  
This letter dated 16 September 2011 addressed to 
all Relief Commanders and Cell Commander titled 
Visitation Durban Central - Madhoe.  Provides that 
on 
the 
direct 
instruction 
from 
10 
Major General Booysen only the following persons 
will be allowed to visit him.  Major General Booysen 
two, Major General Moodley.  What is amazing with 
this 
is 
that 
Major General Booysen issues 
an 
instruction regarding who must visit a suspect in a 
case that he is the complainant himself.  Further he 
also has a visitation right in this as it appears in 
the letter him being mentioned as number one 
among 
those 
who 
are 
allowed 
to 
visit 
Colonel Madhoe.  By the way what would a 
20 
complainant want to visit a suspect in their own 
case for?  This is unheard of and smacks of an 
agenda.” 
Can you comment on that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I only became aware of this letter 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 141 of 162 
 
at a later stage Chair.  That is the only comment I can make on this. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will - if I can show - tell you to go to page 1-
3-2 what Colonel Booysen’s response was and perhaps you can 
comment on that.  At paragraph 2.9. 
“Advocate Noko is seriously misguided to suggest 
that I interfered with the exercise control in Durban 
Central case 466.  Had she complied with the NPA 
Policy Guidelines she was at liberty to consult with 
me to establish the facts which I shall detail below.  
As the Provincial Head Hawks it is incumbent upon 
10 
me to exercise control over all investigations 
conducted by the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal.  The 
National Directorate Head Hawks were kept abreast 
of all developments in the investigation.  To suggest 
that I interfered with the investigation is akin to 
suggest that Advocate Noko herself is interfering 
with the functions of her subordinates.  There is 
nothing mysterious regarding my instruction with 
regard to visits to Madhoe.  Initial investigations 
revealed complicity by officers within SAPS.  This 
20 
entry into the occurrence book was made to obviate 
attempts by officers with mala fides intentions.  I 
have dealt with the matter regarding being the 
complainant above.  Again the tenor and tone of 
Advocate Noko’s contentions appears to be that of 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 142 of 162 
 
a defence counsel rather than that of a prosecutor.  
The fact that I had not visited Colonel Madhoe at all 
subsequent to his arrest or that I had not personally 
communicated 
with 
him 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
demonstrates that Advocate Noko’s assertion that it 
smacks of an agenda is misguided and I reject it 
with contempt.” 
Can you comment? 
COLONOL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. I agree with what the - 
General Booysen is saying Chair. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are asking the witness to comment on just 
argument really. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think we should spend time on - on this with 
this witness.  General Booysen if he did not cover this when he gave 
evidence last year … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would need to come in or at least do an affidavit 
confirming … 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That this was his memorandum and confirming the 
correctness of … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of this. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 143 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise ask this witness questions that led to 
matters where he can really add … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Value. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There is only one final aspect that I would like 
you to comment on with regard to this document.  If you could go to 
page 122 and it is paragraph 2.10 and I would like your comment on 
this. 
“The allegation that the accused in 466 Mr Panday 
10 
and Colonel Madhoe wanted Major General Booysen 
to predate a report in the 781 case in order to have 
the Section 205 subpoena set aside - subpoenas for 
access 
to 
the 
bank 
account 
records 
and 
consequently bribed Major General Booysen to do 
that.  Does not really hold water, because the fact 
is that if there has been any corruption, bribing of 
Major General Booysen that took place would not 
make the corruption and its successful prosecution 
impossible as Sections 3(B) and 4(1)(B) of the 
20 
Prevention of Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act 
12 of 2004 state.  The alleged report in the 781 
case that it was alleged was to be predated to 
validate the Section 205 subpoenas did not suffice 
to prove fraud or any offence against anyone 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 144 of 162 
 
especially …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel that is all argument by General Booysen.  
It is not facts or a lot of it at least. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this witness what do you want this witness to do 
about it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What I want him to comment is - is this a 
reason, because what is stated is - it is - it is almost as a circuitous 
10 
reasoning.  Is that how is it possible that because there was this 
bribing that it can have any effect on the subpoenas and therefore you 
cannot prosecute section - case 446 - 466. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is argument. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is argument. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will take the point.  If we may then go back 
to your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page - I think we have dealt with paragraph 
20 
13.  We have dealt I think mainly with what is said with regard to - oh.  
This is - is actually quite important, because there is a further 
document that was located this morning which I would like to deal with.  
If we can go to paragraph 13 on page 16.  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 145 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You said what transpired with this draft 
memorandum with Colonel Jones.  You have indicated that the draft 
memorandum which was ultimately prepared by Advocate Noko was in 
Colonel Jones’ possession. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now was the case then withdrawn? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what then did Colonel Jones do? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, what Colonel Jones then did 
is he actually wrote a letter to the Provincial Commissioner - 
10 
Lieutenant-General Ngobeni not the finance - not the finance earlier 
indicated in this affidavit.  It is a correction.  He actually wrote a letter 
to the Provincial Commissioner - Lieutenant-General Ngobeni. 
Stating that the case has been withdrawn and he heard from 
his attorney and that the money that was being held must be paid out to 
Thoshan Panday - held by the police.  Must be paid out to 
Thoshan Panday and as far as we could gather she actually - none of 
us knew about this letter. 
I mean I do not know why, because General Booysen stopped 
this paying out and Colonel Jones writing a letter to the suspect in 781 
20 
requesting authorisation to release the funds to pay out another 
suspect.  I mean it does not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  That would not normally be his business. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 146 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the suspect or his attorneys would be the ones 
who would be expected to write and say now that the case is withdrawn 
we believe our client should be paid. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You say in paragraph 13.12 that this annexure 
- this letter was still to be located.  Chair the Commission investigators 
10 
were able to obtain a copy of this from the National Prosecuting 
Authority from the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At the end of the bundle at page 3-9-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not seem to have 3-9-9. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Three … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  3-9-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My last page seems to be … 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh.  It is the same difficulty that you had 
Chair.  I am now reading the black as opposed to - I am trying to see 
what it is.  It is page 3-0-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now this letter is addressed to the Provincial 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 147 of 162 
 
Commissioner and I am trying to - the date is 26 March 2014 and it 
says: 
“Herewith 
attached 
memorandum 
dated 
25 March 2014 
from 
the 
prosecutor 
Advocate Letsholo.  A decision has been made by 
Advocate Letsholo to decline prosecution.  The 
suspects defence attorneys and the investigators in 
the matter have been made aware of this decision 
as indicated in the memorandum.  The investigators 
have since released all the exhibits that were 
10 
seized in their lawful owners.  It was brought to my 
attention by the defence that the state also needs 
to release funds that had been held back due to the 
pending investigation that has since been declined 
against the suspects involved.  To avoid any civil 
action 
against 
the 
state 
it 
is 
therefore 
recommended that the matter is finalised as soon 
as possible.” 
Can you comment on that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, this is inappropriate.  I mean 
20 
this should never have been done.  He has got no authority to do so at 
all.  It is all I can comment on that, because I do not know what his 
interest was in this matter, but there were surely signs that he had 
some interest in this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 148 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is it correct that what is said in paragraph 
4 that the investigators have since released all the exhibits that were 
seized to their lawful owners? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  That is not correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then if you can have regard to a 
document on page 300.  It is an email sent from Colonel Govender 
dated 5 August 2014 to Brigadier Van Graan and the - it deals with the 
previous correspondences regarding the actions of Colonel Jones and 
you will see that you were copied on that email. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you remember this email? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Colonel Jones informed me about 
this email to him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if we can just refer to it.  It says that: 
“Yesterday 4 August 2014 I had a meeting - an 
appointment 
with 
Major General (indistinct) 
the 
Head of Legal Services to obtain her affidavit with 
regards to investigation of Durban case 781.  
During the meeting she raised the fact of receiving 
a letter from Colonel Jones stating that the matter 
20 
which is Durban case 781 has been brought to her 
attention.  That it has been declined to prosecute 
and Colonel Jones had stated in the letter to 
prevent any civil claim against the state that she 
may attend to the matter of the civil claim.  This 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 149 of 162 
 
letter 
was 
addressed 
to 
the 
Provincial 
Commissioner. 
 
Attached 
letter 
sent 
by 
Colonel Jones 
for 
your 
information. 
 
Also 
Colonel Jones has attached the decision from the 
prosecutor 
to 
his 
letter 
which 
you 
have 
in 
possession.  I then informed the General that the 
investigation team was unaware of this letter and 
there was no communication by Colonel Jones with 
the team.  This was reported to your office has 
unbecoming … (intervenes).” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel you are not going to read that whole 
email please. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh.  I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what is the point? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you agree with the contents of what is 
stated in this …? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I do Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and there is then an email dated 
31 July 2014 
appearing 
at 
page 
3-0-1 
to 
3-0-2 
from 
you 
to 
Brigadier Van Graan with regard to this. 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you confirm the contents of this email and 
do you recall what it was about?  If you can just … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is the conduct … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Generally inform the Chair. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 150 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It is the conduct of Colonel Jones 
during the investigations and what happened and I confirm that this is 
my email Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just the main points in the email was it responding to 
a particular email from somebody on what and what did he say in terms 
of - just the gist? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It - it deals with this conduct of Colonel Jones 
which occurred on 30 July … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And his view in … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you say in the email about the conduct of 
Colonel Jones? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair just the information which 
was received from - I just - the second last paragraph.  I said: 
“The action of Officer Colonel Jones is highly 
questionable as he has now affected two witnesses 
of the Durban Central case 781.” 
Because he approached Colonel Moodley that was working in the 
Finance Office with Brigadier Kemp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now after the memorandum of Advocate Noko 
you said the case was withdrawn. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  It was Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then what happened after that?  Did you 
continue with the investigations?  What did you as investigators do? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 151 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair, we - first of all we wanted to 
keep the docket away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted to …? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Keep the docket away from the rest 
of the police force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  To hide it from them. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  to hide it from them.  So the only 
legal way we could do that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Why did you want to hide it from them?  What 
did you think … 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were going to do? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair with all the things that were 
going on during the investigation and the allegations and the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You thought it could get lost? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And everything about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Letsholo’s letter and Noko’s letter.  
20 
We decided then to - we discussed the matter with Major - ag - 
Major General - what is her surname?  Maharaj.  She was Head of IPID 
KZN at that point in time and it is clear from the dockets - from 781 - 
the docket 781 that police corruption is involved and it was their 
mandate to investigate that. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 152 of 162 
 
On the CAS system you can physically book out cases to IPID 
- on the system and what I did.  I made sure that we booked out 781 to 
IPID on the CAS system.  What we then did is we took the docket and 
we gave it over to General Maharaj was the IPID Provincial Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Then after that we had a meeting 
with - with the National Head of IPID and with his advocates and they 
agreed there is a case and they will see if they can take it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Who was at that meeting? 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
It 
was 
myself. 
 
It 
was 
General Maharaj.  It was Trevor White.  It was Peter Pau.  It was 
S Y Govender and the Head of IPID at that stage was McBride - 
Mr McBride.  He was the Head of IPID at that stage.  They were 
present. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And after your presentation of the docket to 
them what was Mr - General McBride - Mr McBride’s attitude? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He was - he agreed with us that 
there was a case in 781 against the people mentioned and also we had 
interviewed him with this advocates after they looked at the docket at 
20 
IPID and they agreed as well and then after that that is when we were 
called by Advocate Gerrie Nel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
We 
were 
called 
by 
Advocate Gerrie Nel. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 153 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He was then in possession of the 
docket.  So he must have had dealings with IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  But then at a later stage I heard 
that it was taken away from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He - he called you to come to see him in Pretoria? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  He - he came to interview us in 
10 
Durban - Advocate Gerrie Nel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  With the docket and we went 
through the docket and he agreed yes there is definitely a prima facie 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  There is enough evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And after that it just went dead 
until we heard that Advocate Shaun Abrahams gave instruction to 
20 
reinstitute the charges. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in terms of - sorry.  In terms of the view that 
Advocate Gerrie Nel took of the matter the - the matter should have 
been reinstated? 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 154 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But nothing happened for a number of years? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair and he - he had the 
views we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And as I say at the end of the day 
his view did not count or it did not matter, because it was taken away 
from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was taken away from him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  How do you know that? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
Because 
we 
wondered 
what 
happened with the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And then (indistinct) the matter was 
taken away from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did - did you ask somebody?  Who told you that in 
the NPA? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  We - we asked around. 
Everybody said no.  It was taken from him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and who was it given to?  Were you told? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I - I do not know Chair.  I do not 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  I do not. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 155 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for many years … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After that 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing was happening about it? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until Advocate Shaun Abrahams said it should be 
pursued? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair and then after 
that 
Thoshan Panday 
filed 
papers 
for 
the 
permanent 
stay 
of 
10 
prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  The state then had to appoint a 
Silk from the Johannesburg Bar … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
And 
two 
other 
advocates 
- 
Advocate Hilton Epstein … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And two other advocates who are 
dealing with the civil matter and it is costing the state hundreds and 
20 
hundreds of thousands of Rands now to get this thing back on the roll 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  And to fight this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Now when - when was it - if you are able to 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 156 of 162 
 
remember - when Advocate Abrahams said the matter should be 
reinstated?  Which year? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair this was - if I can recall 
correctly.  What we are in 20 - I think it was 2017 or 2018.  If I am not 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Okay.  Somewhere around those years. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Somewhere around those years 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That - that is fine.  Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now did you consult with the Silk?  Who was 
10 
that Silk?  Do you remember who was the …? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It was Advocate Hilton Epstein. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you consult with him? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair.  He came down.  He 
consulted with us.  Us being myself and Colonel Govender and 
eventually he obtained an affidavit from the NDPP at that time - 
Advocate Silas Ramaite 
and 
I 
read 
through 
the 
affidavit 
with 
Advocate Silas Ramaite and I further confirmed with an affidavit that 
what was in Advocate Silas Ramaite’s affidavit is true and correct and 
that matter is still ongoing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see - I see that you say in paragraph 14.12 
that: 
“After the then NDPP Mr Nxasana had appointed 
Advocate Gerrie Nel and Andrew - Mr Andrew Lisk 
to deal with the case and that after they had 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 157 of 162 
 
interviewed you shortly thereafter Mr Nxasana and 
Advocate Gerrie Nel were removed.” 
So this would have been around 2015 I would imagine, because I think 
… 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Chair you are … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nxasana was removed … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Either in 2015 or 2016. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja.  Ja.  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Would 
this 
not 
have 
been 
the 
time 
when 
Advocate Gerrie Nel left the NPA? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So could it be that he was not removed from the case 
as such … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he left and then it had to be given to somebody 
else. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  I was in - I finished in 
20 
2015 and he came and saw us before that - long before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  So that is before August 2015 when 
I went on pension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 158 of 162 
 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  It was long before that.  He … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Well in - in that event probably your 
statement 
in 
15 
- 
in 
paragraph 
14.12 
that 
shortly 
after 
Advocate Gerrie Nel had interviewed you he and Mr Nxasana were 
removed.  Probably that is not accurate then, because I guess nobody 
could remove - I mean the removal of Mr Nxasana that you are talking 
to - talking about must be his departure from the NPA as NDPP. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No he was not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not talking about him being removed from the 
case? 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No.  He was removed from the 
case.  He was not - he did not resign as far as I can recall at that 
moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but nobody could remove him from the case.  He 
was the big boss there. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No, no.  He was - he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the NDPP … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nationally. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
Yes, 
but 
I 
know 
when 
20 
Advocate Shaun Abrahams came in after that that … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Abrahams came here - came after Mr Nxasana had 
left. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Nxasana left either in 2015 or 2016.  I cannot 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 159 of 162 
 
remember, but it is one of those years. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, but what I am saying … 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  As far as I can recall Chair is that 
when Advocate Shaun Abrahams was appointed that is when it was 
taken away from him - from Advocate Gerrie Nel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Alright.  Okay.  So that - that means it 
would then have been certainly not earlier than 2015, because 
Mr Nxasana - Mr Abrahams only came after Mr Nxasana had left the 
NPA and Mr Nxasana only left the NPA either in 2015 or 2016. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  So - so the - the timing might - you might 
not be accurate about the timing, but I understand what your evidence 
is.  You may continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Were you told why an external 
counsel was appointed to deal with Mr Panday’s application for a 
permanent stay of execution? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Sorry.  I could not … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Were you told why an external counsel 
instead of an employee at the NPA was appointed … 
20 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  By the - by the state? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  By the state. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Yes.  I do not actually recall the 
specific reasons why private counsel was appointed to do this, but I 
know because Advocate Epstein made contact with me and he told me 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 160 of 162 
 
he was appointed to take this matter up in the High - up in the High 
Court and defend it and it is still pending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course the appointment of external counsel 
should not be anything remarkable.  Is it not?  That happens quite 
often. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  It does - it does happen often.  
The witness had said something to me earlier, but I - I cannot take it 
further.  Then just for completeness you say that Advocate Epstein 
drafted an affidavit which was signed by Mr Ramaite.  That appears at 
page 153 which you confirmed in the proceedings. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is that the affidavit that you confirmed? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Are you aware what the current status is of 
the Panday investigations? 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG: 
 
You 
are 
talking 
about 
this 
application? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just what is happening in the investigations 
… (intervenes). 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  No Chair.  The only thing that I 
20 
know is it is at a standstill and they are waiting for this civil matter to 
be finalised before they can actually move further on with that thing 
and I am aware that 466 is presently being dealt with by 
Advocate Wendy O’Brien 
from 
the 
Commercial 
Crime 
Courts 
in 
KwaZulu-Natal. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 161 of 162 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair from my side that concludes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The witness’ evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you very, very much 
Mr Van Loggerenberg for coming to give evidence. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Thank you Chair.  It is a pleasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we need you to come back we will ask you to come 
back, but for now you are excused. 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
COLONEL VAN LOGGERENBERG:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tomorrow did you say that the witness will be … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  General Lebeya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lebeya? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that - and then his evidence - I have seen 
his affidavit.  It is not short at all. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is not short at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I suspect it might be the affidavit that you feel 
20 
that there is a lot of issues that are not contentious and need not be 
dealt with in - in great detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  The one that I was talking about is shorter - is 
much shorter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh. 
15 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 199 
 
Page 162 of 162 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that his one also has got those features, but 
the one I had in mind is much shorter than his. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will have to start at half past 10 tomorrow.  
Yesterday I said we would start at half past 10 today, but I discovered 
that my commitment was going to happen.  So we will start at half past 
10 tomorrow. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
