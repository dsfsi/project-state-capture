PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 16 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody.  Good morning Mr Thabethe. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Good morning Chair. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Morning Chair.  My apologies Chair I was 
just having a short consultation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With Mr Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chair Mr Thabethe has indicted that he 
would like to - to address you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This morning on one or two matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not know if you want to start there 
before we do anything else? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let – let us start with him.  Mr Thabethe do you 
want to say something? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you very much Chair.  Good 
20 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes good morning. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair my humble request to you and 
the commission is that I would request a postponement if it is possible 
since I do not have legal support at the current moment.  I would 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 3 of 12 
 
therefore request that I be afforded an opportunity to do so; so that as I 
proceed and then I am being assisted with that kind of support.  Thank 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand the legal representative that you had 
before have withdrawn, is that correct?  Is that why you do not have 
legal support as you put it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  I am actually 
informed by the commission that they have withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You – you have not received any communication 
from them to that effect? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not – not so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When were you last in touch with them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair on Friday when I received a call 
from the commission that I am due to appear today and then I then did 
speak to them and then we have agreed that we will – I will speak to 
them after the sitting today so that we – whether there is a possibility 
to sort any difference that are there which – which might be very 
difficult Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If not then I will then request 
20 
assistance from other lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Also Chair maybe also address you 
specifically in making a request.  I am aware that the rule of the 
commission stipulates that you may bring your own legal assistance.  I 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 4 of 12 
 
do not know if there are any special arrangements in this regard for the 
commission to assist.  That is my request Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there are not any arrangements in terms of 
which the commission provides anybody with legal representation or 
any assistance as such.  So – so we do not have that.  So each person 
makes their own arrangement.  I know that some who are in government 
are represented by the State Attorney but I do not know what 
arrangements get made and I do not know whether there are any people 
who might be represented by the legal aid board lawyers I do not know.  
But certainly the commission does not have any arrangements that it 
10 
provides in terms of which it provides legal representation or makes 
legal representation available to anybody.  The regulation that talks 
about legal assistance for witnesses is understood to simply say you 
may bring your lawyer you know.  We will not – the commission will not 
say no, no, no a lawyer is not allowed here.  That it is understood to 
nothing more than that and then you can bring your lawyer.  Of course 
we – one would like a situation where if somebody would like to be 
legally represented the commission would like that that be achieved but 
at the same time the commission has a limited life span and it is has 
got to do the best it can to use the time that it has fruitfully and of 
20 
course as I understand it this stage was arranged some – quite some 
time back and one would have expected that you and your lawyers 
would have been in touch well in advance to make sure that the 
commission was not disrupted in its plans.  You understand that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I do understand Chair. 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 5 of 12 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so – so it is inconvenient when we set aside a 
day for something and then we do not use that day because I think 
today was just for your evidence only and there were no other witness – 
was planned.  So at this stage you – you say you are not sure what the 
problem is with your lawyers or you do have an idea what the problem 
is?  You just need to talk to them. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair I am aware what is the 
problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ms Gcabashe do you want to say some – 
anything? 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman.  Chairman there is an email 
that Mr Thabethe’s lawyers had written to the commission on the 13 
September in which they indicate that they are no longer able to 
represent Mr Thabethe.  I would simply like to hand this up without 
reading it into the record by your leave Chairman hand this up for your 
records?  We have a record as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have also in the short consultation I had 
20 
with Mr Thabethe – thank you – thank you very much – encouraged him 
if the worst comes to the worst to possibly approach the Johannesburg 
Bar Counsel or the Pretoria Bar Counsel or the Wits Legal Clinic or 
Pretoria Legal Clinic just ones that are in the close vicinity of this 
commission’s venues and possibly speak to them as well about giving 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 6 of 12 
 
him pro-deal assistance.  Because as we agreed that best we will run 
for two more days in relation to his evidence.  So it is for a limited span 
of time and I think he is amenable to doing that depending of course on 
– on his discussions with his legal team.  So those are the ideas we 
were sharing Chairman and I think that given that every now and again 
there is a bit of tension between us I think it is – we have agreed that 
he will be more comfortable if he is guided by another set of lawyers 
much as he does not think that we are partial or biased or prejudiced in 
the manner in which we are conducting our work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Obviously as long as there is 
appreciation that whatever you do for one you will be expected to do 
for others.   
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain that Chairman so that I am 
very clear.  I have done nothing but just simply indicate that there is 
assistance available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no what I am saying is if you will do more than 
just refer him to those then others will expect you to do whatever you 
do for it.  But if it is just a referral then it is easy and then even if it is 
20 
done for everybody it should not be problem. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact Chairman it was just an indication 
because I find many people do not know that these particular 
institutions… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 7 of 12 
 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do provide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Not as of right but you will request then 
you either get a [indistinct] of a no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I also mentioned the legal resources centre 
to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And Legal Aid South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But again all of those institutions have got 
their rules. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is just a matter of saying to him 
there are other institutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That may – may be able to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The other option Chairman that we 
discussed was the possibility of getting the departmental legal 
20 
representative who assisted Doctor Thabethe.  I beg your pardon – 
Doctor Masiteng to assist him because the matters he is dealing with 
really emanate from his time at the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development.  I believe that it is another option he may wish to pursue 
simply because that is how Doctor Masiteng was assisted. 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 8 of 12 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was representated. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  By the – ja by the Department.  So we 
really just tried to discuss the various options without discounting his 
current set of attorneys if he is able to resolve the difficulties there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well it would be important as far as possible to 
ensure that Mr Thabethe is given an opportunity to get legal 
representation because he played quite a significant role in the whole 
project that we are talking about and so that if at all possible there can 
be no concerns that because there – he did not have legal 
representation there may have been unfairness.  But I think if at all 
10 
possible it would be better to adjourn the – his further evidence to a 
specific date so that if he is looking for a lawyer he looks for a lawyer 
who is available on that date.  He does not look for lawyer who will 
accept to help him but then come here and apply for a postponement 
and say he is not available.  You know.  So I do not know if you have 
got some dates.  There is a week where we were trying to put in some 
implicated persons in the program.  I cannot remember what week it is. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman may I – with your leave interrupt 
you and ask that we take a very short adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Pull up the schedule that you have signed 
off on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Find particular dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 9 of 12 
 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then reconvene as soon as we have 
looked at the schedule with you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then set this matter down for those two 
days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Also what you can do is speak to 
Ms Sello. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she was part of the meeting that I had with 
Mr Pretorius last week when we were looking at that week that for 
10 
which we needed to find witnesses.  So it could be that we could look 
at a date or two days during that particular week.  So maybe let me 
adjourn for a short period and then you get the program and then speak 
to Ms Sello if possible because she would know what the latest is and 
then – and then you let me know then we will resume and then I will fix 
a date. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As you please Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You understand that Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
MEETING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Gcabashe. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you DCJ 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 10 of 12 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  DCJ we have consulted as you requested 
us to.  The 3 r d and 4 t h of October this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are the dates that both Mr Thabethe and 
the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are agreeable to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you think that those are dates that you 
10 
would like to hear Mr – the rest of Mr Thabethe’s evidence on? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. Do you confirm that you will be available 
for those dates Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I confirm Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So as you look for a lawyer then do remember 
that you must get one who would be available on those dates so that 
you do not get one who will come and apply for a postponement 
because they say they are not available on those dates. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I understand Chair I will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I will therefore postpone the hearing of your 
20 
further evidence to the 3 r d of – 3 r d and 4 t h of October this year.  So you 
must please come back and – so that we can finish with your evidence. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is appreciated Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  I am going to adjourn the 
proceedings for the day because we are not in a position to continue 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 11 of 12 
 
with Mr Thabethe’s evidence.  Tomorrow and for I think the rest of the 
week we will hear a witness or witnesses relating to crime intelligence.  
I am not announcing the name of the witness for tomorrow because I 
am – I have not been able to double check that announcing it would not 
be problematic but that is what we will be dealing with in the next few 
days.  We adjourn. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman if I might make a small … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are back with you on Friday and 
Saturday possibly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it will be three days? 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is three days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes on Friday it will be Estina. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then you are back with Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Estina.  And Saturday. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And Saturday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Saturday. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And Saturday Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so I think the crime intelligence will be Tuesday, 
Wednesday, and Thursday. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman. 
16 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 164 
 
Page 12 of 12 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Friday it will be Estina again and Saturday.  
We will sit on Saturday this time as well. 
MS LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If we do not finish we will Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  We adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
