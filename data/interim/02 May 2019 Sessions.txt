morning

ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Morning Major General Booysen.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We continue from where we left off?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTE MBER:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Before we do I understand that 
we have colleagues who are seated here who may wish to place 
themselves on record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry [not speaking into microphone]  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  We have legal representatives?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Who may wish to place 
themselves on record.

ADV YANGA LUDIDI:  My name is Yanga Ludidi from the office of the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 3 of 258 
 
state attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV YANGA LUDIDI: Yes I am here to represent Major General 
Mnonopi and Advocate Mtolo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV YANGA LUDIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  It is a – Mr Pretorius we – we need to 
reflect of what the implications are of the fact that the legal team of the 
commission is technically briefed by the state attorney as I understand 
it.  But the state attorney also represents some implicated persons.  I – 
10 
that had not occurred to me.  It just occurs now.  I do not know whether 
you have had a chance to think about it but we will  need to reflect on it.  
It may be – it may be that I should not be concerned but on the face of 
it it seems that it needs reflection.  Okay.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have noted what you have said 
DCJ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And I will discuss it with you 
later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And give it some thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As to how it can be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, that is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Any change in any system with 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 4 of 258 
 
the commission unfortunately takes time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And one would not want that to 
be disrupted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I understand that.  That is partly why I a m 
saying we need to reflect on it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But equally we need to reflect on what dangers it 
might pose. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now I understand that.  It is a 
concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because a… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will have to address it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because so to speak as I understand the position 
the state attorney becomes instructing attorneys to you people and an 
instructing attorney has access to certain things and in regard to 
counsel that they instruct and if they also instruct counsel who 
represents an implicated person what does that mean?  So we need to 
20 
reflect on that as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  No it is a valid point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will investigate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87

Page 6 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Chair there 
is one last quick matter and that is that an additional bundle is before 
you.  It is marked Exhibit ZG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes it has been handed to – it was handed to me 
in the past few days.  I understand that to be the full report of the 
Mokgoro Inquiry? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I beg leave that it forms part of 
the documents before you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  That will b e Exhibit ZG. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But we will not need it for today is it or will we?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  We will need it for today Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Alright thank you. 
ADVOCATE 
VERUSHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 
Based 
on 
the 
long 
adjournment… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page were we on the last time I thought I had 
20 
marked but it does not look like I did?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The witness was givin g 
evidence in relation to the Cato Manor investigator which begins at 
Exhibit bundle ZA page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Let me just check something before you 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 7 of 258 
 
proceed.  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Before we 
commence where we left off… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Major General Booysen have you got all the 
documents that we all have?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I think I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Before we – 
before we get to where we left off on the last occasion you will recall 
General Booysen that you gave evidence in relation to the Toshan 
10 
Panday case which was guided by the timeline in Slide 2.  Is there 
anything in particular that you wish to add in addition to th e evidence 
that you had given in relation to that matter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Indeed there is Chair.  
One thing that – that concerns me and it has been of a great concern to 
me over the last couple of years.  As we speak or the Colonel fro m the 
South African Police Service Colonel Navin Madhoe who had put just 
under R1.4 million in the boot of my car in an attempt to bribe me – he 
is still at work.  After that event I was arrested and suspended.  I will 
deal with that but the problem that I  have is that Colonel Navin Madhoe 
20 
is still sitting in the same position dealing with the same matters and it 
had been brought to my attention by a senior person from Finances that 
some of these irregular activities after my departure still continued.  
Now I cannot confirm so I – I have not been able to independently 
verify that but he did report that to me and it is a very senior person 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 8 of 258 
 
from Finances in KwaZulu Natal.  There are – there are two matters.  
The one is the R60 million corruption investigation and then the attempt 
to bribe me.  So what happened is Chair when he was arrested after 
they attempted to bribe me there was an attempt to have a disciplinary 
hearing on Colonel Navin Madhoe.  However he managed to obtain an 
interdict preventing the police  from continuing with that particular 
disciplinary hearing because they had followed the wrong procedures.  
But that interdict only pertains to the attempt to bribe me.  Nothing up 
until today in spite of myself making – bringing it to the attention of 
senior management at SAPS nothing, absolutely nothing has happened.  
10 
He is still in the same position, still doing the same work and that to me 
is of real concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to refresh one’s memory.  What was the year of 
the bribery case again?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it was in 2011, 
August 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So for about eight years or so no disciplinary – well 
from what you say there was an attempt to take disciplinary action and 
he obtained an interdict and after that as far as you know nothing 
happened? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Nothing happened 
Chair and over and above that while I was still in office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I received information 
and I canvassed this with the then he ad of the Hawks. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 9 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  A General Anwa 
Dramat. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I had information that 
I will be suspended on a specific date and that Colonel Navin Mad hoe 
had now been suspended for the attempt to bribe me would return on a 
certain date.  And those two dates I conveyed to General Dramat and lo 
and behold on the day that I was told that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  He would be…  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Madhoe had returned 
back to work – he returned back to office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He was temporarily 
removed to another office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But within a month or 
two he is placed back into his position and on the exact same date that 
the prediction was and those predictions came from none other than the 
main suspect in the investigation Toshan Panday.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He predicted the 
exact day on which Navin Madhoe would return back to office and the 
day that I would receive my suspension notice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 10 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair if I may?  I humbly 
apologise for the interruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  But should General Booysen 
perhaps be sworn in again or is it not necessary?  
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is the same oath continuous.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he had not finished his evidence.  It is 
different if he has finished and he comes back for cross -examination. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say you had raised the issue with the – in any 
event just to be on the safe side – in any event you confirm that you 
are still under oath that you had took previously and you will continue 
to give your evidence under the same oath?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I accept that I am still 
under oath Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes thank you.  Now in terms of the people at 
SAPS or people within whatever structure internally to whom you had 
reported this for purposes of any disciplinary action are you able to say 
this is to whom I addressed correspondence or spoke – this is who I 
20 
spoke to and these would be the people who would have taken 
decisions or is that something that you are not able at this stage to 
indicate? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair as recent as 
late last year. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 11 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I was phoned by a 
Colonel in KwaZulu Natal who was desperate to talk to someone and 
that was a Colonel Myburgh.  Colonel Myburgh had also reported 
corruption emanating from the office of Colonel Navin Madhoe.  There 
was a protracted investigation and the nett result of that investigation 
was that they were going to charge the whistle-blower, Colonel 
Myburgh.  So I flew to Durban and I had a conversation with the Acting 
Provincial Commissioner General Mkhwanazi and he stopped that 
process.  But during that discussion I did detail to him the fact that 
10 
Navin Madhoe had managed to obtain an interdict for a disciplinary 
hearing pertaining to the attempted bribery but that does not preclude 
them from continuing with the disciplinary hearing against him for the 
main charge the R60 million corruption and which is fully implicated.  
And that – the same applies to the captain that works with him Captain 
Narain Prasad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m, h’m.  And you do not know what happened 
ultimately with that interdict because an interdict will normally and I 
assume it was just a temporary interdict and you – from what you have 
said there was some procedural problem or something.   It – you do not 
20 
know whether it was discharged or fell away at some stage or whether 
it is still in existence?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair what typically 
happens in SAPS.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 12 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  If they want to get rid 
of you they follow the procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Or they attempt to 
follow the procedure.  And I am speculating now.  The way they treated 
the disciplinary hearing of Madhoe it was a paper exercise.  And 
obviously that being a paper exercise they would remand it and then 
they would stop it and eventually when they wanted to proceed with the 
matter just before I was going to give evidence he went to the labour 
court and applied for an interdict which was granted.  I think it was a 
10 
final order and because the police had procrastinated with the 
proceedings. And quite rightly so Chair I mean what is good for t he 
goose is good for the gander so I do not have a problem with that 
interdict.  The police did not follow the necessary – their own rules but 
the problem that I do have is in the other matters.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Absolutely nothing 
was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in any event it seems to me that certainly within 
SAPS or the Hawks somebody should look into that issue thoroughly 
20 
and see who – what the – why there seems to be nothing that has 
happened in regard to the other ma tters.  But also to look at the – at 
the one relating to the interdict because obviously I have no knowledge 
of the interdict that you talk about but courts would not lightly say 
somebody must not be disciplined at all when there seems to be 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 13 of 258 
 
evidence you know. They might say follow up with the right procedure if 
you want to discipline you know.  So somebody might need to look – 
look at that carefully.  Who would be the right person?  Would it be the 
head of the Hawks? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
To 
ultimately 
who 
would 
have 
the 
ultimate 
responsibility to check these things and see if somebody is not doing 
their job. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it would be the 
provincial head for support services in KwaZulu Natal.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which I recall is Major 
General Ngembe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they would all fall under the head of the national 
head of the Hawks or not?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair because 
Madhoe does not work … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he is with… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He is not with the 
Hawks. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he is with… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He is with the as they 
say SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SAPS – with SAPS ja.  But ultimately the n ational 
commissioner of SAPS would be able to talk to whoever at provincial 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 14 of 258 
 
level that needs to investigate and see what is happening.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  If it is brought to his 
attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is brought to his attention.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do not – Chair I do 
not think the current national commissioner is aware but…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
Provincial 
management in KwaZulu Natal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Is blissfully aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And the fact that he is 
still in the same post they did not even think it prudent…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  To at least put him in 
a different department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Where there can be 
no attempts to commit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I think the legal team should while we are 
busy with the investigation maybe through the acting secretary ju st 
bring the matter to the attention of the national commissioner of SAPS 
to say that Major General Booysen raised this concern about a matter 
that he is giving evidence about for the national commissioner to look 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 15 of 258 
 
into it and – and see whether there is not something that is happened 
that should not be happening.  And I sure he would let the commission 
know what was found out.  Thank you Major General Booysen.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For raising the issue.  Thank y ou. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry if we could then resume 
where we left off and that is then on page 23 of Exhibit ZA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just check Ms September you have a soft voice 
let me check if they can hear you at the back?  Are you able to hear Ms 
September at the back?  They say I think they wish you to raise your 
10 
voice a bit. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I will speak a little louder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that case let us resume at 
page 23 of Exhibit ZA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen following the 
evidence that you gave in relation to the Toshan Panday investigation 
you then addressed two additional investigations one which you have 
termed to be the Amigos  Investigation and the other which was the 
20 
looting of the secret service account.   You then turned to the Cato 
Manor investigation and when last this matter was heard you had 
sketched a factual background in relation to the investigation.  To this 
end can I ask you to turn to Exhibit ZG which is the new bundle that 
has been placed before the commission?  So from your main affidavit at 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 16 of 258 
 
page 23 you deal with the Cato Manor investigation very briefly and 
that is but in two paragraphs which is at page 75 and 76.  Since our 
last hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraphs 75 and 76 hey?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said page?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Oops.  Paragraph  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry paragraph 75 and 76. 
CHAIRPERSON:  75 and 76. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  On page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Since the last hearing a report 
has been publicised which relates to the inquiry in terms of Section 
12(6) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act and the unabridged 
version of that report is contained as Exhibit ZG.  This particular report 
relates to the commission which was chaired by Justice Mokgoro.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is called Inquiry. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think it is a commission.  
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is an inquiry in terms of the National Prosecuting 
Authority Act. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A commission will be a commission under the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 17 of 258 
 
Commissions Act of 1947. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Apologies for my error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  This report – this report related 
to the inquiry which was chaired by Justice Mokgoro.  For ease of 
reference we will refer to the report as The Mokgoro Report.  Have you 
considered this report General Booysen?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I have perused 
it more specifically in the passages that deals with the Booysen matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it is correct that you gave 
evidence at this inquiry?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Indeed Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just to clarify the context of 
this particular report if I ask you to tu rn to page 14.  At paragraph 12 it 
reads – at paragraph 12 it reads: 
“That the scope of the terms of reference was to look 
into the fitness and propriety of both Jiba being 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba and Mrwebi being Advocate 
Lawrence Mrwebi to hold office in their respective 
20 
capacities.  In relation to Jiba and at the panels’ 
discretion the inquiry was to consider evidence 
arising from the cases referred to in the terms of 
reference.” 
It is correct that the matter which is referred to in this report as the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 18 of 258 
 
Booysen Evidence is the evidence relating to the racketeering charges 
related to the Cato Manor investigation, is that…?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is so Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Chair while we 
place this entire report before you and tender it as evidence we will not 
deal with or detract from the particularity or detail in the report but 
simply highlight certain evidence relevant to this witness so this 
witness can then augment some evidence that was not necessarily 
placed before the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you place it before me as nothing more than 
10 
simply a report of the Mokgoro Inquiry is it not?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You place it for no other purpose other than that it is 
a report of that inquiry?  What we make of it is another matter.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  To the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is my understanding. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just pointing that out because you said you 
20 
put – place it before me as evidence.  So I think that might cause 
confusion.  I think you place it before me for what it is a report of the 
Mokgoro Inquiry. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If you place it for any purpose you can come 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 19 of 258 
 
back and tell me what that other purpose is.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Then let me ask General 
Booysen in considering the parts of this r eport which relates to you do 
you have any comment on the accuracy of the evidence as it is 
recorded in here which you gave at the inquiry?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair with regards to 
where my name appear in this report it correlates with th e evidence 
that I gave at the Mokgoro Inquiry.  The Justice Mokgoro Inquiry.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that it might summarise or it might 
purport to summarise the evidence that you gave  at that inquiry as far 
as you are concerned it correctly does so.  It correctly summarises your 
evidence? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is my case Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And accordingly Chair to  that 
20 
extent we do not intend to lead all this evidence again.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  But rather just augment certain 
aspects of it to the extent necessary.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have not – I have not read the report.  I paged 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 20 of 258 
 
through.  From where to where does the report deal with the issue that 
Major General Booysen refers to?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes I will take – I will take us 
through the relevant excerpts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  With your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well if you first tell me where I find it?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem.  The first 
reference of the pertinent case relating to General Booysen is at page 
58.  It is in fact a synopsis of the case of Booysen versus Acting 
10 
National Director of Public Prosecutions and others 2014 2ALL 
SA319KZD which was delivered on the 26 February 2014 by Justice 
Gorven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this not a summary of the judgment as Justice 
Mokgoro and her [indistinct] understood the judgment?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Correct Chair.  That very 
judgment appears…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that does not need Major General Booysen’s 
confirmation as correct?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Not at all.  I am just pointing it 
20 
out that that is one of the aspects . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In fact… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to be able – I want you to identify the part of 
the report which Major General Booysen has talked about as a correct 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 21 of 258 
 
summary of the evidence he gave at that inquiry.  That is w hat I want 
you to identify? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair.  If we go to 
page 97 of the same Exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  That deals particularly with the 
Booysen case.  It relates to pages 97 to 143 which start s at paragraph 
295 to 453.  In particular to General Booysen’s evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I see at page 106 where it says Booysen’s version is 
that the one? 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You talk about? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As Booysen’s evidence?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you are talking about?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which part?  Is it this part that you and he are 
talking about when you say is a correct summary of his evidence before 
that inquiry?  It is important to identify that part.  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair perhaps I can 
assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am referring from 
page 96 to page 143. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 22 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  96 to page 143? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the same that you have in mind when you 
asked him that question?  Is that the same?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Not particularly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not particularly but that is what he is talking about 
that we know now?  Which one are you talking about when you were 
talking him the question?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen is indeed 
correct to the extent that evidence relatin g to his matter is contained in 
10 
– from page – hello. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I do not know what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the –  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Hello. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might have to take or are we back?  Ja  it looks like 
we are back.  Okay just continue or – there is goes again.  Okay it 
looks like we are back.  Okay pages 96 to – just repeat Major General 
Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it is 96 to 143 
20 
but in addition to that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There are also 
sections …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the report. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 23 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In the latter part of 
the report by – at the findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which I highlighted 
and which I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you go along with? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we – they fall outside of the pages you have just 
mentioned? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to mention where they are if you do 
know?  But if you do not know she will help us later on.  I thought you 
might have it at hand. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair unfortunately it 
is on my phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because I numbered 
them on my phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay later on that can be done.  
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I could perhaps just clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  From 96 to 143 it is a consolidation 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 24 of 258 
 
of all the evidence in relation to the Booysen matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To the extent that it consolidates the 
evidence.  There are parts of Booysen’s evidence which is  included at 
different intervals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There is also a dedicated section.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is at the page Chair directed 
us to which is page 106. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is specifically to his version.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So my understanding is that when 
General Booysen considered these paragraphs – and I am happy for 
him to confirm this to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  He agrees that where any evidence 
that he placed before the enquiry.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is recorded in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the bigger context of the evidence 
as consolidated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 25 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That evidence is in fact accurate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is accurate? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reflected? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Major General that is what you say that to the 
extent that the report refers to evidence that you gave in the Mokgoro 
Inquiry.  It reflects your evidence correctly?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I confirm that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Then later on you can identify 
10 
maybe prepare a piece of paper that identifies where one can find all of 
those parts. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance can we then start off 
at page 96?  It is correct that the purpose of the evidenc e in relation to 
the or rather paragraph 94 records that this particular section which 
deals with your matter hones in on new aspects of the Booysen matter.  
If I may refer to it as such and deals with the issue of racketeering 
authorisations.  The purpose  of evidence is not to evaluate or 
20 
determine the guilt or innocence of Booysen in relation to the criminal 
charges you are currently facing but rather to consider with reference 
to the terms of reference vis-à-vis the lawfulness of the decision taken 
by Jiba to authorise the prosecution of Booysen for racketeering?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I confirm that Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 26 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  In other words all facts that 
are then contained in here augment paragraphs 75 and 76 of your 
affidavit on page 23? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  (No audible reply). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then look at page 97. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did you not want him to confirm that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I confirm that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 97 paragraph 296 it is 
recorded that the evidence before the inquiry.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well since we are dealing with two exhibits at  the 
same time just repeat that you are now – you are referring to EXHIBIT 
ZG. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that there is no confusion as to which one of the 
two exhibits we are dealing with now.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  EXHIBIT ZG page 97 
paragraph 296.  It is stated that:  
20 
“The evidence before the inquiry relates to the 
following and it is fourfold.  The first is the 
authorisation by Jiba to charge Booysen with 
racketeering.  The second is the lawfulness and 
proprietary of Jiba’s conduct in ordering that the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 27 of 258 
 
prosecution of Booysen and others in the Cato 
Manor Unit be done by a team of prosecutors from 
outside KZN.  The third is the involvement or lack 
thereof of Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa together 
with the instructions to him ostensibly either at the 
behest of Jiba or at the very least with the 
knowledge and consent to sign an indictment in the 
absence 
of 
supporting 
evidence 
and 
lastly 
Mlotshwa’s 
removal 
as 
Acting 
DPP 
and 
the 
appointment of Advocate  Moipone Noko in his stead 
10 
is dealt with.” 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I confirm that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  From page 98 of the same exhibit at 
Clause 5.2.1.2 the powers of the DPP to prosecute outside of their 
jurisdiction is addressed in particular from paragraphs 297 to paragraph 
303 on page 102. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am confused.  You are referring to page 
98 of EXHIBIT ZG? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The best part of that page consists of a quotation 
from Section 179 of the Constitution.  Is it not?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you are referring to?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 28 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or have I missed something?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  My submission is that the recordal in 
relation to the considerations of the DPP to prosecute outside of their 
jurisdiction which General Booysen need not comment on is dealt with 
in paragraphs 297. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To 303. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The offence – we are now on page 
102 – which deals specifically with the offence of racketeering and the 
10 
judgment of Gorven J, okay and so to just for the record the offence of 
racketeering is dealt with only in two paragraphs which is 3 04 and 305.  
When one then looks to page 103 if I can take you to Clause 5.2.1.4 it 
talks about the process of evaluation of racketeering charges within the 
NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the paragraph of the report 5.2.1.4?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is the – it appears to be a sub 
section – a sub section.  Just above paragraph 306.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen you have given 
20 
evidence that you have extensive knowledge in relation to racketeering 
and process.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you have any comments in 
relation to the process of evaluating racketeering charges within the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 29 of 258 
 
NPA based on your experience in the service?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I have – I have 
read this passage from the inquiry.  I can confirm that the evidence that 
that was led at the inquiry - not by myself.  It was a statement by 
Advocate Mamabolo.  I confirm the procedure that he describes in his 
affidavit.  In my experience I was surprised to see that this procedure 
was not followed in – in the Booysen matter.  As head of the Hawks in 
KZN the procedure – and I am going to try and use an analogy of a 
narcotics investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
investigators 
would start a project on narcotics.  Once it starts to look that it could – 
there could be a possible case of racketeering – I just want to add that 
in each province we had advocates which we call organise cr ime 
advocates who work with the Hawks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  This advocate and the 
investigators would then at regular meetings that we have in terms of 
progress in projects would then allude to the fact that this might be a 
case for racketeering. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That advocate will 
then basically give instructions to the investigator.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  As to what evidence is 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 30 of 258 
 
required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Guide the investigators? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Once 
they 
are 
satisfied from my office we will then contact the National Office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At the National Office 
previously I would – I actually dealt with Advocate  Mamabolo and 
Advocate Johan Kruger.  They were dealing with the desk where 
10 
through these racketeering cases had to go before it is presented to 
the NDPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For authorisation in 
terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my experience and 
the Savoi or the Amigos case is a case in point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Where 
the 
20 
investigators were sent back several times to – from National to – to 
obtain more and relevant evidence to – to establish the enterprise 
number one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And number two to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 31 of 258 
 
link the individuals to the enterprise.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Individually 
– 
individually and collectively. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So – and it is true 
what Mamabolo says - Advocate Mamabolo says in his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He says normally that 
procedure would take 14 days. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if you look at 
the correspondence the application t o prosecute myself and Cato Manor 
for racketeering I think landed on the desk of Advocate – I think is 
Anthony Mosing at the time and within a day I think it landed on his 
desk on the 15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And on the 17 t h the 
racketeering charges were authorised.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was an unusually short period that was taken?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 32 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is in fact confirmed on page 
105 paragraph 320 which reads that the process which is preceded in 
paragraphs 313 to 319 was not followed in the Booysen ma tter and no 
explanation has been provide as to why the accepted process was not 
followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Have you since the time that instruction was 
issued have you ever been told or given an explanation why in your 
case this took such a short time ei ther through your own inquiries or 
through your lawyer’s inquiring or through any affidavits that may have 
10 
been filed at some stage in court?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have never – you have never been given any 
explanation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
might 
have 
mentioned it in my founding affidavit Chair or in any of my 
supplementary affidavits in the review application.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I cannot recall 
specifically asking why was. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My matter dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So quickly within a 
space of one day as opposed to. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 33 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Other cases that I 
personally dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  With my investigators.  
That normally took longer than two weeks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocate Mamabolo 
says 14 days.  In some instance it actually took much longer than that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
have 
never 
pertinently asked the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I have never 
given – well obviously never got an answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say you did pertinently ask the question?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No, I did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you did not, ja but you say you are not sure you 
may or may not have raised the issue in – in some affidavit? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I suspect I might 
20 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Raised it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Over the last six 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 34 of 258 
 
years I made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Many affidavits? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Six 
founding 
affidavits, replying affidavits and supplementary affidavits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I might have 
mentioned it.  So (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it would be – it may be important to establish 
whether in any of the court applications that you made you raise the 
issue as part of challenging whatever you were challenging and to see 
10 
whether it was dealt with in response and if so by whom and how.  So 
that might be important to establish.  So maybe if you still have access 
to all your affidavits it might help to just check.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I will check.  I do 
have all the affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  If we can then turn 
to page 106 and at sub paragraph 5.2.1.5 which is titled “Booysen’s 
20 
Version” that is in fact the version that you tendered before the inquiry.  
Is that so? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and in particular at page – 
same page of 106 paragraph 232 - sorry 323 – the last line reads that: 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 35 of 258 
 
“Maema is a DPP based in the North West Province 
and who was appointed to the Booysen Matter by 
Jiba.” 
Paragraph 324 reads: 
“That at the time he was charged according to both 
Booysen and Padayachee he was working on a 
particularly sensitive and high profile case namely 
the Toshan Panday investigation and this case 
involved 
a 
multimillion 
Rand 
corruption 
investigation 
against 
wealthy 
businessman 
10 
Toshan Panday.  He is alleged to have had business 
links to direct family members of Zuma presumably 
former President Jacob Zuma.” 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  325 first sentence says: 
“The case also concerned procurement regularities 
within the South African Police Services.”  
And 326 confirms: 
“That the charges against both Madhoe and Panday 
were subsequently provisionally withdrawn.”  
20 
At paragraph 327 mention is made of an article that appeared in the 
Sunday Times which stated that: 
“Cato Manor SVC Section was a “death squad”.  
The article also accused Booysen of being complicit 
in the alleged actions.”  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 36 of 258 
 
Do you have any comments in relation t o this particular article that 
appeared in the Sunday Times and the context within which that - that 
occurred? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair basically what 
happened is photographs were used by the Sunday Times and the two 
journalists 
responsible 
for 
that 
were 
Stephan  Hofstatter 
and 
Mzilikazi wa Afrika.  Now Chair would recall when I testified when 
Colonel Madhoe attempted to bribe me when I met him the first time.  
He showed me certain photographs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I do not think it is 
any 
coincidence 
that 
those 
very 
same 
photographs 
were 
the 
photographs that eventually appeared in the Sunday Times.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On what basis do you draw the 
conclusion that it was no t a coincidence? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair it is – it 
stands to reason.  I saw the photographs well not all of them.  There 
was a whole file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On the – on the laptop 
that Navin Madhoe showed me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I also had a 
discussion with Mr Stephan Hofstatter in my office. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 37 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Before they published 
the article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I still took issue 
with him and I said to him look the photographs that you guys have not 
all those people were shot by Cato Manor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
the 
one 
– 
probably the most gruesome picture was the one of – I think – four or 
10 
five people deceased on the back of a bakkie.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Where Cato Manor 
had not been involved.  They actually tendered to – to the scene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I – I found it very 
suspicious that the very same photographs that were used.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To put pressure on me 
now all of a sudden appear in the Sunday Times.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the reason why I 
am saying that is it - it later became evident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That it was indeed a 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 38 of 258 
 
member from Crime Intelligence that colluded with the Sunday Times.  
There were also intercepted communications between Panday – 
Toshan Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
Mzilikazi wa Afrika. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Where 
certain 
photographs and CD discs were promised which obviously I – which I 
was privy to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it was clear to me 
Chair and there was also a statement and I cannot recall the name of 
the person who actually stole the photos.  Chair these photographs 
were actually photographs at Cato Manor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
On 
the 
computer 
system which they logged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Those photographs 
20 
came from – from the dockets – the case dockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the reason why 
those photographs were kept is the number of instances where – where 
robberies had been committed and incidentally we had one last night 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 39 of 258 
 
where a person shot a police Colonel about  three months ago in Durban 
and this very same person was shot and killed last night in 
Johannesburg during a robbery case.  So that is one of the reasons 
why they keep those – those albums. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To identify suspects 
who had been – who had become deceased. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who were involved in 
other cases. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is a statement 
in one of the dockets where the person w ho stole these photographs – 
it was done so at the behest of Colonel Madhoe with the involvement of 
another Colonel Rajen Aiyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So the only escapable 
conclusion one could come to is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Those photographs 
20 
were shown to me on the computer to put pressure on me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is evidence that 
they were stolen for a particular purpose and the next moment.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 40 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They appear in the 
Sunday Times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So that is why I come 
to that conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but just to go back to your evidence earlier in 
regard to those photographs, When Colonel  Madhoe showed them to 
you is my understanding correct that you never asked him why are you 
showing me these photographs?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I asked him 
10 
what it was all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja (intervenes). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because it did not 
make sense to me.  He showed me photographs which I could probably 
give – given him thousands of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then he just said 
to me no, no he can get some more of these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he did not – he did not answer what was the point 
of him showing you these photographs?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well I did Chair.  I 
said to him well what is this all about.  These are normal police  
photographs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is at that point 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 41 of 258 
 
where he closed the laptop and he said no he can get more of these 
photographs.  I said to him well get more.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying is from what you are saying 
it seems to me that he did not give you an answer to your question. My 
understanding is that your question was – I am paraphrasing.  What is 
the point of showing these photographs?  Is my understanding correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He did not give me an 
explanation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that was in effect the question you put to him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he did not give you an answer to that question?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  So just to confirm 
the conclusion of coincidence that you draw is your conclusion?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is my conclusion 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To continue on page 107 of EXHIBIT 
ZG paragraph 328 it is recorded that:  
“Booysen was then suspended from duty.  He 
20 
successfully challenged his suspension in the 
Labour Court on two occasions.”  
Next. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When – I am sorry.  You went to court a number of 
times I think you said.  Is that right?  In regard to your suspensions and 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 42 of 258 
 
criminal charges against you.  Is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if I include the 
disciplinary hearing and the SCA matter that was aband oned by SAPS I 
think it is probably about seven or eight times but to court - to High 
Court and Labour Court I think six or seven times.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That must have been quite expensive in terms 
of lawyers? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Very expensive Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To then quickly deal with your 
10 
suspensions.  When were you first suspended General  Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair just after the 
Sunday Times article appeared in December 2011.  Officially we had 
the Christmas period then nothing happened during December.  Then 
early and I think it was early February I received a notice of intention 
to suspend me and I had to advance reasons why I should not be 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was what year now – February what year? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  2012 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and at that – at that stage who – the notice 
20 
would have come from whom – a provincially person? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No that came from 
national Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it have been the National Commissioner of 
Police? 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 43 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At that time no.  It 
was from General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright.  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
Chair 
early/mid-February I received this notice of intention to suspend but the 
notice was very vague.  So I wrote to SAPS and I said look I need more 
information to make a meaningful representation.  I cannot make a 
representation if I do not know why I am suspended and I received a 
letter back from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After – after – well I think if somebody is considering 
10 
suspending anybody they are the ones who must give the basis first.  
Why are they thinking of that in the first p lace? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSL BOOYSEN:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – then you can address those issues rather 
than simply saying you must say why you should not be suspended 
without saying why they are thinking of suspending you in the first 
place. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is indeed the 
case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should apply to everybody. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
Chair 
their 
response was very curt saying that well there is enough information at 
my disposal and they are proceeding with the matter.  So I went to the 
Labour Court and applied for an interdict because of the paucity of the 
information in the – in the notice.  The – well the police did appoint 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 44 of 258 
 
Counsel but by consent the order was granted and the orde r said that 
the police cannot suspend me unless and there was a list of questions 
that they had to answer.  I never received those answers.  There was a 
very amateurish attempt a couple of – a couple of the – I think seven or 
eight questions were answered but in no particular sequence and I 
wrote back to them and I said to them look this is unacceptable.  You 
still have not complied with the court order and I think it was about 
three weeks later I was called in and given a notice that I am now 
suspended and I still said to the General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without answers to those questions?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Without any answers 
to those questions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I still said to the 
General – he handed me the suspension – suspension notice.  I said 
well there is an interdict and she just shrugged her shoulders and I – I 
phoned my attorney right there and then and I proceeded to his office 
and we worked throughout the night to apply for an – for an urgent 
court order to set aside the suspension – to declare it unlawful Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you proceed just to make sure one gets – 
20 
understands who the players or the actors were in this context now.  
You said the notice to – the notice giving – asking you to make 
representations why you should not be suspended came from 
General Dramat? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 45 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it him also who made the decision that you 
should be suspended – the suspension that you are now talking about 
which you and your team were looking at challenging?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair in my view de 
facto it was him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No de juro it was him 
but de facto it was someo ne else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure you will explain how that came about.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Probably later on in 
my. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In due course.  That is fine, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Because 
I 
firmly 
believe that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  General Dramat was 
20 
under pressure from the then Minister Nathi Mthethwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The Minister of Police 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 46 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And also later on I 
will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Explain that later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair just to recap 
I obtained an interdict. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Against SAPS not to 
suspend me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Unless they provide 
me with the necessary information that I require to make a meaningful 
representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They do not supply all 
of the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  We correspond to and 
fro and we tell them we are not happy with response.  The next moment 
20 
they suspend me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I immediately went 
back to court and I applied for the suspension to be declared unlawful 
and to be set aside. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 47 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I recall it was a public 
holiday the following day and the – the Judge still said look this is a 
public holiday.  It is not going to impact on the applicant – myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that he is giving 
SAPS until 3 o’ clock that following afternoon to tell him why he should 
not grant the order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And 3 o’ clock the 
10 
following afternoon I received a call from my attorney wherein SAPS 
requested me to withdraw my application.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And they will withdraw 
the – the suspension which I declined.  I said no I would like to see 
them in court and you can make  – we will make it an order of the court.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean that did not make sense.  I mean you went to 
court because they – they suspended you.  If they wanted your 
application not to proceed they should – they would just have to 
withdraw the suspension.  Not the other way round. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair not much of 
what they did at the time made sense.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I insisted that I 
wanted to go to court. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 48 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And have it declared 
unlawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And we went to court 
the following day and my suspension was set aside and the contempt 
proceedings against SAPS was remanded sine die. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – so there were contempt proceedings that 
you had brought in the meantime as well?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well I had brought 
10 
them simultaneous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Simultaneously with your application to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and that – the basis of the contempt 
proceedings was that the suspension was in breach of the first court 
order which had said before they could suspend you they had to answer 
those – certain questions and you were s aying they were in breach of 
that court order because they suspended you without complying with 
that requirement? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is indeed the 
20 
case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  What then 
happened during September  2012? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair then I went 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 49 of 258 
 
back to work and ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we proceed, what happened to the 
contempt proceedings because at some stage some finality would have  
been required? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair they were 
remanded sine die, I did not pursue that for the simple reason I was 
bogged down with litigation and it was basically a fight for survival so I 
never pursued that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes, but from your own understanding would that 
mean that it may still be pending, or was it withdrawn formally or do 
10 
you have any recollection?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair at one stage I 
did canvas this with my attorney, Mr van der Merwe, an d – but that was 
much later when I had more time and he said to me look Johan I don’t 
think it’s going to be appropriate at such a late stage to pursue this so 
I just left it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so you don’t know whether it was formally 
withdrawn but you effectively abandoned it. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I abandoned it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you.  General Booysen what 
then happened during September of 2012?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair then – sorry 
which month? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   During September of 2012. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 50 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Chair 
after 
my 
suspension was set aside I went back to work and continued with the 
investigations and then in September 2012 I was a rrested.  I was 
detained for one night, went to Court the following day, released on 
bail, bail was not opposed and I went back to work and then about a 
week or two later I was suspended again and this time Chair I thought it 
would be a futile exercise to now again try and set aside the 
suspension because that suspension went hand in hand with me being 
arrested for a criminal offence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And did that suspension result in a 
10 
disciplinary hearing being convened?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair no in terms of 
the police regulations once you are suspended the disciplinary hearing 
should commence within 60 days, so there was no disciplinary hearing, 
what in fact happened is when I – in the meantime I had taken the Jiba 
authorisation on review and then after Judge Gorvan ruled in my favour 
I said I am going back to work now and then that following week, it was 
during the evening I was served with papers and that was – I still recall 
I think it was 600 days later instead of 60 days  later.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 600 instead of 60 days?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct yes so 
what kept me out of office was the criminal charges hanging over my 
head.  When the Court ruled in my favour and the charges were 
withdrawn by the State often I could go back to work and then 
belatedly, 600 days later, 600 odd days later I was served with papers 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 51 of 258 
 
for a disciplinary hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be – 600 days will be more or less two 
years. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Two years later 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was there ever an explanation why this was 
being done so late in breach of the 60 day requirement?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair when the 
hearing started we raised the point in limine objecting to the procedure 
being followed.  The Chairperson overruled us and then I said to my 
10 
attorney let’s just place it on record, if the finding eventually is adverse 
to me then at least we can take it on review, we have placed it on 
record.  Fortunately it tur ned out that I was exonerated during that 
disciplinary hearing which lasted six months.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And who chaired that disciplinary 
hearing? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
It 
was 
senior 
counsel, Advocate Naseer Cassiem. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   To that end can I then take you to 
bundle ZB?  That’s page 442, or rather 443, sorry.  This document is 
20 
marked as findings.  If I can ask you to then turn to page 470, is it 
correct that the conclusion of Advocate Naseer Cassiem SC was:  
”that 
the 
employer 
has 
not 
discharged 
the 
onus 
of 
demonstrating wrongdoing on the part of the employee, Major 
General Johan Wessel Booysen,”  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 52 of 258 
 
And at paragraph 77: 
”In my view it would be unjust not to forthwith reinstate 
Booysen to his position as Provincial He ad of Priority Crime 
Investigation in KwaZulu Natal so that he can do what he is 
best suited to do, that is fight crime.”  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That was the finding 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   While we are dealing with this 
particular finding I ask you to turn to page 44, sorry paragraph 44 
which is at page 457 of the same bundle.  At paragraph 44 the findings 
10 
of Advocate Naseer Cassiem, SC reads:  
“That I found Colonel Aiyer to be a dismal witness in material 
respects.  He is obsessed by the notion of his own importance 
and his entire testimony was permeated by his political 
acceptability and self-importance.  I find him not to be the kind 
of professional policeman one would expect holding the rank 
he holds.  His tenure of evidence as I  have indicated above is 
one in which he emphasizes his own importance but lacking in 
conduct justifying his usefulness.  I think those in charge of 
the 
SAPS 
ought 
to 
carefully 
consider 
Colonel Aiyer’s 
20 
continuous role in the Police Force.  In his quest for  
acceptance and self importance he is determined to tarnish 
Booysen’s reputation and dignity irrespective of the cost to the 
overall interest of the police force.  If in fact the employer 
party actually believed that it could establish a case against 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 53 of 258 
 
the employee based on the evidence of Colonel Aiyer this was 
a serious error of judgment and worse still a strong indication 
that the employer sought to create a case where one did not 
exist.” 
Who exactly was Colonel Aiyer in the context of the racketeering 
process that was instituted against you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Colonel he – sorry 
Chair he is the key witness in the racketeering case.  I am being 
charged under (e) and (f) of POCA and (f) being that I managed the 
enterprise.  So whereas he w as the actual unit commander at the time 
10 
he now becomes a witness against me, I don’t know how he can be a 
witness, he should have been a 204 witness, but he is now the key 
witness against myself and some of the Cato Manor members in that we 
managed a criminal enterprise.  His statements were ventilated in the 
matter, the review matter which I brought in front of Judge Gorvan and 
my contention at the time was that the statement that he had made at 
the time, well he made three Chair and all three are very in coherent to 
say the least.  It related to office politics, there was no indication of 
any offence being committed whatsoever and my assertion was 
confirmed by Judge Gorvan that it only relates to office politics and 
20 
much later when Advocate Abrahams became  the NDPP he procured a 
legal opinion from two of his advocates, one being a senior advocate, 
Advocate Jan Ferreira and Advocate Van Eeden in which they had to – 
well they had to give him a legal opinion as to why they should proceed 
with criminal charges against Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba for – in my 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 54 of 258 
 
matter, and in that particular legal opinion which I managed to obtain 
because it became part of court papers in another application by one of 
these non-governmental organisations, in that particular legal opinion  
both those advocates from the National Prosecuting Authority actually 
confirms, or they don’t confirm they agree with what Judge Gorvan have 
said, and what I have said confirmed by Judge Gorvan that it only 
relates to office politics and it’s this very sa me Colonel Aiyer that 
Advocate Sean Abrahams is still relying on because he much later and I 
will testify about that later, in spite of the court order he authorised my 
prosecution but he still remains the key witness for the State.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So charges have been reinstituted 
against you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That is indeed the 
case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is from when, when did that happen?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Chair 
it 
was 
reinstated I think February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So Advocate Naseer Cassiem’s 
findings which is dated the 16 t h of September 2014 is released, do you 
20 
return to work? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I have now 
been exonerated by Advocate Cassiem in a disciplinary hearing, the 
Court had found that there was no case against me, and fortunately for 
myself the Constitutional Court then at that time with the Glynnister 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 55 of 258 
 
matter said that myself would now report to the National Head a nd the 
National Head to the Minister, whereas in the previous era am I to 
report to both the Provincial Commissioner and to the National Head, 
and the National Head of the Hawks also had to report to the National 
Commissioner, so that was all taken out of the equation, so I decided, I 
phoned General Dramat and I said look I am going back to work now, 
and he agreed with me.  I then received a phone call from General 
Dramat that I need to come to Pretoria where I had to meet with him 
and the then National Commissioner Riah Phiyega.  General Phiyega 
called me to her office, myself and Dramat and she gave me three 
10 
options, she said to me either you must remain at home on special 
leave or you should take a transfer or if you take a Section 35, Section 
35 is a golden handshake, I still had three years left in the police 
service so she was prepared to pay me out for three years and then I 
said to her well ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  If that happened, if that happened, if you had gone 
for that route ,that option , what it would have meant is that one, the 
country would have paid you for three years for staying at home when 
you could have been working, that’s one, is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s actually 
20 
worse than that because at that stage I had already been sitting at 
home for two years, so another three, so the State would have had to 
pay me, and despite what a lot of people say the police generals get a 
generous salary, the taxpayer would have to pay myself sitting at home 
for five years. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 56 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, but also in relation to the three years if you 
had taken that route they would have had to appoint somebody else in 
your position and paid that person for that three years, so during that 
three years they would have been paying two people for the same job.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s indeed the 
case Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So but that’s one of the options she offered you.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s what she 
offered me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair so I told her, at 
that stage she told me she’s taking Advocate Cassiem on review so I 
said to her well you need to file a record for me to oppose it, which up 
until today she hadn’t done, but then she  said to me she is going to 
give me a month to think about it, a month later I went back and she 
called me into her office once again and this time around she already 
had the Brigadier from Finance Services there with the documentation 
for me to sign, so I said to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  To sign for what now? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   Either the transfer or 
20 
the Section 25, the golden handshake.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair she asked 
me so what did you decide so I said to her option number one is not an 
option, I am not going to stay at home any longer, I have been sitting at 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 57 of 258 
 
home for two years already and then she said to me option number two, 
I said I am not going to take a transfer, then she said to me so I give 
you a lawful instruction to transfer you you’re going to – you’re not 
going to comply with my instruction.  I said no that’s not what I’m 
saying, so she what are you saying I said well if you transfer me I will 
take the matter to court.  Sh e said why, I said because you cannot 
transfer me.  Then she said to me well who can transfer you.  I said 
General Dramat can transfer me in terms of the Glynnister judgment.  
Then she asked General Dramat what do you say General, and then he 
said to her no he agrees with me, at which point she – well then the 
10 
whole tide changed, then she started arguing with him, and then when 
it got to the point of the Section 35, the Golden Handshake, then she 
said to me what about that option, I said no I am not going t o take that 
either, and then she said to me why not, I said well I’m still reasonably 
fit and young and I think I can still make a contribution to fight crime in 
KZN and at that time the cash in transit heists and the political killings 
had spiralled out of control and I said to her crime is out of control in 
KZN, she said how can you say that.  I said well your own Divisional 
Commissioner as recent as last week made a statement in the Daily 
News newspapers that he needs to send task teams to KZN to deal wi th 
20 
these crime matters, and then she said to me before I excuse you is 
there anything else you would like to say, so I said no there is 
something I would like to say, I got up and I said I will be back in my 
office tomorrow and then I walked out and then I  had to wait for 
General Dramat and I could hear through the walls that it wasn’t a 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 58 of 258 
 
pleasant meeting.   
 
Then Dramat eventually came out and we left and he said to 
me Phiyega wants to know what makes me tick, I said what makes me 
tick is let me do my work, that’s what makes me tick.   
 
He said to me that she has requested that I don’t go back to 
work and that I take two weeks leave.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What for? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair they just didn’t 
want me back at the office.  They just di dn’t want me back at the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did General Dramat tell you whether he asked her 
10 
what for? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair General Dramat 
is a very soft spoken person, and he is not confrontational.  But he was 
100% behind me going back to work and I agreed with him I said to him 
look what I will do is I will take two weeks leave, but I am going to go 
back to my office, I am going to report back for duty, because I know 
how they operate, if you stay away then they will say no you 
acquiesced to the process of staying away now you’re back so I said I 
will go back to work then I am going to apply for leave for two weeks, I 
am going to send it to you, you must approve it, that means I am back 
20 
at work.   
 
Then he said to me how can we overcome this impasse, I said 
let General Nkombeni, the Provincial Commissioner at the time, let us 
all have a round table with the National Commissioner, let’s sort this 
thing out.  So a month later we had this meeting and this meeting 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 59 of 258 
 
turned into a debacle, to say the the lease. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the general that you referred, Nkombeni, the 
Provincial Commissioner. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was after the incidents, obviously it was 
after the incidents where she  called you and said stop the investigation 
and so on and so on. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes alright. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So they convened 
10 
this meeting with General Phiyega, General Makubela, who has  since 
passed away, General Dramat, there was another General from Legal 
Services, I cannot recall her name, she was sitting across, and I could 
see from her demeanour that she wasn’t even interested in listening 
because she knew what was going on was wron g, she was on her 
phone, I don’t know whether she was texting or blaming games or 
whatever but she had no interest in this meeting and quite rightly so, 
and then Chair it wasn’t a meeting, the more I tried to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just again who was at this meeting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   It was General Riah 
20 
Phiyega, General Dramat, who was with me, and General Makubela who 
is a lady, she subsequently passed away.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the Provincial Commissioner was not there?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   She was also there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was also there.  This meeting was convened 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 60 of 258 
 
pursuant to your suggestion there should be a round table meeting.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair, 
yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Maybe we will take the tea break now, 
and then we will resume.  Let’s take the tea break, it’s twenty past, we 
will resume at twenty five to. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms September you may proceed. 
ADVOCATE 
VERUSHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 
Thank 
you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Major General Booysen was in the middle of 
his evidence when he had to adjourn.  I think he may proceed from 
there. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  It was your 
evidence that you then returned to work following the finding of 
Advocate Nazeer Cassim?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – we were dealing with – if I recall correctly but I 
20 
may be mistaken what happened after that round table meeting that you 
talked about and you returned to work after that, is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as I understand it you returned with  the intention 
to apply for leave or fill in leave forms which would have to be 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 61 of 258 
 
considered by General Dramat?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Following 
your return to work were any – were there any further disciplinary steps 
taken against you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair when I returned 
to work I called in the investigators.  Obviously I wanted feedback as to 
how all these investigations had proceeded in the time that I had been 
out of office – suspended. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had been out of office for how long by the 
way? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  About two years 
Chair, just over two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was a long time  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Long time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair it was clear 
to me that well number 1 is the attempt to bribe me by Panday and 
Madhoe but that matter had been withdrawn by Advocate Moipon e 
20 
Noko.  The main case, the R60 million case, that case was nolle 
prosequi declined to prosecute by I think it was Advocate Abby Letsholo 
from the Durban office in spite of the fact that there was overwhelming 
evidence.  Chair there was even a forensic rep ort which cost the tax 
payer R1.93million from Price Waterhouse Cooper and which the – it is 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 62 of 258 
 
clear from that report – there were approximately 20 arch lever files 
and over 200 affidavits and in spite of all that overwhelming evidence 
Advocate Letsholo declined to prosecute.  Then there was the matter…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe for the record you can help with the spelling 
for Letsholo or you are not – are you not able to? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I will have to 
write it then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are not able to that is fine maybe some other 
10 
time somebody will give it to us. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am going to second 
guess Chair I do not think I am going to get it right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But anyway you - you say there was an investigation, 
forensic investigation by Price Waterhouse?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Price Waterhouse 
Cooper Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And that investigation would have bee n 
authorised during the time you were not there?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair what 
20 
happened just – just before I was …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Suspended. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Suspended the 
investigators told me the scope of the inves tigation was of such a 
nature that we would have to get forensic auditors involved and then we 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 63 of 258 
 
applied to national head office at the time the national commissioner 
was the now Minister of Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Mr Bheki Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He approved it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that particular 
report Chair SAPS was invoiced R1.93 million for that report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And the conclusion of 
that report was that there was definitely corruption committed by …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The people that we 
were investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – but there was a decision not to prosecute 
notwithstanding that that is what you are saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  When you returned to work how long before that 
had that decision been taken if you are able to remember?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How old was it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I think it was 
quite a long time before I returned back to work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 64 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can just interject there?  
Yesterday when we consulted there were certain documents that was – 
that you referred to.  Chair it is not included in the bundle but with your 
leave if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Hand these documents up 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are they? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The one document relates to a 
submission by Advocate Noko in relation to the withdrawal of charges in 
10 
the corruption matter against Mr Toshan Panday and Colonel Navin 
Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the other is a memorandum 
– apologies.  The other is a response by General Booysen to that 
particular memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And these were documents that 
he called for upon his return to office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I will be guided by you as to 
how you wish to mark them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should – we can – maybe we should have them 
dealt with.  We should have them put separately b ecause the ones that 
you already have here they are referred to in his affidavit.  These ones 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 65 of 258 
 
are not referred to is it not?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No it is not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think we will need to – we have got Exhibit ZA 
and ZB, is that right? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it runs to ZG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you have got ZG as well.  Have you got the 
other alphabets in between?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got C, D, E, F?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay then we should make Advocate Noko’s – is it 
Advocate Noko’s submissions?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair.  That is the one at 
the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That memorandum we should make it Exhibit Z[H].  H 
will be in brackets because you have put the others in brackets.  And 
then Major General Booysen’s – I think it is in the form of a letter.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Letter responding or dealing with that dated 19 
November 2014 we will mark that Exhibit Z[I] in brackets.  Yes thank 
you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are the witness – of the witness have they 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 66 of 258 
 
been marked or not?  I am sure he will be able to mark them.  He has 
dealt with these – with Exhibits for many years.  You understood which 
one I said would be Exhibit Z[H] that is Advocate Noko’s submissions.  
Exhibit Z and in brackets [H] and your letter include – which contained 
your response Exhibit Z[I] and I will be in brackets.  Thank you.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  If I could 
then quickly refer you to Exhibit Z[H] which is the mem orandum that 
was prepared by Advocate Noko in relation to the withdrawal of 
10 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let – before we go there I just want clarification.  
So this briefing that you asked for from the people under you did it 
happen before you went on leave  or before you went on leave?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No it is – after my two 
weeks leave Chair I went back to work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so it was after?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  After Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja I wanted us to clear that part as to where it 
fell okay.  So your leave was – you went back to work, you filled in the 
20 
forms for leave and General Dramat approved the leave?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair 
and I – for that two weeks in my absence I appointed Brigadier Vlek. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Who was the second 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 67 of 258 
 
most senior person at the time to act in my absence for those two 
weeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  During the time that you had been suspended 
for two years was there somebody acting in your position and if so who 
was it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair there was 
Brigadier I cannot remember his name now – Mboto, Brigadier Mboto 
acted in my place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  In those two years. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because I assumed that whatever issues you 
would have dealt with in regard to these matters would then have fallen 
to be dealt with by him in your absence being the person who was 
acting in your position during that two year period? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I would have 
expected that to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But it did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not happen ja.  Okay.  And I assume you had no 
– you had no hand in – no role in his appointment as – to act in your 
20 
position? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  None whatsoever 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But generally you would be the person 
empowered to appoint a person to act in your position if you were  away 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 68 of 258 
 
or would that be somebody else’s power?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair under – Chair 
under normal circumstances I would have been – I would  appoint a 
person to act in my absence if I go on vacation leave or…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But in this particular 
instance I think well once you are suspended you do not have any say.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen it was your 
evidence that when you returned to office you called for a reporting on 
10 
the status of investigations?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If you could look at Exhibit Z[H] 
which is the memorandum prepared by Advocate Noko dated the 21  
October 2014.  Is this a memorandum that was placed before you when 
calling for a status update?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  This was one of the 
documents that was placed before me Chair when I wanted an update 
from the investigators as to how th e… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  After considering this particular 
document it is understood that you then prepared Exhibit Z[I]?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I did Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that letter under your hand 
is dated 19 November 2014. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 69 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  Can you  please explain 
the basis of your letter and the objections that you had taken as 
documented in your letter?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us start with this.  Do you want to in 
relation to Exhibit Z[H] that is the memorandum by Advocate Noko, do 
you want to highlight any particular fissures of her submissions that 
you think are important that may have struck you, that may – you may 
have decided should be dealt with in one way or another?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the general gist 
10 
of Advocate Noko’s report if I can summarise it?   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It looks like it was 
written by a defence attorney rather than a prosecutor for the state.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It is as if she has 
looked at any possible excuse and some of the stuff she basically made 
up.  I mean that is why I say in one of my – paragraph 2  
“Assertions are in – an aberration which lacks 
substance supported by credible evidence.”   
20 
Some of them are blatant untruths that she placed on record in the 
report. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that was 
paragraph 2 of Exhibit Z[I] which is your letter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is paragraph 2 of 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 70 of 258 
 
my letter Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms September it is important to deal with the 
gist of the submissions by Advocate Noko and at least the gist of the – 
of Major General Booysen’s response.  Somebody listening needs to 
know what it was about, what was its purpose and to the extent that 
she was – she may have been saying the withdrawal of the charges was 
justified or the charges s hould be withdrawn for this and that reason.  
At least the important fissures must be dealt with so somebody 
listening can follow. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the response what Major General Booysen 
may have said about some of those reasons. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if it is not everything. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair.  The 
response that was prepared by General Booysen is quite specific to the 
paragraph referenced in Advocate Noko’s submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And if with your leave  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may then take him through 
the points as he referenced it?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but not… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And his objections to it. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 71 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not necessarily everything, the important points.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  General Booysen… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe he has not had both you and him he have 
not had time to look at the important  ones. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair all those 
paragraphs are…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are quite important. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Are quite important 
because it is evident. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL 
BOOYSEN :  From Noko’s 
memorandum that this is a contrived document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us deal with them.  Let us deal with everything 
because it is – it may be quite an important issue so let us hear – let 
us deal with the submissions from Advocate Noko and then we will deal  
with – let us deal with them fully, it is okay.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.  If we could 
then look at the documents simultaneously.  Your first issue as taken in 
paragraph 3 of your letter relates to paragraph 2.3.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe – sorry maybe before we do that.  I think 
in paragraph 1 she indicates – I understand she – it is a lady, is that 
right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  She indicates what this document – what the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 72 of 258 
 
purpose of the document is.  She says:  
“I had previously provisionally withdrawn this matter 
on the basis that there were considerations of justice 
that I had to look into in order to arrive at a p roper 
decision that is in the interest of justice. These have 
been so looked into and my decision is indicated 
hereunder with substantiation.”  
So she had withdrawn – she had provisionally withdrawn the matter and 
she had said so according to this that she needed to look into certain 
considerations of justice.  She now says:  
10 
“I have had a chance to do so.”  
And then she says her decision is indicated hereunder and she says 
she is giving substantiation for her decision. What was her decision 
that she gives hereunder you would have known because you know the 
matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair if I can just 
respond to that.  She confirms why the case against Panday and 
Madhoe was withdrawn the attempt to bribe me.  Then they go into the 
main case, the R0 million case as to why there was going to be no 
prosecution.  But what she does not say in this report of hers is after 
20 
she initially withdrew the charges against Panday and Madhoe the 
investigators reported to me and that carried on for almost six  months 
that she refused to return the docket to them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  But – but the memorandum I have not read the 
memorandum so I think in case you have read it.  In the memorandum 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 73 of 258 
 
does she confirm the decision to withdraw the charges?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the reason the substantiation that she is talking 
about therefore means she is giving reasons to justify her decision to 
withdraw the charges? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the case 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Against Panday and 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Madhoe.  Yes okay I think that is where you – 
then everyone understands while looking at the reasons what reasons 
did she give for the decision to withdraw.  Okay deal with that.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  For the benefit of those 
listening paragraph 3 of your letter or rather let me start me off by 
saying paragraph 2 of your letter makes a general statement to say that 
it –  
“This missive from Advocate Noko is rather verbose 
it 
is 
permeated 
with 
conjecture, 
innuendo, 
20 
inaccuracies 
and 
in 
certain 
instances 
blatant 
untruths.  The assertions are an aberration which 
lacks substance supported by credible evidence.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  No Ms September – no Ms September.  Let us hear 
what the reasons are that she gives first then we can go to General 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 74 of 258 
 
Booysen’s critique of that if necessary.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Would you like me to address 
all of the reasons and not just those that he objected to or took issue 
with? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well let us do that.  This might be very important.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  With your leave then 
Chair it is quite a technical document. Could I then read the paragraphs 
as indicated into the record?  General Booysen does raise issues with 
very specific paragraphs and not all of them but I am guided by your 
direction Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is possible then we – maybe we need to skip this 
part.  Maybe during the lunch break have a look properly at the – at the 
– at these two documents and then after lunch let us – let us deal with 
these properly.  I am sure you will find a way that we deal with them 
without reading them. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay because maybe you have not had enough time 
to look at them. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So let us return to that part after lunch.  I think 
20 
to the extent necessary we – you may just be able to say there were – 
there was that submission by Advocate Noko and Major General 
Booysen having read it was unhappy with the reasons given and he 
gave his comments in this submission that we will deal with later and 
then proceed. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 75 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.  With your 
direction we will then deal with that – the submissions and letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  At a later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  After lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen you returned 
to work.  You go on leave.  Were there any subsequent disciplinary 
steps that were taken against you following your return to work?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair perhaps I 
should just contextualise my response to Advocate Noko.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To that question. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because that is what 
now led to…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Another – further 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it – if you deal with it without dealing with 
this? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It takes away the context?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It takes away the context.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I –  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 76 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I can just perhaps 
summarise that I…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but let me just say what I am looking for.  I want 
to be told these were the reasons given by Advocate Nok o for the 
decision to withdraw a, b, c, d. okay?  Then because you responded to 
that you then say in regard to a, I did not have a problem, b I did not 
have a problem but I had a problem with c, d and e.  And my problem 
with c, d and e were the following b ang, bang, bang.  That is the kind of 
thing I am looking for.  I have not read this because they only got 
10 
handed up now so I am not able to assist – to assist.  If you are able to 
do it that way do it that way.  If you are unable we may have to read 
them you know throughout the – all the pages. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I will attempt 
during the lunch break to do as you request.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But I think for 
purposes of answering the questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of continuing you need to say something.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  This – I wrote this to 
20 
the newly appointed national director of public prosecutions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Advocate Nxasana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay yes.  Also your exhibit the Exhibit Z[I] was – 
was directed at Mr Nxasana?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 77 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he was the new NDPP at the time.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I then also went to 
General Dramat and I told him that I had written this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  This report and he 
said to me he had also written a report to Mr Nxasana.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Under very similar 
lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the purpose of your letter which contained 
your views on the Noko submission the purpose was to get that 
decision reversed, is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was – that was 
the – my position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your – yes okay continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair and also at 
the very same time I received a phone call from the head of ICD then 
20 
IPID now the Independent Police Investigative Directorate a Mr McBride 
and he asked me what was going on and I gave him a report.  And 
because of this and the reason – also the report by Dramat and 
McBride I do not know whether McBride wrote a letter to Mr Nxasana or 
whether he paid him a visit but nevertheless I was then asked myself 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 78 of 258 
 
and the accountant for Price Waterhouse Cooper to come to national 
head office where we did a presentation to Advocates from that – that 
Advocate Nxasana had appointed to relook – have another look at 
these cases that either had been withdrawn or nolle presequi.  A 
specific advocate was appointed. At the time it was Advocate Gerrie 
Nel.  He had started interviewing witnesses.  He had visited some of 
the witnesses in KZN and we were about to embark upon basically 
prosecuting the majority of the people mentioned in this investigations.  
Then it was after the appointment of the – Mr – well Major General 
Berning Ntlemeza he was then appointed head of the Hawks.  After 
10 
Dramat had been …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay let us get the sequence correctly.  You 
returned to work after the two weeks leave.  You get briefed on matters 
that were ongoing when you were suspended and in regard to the 
Panday, Madhoe matter you get – you get furnished with Advocate 
Noko’s submissions as to why it was justified to withdraw the charges.  
You prepare comment on that the purpose of which was to have that 
decision reversed so that the prosecution could proceed against Mr 
Panday and Colonel Madhoe.  And at that time General D ramat was still 
the head of the Hawks when you …  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That letter. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but after that – after some time she was – he was 
suspended or removed or he left, is that correct.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 79 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair this is – this 
is where things get complicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because in that 
December I think it was the 24 December just prior to that…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And just mention the years as well because there are 
too many years we are dealing with here.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair so it was 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja 2014.  So I just 
10 
returned to work giving the reports, written these reports.  In that 
interim period I cannot recall the exact dates there is another Sunday 
Times article that appeared by the same two journalists Hofstatter and 
Wa Afrka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Accusing General 
Dramat and General Shadrack Sabiya and there was another colonel I 
cannot recall his name I think it was Kumalo I am not too sure accusing 
them of so called rendition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They were accused of 
extraditing Zimbabweans without extradition papers.  And that is 
another chapter Chair which I will will…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I will talk to a bit 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 80 of 258 
 
later.  Then Dramat got suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In December that 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And immediately when 
after he was suspended they appointed as acting head of the Hawks 
Major General Berning Ntlemeza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He acted for a period 
10 
of time and then in that period Dramat agreed with SAPS to leave SAPS 
on a special dispensation.  And then the post for head of the Hawks 
was advertised.  I applied for th at.  Myself and three others were short 
listed for that post.  We were flown down to the then Minister of Police 
Mr Nathi Nhleko’s office at Parliament to be interviewed for the post.  
Ntlemeza was not there.  It was myself, two ladies and a gentleman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  We completed our 
interviews on the day and a month or two later Ntlemeza was appointed 
as the head of the Hawks.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether he was an applicant for the 
position at the time you w ere interviewed? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because normally 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 81 of 258 
 
what he would say in public and what actually happened were two 
different things.  What I do know is in an o pen meeting in Polokwane 
the meeting with all the provincial heads.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And other senior 
managers from the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He said that he did 
not apply for the post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ntlemeza? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ntlemeza said that 
personally at a meeting at Polokwane.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Now whether he just 
said that and applied or not I do not know b ut that is what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what he said yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
he 
was 
not 
present on the day that the four of us were interviewed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And whether he had 
20 
applied and whether they had a separate session with him I do not 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know ja, yes.  Okay, but you say about a 
month after that interview. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would say about a 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 82 of 258 
 
month or two Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About a month of two he was appointed?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He was appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
and 
the 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But all the other people that as far as you knew had 
applied and you do not know whether he had applied or not were there?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
They 
were 
there 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the day of the interviews?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There were four of us 
there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So Major-General Berning Ntlemeza 
was in office and were any steps then taken?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair within I would 
say a week after his – his permanent appointment as Head of the 
20 
Hawks I received another notice of intention to suspend me.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay. 
 
Let 
us 
also 
just 
get 
clarification.  
General Dramat got suspended and General  Ntlemeza was appointed to 
act in his position.  How long did he – for how long did he act before he 
was permanently appointed as – if you are able to remember?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 83 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I think he was – 
he started acting I think it was on Christmas Day 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I think he was 
appointed permanently perhaps in July the following year.  
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Give or take a month 
or two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So I just wanted to get a ti meframe, 
yes.  Okay.  You say within a week or so after he was permanently 
10 
appointed you got a notice from him asking you for representations why 
you should not be suspended?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Once again Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once – yes and – and what was your response?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair this time 
around he - he accused me of committing fraud.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
what 
is 
interesting more or less at the same time he also 
accused 
General Shadrack Sibiya of committing fraud. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He was eventually 
prosecuted and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Acquitted. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 84 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my matter I wrote a 
letter – well in my presentation I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Let us - was fraud the only thing that was 
the basis of the notice?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The fraud. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what did he say the fraud was about?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The fraud related to a 
10 
monetary award Chair that was written by the Commander of Cato 
Manor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For work done by his 
members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In the investigation of 
the killing of Colonel Chonco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The killing of Chonco 
20 
one 
of 
the 
suspects 
that 
was 
sought 
by 
Cato 
Manor 
Magojela Ndimande. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They were looking for 
him and they could not trace him.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 85 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I received information 
from an informer that he was on his way to Pietermaritzburg.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I conveyed that to 
Cato Manor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They got hold of the 
surveillance unit to manage to track down Ma gojela Ndimande.  The 
surveillance unit then informed Cato Manor that he was on the freeway.  
10 
Subsequent to that there was a chase on the freeway where – whereby 
Magojela was shot and killed and his.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He had a bodyguard 
with an AK47. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who was also shot 
and killed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So my role played in 
20 
the tracing of Magojela was detailed in that report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
A 
number 
of 
detectives and I will guess probably about 18 to 20 detectives.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 86 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That get a R10 000,00 
monetary award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Somewhere in the – in 
the report there is a wrong date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What kind of award would that be?  What was it for?  
Is it a performance? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bonus or what is it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it is not really a 
performance bonus.  It is – police regulations make provision where 
police officers did exceptional work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That they can be 
awarded with a certificate or a medal or.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay – okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Or a monetary award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Up to – I think – it is 
R30 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was a monetary award connected with excellent 
performance of their duties?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 87 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On that particular point if I can take 
you Bundle ZG which is the Mokgoro Report at page 108.  Under sub 
paragraph 5.2.1.7 which is titled “Monetary Reward” it is dealt with from 
paragraphs 331 to 337 on the next page.  Is that the monetary reward 
that you were referring to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is the same 
monetary award that that Judge  Mokgoro refers to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He must still tell us what he was still telling us about 
this, ja. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the members of SAPS were said to have cl aimed – 
put in claims for a monetary award?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it is not a claim.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is an application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is an application. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In terms of those 
regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which is done by the 
Unit Commander. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
the 
Unit 
Commander detailed the names of people who had been part of this  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 88 of 258 
 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he sent that to 
me but my – and the process is I would send that to my superior.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He will send to the 
Provincial Commissioner who was General (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He has a committee 
that sits on it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
He 
eventually 
approves.  It goes to National Head Office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Where 
Deputy 
National Commissioners – more than one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Sits on a panel and 
then they will eventually agree or disagree.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in this particular 
instance they agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And awarded each of 
us with a R10 000,00 once off payment. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 89 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
problem 
according to Ntlemeza was that there was a date that was wrong.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But if you read the 
things sequentially it is clear that it is a typographical error.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I wrote a detailed 
10 
report and I said to him it is clear from that it is a typographical error.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I actually pointed 
out and his notice of intention to s uspend me – he has also made 
similar mistakes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in spite of – of a 
detailed report he nevertheless suspended me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying that – was the position that 
General Ntlemeza said in effect you should be charged for or he said 
20 
that you should make representations why you should not be suspended 
on the basis that you may have committed fraud and the fraud that he 
was talking about was based on the fact that a certain date had been 
given in the document that you had signed.  Is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No, I did not.  Chair 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 90 of 258 
 
that is just the point.  I never signed the document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you never signed it?  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because I was a 
possible recipient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
did 
not 
feel 
comfortable signing that document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Recommending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For myself although 
when I send it to my superior I recommended that the people in that 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Be awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I deleted my 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At the bottom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
I 
put 
the 
General Brown’s name there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He then dealt with the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 91 of 258 
 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He recommended to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
Provincial 
Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what was according to General  Ntlemeza’s 
letter what associated you with that date that you say was wrong?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Absolutely nothing 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And his letter did not indicate what you had to do with 
the put – with putting in that date?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he accuse you of having given?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The wrong information or something?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Maybe if I can explain 
it this way.  I took that decision to suspend me on review as we ll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in – this time to 
20 
the High Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the Judge on that 
matter - I think it was Judge Van Zyl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 92 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He ruled that there is 
– there is not an indication of an offence being committed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Let alone by the 
applicant. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Hm. 
 Anyway 
you 
made 
representations 
to 
Mr Ntlemeza saying among other things this is - it is clear when you 
read the document that this is a typographical error and you say 
despite that he still suspended you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I also told him in my 
10 
representation Chair that what he is saying in his  notice of intention to 
suspend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That he is actually 
misrepresenting facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That could possibly 
prejudice me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that he will make 
20 
himself guilty of an offence of fraud if he does that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
I 
did 
subsequently open a fraud case against him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 93 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which I believe is now 
with the NDPPs Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But he – in spite of 
the fact that I am – it is – it is evident Chair if you read my report that 
there - there is just no reason or there is just no valid reason for him to 
have suspended me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  If I can ask you to 
turn to Bundle ZB and in particular page 315?  Is this the Van  Zyl – 
10 
Justice Van Zyl judgment that you refer to which at page 345 sets aside 
your suspension and ordered that pending the outcome of any 
disciplinary proceedings you will be not liable to suspension from your 
employment in addition to which a punitive costs order was granted?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is the judgment 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
– 
General Ntlemeza’s 
notice 
and 
Major-General Booysen’s response are they here because then if they 
are we must just identify them?  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We do not have that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are not here? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No but we can certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the sake of completeness it might be important to 
– to have them. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 94 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I still have them 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If you can make them available that would be 
helpful because it is important. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see what facts you place before him and despite 
that he made the decision continue with the dec ision. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  It is correct that 
10 
the – the suspension did result in not only being set aside by court but 
additional legal action was taken?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair a few things 
happened.  Ntlemeza applied for leave to appeal the Van  Zyl judgment 
which was refused and then he petitioned the SCA.  In that interim 
period I indicated that I am going back to work again, but he th en 
indicated (indistinct) Le serve papers on me for another disciplinary 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to remember this suspension – this 
application that you had just won in court now – that you have just 
20 
talked about where Judge  Van Zyl gave judgment.  That was what – the 
second or the third time that you had to challenge a suspension in 
court? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the very first 
one was the interdict that I got because they did not give me enough 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 95 of 258 
 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And they suspended 
me in spite of the interdict. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
then 
had 
that 
overturned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The second time was 
when I was arrested.  I was suspended.  I did not challenge that for 
10 
obvious reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there was a disciplinary inquiry?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then there was a 
disciplinary inquiry in which I was exonerated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Which found in your favour?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then you were told about various options by 
General Piyega? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you went on leave.  Then you came back 
and then and there was this suspension now by General  Ntlemeza? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was a second suspension.  Is that right or a 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 96 of 258 
 
third? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It would be the third 
one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The third one ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of which I challenged 
two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  So continue.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is that the suspension which led to a 
hearing the evidence of which shall not be placed before the 
Commission at this stage?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had just said that something had happened 
and General Ntlemeza was preparing to suspend you again or I think or 
I think – I thought it was something you were saying that or did I 
misunderstand you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair he – no he 
did suspend me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I know about the first suspension.  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was overturned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You won.  He applied for leave.  He was turned down.  
He petitioned the SCA.  Was he turned down there as well?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair so what 
happened then is and I am not going to give this evidence.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 97 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At that point I had 
been approached by a private sector.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For – and I was sitting 
at home doing nothing and the matter – I was due to retire July  2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the matter was 
set down for the SCA for March  2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I – by now I think 
I know how the courts work.  Judgment will be reserved and if you are 
lucky I would have gotten my – my judgment by say May, June which in 
effect would have meant that I would basically go back to work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
fill 
in 
my 
retirement papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that – I indicated 
to SAPS that if they are prepared to release me now I am prepared to 
20 
go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think they were very 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 98 of 258 
 
happy to get rid of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Or some – some 
individuals within SAPS.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I was – I went – I 
left the police in February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2017? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  2017 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I was supposed to 
have left in July that year.  So they paid me out.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Till July? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For that period of time 
as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did that form a settlement o f the appeal or 
not? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was part of the – 
20 
well Ntlemeza then indicated then that if that is the case they will not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Proceed with the appeal?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Proceed with the SCA 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 99 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I know and I was privy 
to - to the communication that the Registrar had sent to the State 
Attorney at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Basically 
telling 
General Ntlemeza that the way they dealt with this matter is not the 
way that the SCA works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of procedural issues?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay.  Yes, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance can we go back to 
the EXHIBIT ZG – the Mokgoro Report at page 109 and just to add 
Chair in the introduction – in the initial presentation to the stream there 
was 
a 
slide 
that 
was 
posted 
which 
informed 
that 
Major-General Berning Ntlemeza acted during the dates of 2014 to 
2015 following which he was appointed to the position of National Head 
of DPCI from 2015 to 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page in the Mokgoro Report do you want to  
20 
refer us to? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 109 which is sub paragraph 
5.2.1.8 and titled “Padayachee Affidavit”.  Without going into the detail 
of what is stated from paragraphs 338 to 345 is it correct that this 
particular Colonel Brian Padayachee is the same Padayachee who 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 100 of 258 
 
assisted you in the Toshan Panday investigation relating to interception 
(background noise)? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was the same 
Colonel Padayachee Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can we then move on to page 111 of  
the report?  Under paragraph 5.2.1.9 it is marked “The Decision to 
Authorise the Prosecution and the Steps Taken”.  This particular 
section is dealt with at length and to that end you were asked 
General Booysen to please clarify the – as far as you are aw are – the 
process and involvement of Mlotshwa as the Acting DPP to authorise 
10 
the prosecution and the steps taken by augmenting what is already 
stated here. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair at the time 
when I was still at the office before all my problems started the actual 
DPP at the time was the current NDPP Advocate  Shamila Batohi.  She 
then took up the position at the International Court at The Hague and 
Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa was appointed as the Acting DPP in KZN.  
Mlotshwa – I did not personally know him at the time but I knew about 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because some of my 
investigators had reported that they dealt with him and one of the 
cases on which I already testified was the Amigos case under wh ich 
there was pressure on Mlotshwa – Simphiwe Mlotshwa to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 101 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Withdraw 
those 
charges.  So I knew about him but I had never met him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Unbeknown to me and 
I only established this much later.  This came out that during that same 
period that I was busy with these investigations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Advocate Mlotshwa 
received 
a 
phone 
call 
from 
the 
then 
Acting 
NDPP 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And – where she said 
to him that because of pressure and urgency there are certain 
documents that he had to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He was on his way to 
Port Shepstone to court and he indicated to her when he arrives back 
at the office he will have a look at it and if all the necessary documents 
are there that he would sign the documents.  It turns out that it – there 
is other a covering letter or the actual indictment to have myself and 
20 
Cato Manor members prosecuted for racketeering.  On his arrival back 
at the office there was only the letter to sign with no supporting 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He then wrote an 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 102 of 258 
 
email to I think it was Advocate Chauke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Would the letter that he was expected to sign 
have been a letter to authorise your prosecution?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It would have been a 
recommendation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been a recommendation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you be prosecuted? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So normally the DPP 
in spite of the fact that the NDPP must authorise prosecutions in terms 
of racketeering.  It remains the responsibility of the DPP to sign the 
indictment.  So it was the accompanying letter with the indictment that I 
suspect that he had to sign but he indicated in  an email to Chauke look 
I am not going to sign this thing until and unless it is clear from the 
supporting documents which individuals are linked to the criminal 
enterprise individually and collectively.  Then it is communication 
between Chauke and Mlotsh wa to and fro in which it became evident 
that Advocate Mlotshwa was not comfortable to sign the documents.  At 
20 
a later stage there was a meeting at National Head Office - at the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Office 
- 
where 
Advocate Chauke 
told 
Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa that Advocate Jiba wanted to see both in 
her office.  Advocate Jiba once again asked him what the problem was 
and he said he is happy to sign it but he needs the supporting 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 103 of 258 
 
documents that links us collectively and individually to the criminal 
enterprise.  The meeting was adjourned and the next moment or awhile 
later Advocate Mlotshwa was replaced by Advocate  Moipone Noko.  
Now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How – how soon after that – if you are able to say?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I will have to 
guess but it was not very long after that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now Chair a lot of 
10 
things happened simultaneously now because there is Mlotshwa’s 
refusal to withdraw charges against M abuyakhulu and Nkonyeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is his refusal to 
sign documents for our prosecution and the next moment he gets 
replaced by Advocate Moipone Noko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to understand.  So as you unders tand the 
position Advocate Mlotshwa in regard to the Amigos case which related 
to Mr Mabuyakhulu among others and Ms  Nkonyeni – in regard to that 
case your understanding is that pressure was being put on him to 
20 
withdraw the charges and he was refusing and in regard to you he was 
being asked to recommend your prosecution and he was saying until I 
have supporting documents that show how these individuals are linked 
to the enterprise I am not prepared to sign.  That was his stance in 
regard to the two matters.  Is that right? 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 104 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  100 percent Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So Mlotshwa refuses to sign without 
the supporting documentation.  Who in fact signed the indictment?  Are 
you aware? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The - well there were 
two indictments.  The first one I think was signed by – I think it was 
unsigned but I think the covering letter was signed by Advocate  Noko. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
after 
Advocate Mlotshwa 
– 
after 
10 
Advocate Mlotshwa was no longer the Acting DPP and Advocate  Noko 
had been appointed Acting DPP then your indictment was signed?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or your prosecution was?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Authorised? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well not authorised 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was recommended 
20 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was recommended? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay by her that is Advocate  Noko to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 105 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The National Office. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair somewhere in 
this exhibit here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  ZG. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  ZG where I think 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Make such a finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That Noko did what 
Mlotshwa did not want to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is a reference 
to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go there if we can.  Ms  September do you 
know where that is or not really?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There is - there is certainly the 
exchange between Mlotshwa at page 155.  Mlotshwa actually testified 
at the inquiry and that talks to his agreement to in fact sign the 
20 
indictment 
without 
the 
supporting 
documents 
and 
Jiba’s 
non-interference in the exchange between him and Chauke.  Is that 
what you refer to Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is Major-General Booysen that is looking for 
something.  I think he said it is in the judgment.  Is that right?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 106 of 258 
 
Major-General Booysen. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Judge when. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you are looking for is in the judgment?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes.  It is in the 
judgment where she is – where the Judge actually comments that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Noko 
did 
what 
Mlotshwa had refused to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And which is it - Judge Van Zyl’s judgment or 
Judge (intervenes)? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No it is the Mokgoro 
judgment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh, oh here, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I perhaps have a look at that?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And revert to you?  I do not have it 
at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At my fingertips right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Look for it during the lunch break, okay.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then take you to page 117 of 
the report – Mokgoro Report and that is sub paragraph 5.2.1.10 and 
that in fact confirms evidence that - unless I am incorrect – evidence in 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 107 of 258 
 
relation to Mlotshwa’s end of office.  Do you have any comments in this 
regard? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Can you just rephrase 
the question please? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
No 
problem. 
 
Page 
117 
sub 
paragraph 5.2.1.10 is titled “No Reappointment of Mlotshwa”.  Do you 
have any personal knowledge in relation to that no reappointment?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair not – not 
personal over and above what I have read in this finding by 
Judge Mokgoro. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  If we can then go to 
page 119 and this particular sub section 5.2.1.11 talks specifically to 
“Nel’s Opinion” – Advocate Nel’s opinion.  Do you have any personal 
knowledge in relation to that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I have got 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Let us finalise Advocate Noko gets 
appointed as Acting DPP what happens?  Let us – let us get that story.  
What happens after that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Well 
Chair 
three 
20 
significant things happen.  She gets appointed within two weeks.  She 
withdraws 
the 
Amigo 
case 
charges 
against 
Mabuyakhulu 
and 
Peggy Nkonyeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Nkonyeni. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  About two or three 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 108 of 258 
 
months later she withdraws the charges against Toshan  Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And if one looks at the 
timeline it is during that same timeline.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Unbeknown to me 
then but known to me now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That my prosecution 
is recommended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So your prosecution is recommended by her to 
the National – the Acting – to the NDPP?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time who was the NDPP – Mr Nxasana or…?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No, no then it was 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, Miss Jiba, and was your prosecution then 
authorised? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you were served with an indictment?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I was arrested Chair 
and then served with indictment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue.    
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 109 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can then take you to – I’ve just 
been informed paragraph – page 121 of the Mokgoro report, paragraph 
375 which is exactly where we are now Chair, so it’s page 121 
paragraph 375 talks to Noko having signed which she regarded to be 
the covering letter to the prosecution memorandum at the request of 
Chake, is that the paragraph that you were referring to earlier?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s the paragraph 
I was referring to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.    
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you on that score and specific 
10 
to the prosecution memorandum in the outline of the procedure that 
needs to be followed for the purposes of obtaining the authorisations 
relating to racketeering charges, a prosecution memorandum needs to 
be submitted.  If one looks then from paragraph 375 at page 121 of th e 
Mokgoro report an address is made in relation to the prosecution 
memorandum specific to your case. Do you have any comments in 
relation to the prosecution memorandum submitted?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I don’t want to 
comment specifically because some of the stuff I only realised and 
heard about ex post facto. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well do you want to be specific about the 
question that you want him to comment on.    
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem Chair.  If I could ask you 
– just bear with me Chair.  If I could ask you to turn to page ZA.  
CHAIRPERSON:   To Exhibit Z?    
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 110 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   ZA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ZA okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page 204 do you recognise this 
document? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please explain what this document 
is? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair normally, as 
I’ve said earlier on in my evidence, once the desk at the National 
Prosecuting Authority, for instance advocate Mabolo and advocate 
10 
Kruger, if they are satisfied that all requirements are met a meeting is 
then – or a session is then set down with the NDPP, at that session 
she’s presented or he is presented with a prosecution memorandum.  
How it normally works in practice is that they wi ll also do a PowerPoint 
presentation and go through that in order – there are decided cases, 
and I think it was in the Moodley matter where it’s not a prerequisite to 
read all the dockets and statements.  So just a factual report how the 
accused are linked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Basically they say this is the charge, these are the 
requirements for us to prove this charge, this is the evidence that we 
20 
have that proves each of the elements, that’s what they go through 
more or less. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And based on that if 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 111 of 258 
 
she’s then happy or he’s then happy that the crime of racketeering had 
been committed he or she will then authorise the prosecution.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So the document that appears from 
page 204 until page 260 of Exhibit ZA is that the prosecution 
memorandum relevant to the charge, the racketeering case against 
you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   The one that’s signed 
by advocate Noko? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s the same one 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if I can then take you to page 
261 of that same bundle there’s another document which appears there 
which runs until page...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry what page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   261 of the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of ZA? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   ZA still on ZA.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry just hang on one second. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s the lever arch, it’s in fact the 
document immediately after the document (indistinct).  
CHAIRPERSON:   But the report that I was looking at was at ZE.  Was I 
on the wrong document, the report that you were asking the witness 
about? 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 112 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes the report I was referring to is in 
ZA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ZA not ZE? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   ZA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay what was the page, let’s go back to it because 
I think I was looking at the wrong one then.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem it’s page 204. 
CHAIRPERSON:   204, okay so that’s the prosecution memorandum 
that (indistinct) says was used in regard to his racketeering case, is 
that right? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if one goes to page 261 of that 
same bundle there’s a presentation document that appears there.  What 
document would this be?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I think I just 
need 
to 
correct 
something. 
 
If 
you 
look 
at 
this 
memorandum...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON: The one at 261?   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ja, that’s the second 
20 
one she signed or a second prosecution.  I’m referring to the covering 
letter – the covering minute in the first application for my authorisation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s the one you want to identify or at least to 
find, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Unfortunately I don’t...(intervention).  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 113 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know where – do you know whether it is in 
the bundle or not? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It certainly doesn’t come to mind 
and I do not recall it to be included in the bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON: Okay will you check over the lunch break.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to make the point without looking at it 
that you may have wanted to make about it or you’d rather make it after 
lunch when it has been filed?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I would like to 
10 
be 100 percent accurate, I’d much rather look at the document first.  
CHAIRERSON:   Ja but your recollection is that it is in the bundle or 
you are not sure? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I’m not too sure 
whether it’s in the bundle Chair I’ve seen it somewhere.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we could then deal with these  
documents since we’re at them which is the prosecution memorandum 
and the presentation.  Is it correct that you took certain action in 
relation to the detail of these documents and please explain the context 
20 
of such action that was then taken, if I can th en refer you 
to...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I’m sorry, let’s know about the documents 
first.  This one at 261 you say is a presentation where?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So it was General Booysen’s 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 114 of 258 
 
evidence that in the process of obtaining the necessary authorisations 
there are two documents that need to be submitted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
 
The 
one 
is 
a 
prosecution 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON: Which we have seen.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the other is – which is the one 
that appears at page 204. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the other is a presentation that 
10 
needs to be done at page 261. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Both of these documents, if I 
understand the evidence correctly, are documents that were then 
submitted in support of the institution of racketeering charges.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair 
so you have the prosecution memorandum and the PowerPoint 
presentation which basically encapsulates w hat’s contained in the 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can then take you to page 191 of 
the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve got it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It’s Annexure JWB17.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Which file are we in 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 115 of 258 
 
now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Still the same bundle it’s ZA. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page 191 there’s an affidavit which 
appears there which is your affidavit.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s my affidavit 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And similarly at page 199 of the 
same bundle appears another affidavit that you deposed to.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  
 That’s 
also 
my 
10 
affidavit Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   However these affidavits are in fact 
unsigned. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   They are unsigned 
Chair but those affidavits – the original ones with my signature on are 
in the police dockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes the one affidavit is one at page 191 the  other 
one is where? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page 199. 
CHAIRPERSON:   199 okay so there are original affidavits – there are 
20 
original versions of the same affidavits that are signed?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair yes I normally 
keep copies because in these type of investigations, and it has already 
happened, that statements seem to disappear so I keep copies and I 
did not re-sign them because it would have had a different date on.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 116 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja no that’s fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  
 These 
affidavits 
talk 
to 
the 
prosecution memorandum and it talks to the presentation which is 
enclosed below.  Please explain the context of ...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe for what it’s worth just in case we never get 
to the signed ones, do you confirm that the contents of both affidavits 
are true and correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I did Chair and I 
handed them in as part of my statement, I confirm that they are 
accurate and that’s what I wrote. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. General Booysen 
please explain why you deposed to these affidavits and the context in 
which it was done? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair when I was 
prosecuted the second time, obviously then we app lied in terms of Rule 
53 for the record of decision and part of that then – the record would 
be then the memorandum and the PowerPoint presentation.  When I 
went through the PowerPoint presentation and the prosecution 
memorandum it was blatantly clear to m e that both advocate Mahema 
20 
who was responsible for preparing the prosecution memorandum, the 
second one, and advocate Noko who worked with him at the time – I 
was under the impression that she did the PowerPoint presentation but 
it was later pointed out in court papers that advocate Mahema prepared 
both, but she just represented it with him to the NDPP at the time.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 117 of 258 
 
Chair if you go through – now in my experience, and I’ve done a 
number of these, if you send a docket to the public prosecutor for a 
decision and you do a memorandum, you write a (indistinct) of what 
each witness will say and you’ll describe the evidence for the 
prosecution and for the defence and this particular memorandum, or 
this particular memorandum is permeated with misrepresentations as t o 
what the witnesses (indistinct), there are serious omissions that should 
have formed part of the prosecution memorandum but most importantly 
Chair it contains falsehoods.  In some instances advocate – and one 
would not say this lightly on a platform like  this Chair, but I will say it, 
10 
advocate Mahema blatantly lies in the prosecution memorandums and I 
can prove it. He says things that is part of the evidence that’s nowhere 
to be found in the dockets it just does not exist.  I deposed of these 
two affidavits and I opened criminal cases against advocate Mahema 
and Noko for committing fraud because the misrepresented what is 
contained in the dockets and because of that myself and the State 
having prejudiced.  Chair if one go into my statement – or one can have 
a look at the memorandum and go paragraph by paragraph what I 
describe I’ll just cite one example.  Mahema, for instance will write in 
the prosecution memorandum to Shaun Abrahams – advocate Shaun 
20 
Abrahams that Booysen, that’s myself and one of the peopl e from Kato 
Manor, Warrant Officer Paul Mostert, he says in the memorandum that 
Booysen and Mostert conspired to kill Colonel Ntonko.  Chair there’s 
nothing of that nature in the docket, we had nothing to...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say, he say s something that’s quite critical 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 118 of 258 
 
for the charge but there is no – nothing in the docket that supported 
that statement, that’s what you’re saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Absolutely nothing, 
what the witness says in his statement, it’s a dece ased witness by the 
way Chair, he overheard a conversation by two other people stating 
that they wanted to get rid of Colonel Ntonko and they will speak to 
Booysen and Mostert about it but he says in the prosecution 
memorandum that it was Booysen and Moste rt who conspired to kill 
Ntonko.  Chair if he was right then they should have charged myself 
and Mostert for conspiracy to kill Ntonko.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The fact of the matter 
is an inquest findings Magistrates had a lready ruled that the number of 
the people that were being sought were – and eventually killed that 
they were responsible for the killing of Ntonko.  So that – it’s a 
complete fabrication.  When I pointed this out to them in my founding 
affidavit, in my review application for the second authorisation, he 
exacerbates his own problem, he says to me that’s his interpretation of 
what the witness says and, I mean Chair, we can read the 
statement...(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says what the statement he made  that you 
conspired together with somebody else to kill Ntonko.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Ntonko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes he says that is his interpretation of what was in 
the docket and what was in the docket was certain two people which did 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 119 of 258 
 
not involve you, spoke about – said something to the effect that they 
needed to talk to you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   They first said that 
they need to get rid of Ntonko...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and they would talk to you about it.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   But Chair then in his 
answering affidavit he – this time around he lies under oath, he says 
that Booysen and Mostert received money from, I can’t rem ember, some 
10 
(indistinct) association on three occasions.  There’s nothing like that in 
the docket, there’s nothing like that in the statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And he could only speak on the basis of what was in 
the docket, he couldn’t speak on the basis of anything else? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: Chair he was speaking 
what was written in the Sunday Times, he was not, he was not confining 
himself to what was recorded in the dockets.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what I’m asking is whether he – for purposed 
of him performing the function that he was performing, he was 
supposed to base whatever he was saying on what was in the docket is 
20 
that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are saying he was not doing that he was 
going outside the docket and basing some of the things on what was 
said in the newspapers?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 120 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair he was either 
making it up himself or someone told him that, but that is definitely not 
in the docket.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And over and above 
that...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you – if somebody else had told him about it, 
as long as that was not part of the docket he was not supposed to rely 
on it, isn’t it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No that would have 
10 
been completely irrational. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would have needed to get a statement from that 
person, that statement – that person’s statement would be part of the 
docket. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair there’s another 
– I agree with you Chair, there’s another allegation in the prosecution 
memorandum that I planted a AK47 on one of the scenes.  That story 
was in the newspaper, there’s not even a hint of evidence in any of the 
dockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he included it? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s part of the – 
Chair there are a number of untruths, a number of misrepresentations 
where they will say what a particular witness said but they will add to 
what the witness said and there are  a number of omissions where there 
was exculpatory evidence which they were aware of, which they did not 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 121 of 258 
 
make part of the record of decision.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So who drafted the prosecution 
memorandum?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it was initially 
my understanding that Mahema drafted the prosecution memorandum 
and Noko did the PowerPoint presentation.  When I addressed it in my 
review application the response from Mahema was that he did both 
which in my view exac erbates his problem because the prosecution 
memorandum and the PowerPoint presentation itself are at odds with 
10 
each other, I cannot see how it could have been done by the same 
person but if I give him the benefit of the doubt both contain 
falsehoods, misrepresentations and omissions. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
 
And 
who 
authorised 
your 
prosecution? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That prosecution was 
then authorised by advocate Shaun Abrahams.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That was the second. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   the second one 
Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the first? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
The 
first 
one 
was 
authorised by advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: Now General Booysen...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but both prosecutions were still about the same 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 122 of 258 
 
thing? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: The same thing Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So just to make sure I too 
understand, you’re saying that the same p rosecution memorandum 
together 
with 
the 
same 
presentation 
is 
what 
informed 
both 
authorisations? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay now General Booysen, why 
would advocate Noko and advocate Mahema include falseh oods in 
10 
documents that they are – that they compiled for presentation in such a 
serious proceeding? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
in 
my 
statement, 
I 
deal 
with 
a 
specific 
chapter 
if 
I 
can 
call 
it 
that...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s the statement before us?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s the statement 
that’s before yourself Chair.  I deal specifically with a number of 
prosecutors which I firmly believe did things at the behest of certain 
individuals which I will elaborate on when I testify on that chapter.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Advocate Mahema 
and advocate Noko were both part of that group.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s not the only 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 123 of 258 
 
time that Mahema lied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   When the – advocate 
Jiba was – there was an investigation against her consequent to the 
Govern judgment she was charged with fraud and I think defeating the 
ends of justice and perjury.  Advocate Mahema made a statement in 
favour of advocate Jiba in that statement he also tells a blatant lie.  He 
says in that statement that a witness was killed. He knows full well the 
witness was never killed, the witness died of natural causes, he knows 
it because we brought that to his attention in my first review application 
10 
against Jiba, yet much later in an affidavit in support of advocate Jiba 
he says the witness was killed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did he ever provide any basis for saying that, 
that witness was killed at any stage, as far as you know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair, no he just 
mentions in that statement that a witness was killed.  I think for the 
uninformed who would read that statement would come to the 
conclusion the person w as killed by Kato Manor although he does not 
say that in his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but you say it would be easy for somebody to 
20 
think that was – that’s what he intended saying but you say he doesn’t 
say so expressly? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: That’s my position on 
that point Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you say as a matter of fact that witness died 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 124 of 258 
 
of natural causes and this was brought to his attention?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair as a matter of 
fact right – with the first review application, I think it was my 
supplementary affidavit we told him that this witness has died, he even 
denied that the witness was dead.  I sent someone to the Home Affairs 
to obtain a copy of his death certificate.  It’s clear from the death 
certificate that he died of natural causes.  I then, in a further affidavit, 
told him, here’s the death certificate clearly indicating the man died of 
natural cause but in supporting Jiba in a criminal investigation against 
her, he says a witness was killed  and he refers to that specific witness 
10 
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
Then 
– 
if 
you 
could 
then...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I looks like we have reached the point for the lunch 
break. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we’ll take the lunch break and resume at two, 
we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may proceed Ms September.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :   Thank you Chair.  To quickly 
address some of the preliminary  matters that were raised before we 
adjourned we are still waiting for a copy of the covering letter.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 125 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Which is currently in process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then in relation to Exhibit 
Z[H] and [I]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen has looked at 
these in particularity – in particular detail and in doing so it is 
understood that his letter of response takes issue by and large with 
majority of what is contained in Advocate Noko’s letter but I will leave it 
10 
to his evidence to give the details to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well let us hear what are those?  What were the 
reasons given and then let us deal with each one.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then through General 
Booysen.  General Booysen if you can refer to Exhibit Z[H] okay.  As 
previously placed on record this is in fact a letter or a memorandum 
rather from Advocate Noko dated 21 Octob er 2014 in which it is 
documented that she had previously provisionally withdrawn the 
20 
corruptions charges against Mr Toshan Panday and Colonel Navin 
Madhoe and in doing so sets out the substantiation in relation to that 
decision below from paragraph 2 onwards.  Having considered this 
particular document can you please inform the Chair as to the detail of 
substantiation? 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 126 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I had a look at 
Advocate Noko’s memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Except for two 
paragraphs which are very generic and…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which is common 
cause between the two parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I take issue with every 
10 
point that she makes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Every point.  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In this memorandum 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Where is the first reason that she gives in the 
points let us deal with that and then you can refer to your …  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WES SEL BOOYSEN:  It will be 2.3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2.3 ja.   Okay what was that reason?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair she basically 
talks about case 781 was dealt with by the Specialised Commercial 
20 
Crime Unit in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And case 781 is the Panday case? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Panday case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I do not…  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 127 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Would the Chair want 
me to read the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is …  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Makes it [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can read it ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is the best way. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  She says: 
“Case 781 was dealt with by the Specialised 
10 
Commercial Crime Unit in Durban and disposed of 
recently with a decision not to prosecute anyone as 
there was no evidence to prosecute any person for 
any offence.  It has been revealed by the SCCU 
which is the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit that 
the SAPS members who were charged with the 
investigation of this 781 case was gunning for the 
prosecution of a specific person [KwaZulu Natal 
SAPS Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General 
Ngobeni] and Mr Panday and C ol Madhoe were being 
20 
pressurised 
to 
falsely 
implicate 
her 
in 
the 
commission of criminal offences with a promise that 
they will be exonerated in 781.  When the SAPS 
investigators realised that the PC cannot be charged 
in this case [781] simply because there  is no 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 128 of 258 
 
evidence against her one IO reportedly said the 
SCCU prosecutor may as well just close her 781 
case.  It appears Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe 
featured nowhere in the 781 then as the focus was 
on the PC one then may ask a question.  Why was 
Colonel Madhoe arrested in the 466 case?”   
The 466 that is the attempt to bribe myself Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Was this lawfully justified arrest or was it a way to 
10 
pressurise him to implicate the PC as he, Colonel 
Madhoe even mentions in his representation that he 
was being irregularly interviewed by the investigating 
officers so as to falsely incriminate the PC which he 
flatly refused.” 
My response to that Chair is: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“I respectfully disagree with the submissions”  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is in what paragraph in your …  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That will be paragraph 
3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Of my response.  So 
my response I wrote Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 129 of 258 
 
“I respectfully disagree with the submission by 
Advocate Noko that there was no evidence to 
prosecute any person with any offence in the main 
investigation pertaining to the R60 million corruption.  
The reference number in this case is Durban Central 
CAS 781/9/2001.  It is my submission that there is a 
prima facie case against Toshan Panday, Colonel 
Navin Madhoe as well as Captain Ashwin Narain 
Parsad.  For purposes of this submission I refrain 
from detailing the evidence in this m atter save to say 
10 
that it contains in excess of 20 lever arch files of 
documents more than 200 affidavits as well as a 
forensic audit report compiled by an independent 
group of auditors namely Price Waterhouse Cooper.  
I 
find 
it 
objectionable 
that 
the 
Spec ialised 
Commercial Crime Unit from her office seeks to 
entertain and attach credibility to the claims of the 
suspects in this matter.  Quite how it was – quite how 
it was revealed by the SCCU that SAPS members 
charged with the investigation of Durban Centr al CAS 
20 
781 was gunning for KZN Provincial Commissioner 
Lieutenant 
General 
Ngobeni is 
unclear. 
 This 
imputation in not supported by any evidence other 
than the contrived version of the suspect themselves.  
I for one have never expressed any desire to become  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 130 of 258 
 
the Provincial Commissioner of KZN and neither have 
I applied for this position before.  In my view this is 
a fallacious argument since the irregularities that 
were investigated occurred before the – before the 
2010…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the appointment?   Oh before the 2010 Soccer 
World Cup is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
10 
“The investigation focussed on irregularities before the – before her 
appointment as Provincial Commissioner.  It is thus ludicrous to believe 
that the suspects i.e. Panday and Madhoe in this regard.  The 
investigating officer could not have attempted to falsely implicate the 
Provincial Commissioner for a crime that took place before she 
assumed the post.  Her involvement in the matter relates to the 
attempts by her to interfere with the investigation after the – she 
assumed her position as Provincial Commissioner and not with regard 
to the procurement irregularities perse.  The conclusion  by Advocate 
Noko that neither Panday nor Madhoe features anywhere and I wrote 
20 
there nowhere verbatim”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Is manifestly wrong and this conclusion ought to be 
challenged.  There is overwhelming evidence  to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 131 of 258 
 
support a converse conclusion.  The question by 
Advocate Noko as to why Madhoe was arrested in a 
subsequent attempt to bribe me is rather rhetorical.  
A reading of case 466 that is the attempt to bribe me 
will demonstrate beyond doubt that Advocate Nok o’s 
reasoning is fallacious and wrong.  I find it 
reprehensible that the suspects’ version of events is 
preferred by Advocate Noko.  This is a worrying 
precedent.” 
Okay Chair then the next one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so but let us just get this one clear.  Is m y 
understanding correct that what Advocate Noko was saying in 
paragraph 2.3 which you have already read of her memorandum is that  
1. There is no evidence against Panday and Mr Panday and Colonel 
Madhoe to prosecute them and  
2. That those who were investigating that case were actually 
pressurising them to implicate – to falsely implicate the 
Provincial Commissioner of SAPS.  
Is my understanding correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what she is saying. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is what she is 
saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your response is there is ample evidence and you 
say there are more than whatever the number is of lever arch files of 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 132 of 258 
 
evidence and in this paragraph she has not said anything about having 
looked at that evidence, is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. Continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair then in her 
paragraph 2.4 of Exhibit Z[H] she write:  
“The SCCU revealed the scheming and intercepting 
of phone calls of inter alia Mr Panday with a motive 
and agenda to falsely implicate certain people.  They 
allegedly even went further to even boast to Mr 
10 
Panday telling him that they know what the defence 
in the 781 case will be as they heard his discussion 
with the legal representative through the intercepted 
calls.” 
Then my response to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay your response. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  My response Chair is: 
“Quite now the SCCU revealed the scheming and 
intercepting of phone calls of inter alia Mr Panday 
with a motive and agenda to falsely implicate certain 
20 
people in my opinion is a mystery.  The [indistinct] 
and tone of Advocate Noko’s assertions in this 
paragraph is indeed worrying and  ought to be 
examined.  In her own words there is no proof of 
Panday’s claims as she refers to mere allegations.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87

Her preference of believing the suspects version 
over the police’s version raises to my mind the 
question of serious impropriety.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course generally speaking there would be no 
problem with a prosecutor or DPP when looking at a particular case and 
they look at the investigating officer’s statement and so on and they 
look at the statement by the accused or suspect if he or she has made 
one.  If they were to come to a decision in good faith that they believe 
the suspect’s version rather than the investigating officers – that 
generally speaking should be no problem.  You have no quarrel with 
10 
that generally speaking?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is only because of the specific circumstances of 
this one that you have a problem with that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Well Chair the – and 
why I have a problem with that is the reasons that she advances.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There is no 
20 
substance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja no that is – yes let us continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Her paragraph 2.5 of 
Exhibit Z[H]. 
“Mr Panday was even promised by SAPS members in 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 134 of 258 
 
the 781 case that if he falsely implicate the PC that 
is now the Provincial Commissioner they would get 
rid of the 466 case.  It was further explained to Mr 
Panday that the benefit of this sought incrimination 
for the PC for them SAPS members will be that the 
PC will be forced to resign and then Major General 
Booysen will become the next KZN Provincial 
Commissioner. 
 
Further 
Major 
General 
Deena 
Moodley would remain in control  of the Secret fund.”  
And my response to that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In Exhibit 2[I]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Other than the claimants by the suspects in this 
matter who had much to lose had the investigation 
led to a prosecution and conversely much to gain 
should they have managed to derail the investigation 
there is no evidence whatsoever to remotely support 
her claims contained in this paragraph.  In any event 
20 
why would the Provincial Commissioner be forced to 
resign if she knew the evidence against her were 
contrived?  Furthermore there is no guarantee that I 
would succeed her as a Provincial Commissioner 
presupposing that she had resigned.  For this or any 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 135 of 258 
 
other reason he vacant p ost would have been 
advertised and prospective candidates evaluated for 
possible appointment.  It is my submission that 
Panday and Company have failed to compromise me.  
They have attempted to have the investigation 
stopped. The Deputy National Commissione r for the 
Hawks Lieutenant General Dramat is aufait with the 
detail.  When this allegation failed they brought in an 
unsuccessful application the high court to thwart the 
investigation and after they failed to bribe me with 
10 
R2 million in cash they have obv iously run out of 
ideas.  To now suggest an agenda by myself to 
become Provincial Commissioner at the expense of 
Lieutenant General Ngobeni is not supported by any 
evidence and ought to be rejected.  Lieutenant 
General Ngobeni has no control over the Secre t fund.  
If I had to succeed her the situation would remain the 
same.  To postulate that Major General Moodley 
would therefore remain in control of the Secret fund 
makes no sense and it is in any event irrelevant.”  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But I just want to go back to the first paragraph 
that you have dealt with which contains Advocate Noko’s reasons that 
is 2.3.  Am I correct in understanding that what she said in 2.3 of her 
memorandum includes saying there was no case in relation to the 
bribery case against Co lonel Mood – Madhoe or did I misunderstand 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 136 of 258 
 
that?  In saying there is no case does she include that one or does she 
not include that one? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I think she is 
dealing here with the main R60 million case.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you.  Yes let us continue.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then 2.6 of 
Noko’s letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“The matter 781 matter – the 781 matter which forms 
10 
the basis and reason for the alleged co rruption of 
Major General Booysen by Colonel Madhoe was 
found to be non-existent by the SCCU.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is she saying there?  I am not sure that I follow.  
About non-existent? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I do not – I do 
not think she knows what she is saying here.  I – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I cannot understand.  Yes how did you respond?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  My response thereto 
Chair was:  I have dealt with the Durban Central CAS 781 in paragraph 
20 
3 and that would be my par agraph 2.3 above. 
“The submission by Advocate Noko I repeat is based 
on a fallacious argument.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Then her 2.7 Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 137 of 258 
 
“Major General Booysen is the complainant and the 
only witness in the 466 case against Mr Panday and 
Colonel Madhoe.  The very Panday and Colonel 
Madhoe who allegedly refused to pave the way for 
him to become the next KZN SAPS Provincial 
Commissioner by refusing to falsely implicate the 
current Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General 
Ngobeni.” 
2.7 
of my response thereto Chair. 
“I am not the complainant in the matter of Durban 
10 
Central CAS 466 that is the bribery.  This is a 
disingenuous proposition by Advocate Noko so as to 
build a legend for her imputations contained in 
paragraph 2.8 and 2.9 info.  For one the state is the 
complaint in the corruption matter.  I am merely one 
of the many witnesses.  Advocate Noko clearly does 
not understand my role in this investigation.  She 
also chooses to ignore the fact that the Durban 
Central CAS 781 investigation was initiated by none 
other than the financial head in the province 
20 
Brigadier Lawrence Kemp.  It is inconceivable that 
Brigadier Kemp knew about my aspirations as 
alleged by Advocate Noko unless he obviously 
colluded 
with 
me 
to 
discredit 
the 
Pro vincial 
Commissioner. 
 
Had 
Advocate 
Noko 
however 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 138 of 258 
 
bothered to examine Brigadier Kemp’s statement in 
Durban Central CAS 781 she would have established 
the origin and source of the entire investigation.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Her 2.8 Chair. 
“The 466 case, the bribery case is investigated by 
the members of the police who fall under the 
command of Booysen who is the complainant in the 
466 case.  Their objective dealing with the case 
becomes questionable especially with this – with the 
10 
Cato Manor case cloud hanging over their heads.  
This I believe would shake their credibility and the 
court would view all these in favour of the two Mr 
Panday and Colonel Madhoe.”  
My response thereto Chair. 
“Advocate Noko has been [indistinct] in stating that 
the investigating officers objectivity are questionable 
especially with the Cato Manor case cloud hanging 
over their heads.  The investigating officers in these 
matters are as follows:”  
20 
Then I mention the case numbers and the investigating off icers’ names.   
“Colonel Von Loggenberg, Colonel Du Plooy and 
Colonel Herbst.  None of these investigating officers 
were ever attached to the Cato Manor unit.  They are 
not implicated in the Cato Manor issue at all hence 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 139 of 258 
 
their credibility cannot be questioned as implied by 
Advocate Noko.  In any event it would appear that 
Advocate Noko is [indistinct] the functions of the 
courts as her credibility of witnesses ought to be 
pronounced upon by the courts.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Her 2.9 Chair. 
“Major General Booysen being the complainant in the 
466 case interfered with an exercise control in this 
case even going to an extent of determining and 
10 
deciding who visits Colonel Madhoe when he was 
detained in the Durban Central police c ells in the 466 
case.  This is exhibited by the letter that was issued 
on his direct instruction to the Durban Central police 
station Brigadier V R Stokes.  This letter dated 
September 2011 addressed to all relief commanders 
and cell commanders and titled Visitation Durban 
Central CAS 466 N Madhoe provided that – provided 
that the …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Provise that and then quote on the direct instructions.  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“On the direct instruction – provided on the direct 
instruction from Major General Booysen only the 
following persons were allowed to visit him.  One 
Major General Booysen and Major General Moodley 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 140 of 258 
 
etcetera.  What is amazing with this is that Major 
General Booysen issues an instruction regarding who 
must visit a suspect in  a case that he is the 
complainant in himself.  Further he also has a 
visitation right in this as it appears in the letter him 
being mentioned as a number 1 amongst those who 
are allowed to visit Colonel Madhoe.  By the way 
what would a complainant want to visit a suspect in 
their own case for?  That is unheard and smacks of 
an agenda.” 
10 
My response to that Chair. 
“Advocate Noko is seriously misguided to suggest 
that I interfered with an exercise control in Durban 
CAS 466.  Had she complied with the National  
Prosecuting Authority Policy guidelines she was at 
liberty to consult with me to establish the facts which 
I shall detail now.  As the Provincial Head of the 
Hawks it is incumbent upon me to exercise control 
over all investigations conducted by the Hawks in 
KZN.  The National Directorate of the Hawks were 
20 
kept abreast of – that is now Dramat – were kept 
abreast of all developments in this investigation.  To 
suggest that I interfered with the investigation is akin 
to suggest that Advocate Noko herself is in terfering 
with the functions of her subordinates.  There is 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 141 of 258 
 
nothing mysterious regarding my instruction with 
regard to visits to Madhoe.  Initial investigations 
revealed complicity by officers within SAPS. This 
entry into the occurrence book was made to ob viate 
attempts by officers with mollified intentions.  I have 
dealt with this matter regarding my being the 
complainant above.  Once again the [indistinct] and 
tone of Advocate Noko’s contentious appears to be 
that of a defence counsel rather than that of a 
prosecutor.  The fact that I had not visited Colonel 
10 
Madhoe at all subsequent to his arrest or that I have 
not personally communicated with him directly or 
indirectly 
demonstrates 
that 
Advocate 
Noko’s 
assertion that it smacks of an agenda is misguided 
and I reject it with contempt.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her – Advocate Noko’s paragraph 2.10. 
“The allegation that the accused in 466 Mr Panday 
and Colonel Madhoe wanted Major General Booysen 
to pre-date a report in the 781 case in order to ha ve 
20 
the Section 205 subpoena set aside [subpoenas for 
access 
to 
the 
bank 
account 
records] 
and 
consequently bribe Major General Booysen to do that 
does not really hold water because the fact that if 
there has been any corruption [bribing of Major 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 142 of 258 
 
General Booysen] that took place would not make the 
corruption and its successful prosecution impossible.  
As Sections 3B and 4[1}B of the Prevention and 
Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act 12 2004 state 
the alleged report in the 781 case that it was alleged 
was to be a predated to invalidate the Section 205 
subpoena did not suffice to proof fraud or any 
offence against anyone especially Madhoe and 
Panday who are alleged to have bribed Booysen for 
the predating of his very – of this very report.  This 
10 
report is made out to be the evidence in the 781 case 
to prove fraud against Panday and Madhoe but one 
wonders why it would not be seen in this way by the 
SCCU.  If then there is no fraud that could be proven 
by the SCCU in the 781 case why would Colonel 
Madhoe and Mr Panday bribe Booysen or anyone for 
that matter in respect of 781 case using this report?  
One would expect that they would know what is 
contained in 781 case against them as they are part 
of it.  They would know what they did not even know 
20 
– they would know what they did …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  What they did … 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“They did to even know what this report has against 
them especially Colonel Madhoe who was then a 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 143 of 258 
 
procurement 
official 
who 
processed 
the 
accommodation documents leading to  the 781 case.” 
My response to that Chair. 
“Advocate Noko chooses to be deliberately obtuse 
for one there is indeed a strong prima facie case 
against Madhoe and Panday in Durban 781.  The 
[indistinct] by Colonel Madhoe and Mr Panday to 
derail the investigation in 781 emanates from the 
unsuccessful application to have the Section 205 
subpoenas set aside.  Although the report in question 
10 
itself does not contain prima facie evidence of a 
crime being committed predating the report to a date 
before the application for the Section 205 case have 
rendered 
the 
205’s 
and 
subsequent 
evidence 
obtained inadmissible.  Information in this report 
contained evidence gleaned as a result of the 205’s 
in other words if I had predated this report it would 
have had meant that the  investigators had obtained 
information legally before obtaining the Section 205 
subpoenas.  Advocate Noko rightly indicated that 
20 
Colonel Madhoe was from the procurement section.  
He had inadequate legal knowledge to argue the 
points raised by Advocate Nok o her sentence one 
would expect that they would know what is contained 
in 781 case against them as they are part of it they 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 144 of 258 
 
would know what they did to even know what this 
report has against them especially Colonel Madhoe 
who was then the procurement offic ial who processed 
the accommodation document leading to the 781 
case and then I say is incoherent and difficult to 
understand.  For instance how and why would 
Panday and Madhoe know what is contained in 781?  
They were the suspects in the matter not the 
investigators.  Furthermore they knew exactly what 
was contained in the report since they had illegally 
10 
obtained it.  Two copies of the report were found in 
Madhoe’s vehicle on two separate occasions.  A third 
copy of the report had fingerprints that matched  
those of Panday on it. All this evidence is contained 
in the dockets and for some unknown reason appears 
not to have been considered.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  2.11 of Noko’s 
memorandum Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Colonel Madhoe alleges to have met with Booysen 
approximately 
eight 
– 
on 
eight 
occasions 
at 
Booysen’s instance regarding the Cato Manor Unit 
shootings incidents before the 466 case came into 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 145 of 258 
 
being.  I will say no more regarding t his issue as the 
Cato Manor matter is sub-judice.  This however 
indicates a history of some sort being shared by the 
two.  Colonel and Major General Booysen.  Now they 
are complainant and accused in the 466 case 
respectively.” 
My response to that Chair. 
“Advocate Noko once again prefers to exclude 
reliable evidence in Durban Central CAS 466 in 
favour 
of 
Colonel 
Madhoe’s 
allegations 
who 
10 
obviously stands to gain by making these false 
allegations.  There is objective evidence in 466 such 
as cell phone tower and communication correlation 
analysis obtained from cell phone records of Colonel 
Madhoe and Mr Panday.  SMS’s sent by Colonel 
Madhoe, affidavits from Brigadier Madonsella and 
Sergeant Govender as well as the cell phone records 
of Colonel Madhoe.  Mr Panday  and myself to prove 
that the converse is in fact true.  It was Madhoe in 
fact contacted myself on the number of occasions.  
20 
The objective evidence will prove that the meeting 
took place before the so called Cato Manor matter.  I 
would venture to suggest that by not considering the 
objective evidence and to favour unsubstantiated 
submissions by accused smacks of an agenda itself.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 146 of 258 
 
If Advocate Noko had regard to all the available 
evidence at her disposal she would have come to a 
conclusion – she would not have come to the 
conclusion she has.  Advocate Noko should be aware 
that my involvement in this Cato Manor matter is not 
sub judice and has been disposed of in my favour at 
the time that Govern had ruled in my favour chair.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Once again – once again the last sentence in this 
10 
paragraph 
in 
inverted 
commas 
“this 
however 
indicates a history of some sort of – shared by 
Madhoe and Booysen now they are complainant and 
accused in the 466 case respectively.  It is 
incoherent and difficult to understand.”  
12. – 2. 12 of her memorandum.  
“There is an assumption that is not substantiated by 
evidence that Mr Panday is part of the alleged 
bribing of Booysen and Madhoe.  This assumption is 
derived from the position that they both are suspects 
20 
in 781 case.  This will not stand in court as evidence 
for corruption against them.”  
My response thereto: 
“Advocate Noko fails to ascribe these assumptions to 
anyone.  Neither the investigators nor I have come to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 147 of 258 
 
this assumption.  If she herself is coming to this 
assumption she once again fails to consider prima 
facie evidence in 466.  For instance a statement of 
the person who drew the money on behalf of Mr 
Panday.  Mr Panday’s fingerprints on the documents 
in question and the paper  slips found amongst the 
money offered to myself which is linked to Panday’s 
bank account to name but a few.”  
Then 2.13 of her memorandum. 
“This is one of those your word against mine kind of 
10 
cases as it is Major General Booysen’s word against 
Madhoe’s.  However Section 208 of The Criminal 
Procedure Act of 1977 provides that a conviction may 
follow on evidence of a single witness.  The 
cautionary rules may be applied by the court in this 
case especially given the background of this case 
and the challenge there is that Booysen himself 
allege to be hitting back at Madhoe for the damning 
information that Madhoe has against him relating to 
the Cato Manor case.  Madhoe alleges that Booysen 
20 
is trying to silence him with the allegation of the R2 
million corruption for the damning information that he 
has 
against 
him. 
 
A22: 
 
a 
former 
SAPS 
Constable Sandesh Dhaniram 
confirms 
the 
possession of the information about Booysen by 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 148 of 258 
 
Colonel Madhoe in the form of discs.”  
And my response thereto: 
“This is not a matter of your word against mine.   If 
Advocate Noko had regard to all the evidence it 
would be clear to her that there is not only direct 
evidence – witness evidence – but also objective 
technical evidence and circumstantial evidence to 
support my version.  No such evidence other than 
false allegations by the suspects exists to support 
Madhoe’s claims.  The reference to Dhaniram’s 
10 
statement 
is 
rather 
surprising 
as 
a 
careful 
examination of this statement actually confirms my 
version.  Advocate Noko failed in her duty to stu dy 
the outcome of my successful application in the 
High Court.  See Booysen v NDPP.  Had she done 
so she would have realised that no such evidence 
as purported by Madhoe exists.  I fail to understand 
how Advocate Noko seeks to accept an untested 
and unfounded allegation by a suspect who faces 
serious consequences in this regard.  I also quote a 
20 
passage of a finding by the then Appeal Court in 
S v Zuma.” 
I do not think it is necessary for me to quote that Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No stop there sorry. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then her paragraph 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 149 of 258 
 
2.14: 
“If the legal strength of the Section 205 subpoenas 
were based on the date on the report as it is 
alleged hence Colonel Madhoe wanted it predated 
to invalidate the subpoenas.  It is inconceivable 
that any person let alone a Colonel in SAPS a 
person of Colonel Madhoe’s calibre was working on 
these issues of procurement at SAPS would not 
know that SAPS could simply obtain other Section 
205 subpoenas that would tally with the new 
10 
predated date in the report.  His problem would not 
have been resolved.  Therefore one may ask why 
would he bribe Booysen when this would not 
provide 
a 
permanent solution 
to 
his 
alleged 
problem.  This dating of the report would not have 
caused any subpoenas to be set aside because  it is 
not evidence to 781.  Neither does it have any 
bearing as far as the procedural steps and 
prerequisites for obtaining a Section 205 subpoena 
is concerned.  This was proven by the SCCU in the 
20 
781 case.” 
My response thereto: 
“I dealt with this adequately above.  I would like to 
add however that Advocate  Noko wrongly assumes 
imputed knowledge of law by Madhoe.  She herself 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 150 of 258 
 
points out that he works at Procurement who hardly 
if ever works with Section 205 subpoenas.  What 
concerns me however of this paragraph is once 
again the tone of her assertions.  She is once again 
deliberately 
obtuse 
and 
misconceives 
the 
allegations against Madhoe.  I find it disquieting 
that the SCCU 6 to prove allegations by suspects.”  
Her paragraph 2.15: 
“Further it appears that Bo oysen was not the 
investigating in the 781 case but Van  Loggenberg 
10 
and others.  Therefore a question arises that why 
would a favour of the predating of the report that 
should be in the possession of those who are 
investigating 781 case be sought from Booys en not 
the investigators.” 
My response thereto: 
“Advocate Noko 
once 
again 
demonstrates 
the 
ignorance of the evidence at her disposal.  The 
report in question was undated when I received it.  
It is common practice in SAPS Communication 
20 
Protocol for the recipient to date stamp and they 
sign reports when they receive it.  It is this date 
Madhoe wanted me to predate.  The fact that 
(background noise) a potential witness in this 
regard was not interviewed is indeed worrying.”  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 151 of 258 
 
2.16 of her memorandum: 
“The cellphone records purported to reflect the calls 
between Panday and Madhoe do not indicate any 
specific 
crime 
having 
been 
planned. 
 
It 
is 
haphazard conversations with slang and profane 
language between the two people that one cannot 
really make out what issue was  being discussed as 
a lot of different issues were being spoken about.  
More especially a criminal offence cannot be 
deduced as constituted by the fact from their 
10 
conversations in the cellphone records available.  A 
question maybe asked that on what basis was an 
inference drawn by the police investigators that 
these conversations pertained to or constitute a 
criminal offence being planned by the couple 
specifically that they were planning to bribe 
Booysen.  The alleged authority to intercept the 
calls for which Madhoe and Panday calls are 
alleged to have been recorded was issued during 
June 2011 for June to September  2011.  This 
20 
appears to go way before the 466 case.  This then 
ties up with what the SCCU has revealed that 
people’s calls were being recorded and the period 
tallies with the 781 case rather than the 466.  One 
then wonders if the 781 recordings are not utilised 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 152 of 258 
 
in another case – the 466 case which is not 
permissible.” 
And my response thereto Chair: 
“Advocate Noko I respectfully submit could not have 
listened to all the records between Panday and 
Madhoe.  Her conclusion otherwise would be 
irrational and subjective.  It is evident that she has 
considered some of the recordings to the exclusion 
of others which may very well have resulted in the 
wrong conclusion.  It is common cause that 
10 
Panday’s calls were intercepted prior to the 466 
case.  In any event if she would argue that the 
recordings are admissible it does not render them 
illegal.  Furthermore there is enough prima facie  
evidence to secure a s uccessful prosecution in 
466...” 
That is a bribery case. 
“…without presenting the Act 17 deceptions as 
evidence.  This I understand was the stance and 
view of the investigator.  In conclusion it is 
20 
unfortunate that Advocate  Noko seeks to accuse me 
of having an agenda in these investigations.  Even 
if it is was true and I deny this strenuously the ADS 
pronounced itself adequately in this regard.”  
Then I refer to a quotation from the case of Mr  Zuma. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 153 of 258 
 
“I suspect that the converse is true.  This matter 
has been outstanding for more than two years.  I 
think it is no coincidence that this coincides with 
the renewal of Provincial Commissioner ’s contract.”  
That was the Provincial Commissioner  Ngubeni.  His five year contract 
had expired Chair and this – this report by Advocate Noko coincided 
with the renewal of her contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  “The fact 
that Advocate Noko has failed to return the case 
10 
docket to the investigating officers and spite a 
request by him and the subsequen t timing of 
dismissal 
leaves 
me 
with 
this 
inescapable 
conclusion.” 
And then I request: 
“I hereby request you to summon all the relevant 
documents to your office and to have same 
evaluated by an independent team from your office.  
This issue has been widely  reported in the local 
media.  It has drawn various negative remarks from 
20 
the public and commerce.  It is in the best interest 
of the judicial system, the National Prosecuting 
Authority, 
the 
South 
African 
Police 
Service, 
Mr Panday, Colonels Madhoe and Narainpersad for 
these issues to be ventilated in an appropriate 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 154 of 258 
 
manner once and for all.”  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
in 
her 
conclusion 
in 
her 
memorandum 
Advocate Noko among other things says that she has decided to 
decline to prosecute Colonel  Madhoe and Mr Panday for corruption or 
any offence in the 466 case.  She says:  
“This is due to lack of reasonable prospects of a 
successful 
prosecution 
as 
explained 
and 
substantiated above.  Further there appears to be 
agendas among the parties and the score is to be 
settled.” 
10 
So – but with – with regard to the Madhoe corruption case - just to go 
back – your evidence was that he was arrested at the time when the 
actual money that he had brought to you as part of – for bribery 
purposes was there.  Photos of the money was taken.  Thi s happened 
in the basement of the building where your offices are and there were 
police officers who were waiting for him to come into the building.  
They saw him coming in.  They saw both you and him interacting and as 
you were leaving and you had agreed with them - that is the police 
officers concerned – that you would give a certain indication to say 
they must in fact pounce on him and I seem to think you could not 
20 
remember whether you gave the indication or not last time – last time 
when you were giving evidence - but they - while you were walking 
towards the lift they – they jumped and they arrested him.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair yes I did – my 
evidence was that I did give them the indication.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 155 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you did yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I touched my head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You touched your head ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then I – I was 
scared that they did not see me.  I actually started slapping myself on 
the head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To make sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That they – that they 
10 
see the signal but over and above that Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is also the 
video recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was the video recording as well.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of him putting the 
money in my car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and – and do you know personally that all of this 
evidence or statements by these police officers and your own 
statements all of that were in the docket?  You know that that was the 
20 
case at least before you were suspended or so on.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  As Chair is 
aware you have direct witness evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was contained in 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 156 of 258 
 
the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
You 
have 
circumstantial evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was contained in 
the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There was technical 
evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Such 
as 
the 
fingerprints of Madhoe on one of the documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
There 
was 
the 
evidence of Panday’s brother ’s girlfriend’s father.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who they had taken to 
the bank to withdraw a substantial amount of money.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which was linked to a 
piece of paper – a bank piece of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
think 
it 
was 
Nedbank. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 157 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
was 
found 
amongst the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There was the actual 
Act 70 interceptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There was also the 
tower movement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That we – a205. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There was also the 
SMS’ that he had sent me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was downloaded 
from my – from my phone and his phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in spite of all that 
evidence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She says there is no 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then part of what you are saying it is difficult 
to understand how she could say that in the light of that evidence that 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 158 of 258 
 
was there? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is part of what you are saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair to me it is 
incomprehensible that she can come to that conclusion of.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Over the years I have 
dealt with many cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And she herself – she 
10 
herself says that the Criminal Procedure Act.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Provides for a single - 
single witnesses evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But here it is not a 
single witness.  She says it is his word against mine.  There are people 
who actually saw that.  There is a 252A.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  From the DPPs Office.  
20 
There is the coordinator.  There is the investigator.  It is just 
overwhelming Chair.  There is just no ways that anyone could come to a 
rational conclusion that there is no case against Panday and Madhoe.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and to the extent that she says among other 
people you – to the extent that she may be saying you may have had an 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 159 of 258 
 
agenda. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To have the Provincial Commissioner falsely 
implicated and prosecuted?  Ha d she sought your own statement about 
that allegation?  Had you been approached by her or anybody to say 
there is this allegation that you are part of an agenda to do this and did 
you get a chance to refute that before you saw this memo?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair not once. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  From my arrest had I 
10 
ever been given an opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In terms of a warning 
statement or in terms of a response.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Not once. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So these assertions that she makes in her 
memorandum that - at least we can talk about you - that you may have 
been pursuing a certain agenda about the Provincial Commissioner and 
that you may have been pressurising Panday and Madhoe to falsely 
20 
implicate the Provincial Commissioner.  When she wrote this memo she 
had never herself or through anybody put this to you to hear your 
version? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Never ever Chair not 
once. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 160 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Following the 
submission of your letter was there any – did the – did the decision 
change at all? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
I 
think 
I 
testified about that earlier on.  That is when subsequent to this letter of 
mine 
where 
Advocate 
– 
because 
this 
was 
addressed 
to 
Advocate Nxasana. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And subsequent to 
that a few things happened.  One is that Advocate  Jiba stood to be 
prosecuted for the cases in which I was the complainant and 
Advocate Gerrie Nel had been in the process of reviewing the 
withdrawal of these charges and the nolle prosequi and it was at that 
point where myself and I think McBride thought we were – Mr McBride – 
we thought we were on top of things now we were now at last making a 
headway.  Then the next thing there was the newspaper article about 
Advocate Nxasana not being fit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And unfortunately he - 
he was elbowed out and replaced Advocate  Abrahams.  So nothing 
came – as we speak to date none of Panday or Madhoe or 
Narainpersad or General Ngobeni has appeared in front of a court on 
any of these charges. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 161 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I am sorry.  Let me go back to this issue what 
we dealt with just a few seconds ago about Advocate  Noko.  The other 
persons who she is talking about when she says certain people have an 
agenda.  Apart from you it would be whom or do you now know? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair I think she is 
referring to General Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  General Moodley was 
in charge of Crime Intelligence in the Province.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
the 
guy 
responsible for the Act 70 interception - communication interceptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Which 
is 
Colonel Padayachee reported to General Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There was at that 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Panday allegedly was 
20 
called in by – by Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And played some of 
the intercepts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 162 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In order to force him 
to implicate the Provincial Commissioner.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am not aware of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not think that 
took place because when it was reported in the media at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Panday quoted things 
10 
that was definitely not said during the Act 70 interceptions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which he said he had 
heard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I have got my – I 
have got my reservations whether Moodley actually did that or not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not think it 
happened. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I think she is 
referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To General Moodley. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 163 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But am I right to say she was – you were one of the 
people she was including when she said in the memo certain people 
have agendas to? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Falsely implicate the Provincial Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  It is just that it is – it seems to be 
concerning.  I mean she was acting in a senior position of Deputy – 
DPP in KZN.  Would that not be the highest provincial position under 
the National Prosecuting Authority for the Province or not really?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
are 
you 
referring to Advocate Noko? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocate Noko was 
the – the Senior Prosecutor in the Province (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the whole Province yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And here you were a very senior member of the – of 
the police service – a member of the Hawks.  If there was such an 
allegation that you were involved in something so wrong to have a 
20 
senior – the Provincial Commissioner of Police falsely implicated one 
would have expected that before she made the decision such as 
withdrawing charges she would have at least heard what you had to say 
about this allegation that you were part of an agenda.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair my response is 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 164 of 258 
 
twofold.  One is I agree with Chair.  That is – that is a normal course 
that we always follow when – when there are representations from 
accused persons but what concerns me most about this memorandum of 
hers.  It is almost an attack against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the case.  It 
makes me look like the accused person.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
the 
actual 
accused person is like the complainants.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The tone of her whole 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would have at least 
expected - as Chair says – to have at least been given – given me an 
opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To state my case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
way 
I 
did 
eventually to Advocate Nxasana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you know whether she ever saw your – your 
comment that you said to Mr Nxasana or you do not know? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 165 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  If we can then 
move on to the next point that Chair had raised for attention and that is 
the letter – the covering letter specifically by Advocate  Noko.  With 
your leave if I may hand up two documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What are these? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Yes. 
 
Before 
you 
Chair 
General Booysen had provided two documents.  The first documen t 
which is marked blue – which is a blue document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Is 
the 
letter 
that 
Chair 
had 
requested.  It is the letter from Advocate  Jiba.  Apologies – it the letter 
from Advocate Noko to Advocate Jiba which is the coverin g letter that 
Chair requested specific to the application for authorisation about the 
racketeering charges to be instituted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will need to mark this as EXHIBIT Z(J).  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last one was I. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This will be EXHIBIT Z(J).  That is now the letter that 
20 
is blue coming from Advocate  M Noko-Mashilo acting Director of Public 
Prosecutions KwaZulu-Natal and addressed to Advocate  N Jiba Acting 
National Director of Public Prosecution dated 15 August 2012. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that Advocate M Noko-Mashilo is the same 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 166 of 258 
 
person who so far we have been referring to as Advocate Noko?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair this is but just the covering 
letter and it does not include the annexures that are referred to in this 
letter.  In addition to this document General  Booysen had also provided 
another letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if I may EXHIBIT Z(J) as has been 
marked now relates to the first authorisation of racketeering charges.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next document which was also 
provided and yet to be marked relates to the second authorisation for 
racketeering charges.  Chair will recall that the first authorisation was 
done by Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the second was by – the second 
authorisation was by Advocate Shaun Abrahams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  With your permission are we to mark 
20 
the next document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  This document will be EXHIBIT Z(K) and it is purports 
to be an application for authorisation in terms of Se ction 2(4) of POCA 
121 of 1998.  It is from Advocate  M Noko Director of Public 
Prosecutions KZN and it is addressed to Advocate  S K Abrahams NDPP, 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 167 of 258 
 
yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen if we could first 
quickly refer to EXHIBIT Z(J) - that is the blue document.  That is the 
covering letter that was sent by Advocate  Noko to Advocate Jiba in 
relation to the first authorisation of racketeering charges.  Is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  It specifically then talks to 
10 
enclosing - as referred to in paragraph 1 – an application as – sorry 
paragraph 1.1 is the application for authority.  1.2 is the proposed 
indictment and 1.3 are the draft authorisations.  The recommendation is 
for the authorisation to be granted.  This particular document - while we 
do not have the annexures to this document – was signed in fact by 
Advocate Noko? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Who signed – do you know 
who signed the indictment that ought to have been enclosed with this 
document? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if my memory 
serves me correctly I think it was Advocate  Maema. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and are you aware 
whether or not in accordance with procedure there was a prosecution 
memorandum and/or the PowerPoint presentation?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 168 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In support of this application? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think there was a 
memorandum Chair but not a PowerPoint presentation.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Thank 
you 
and 
is 
this 
the 
authorisation that was then subsequently challenged to which a finding 
was granted by Justice Gorven? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  If I can then move on to 
10 
EXHIBIT Z(K). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if you would 
allow me I just want to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Contextualise the date 
on this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  This is not soon after 
Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa was moved sideways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
Noko 
was 
appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And this coincides 
with a number of events that occurred at the same time.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 169 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  During this period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
was 
still 
busy 
supervising the Panday investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
the 
Amigos 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  
Both 
which 
Noko 
10 
subsequently withdrew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then recommend 
my – recommended my prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The events that you refer to that were happening 
roundabout this time.  Do you want to deal with them or not – they are 
20 
not necessarily in your evidence?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair it is in my 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHANWESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I just wanted to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 170 of 258 
 
bring it to Chair’s attention that the timeline here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Is at the exact same 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was after Mlotshwa 
refused to withdraw against. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The people in the 
legal case. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He refused to sign our 
indictment – mine and Cato Manor ’s indictment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He gets replaced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Noko withdraws those 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Against the Amigos 
20 
groupings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And also Panday and 
Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 171 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
in 
turn 
recommends my prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I do not know whether wh at I am going to ask 
will relate to the next document that we have just referred to - which 
Ms September will deal with - namely the question of whether when 
Ms Noko – if you do know – when Ms Noko recommended your 
prosecution the documents that Mr  Mlotshwa – Advocate Mlotshwa had 
said he would not sign it if they were not before him whether they were 
before Ms Noko?  You might or might not know (intervenes).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair all I can – the 
10 
response I can give is what she says in the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She refers to the 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In terms of Section 
2(4) of POCA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
proposed 
indictment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then the draft 
authorisations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then she says: 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 172 of 258 
 
“I have perused the documents…”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
“…and 
recommend the application.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but we do not know which documents?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She perused.  They might or might not include the 
ones that Advocate Mlotshwa thought were important to be furnished we 
do not know.  Is that right or we do?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know Chair 
10 
but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I will venture a guess 
that they were not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  I think it will be important to establish 
well one, what the documents were that Advocate  Mlotshwa were 
insisting should be there because if he signed or recommended 
prosecution without them it would be improper and then of course it 
would be necessary to apply one’s mind to the question whether he was 
correct on insisting on those documents and three whether in making 
20 
the recommendation Ms  Noko had those documents.  Obviously if 
Advocate Mlotshwa was wrong to insist on those documents then even 
if Advocate Noko recommended without those documents that might not 
be anything negative towards her, but if those documents were 
important to be before the person taking the decision to recommend

and she recommended without those documents then one would need to 
look at that.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  Before we move 
onto the next document this blue document is the first authorisation in 
2012? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The second document which is 
Exhibit ZK is dated 18 August 2015 which relates to the second 
authorisation. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That is so Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now it is stated in your affidavit at 
page 23, paragraph 75 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON: I’m sorry, where are you?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Apologies, Exhibit ZA, it’s in his 
main affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one with the statement?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page 23 paragraph 75. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The – what is recorded in paragraph 
75 talks to the evidence that you’ve already presented alluded to by the 
Chair in that advocate Mlotshwa refused to sign the indictment un til he 
received certain documentation. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That is so Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 174 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was the refusal to sign the 
indictment then related to the second authorisation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No it was related to 
the first authorisation Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you, if we then look at Exhibit 
ZK there does not appear to be many paragraph references but if you 
look at page two...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page two of? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page two of Exhibit ZK. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay of the statement?  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair the new document that we 
just entered in, there’s the blue one and then there’s the other.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that J? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   ZK. 
CHAIRPERSON:   K okay, alright what page on that one or paragraph?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So paragraph one reads that this 
document is essentially an application for fresh authorisation of 
racketeering charges against you and several others. On page two i t 
talks to certain documents that ought to have been enclosed which we 
do not have in support of the application and 1.1 lists it as the 
20 
application for authority, 1.2 the fresh prosecution memorandum, 1.3 
the proposed indictment and 1.4 the draft authoris ations, is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now in this regard earlier you 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 175 of 258 
 
referred to a prosecution memorandum and a PowerPoint presentation.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Are those the two documents that 
may have been referred to in this particular letter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I suspect so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you, just to highlight, on page 
three 
of 
the 
same 
Exhibit 
ZK 
paragraph 
four 
details 
the 
documents/evidence upon which – rather which were considered for 
purposes of this application and in particular it lists at least seven 
points.  If I could quickly go through them, with your leave Chair, 
10 
paragraph 4a informs – or rather paragraph 4 reads: 
 
“I have received full briefings from the prosecution team and 
resolved that the concessions made by counsel on behalf of the ANDPP 
during the hearing of Booysen’s application were incorrect”.  
 
And it seeks to then address certain points which is listed from 
a to g. If we could then turn to page five paragraph six talks to copies 
of affidavits or documents which are relevant to Booysen insofar as the 
racketeering charges and predicate charges are concerned and in doing 
so lists various documents, including the High Court application where 
Booysen is a respondent, documents relating to the monetary awards, 
20 
statements of Colonel Aiyer? dated 3 August 2012, 31 August 2012 and 
13 March 2013.  Statement of Benkek osi Mntanyane, Ndundlu dated 31 
July 2012.  Statement of Andrew Caarsen Cockrin dated 16 May 2012, 
statements of Commissioner Brown dated 8 and 9 May 2013, 
statements of Nkosi Nati (indistinct) dated 3 August 2012 and 15 March 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 176 of 258 
 
2013, statement of Simphiwe Siprin Matonsi dated 15 March 2013 and 
statement of Bongani Mandla Mkhize dated 1 August 2012 and its 
essentially on the basis of this submission that at paragraph eight on 
page six the request is made – or rather, apologies, paragraph seven 
on page five where the submission is made that there’s sufficient 
evidence linking them to racketeering and predicate offences as will be 
shown in the fresh prosecution memo enclosed herewith.  At paragraph 
eight, kindly indicate that you are available for a full briefin g with the 
entire prosecution team.  This letter is dated 19 August 2015 
notwithstanding the date of 18 August 2015 on the front page.  This is 
10 
then the request for authorisation under which you are currently 
charged. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: If you could then go back to Exhibit 
ZG which is the Mokgoro report on page 121, we’ve dealt with the 
prosecution memo and without detracting fro m the detail that is stated 
in here it continues to page 127 which very briefly, at sub -paragraph 
5.2.1.13 deals with the manner in which the Booysen matter was dealt 
20 
with.  The next pertinent point is at the bottom of page 127 which talks 
about – or rather it is titled at paragraph 5.2.1.14 which is Mosing’s? 
version.  Who exactly was advocate Mosing in the context of the 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it had become 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 177 of 258 
 
clear after advocate Mamabolo and advocate Kruger who was in ch arge 
of the desk to go through the documents before it’s eventually given to 
the NDPP.  When they removed advocate Anthony Mosing then took 
over their position.  I later on refer – when I talk about advocate 
Mosing under the heading of prosecutors Chair bu t at this point what I 
would like to mention is that on the 8 t h of March 2012 that was barely 
two and a half months into the investigation after the Sunday Times 
report, I’m in possession of a copy of handwritten notes which advocate 
Mosing kept minutes of the meeting which it’s – where it indicates that 
there was a meeting between himself, members from IPID, ICD then, 
10 
the Minister of Police who was Minister Nathi Mthethwa at the time and 
also the then acting National Commissioner which would have been 
General 
Mkhwanazi, 
he 
wrote 
(indistinct) 
though 
it’s 
actually 
Mkhwanazi.  Now from those notes Chairs...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON: I saw those notes in your bundle earlier on do you 
know where they are?   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may Chair, yesterday during 
consultation with General Booysen there’s – it’s a document that 
General Booysen had prepared which is a typed version of the copy of 
the note which I will direct you to now...(intervention).  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja let’s find them first and then you can hand up the 
typed version, let’s find them where they are first.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  My humble apologies Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it not Annexure 23 or something?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s Annexure JB12 which is in file 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 178 of 258 
 
ZA page 145. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found Annexure 12?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
Is 
that 
the 
typed 
version?   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No that’s the copy that is in the file.  
CHAIRPERSON: The handwritten one first then we can look at the 
typed version.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   What page is it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s Exhibit ZA page 145. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s indeed the 
10 
copy chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just get there I remember that I got the 
difficult to read – yes thank you, then you say there is a typed version.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   General Booysen had typed up his 
understanding of the note and with your leave I beg to hand it up.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, did you find it easy to read this, I’m 
thinking how reliable your typed version is, have you got a typed 
version from the author that would obviously be much more accurate 
but you might – if you are able to read quite well the notes, that’s fine.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair this copy is not 
20 
very – it’s not a very good copy the one that I – the actual one is 
clearer than this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   In the typed version 
there’s a lot of places where I – where it’s impossible to decipher.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 179 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so we can take this as your – as a typed 
version based on your understanding of the handwritten notes and if 
and when Mr Mosing does give evidence he can tell us what his notes 
actually say. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Okay Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. I think that – so that one can’t put 
this when maybe one could put this – one can’t put this in here because 
it’s not part of this affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think we must make it an Exhibit on its own the 
10 
last one was K so this will be L, that will be Exhibit ZL and it’s the 
typed version of the handwritten notes at page 145 of Exhibit ZA as 
understood by Major General Booysen.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please proceed General Booysen. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I’m reading 
from the typed version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   The meeting was – it 
20 
says 8/3/12 meeting with the ICD the n there are three named, 
Gamanyana, Glen Angus and Mr Khuba, then it reads,  
 
“first meeting, meeting with Minister of Police SAPS – acting 
National Commissioner Nkankla Vilikazi, I think he recorded that wrong 
because it’s Nkonazi and then it reads on, mer ge two teams.  Mandate 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 180 of 258 
 
– matter pending since December 2011 – hit squad allegations – on the 
typed version, Chair I’ve – those bold letters are my own bold letters 
it’s what I read from the minutes but I made them bold myself, they’re 
not bold in the ...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s not bold in the handwritten notes.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right so it 
says, 
 
“wants arrest by this week worked throughout weekend and 
then the other one the underlining is also by myself Chair and the  
boldness and that – in this particular line Chair coincides with what 
10 
emanated during the – Judge Makoro’s Commission of Enquiry or the 
Enquiry not the Commission of Enquiry.  Challenged to rope in NPA 
prosecutors – not submit to KZN DPP but to NDPP and t hen it reads on 
General Mabula met with Malotshwa promise – then I cannot figure out 
what’s written there and then only – join only next week.  It mentions 
51 cases, those J56 (19) inquest dockets, 12 and then I couldn’t make 
out what he wrote. Now 6 cased  that are needing other investigation 
outstanding, I wrote verbatim Chair – brought 6 cases which they want 
to bring here and fields I cannot make out what he wrote, wants 
decision by tomorrow.  Suspects 12 in unit – Booysen PCOC, that PC 
20 
would be at the Provincial Commissioners office at organised crime unit 
office.  Evidence of photos which General Mabula – with General 
Mabula’s team need to get.  Way forward whether and prosecutor – will 
join next week.  ICD offices Durban briefed NDPP”.  
 
The things that are highlighted Chair is – it says first meeting 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 181 of 258 
 
with the Minister of Police SAPS and the acting National Commissioner 
of Police and it says, merged two teams, mandate matter pending since 
December 2011, hit squad allegations.  Wants arrest by this week, work 
throughout weekend.  Now Chair my interpretation of that is if you are 
there with the Minister, my interpretation of this is that was one of his 
demands and then very importantly Chair, challenge to rope in the NPA 
prosecutors, not submit to KZN DPP b ut to submit to NDPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the KZN DPP at that time, would it have been 
advocate Malogwa? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and what exactly was  your 
concern or problem with the recordal as you understood it to be in 
relation to the Minister holding this meeting and calling for arrests 
within that week?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I might add that 
subsequent to the Sunday Times ap ologising to myself I had a radio 
interview with Carima Brown from 702 channel where some of these 
issues were discussed and when I left the studio, when I arrived home I 
received a text message from Carima Brown from 702 that Minister 
20 
Mthethwa had issued a media release again saying what I had said 
during the interview.  The following morning she phoned me and she 
said to me that she’s inviting the Minister to the studio to discuss these 
issues, would I be prepared to come back to the studio and I said to 
her, you can tell the Minister I’ll meet him in the studio tonight and she 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 182 of 258 
 
said would you come and I said I would. I arrived there at the studio 
that same evening he didn’t arrive so they dialled him in and during this 
conversation Carima Brown indicated t o the Minister that I’m in 
possession of these minutes.  He was, in the beginning a bit cagey 
about the meeting, that he hadn’t seen the minutes but then she asked 
him a very pertinent question whether he had a meeting with the 
prosecutors which he confirmed on national radio or 702.  She pointed 
out to him that he had no business meeting with prosecutors which I 
agree with.  He tried to justify his involvement by saying that there 
were allegations of human rights abuses and he referred to one 
10 
particular case where a person by the name of Mkhize got shot and 
killed.  I expected him to use that example so I took documents with me 
to the studio which I gave to Carima Brown because the Mkhize family 
had sued the Minister of Police, Minister Nathi Mathetwa at th e time, 
for the unlawful killing of Mr Mkhize but the Minister at the time, Mr 
Nathi Mathetwa deposed to an affidavit in a civil matter saying that the 
shooting by Kato Manor was justifiable and it was lawful and 
reasonable and he was at pains to explain, on the one hand he 
says...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   The shooting was justifiable and the other hand he 
20 
says he was concerned about...(intervention).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s why I got 
involved but we also pointed out to him then th at he’s taking up a 
different position that he had taken up in the Marikana matter where he 
testified saying that his understanding of the role of the Minister is to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 183 of 258 
 
deal with matters of policy and we pointed out to him – and that’s my 
understanding as well Chair but we pointed out to him that there was a 
discrepancy in how he approached these two matters.  In the Kato 
Manor case he sought to get involved in operational matters.  He 
obviously denied that he had gotten involved in the operational matters 
but my interpretation of the minutes is that he had met with prosecutors 
and demanded that we be arrested and that was as early as 8 t h of 
March 2012 barely before any statements had been taken Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   One would have expected that if the Minister  of 
Police had any concern that the National Prosecuting Authority was not 
10 
acting diligently in regard to the prosecution of any particular people 
that maybe the police had put together enough evidence for, one would 
have expected that he would raise that with the Minister of Justice and 
that it would be the Minister of Justice if he thought that it was proper 
to raise any concern that would raise the concern with the NPA.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So here – and the notes, if they correctly reflect the 
people who were there or if they correctly reflect – ja if they correctly 
reflect the people who are there, there’s no indication that the Minister 
of Justice was at that meeting.   
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do you recall who the Minister of Justice was at 
that time?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I think it was Minister 
Masutha Chair at the time. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 184 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it 2012 – 2015, what...(intervention). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   2012, no it wasn’t 
Minister Masutha, wasn’t it...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Minister Gadebe. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Gadebe that’s right 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay thank you.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair, if I can then take 
you to your statement which is in Bundle ZA we are now, effectively 
dealing with your paragraph references from 77 and 78 on page 24 – 24 
10 
of your statement.  General Booysen you have made various references 
to other perceived interferences by Minister Mthethwa, if I can take you 
to page 146 which is Annexure JWB13.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Excuse me, what page is it?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   147 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen can you identify 
this document please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s a letter 
written by advocate, I think it was, Mahema at the time, it’s addressed 
20 
to IPID, Mr Angus and to the person who was leading the Kato Manor 
investigation General Mabula and it’s from the office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions, South Gauteng.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you and what is your 
observations in relation to this letter?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 185 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s evident 
from this letter, it’s a request to have a further interview with one – well 
the so-called key witness, Colonel Rajen Aiyer and in paragraph two it 
states, 
 
“the plan is that we also consult Sikomboso Ndlovo the 
gentleman from the Civilian Secretariat in the Minister’s office who was 
introduced to us by Colonel Aiyer on Friday the 5 t h of October.  It 
appeared from what Sikomboso Ndlovo was telling us that he has a lot 
of background information or possible clues to unlock some crucial 
information that we will require going ahead with the ca se”. 
10 
 
Chair I just find it a bit curios that a person from the Minister’s 
office gets involved in an investigation at this level unless, of course 
he was a competent witness in this matter which he’s not.  So my 
conclusion here Chair is – and that’s why I’ve added this to my 
statement, I’ve already imputed that the Minister himself had been 
involved with prosecutors which was wrong but here someone from his 
office – from the Civilian Secretariat also now somehow gets involved 
with the witness, Mr Aiyer which we now know was a dismal witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you’re linking it with what you said earlier on, 
namely what was the Minister of Police doing having a meeting with 
20 
prosecutors, one.  Two, what is somebody from the Minister ’s office 
having to – what does he have to do with these matter, that’s what you 
are raising. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s what I’m 
saying Chair. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 186 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  If I can then take 
you to the next...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry you did tell us – you say this letter, the copy 
we have at page 147 doesn’t show the author but you did say it was the 
DPP for Southern Gauteng?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair on the original 
– not the original, the copy that I have I think advocate Chauke signed 
the letter but if Chair would look at the top it says with enquiries, G S 
Mahema, that’s advocate Mahema so if they followed the same 
10 
procedure that we do in SAPS the person drafts the letter, his name is 
in the top left under enquiries and it’s signed off by the head of the 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but this one was signed by who?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   If my memory serves 
me correctly it was advocate Chauke Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Chauke ja okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In continuance of your evidence 
concerning your understanding of Minister Mthethwa’s involvement I 
ask you to go to page 149 which is Annexure JWB14 of the same 
20 
Bundle Exhibit ZA.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  There appears in the middle of 
the page an email and I shall read from Advocate KMA Chauke sent 12 
June 2012 05:14 pm to Cyril S Malotshwa, CC Toko, J Majokwene, 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 187 of 258 
 
Palessa, NP Matse, Sello Mahema, Raymond R Matengwa the subject is 
Re Indictment Cato Manor.  What is your observation in relation to this 
particular email? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair this is clearly a 
communication between Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa and Chair I just 
want to say something about Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshw a not to 
confuse matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There is another 
Advocate Mlotshwa he is JJ Mlotshwa.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  From Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  So this Mlotshwa here 
that is Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa who received this email from 
Advocate Chauke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I think that was 
pursuant to the conversations they had about the signing of documents 
which Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa seems to have been reluctant to 
20 
do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the KZN acting DPP at the time?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And there were also 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 188 of 258 
 
other issues that they expected him to do.  But Chair the second to last 
paragraph Advocate Chauke writes: 
“Another issue of concern to me is the delay in you 
issuing the instruction of the reopening of the 
inquest in view of the fact that you have been 
requested to sign the indictment which must be 
preceded by your decision to reopen the inquest.”  
And then the following sentence is the one I want to point out Chair.  
“If this makes you uncomfortable please indicate so 
that I may urgently take the matter up with the a cting 
10 
NDPP which was Advocate Jiba at the time as well as 
the Minister.” 
Now he does not say there which Minister it is Chair.  It could be any 
Minister but…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when I read this I wrote on the side which 
Minister is this? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair my – the 
only inference that I can draw given the history of Minister Mtetwa’s 
involvement his officers involvement the only inference that I can come 
to that it – he was referring to the Minister Mtetwa.  That does not 
20 
necessarily implicate Minister Mtetwa but the question that I would 
pose is why would Chauke have the liberty to say well he wants to take 
it up with the Minister?  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which would have 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 189 of 258 
 
been inappropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the meeting to which you referred to earlier and 
in respect of which you have produced a typed version of certain notes, 
handwritten notes indicate that that meeting in which the Minister is 
said to have attended with among other public prose cutors or ND – NPA 
people was on the 8 March 2012?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this letter or email is dated 12 June 2012?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  A few months later – 
three months later Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And then it is the 
last part to the Mokgoro Report.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think that last paragraph may be 
important. Mr Chauke says to – or Advocate Chauke says to Advoc ate 
Mlotshwa in the last paragraph: 
“I do not want to step on your toes I was informed 
that you agreed and arranged with the ANDPP for 
somebody and then I do not see outside to do the 
prosecution of this matter.  If you have now a change 
20 
of heart please indicate so that we may resolve it as 
soon as possible.” 
It refers to a possible what bringing in of outside people?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 190 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  If we  may 
then just turn to again Exhibit Z[G] which is the Mokgoro Report and 
again without detracting from the detail of Mosing’s version as recorded 
from page 127 and on.  The report then deals with the evaluation of 
racketeering case law at page 130.  In pa rticular at page 135 it talks to 
the Booysen case.  And just to highlight Jiba’s evidence on Booysen.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you back on the Mokgoro Report?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And what page?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So Chair will recall that 
10 
Mosing’s version – just missed it now.  Mosing’s version without de…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got it.  127 hey?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And without detracting from the 
particularity of detail in here the report continues to deal with the 
evaluation of racketeering case law on page 130.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in particular deals with the 
Booysen case on page 135. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  To highlight to you Chair at 
page 138 Jiba’s evidence on Booysen is recorded at paragraph 430 to 
453.  And effectively this section in relation to the Booysen case as 
considered by the inquiry ends at page 143.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 191 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The only other reference to the 
Booysen case or the pertinent sections then is at page 311 of the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether – whether Mosing is the one 
who made the handwritten notes is it not?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether the issue of those notes and 
what they mean and who was present at that meeting is covered in 
anyway in the report?  I was trying to see whether that is covered.  
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If you could just – there is 
certainly reference to the notes – to the – to the – to the meeting Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that reference is at page 
128. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Paragraph 396 and 397. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  But as to the notes in itself I do 
not specifically recall mention made of such notes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see that in paragraph 397 of the report it says 
notably Mosing does not state that my – my and other prosecutors from 
outside of KZN were also at the meeting and had already been tasked 
with prosecuting the matter.  Yes okay continue.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  As alluded to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 192 of 258 
 
earlier at paragraph – sorry at page 311 of the report the ev idence 
related to the cases are then evaluated and the Booysen prosecution is 
specifically dealt with under paragraph 6.1.5.1 running from paragraph 
1068 until 1078 on page 313.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Reference is also alluded to 
Booysen in page 327 and although it relates to other evidence as such 
under 7.1 – paragraph – sorry paragraph ja 7. Or clause 7.1 Jiba 
reference is made specifically at paragraph 1127.2 where it reads:  
“With regards to the Booysen prosecution the 
10 
evidence establishes that she allowed and in fact 
enabled 
the 
independence of 
the NPA 
to 
be 
comprised.” 
At paragraph 1127.3 it reads: 
“Furthermore in the Booysen matter despite initiating 
the prosecution she did not consult with the DPP 
whose approval was require d and when a dispute 
ensued between Mlotshwa and Chauke she refused 
to get involved and assist in resolving the issue.  
This reflects a lack of leadership.”  
20 
Save to state that the recommendation which is being made on 
paragraph – on page 335 has since been  implemented Chair which is 
public knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Those are the pertinent 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 193 of 258 
 
sections of this report which deals with Booysen.  I do wish to however 
direct your attention to page 345.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is an annexure of the report 
Chair and it is quite a detailed chronology of events.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  For the record in these 
proceedings there are certainly dates and events which are informed by 
this witness’ evidence that I believe needs to be read into the record 
and with your leave if I may I will do so?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you want to do?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just read certain dates and 
events into the record which is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine ja.  Okay.  The important ones.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Important to – or not just 
important but it is actually informed by the evidence of this witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  If I could then s tart on 
page 345. 
“23 December 1998 Jiba’s application to be admitted 
20 
as an attorney struck from the role.  
6 August 2000 Jiba appointed as DDPP.”  
Page 346. 
“29 November 2007 Decision to prosecute Zuma is 
taken by Mpshe and McCarthy. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 194 of 258 
 
12 December 2007 Jiba suspended from NPA.  
28 December 2007 Indictment is served on Zuma.  
June 2008 Zuma launches application to review and 
set aside the decision to prosecute him.”  
Next page 347. 
“12 September 2008 Nicholson J being Justice 
Nicholson hands down judgment in favour or Zuma. 
12 January 2009 SCA overturns Judge Nicholson’s 
decision to review the decision prosecute Zuma.  
10 February 2009 Zuma’s legal representatives

provide representations to NPA.  
3 March 2009 Prosecution team considered Zuma’s 
representations.” 
Next page 348. 
“1 April 2009 Mpshe…”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would Mr Zuma’s legal representations when 
they were made be relevant for purposes of this witness’ evidence?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Because the witness – this 
particular witness certainly alludes to  certain allegations in relation to 
President Jacob Zuma former President Jacob Zuma.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I am saying – I am asking why is the question 
of when he – Mr Zuma’s lawyers made representation to the NPA about 
his case – Mr Zuma’s case would be relevant to Major General 
Booysen’s evidence?  Is there anything I am missing?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair this particular witness 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 195 of 258 
 
makes a submission and that submission relates to the prosecutorial 
system.  I am happy to deal with that…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I did not understand anything that you said so 
far to – to be – to the effect that his prosecution may have been 
connected with the prosecution or non-prosecution of Mr Zuma.  My 
understanding was that his prosecution was concerned with the 
investigations that he or his team were involved in relating to Mr 
Panday, Colonel Madhoe and the Provincial Commissioner of SARS.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That does not seem to me to be connected in any 
10 
way. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  I am happy 
to then exclude such portions and deal with the rest of them if I may?  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :   
“11 June 2009 which is on page 348 Jiba refers 
suspension to Labour Court invoking the Protected 
Disclosures Act.” 
Next page 349. 
“4 September 2009 and 8 September 2009. Mrwebi 
20 
and Jiba sign settlement agreements with NPA.  
9 September 2009 Jiba…”  
CHAIRPERSON:  On reflection Ms September on reflection it does not 
appear to me that there is much purpose to be served in just reading 
those dates because we have got them here.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 196 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay not a problem Chair.  It is 
then placed before the DCJ and I am happy to move on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry.  If I can then take you 
back to your statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of the dates might be important to emphasise in 
relation to specific evidence by the witness.  So if there is specific 
evidence by the witness in relation to a specific incident th en you go to 
those dates to indicate the context.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.  We are 
10 
now on page 25 of your statement in particular paragraph 83.   
As it pleases Chair.  We are now on page 25 of your statement in 
particular paragraph 83.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page did you say?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it is Exhibit Z[A].  If I can 
ask for the following slide to be shown and that is slide 3.  Sorry slide 
4.  Excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a slide we have not seen before?  
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have not seen? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No we have not seen it as yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If we could – Chair you could 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 197 of 258 
 
find a copy of that slide in Exhibit Z[D].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Z[D]? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is the point to be made – is the slide quite 
important for the point to be made – to be shown? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  What page at Exhibit Z[D].  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is Z[D] page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So if we could look at Z[D] 
10 
page 4 while they – the witness then addresses his evidence from page 
83 in his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  The next theme of your 
evidence General Booysen is that you address prosecutors and 
individual prosecutors within the system.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Or those who had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that I did not hear.  Just repeat that.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The next theme. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The next theme ja is?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Of General Booysen’s evide nce 
is that he now addresses prosecutors, individual prosecutors within the 
system in the context of the investigations, the four investigations that 
he has given evidence to. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 198 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay he will give evidence about certain prosecutors 
now?  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen the slide 
before you is a combination of four interlinking circles and one circle is 
marked periphery. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please explain what 
this slide represents? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair in my statement 
I tried to articulate what is in…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In this diagram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There were a number 
of investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
The 
Panday 
investigation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which I have testified 
about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The Amigo case which 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 199 of 258 
 
I have testified about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The Cato Manor 
investigation which relates to the investigation against myself and Cato  
Manor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then also the 
looting of the Secret Services account case.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The point I am making 
10 
here Chair is that invariably in all these cases th e same prosecutors 
appear as prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  For the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Well in the Panday 
investigations certain prosecutors – let me start with the Cato Manor 
one Chair.  The prosecutors that I have mentioned under Cato Manor 
also figure in the withdrawal of charges in the Panday matter and the 
Amigos case.  Also included in my statement Chair which is not part of 
20 
this diagram is that in other cases that I hav e knowledge of such as the 
so called rendition case against Shadrack Sibiya the general and 
General Anwa Dramat which subsequently also led to the suspensions 
of Mr McBride for a so called second report that he had changed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 200 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The SARS matter, the 
so called rogue unit of Mr Johan Van Loggenberg. Ivan Pillay and Mr 
Pravin Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Inevitably the same 
prosecutors are always involved with those prosec utions.  On the one 
hand they prosecute people like myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Pravin Gordhan, 
Johan Van Loggenberg, Anwa Dramat, Shadrack Sibiya, Mr McBride, 
10 
Sesoko, Ncuba.  I cannot recall who the prosecutor against G lynnis 
Breytenbach was.  So you have this group of prosecutors always 
involved in the prosecutions of people that are busy with investigations 
of corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In this – in the SARS 
matter Mr Johan Van Loggenberg, Ivan Pillay and Pravin Gordhan that 
has been well documented in the media.  They were running a parallel 
investigation into some of the subjects that we were investigating…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In criminal matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It is just – I just find it 
very odd that the same prosecutors.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 201 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Are always involved in 
prosecuting 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would call them the 
corruption busters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then the same – 
some of the same prosecutors are then involved in the withdrawal of 
charges against people that we have been investi gating and that 
already been prosecuted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Well you were referring to the fact that you deal 
with this in your statement.  I do not know whether you would like to go 
to your statement and mention which prosecutor was involved in which 
matter and so on and so on. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In fact Chair if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The diagram before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I saw that it does…  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Presents… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have but I got the impression that I may be wrong it 
20 
seemed to have or I thought it had only a few.  I thought he might be 
having more people in mind I am not sure.  Does he have all?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has all? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 202 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In fact it is a representation of 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what is in the statement. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  All of the prosecutors that he is 
about to deal with individually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the scheme of this 
10 
particular diagram is that Panday Investigation is the blue circle, 
Amigos case is the red circle, Looting of Secret Service account is the 
yellow circle, Cato Manor is the green circle.  Where these circles then 
interlace those would represent public prosecutors.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think the point that Major General 
Booysen you want to make I do not know if you are confident th at you 
have made it sufficiently clearly or maybe Ms September was still going 
to come to it to simply say in – or prosecutor – so and so on – so and 
so was involved in that case, and that case and that case this is what 
he did in that case.  In that other  case he was also involved and this is 
20 
what happened in that case.  In that other case the other one was 
involved and that is what he did.  I thought maybe that might be what 
you wanted to say but you might or might or not feel that you want to.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I am scared that 
I might leave out some points. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 203 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to read your statement because you 
have.. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   I will just refer to it 
Chair I will not read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay just refer to it to refresh your memory.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair I have – 
what I have done is I have – I am naming certain prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That I feel were not 
necessary state capturers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But enabled state 
capturing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then after that I 
deal with specific individuals within the Hawks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That I would say 
20 
enabled state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then also to a 
lesser extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 204 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Members who enabled 
state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair if I should 
start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN  WESSEL BOOYSEN:  With Advocate 
Nomgcobo Jiba. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before we get there.  If I may?  
At paragraph – at page 26 of your affidavit you allude to the priority 
crimes litigation unit. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can – there is already been 
evidence placed before this commission in relation to that through 
another witness but can I ask you to just clarify and explain what you 
mean by highlighting this particular unit?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN  WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the PCLU 
Priority Crimes Litigation Unit was created by Presidential Proclamation 
20 
20 – on the 23 March 2003.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Now their focus 
should be genocide, crimes against humanity, Fore ign Military 
Assistance Act, Intelligence Services Act and International Terrorism.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 205 of 258 
 
The point I want to make here is that I find it very strange that some of 
the prosecutors from this – from the PCLU would involve themselves 
with investigations against th e likes of McBride, Dramat, Shadrack 
Sibiya for cases I will not say that are not serious but they are 
relatively much less serious than the things that they should be dealing 
with.  Such…  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  For instance they 
would prosecute certain people that I have now mentioned for fraud.  
That does not fall into the remit of what they should be doing in the 
10 
first place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja you – the point – part of the point you 
are making is they were created for purposes of dealing with very 
serious matters which fall within a certain category.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know genocide you mentioned and you mention 
others and you say but they were now involving themselves in matters 
that in terms of priority you would not expect them to be really 
involving themselves in.  That is the point you make?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Absolutely Chair and I 
20 
will refer to this later on again when I talk about Law Enforcement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Within the Hawks you 
have and I will deal with that later.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 206 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  You have crimes 
against the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOY SEN:  Of whom Brigadier 
Ncaba is the head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Also involving 
themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  With these I would – I 
10 
will not call them menial investigations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But much less serious 
investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I just want to 
point out this statement of mine I deposed to last year November 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Well I compiled in last 
20 
year November already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And in this statement 
of mine I mention that those prosecutors should be dealing with cases 
and that is before I hear d the evidence of Mr Agrizzi.  I did not even 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 207 of 258 
 
know who Mr Agrizzi was.  And here in my statement I said that they 
should be – should have been dealing with matters such as Bosasa, 
state captures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The Gupta’s, 
Steinhoff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  All those cases which 
seriously affected the economy of the country.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But yet they choose to 
involve themselves with investigations against people that are 
investigating corruption.  Not all of them are from the PCLU Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Some of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And – but they work 
closely together with the prosecutors that I will address.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That you mention yes.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In my – in my 
20 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then take you to page 
27 of your affidavit and to paragraph 89 in particular.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph? 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 208 of 258 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So page 27 paragraph 89. 
CHAIRPERSON:  59 or 89? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  89 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 27? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 27 of Exhibit Z[A] which  
is the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I know we have to juggle with all of these..  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So we will work through the 
affidavit now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With these three lever arch files here.  Z[A]?  
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Z[A] the statement or affidavit 
rather. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the page – 27? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Paragraph 89. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you proceed we are at either one 
minute to four or 4 o’ clock.  Normally we would stop at 4 o’ clock but if 
you are not too tired Major-General Booysen I am quite happy that we 
continue maybe for another hour to try and cover more ground.  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am good with that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with you? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Let us proceed then.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 209 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 89 if you make a 
certain assertion in relation to your view based on your e xperience 
within the police please explain your view to the Chair.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair in this – in this 
paragraph I make the assertion that these prosecutors that I am 
mentioning in my statement acted at the behest of Advocate  Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who was doing the 
bidding 
of 
the 
then 
State 
President 
Mr  Jacob Zuma 
and 
also 
Richard Mdluli. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When I consulted with 
Advocate September yesterday she said to me it is a wild statement to 
make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I have to at least 
substantiate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And Chair I would like 
to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To do it in the 
following way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I just mention a few 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 210 of 258 
 
things.  Over and above what transpired and evolved over the last 
couple of years the inescapable conclusion – that is the inescapable 
conclusion that I come to - but I would like just to point out a few 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When Advocate Jiba 
arrested – was part of the team who arrested Advocate  Gerrie Nel 
during this Jackie Selebi trial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Subsequent. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess you mean authorised the arrest or I do not 
know if she would have authorised?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No, I think she – 
between. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is the police who would arrest.  Is it not?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes.  Ja well rather 
not coincidentally the same General  Mabula who arrested Gerrie Nel 
also arrested me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In conjunction with 
20 
Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  After Gerrie Nel – the 
case against Gerrie Nel was withdrawn Jiba was suspended for her role 
in his arrest. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 211 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I did not hear that. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  After Gerrie Nel – the 
case against Gerrie Nel was withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocate Jiba was 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Suspended, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For her role in the 
arrest of Gerrie Nel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She challenged the 
matter in the Labour Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And strangely the 
person who came to her aid there and who deposed to a statement in 
her favour was Richard Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So there was an affidavit in her application to 
the Labour Court and there was an affidavit included in her application 
that had been deposed to by Mr  Mdluli? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know the 
20 
exact extent of the statement Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Where it was just a 
confirmatory or whether it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 212 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  His own statement 
but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was some? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The statement was in 
favour of – of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Supporting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Supporting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Her application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The second thing 
Chair I would like to point out is on 8  September 2010 the husband of 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba – Sikhumbuzo Booker Nhantsi – whom I 
believe was an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He had been charged 
for theft of trust money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Was convicted.  I 
cannot remember what the sentence was.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
on 
8 September 2010. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 213 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
– 
the 
then 
President Mr Jacob Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Expunged 
his 
conviction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the third point I 
want to make Chair to validate my paragraph of 89.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And it was a letter 
written by Richard Mdluli to the then State President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In November 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In which he says: 
“In the event that I come back to work…”  
Because he had now been suspended.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At the time. 
20 
“In the event that I come back to work I will assist 
the President to succeed next year.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now 2000 and? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  2011 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 11. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 214 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  November 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is that a letter that we have or?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  It is not a letter we have?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know about it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I know about it and 
this was widely reported in the media at the time Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think this was just 
10 
before the Polokwane ANC Conference Chair.  I am not too sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Polokwane if I recall correctly was 2007.  2012 
was Mangaung. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think it was that one 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
Chair 
having 
regard to what the evidence leader told me – it is a wild statement to 
make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I just wanted to 
mention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Those are highlights 
of. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 215 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Connections that I 
draw. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are making, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But there are also 
other events that makes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That causes me to 
come to that conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I start off by 
saying that Advocate Jiba has been at the centre of controversy at the 
National Prosecuting Authority for a better part.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of the – of a decade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For one she frustrated 
lobby groups to have the criminal charges against the Previous 
President Mr Jacob Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Reinstituted.  She 
frustrated them by releasing the so called Spy Tapes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They were eventually 
I think – it eventually landed up in the SCA.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 216 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Where they – where 
they were compelled to release it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She also paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to refresh ones memory.  The Spy case – the 
Spy Tapes case – am I correct in thinking that initially what the 
Democratic Alliance - because I think they are the ones who brought an 
application to court.  What they sought was to be furnished with those 
tapes and what you are saying is that Advocate  Jiba been Acting 
10 
National Director of Public Prosecutions at the ti me would have been 
the one to make a decision whether to release those tapes or not but 
you say she refused.  Is that what you are saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She frustrated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say she frustrated that process?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is – that is 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair as you would 
recall the. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The Spy Tapes were 
central to the withdrawal of criminal charges against the.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The previous State 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 217 of 258 
 
President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair Advocate Jiba 
was also involved – and it has come out now in Judge Mokgoro’s 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  With the withdrawal of 
charges against Richard Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She was also involved 
10 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She was also involved 
with – well Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach who insisted on prosecuting 
Jiba was then suspended – Breytenbach insisted on prosecuting Mdluli.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
She 
was 
then 
suspended by – by Advocate Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She was found not 
20 
guilty in that disciplinary hearing after her suspension.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
was 
now 
Breytenbach. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am trying to remember but maybe you might 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 218 of 258 
 
remember better.  The suspension of Advocate  Breytenbach related – 
did it relate to her handling of the Mdluli matter or was it on something 
else or is that the detail that you cannot remember?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I cannot recall 
what they suspended her for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But it is my view and 
it is borne out by a number of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For instance the - 
10 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mokgoro Report. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
- 
it 
was 
Advocate Breytenbach’s instance on prosecuting Mdluli that eventually 
led her to be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If – if I may Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the actual timeline to the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the timeline to the Mokgoro 
Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 219 of 258 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 364. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Reference is made there that: 
“On 26 April 2012 Mrwebi writes to Breytenbach 
advising that the NPA should no longer be involved 
in the Mdluli matter and that IGI is the appropriate 
entity to deal with the matter.  Four days later on 
20 April 2012 Breytenbach is informed that she is 
suspended by Jiba.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The other 
10 
date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That you may find. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does not say what she was suspended for or 
does it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Unfortunately not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The other date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That was alluded to earlier in relation 
20 
to the letter by Mdluli to the former President.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At – in the timeline at page 355. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is recorded: 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 220 of 258 
 
“On 
3 November 2011 
Mdluli 
writes 
to 
the 
President, 
Minister 
and 
Police 
Commissioner 
indicated that the charges against him are false and 
based on a conspiracy.  He also indicates that he 
will help the President be successful in the 
following year ’s elections.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the following year ’s election were not general 
elections in the country.  It was elections of the party.  Is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the party? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In 2012. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
once 
Breytenbach was acquitted that still did not deter then Mr – 
Advocate Shaun Abrahams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To prosecute her on 
spurious charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the person who 
then appears on the scene is an Advocate  Raymond Mathenjwa. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 221 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who prosecuted her 
on these spurious charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair this – the same 
Raymond Mathenjwa – Advocate Mathenjwa I mention it later on and I 
find 
it 
strange 
that 
when Advocate Abrahams 
reauthorised 
my 
prosecution on the Monday he appeared in the – in the court here 
somewhere in Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know where 
Breytenbach appeared as the prosecutor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that very same 
Friday he is in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja.  I think you mentioned some time ago.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 93 you deal with 
20 
Advocate Jiba’s role in prosecuting you for racketeering but you have 
certainly dealt with that in extensive detail earlier.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 29 which is paragraph 94 
you deal with additional involvement of Jiba in processes.  Can you 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 222 of 258 
 
please deal with that part?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
obviously 
through the nature of the work that I do and having known a number of 
prosecutors I engaged with them and I spoke to a number of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the feedback that 
I would get from the prosecutors was that the National Prosecuting 
Office in Pretoria was like a battle ground.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There were – there 
10 
were two factions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Those who wanted to 
prosecute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Independently without 
fear or favour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then there – there 
was what – and I have written a couple of articles about which I would 
20 
refer to – to the cabal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
When 
Advocate Nxasana was appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 223 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was clear from 
media reports that both Advocates  Jiba and Mrwebi had become 
extremely recalcitrant with regards to Advocate  Nxasana.  He actually 
much later when I eventually met him confirmed that to me in person.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And to that extent he 
invited a retired Constitutional Court Judge Mr  Jakob – Justice Jakob – 
to try and establish what was going on at the NPA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And it emerged during 
10 
his attempt – during that inquiry that both Mrwebi and Jiba had been 
extremely recalcitrant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To the extent that I 
think in the end he recommended a Judicial Commissioner of Inquiry.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair a number of 
disparaging remarks had been made against Advocate  Jiba.  I think all 
that came out in the Justice  Mokgoro Inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I will not deal with 
that now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair then I conclude 
the section with Advocate  Jiba that she had been suspended. That 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 224 of 258 
 
there was the inquiry but the events have overtaken my testimony.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So we now know that 
the state  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The State President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Has – has dismissed 
her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair then I will move 
onto Advocate Sello Maema. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Before 
we 
move 
onto 
Advocate Sello Maema I just wish to alert you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That mention has been made of the 
Justice Jakob Fact Finding Commission in the Mokgoro Report as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 317. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
When 
I 
met 
Advocate Maema the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 225 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He looks like a wise 
old man.  He is starting to get a bit grey and he is like a gentleman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in the beginning I 
thought – my view of him was that he is a wise old man.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But it emerged later to 
me that he either was not wise or he had been – been captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because invariably he 
10 
seems to be and I describe him as the “go for person”.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Whenever there is a 
problem with certain prosecutions and I highlight some of those 
prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I have referred earlier 
on Chair to the statement that he made in the criminal investigation 
against Jiba in which he lied. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Under oath to say a 
witness had been killed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may it has just been 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 226 of 258 
 
pointed out to me that again in this Mokgoro Report at paragraph 253 
page 85 it is recorded that Breytenbach was involved in the prosecution 
of Mdluli to answer the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As you have raised earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think that – that was. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Made clear but I was not sure about whether there 
was anything in the letter of suspension that indicated whether the 
suspension was linked to her handling of the Mdluli matter but you may 
10 
have read something that suggested that that was the case.  I cannot 
remember but I am sure you will – you will check. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I have already 
covered paragraph 101 with regards to the fabrications in the 
prosecution memorandum by Advocate  Maema. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To prosecute myself 
and members of Cato Manor. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well the fabrications, 
the omissions and the misrepresentations.  I am also aware that 
Mr Johan Van Loggenberg one of the accused in the so called SARS 
matter. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 227 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Had also logged a 
complaint against Advocate  Maema. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
According 
to 
the 
advocate for Van Loggenberg he also lied under oath in an application 
which Mr Van Loggenberg had brought in the Gauteng High Court.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you just please clarify who do 
you say lied under oath?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
According 
to 
10 
Mr Johan Van Loggenberg from SARS who has also been prosecu ted – 
he filed a complaint with Advocate Abrahams against Advocate  Maema 
and Advocate Mzinyathi in which he accuses – that is where 
Van Loggenberg accused Maema also of lying under oath.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
have 
not 
independently verified that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then Chair he 
also gets involved with the so called Rendition case against 
20 
Mr McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
For 
apparently 
updating the report.  Now Chair that case went to court and eventually 
it was withdrawn. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 228 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 105 you talk about the 
suspensions of Mr Robert McBride, General Dramat and yourself were 
held to be unlawful in court whilst the others did not challenge their 
suspensions and it was consequent to these persecutions various 
Hawks 
and 
SARS 
investigations 
were 
compromised. 
 
Which 
investigations are you specifically referring to in your view?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair I have 
already given evidence that in my absence of two years that the Panday 
investigations had become dormant.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  With regards to the 
SARS investigations – Chair what happened is I was oblivious to the 
investigation SARS was busy with.  I was invited to the Nelson Mandela 
Foundation by a journalist to attend to a meeting and when I asked her 
what the meeting was about she sent me a text message and the 
invitation basically rea d only if you are invited you can come to this 
meeting.  So I said to her well I am not invited.  She said no but you 
are one of the subjects of discussion and I said I would get you there.  
So I arrived there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And as I walk in I saw 
Mr McBride there.  So I thought at least there is someone who I know 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now at the Nelson Mandela Foundation?  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 229 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Offices? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In Sandton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and you said you got the invitation from 
who? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  From a journalist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From a journalist? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And Chair when I 
10 
walked in we all recognised each other.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But we have never 
met before.  We recognised each other from – from media articles and 
photographs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  
Johan Van Loggenberg, Ivan Pillay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
All 
the 
usual 
20 
suspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Were all there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then we – it was 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 230 of 258 
 
the University of the Witwatersrand conjunction with various other 
universities.  They were doing an investigation into state capture.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
there 
is 
a 
Professor – I think Lipkin or something.  He was leading the discussion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
during 
the 
discussion each one of us had to give – make a small presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Where we fit into this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Into this story and 
then after that we decided amongst ourselves to have a separate 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then to bring all 
our notes with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And it is at that point 
where as myself, Van Loggenberg, Pillay and company were talking and 
20 
General Dramat also eventually joined us in the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He did not attend the 
first one and he sent his brother.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 231 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It became clear at 
that point that we were doing criminal investigations and simultaneous 
to that SARS was doing SARS investigations against a number of 
individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That we were also 
investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that is why I 
always maintain that the three – the Cato Manor story, the Cato Manor 
10 
Death Squad story, the SARS Rogue story and the so called Rendition 
story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They are inextricably 
linked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
At 
page 
106 
you 
talk 
about 
Advocate Maema’s involvement in the Brett Kebble matter. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Yes 
Chair. 
 
He 
publically took responsibility in the media for changing the prosecutors.  
20 
At the time which was I think Gerrie  Nel and Andrea Johnson who is 
still with the National Prosecuting Authority and not surprisingly 
Mr Kebble was eventually acquitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He was also involved 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 232 of 258 
 
with the charges against Mr  (indistinct) who was a senior police officer 
who was charged for defeating the ends of justice after he allegedly 
interfered with the witness Mr Agliotti.  I understand that matter did not 
proceed either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then I conclude 
Chair by saying: 
“It can be no coincidence that Advocate  Maema…” 
Having been from Mmabatho I think:  
“…gets roped in…” 
10 
To use their own phraseology: 
“…gets roped in, in the prosecution of Booysen, 
Dramat and the likes of that I have now detailed 
here.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in the process – 
in litigation he has perjured himself on more than one occasion.  I have 
opened criminal cases against him and he is – he actively attempted to 
defend Advocate Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if I could move 
onto Advocate Anthony Mosing? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mosing yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just in line with the slide that we 
have before us Advocate Maema was involved in the Cato Manor 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 233 of 258 
 
investigation only in relation to those four investigations at least?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
You 
please 
proceed 
then 
to 
Advocate Anthony Mosing. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I just want to 
add one thing about Maema.  It is my understanding that none of these 
prosecutors including him – I see Justice Mokgoro addresses that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I have not gone into – 
into the detail but there have been suggestions from other prosecutors 
that their appointments to prosecute in KZN was irregular.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And Maema was one 
of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
Advocate Anthony Mosing – his name started to feature with the 
withdrawal of charges against Mike  Mabuyakhulu and Peggy  Nkonyeni. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
At 
the 
time 
the 
investigating officer - Colonel Piet Du Plooy – with forensic auditor – I 
think it was Mr Trevor White.  I cannot recall was summoned to the 
office by – by Advocate Mosing and there they indicated to – to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 234 of 258 
 
Du Plooy that the case is not very strong and I recall Du  Plooy at the 
time reported to me that they were summoned to Pretoria and it was 
clear to them that they already had made up their mind.  He said to me 
at the time at the conclusion of the meeting he basically said them he 
does not see the need for this meeting because it looks like they – they 
are not going to proceed in any event.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I think that is 
where the stage was set. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
ball 
started 
rolling 
for 
the 
eventual 
withdrawal 
of 
the 
cha rges 
against 
Mike Mabuyakhulu and Peggy  Nkonyeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  By Advocate Noko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In KZN. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then move to page 34 of 
your 
affidavit 
and 
paragraph 
110 
at 
which 
you 
deal 
with 
Advocate Moipone Noko? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I think I have 
already alluded to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
In 
my 
view 
at 
Advocate Noko was appointed and at least one of the points has been 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 235 of 258 
 
confirmed by Justice Mokgoro to – well Advocate Mlotshwa was 
removed 
and 
replaced 
by 
Advocate Noko 
to 
do 
what 
Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa refused to do and that is to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Sanction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The application for – 
for racketeering charges against myself and Cato Manor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Hm. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
this 
was 
the 
same 
Advocate Noko who was then appointed and who refused to withdraw 
the racketeering – apologies – who facilitated the withdrawal of the 
corruption charges against Toshan  Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She withdrew the – 
Advocate Noko withdrew the charges against Toshan  Panday and 
Navin Madhoe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Okay 
and 
who 
appointed 
Advocate Noko? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
my 
20 
understanding is that those appointments are done by the State 
President but the State Pres ident would not just out of the blue appoint 
a person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They must – I suspect 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 236 of 258 
 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Came as – after a 
recommendation by Advocate  Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes I – it would be important to check whether it 
is the President who makes the appointment or the NDPP but I thought 
maybe you can check overnight. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including acting appointments in regard to such 
positions as DPP.  The NDPP one I am sure is made by the President 
but the DPP one I am not sure.  So you might check up on that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the three main 
points I am making with regards to Advocate  Noko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She was put there as 
a proxy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She had to facilitate 
the withdrawal of charges against Panday and Madhoe which eventually 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She had to withdraw 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 237 of 258 
 
the charges against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which she eventually 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then she also did 
what Simphiwe Mlotshwa refused to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
that 
is 
to 
recommend my and Cato Manor’s prosecution.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you know (background noise) 
whose proxy did Advocate  Noko act according to your submission now?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   It would have been 
Advocate Jiba because Advocate Jiba is the one who wanted Advocate 
Mlotshwa to sign our – my prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The recommendation for your prosecution?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then a year later 
20 
Advocate Noko was appointed permanently as the DPP by the State 
President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And then I’ve already 
testified with regards to Noko’s role with Advocate Mahema in the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 238 of 258 
 
misrepresentations 
and 
the 
falsehoods 
and 
the 
prosecu tion 
memorandum and the Powerpoint presentation to have us prosecuted.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in particular the criminal 
complaint that she laid pursuant to that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair.  
I’ve detailed those in my affidavit which is attached to my statement.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair in the recent 
interviews that were televised when the – for the appointment of a new 
NDPP Advocate Noko was one of the shortlisted ad vocates. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And one of the 
panellists asked her about the Booysen matter and her response was 
that she had found it on the court roll when she got there, almost 
absolving herself of any involvement and when I watched it I said to 
myself how can a person who knows this is being broadcast nationally 
sit and lie to a panel like that.  She had signed both the covering 
letters for my and Cato Manor’s prosecution so she – I think she misled 
the panel there by saying to the panel she found the thing there on the 
court roll. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because it can only be on the court roll if there 
has been an authorisation of the institution of prosecution and you say 
that she recommended the authorisation of prosecut ion. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair the objective is 
that she signed both those covering letters and then she tells the panel 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 239 of 258 
 
she found the thing there when she ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say what she said is contradicted by objec tive 
facts? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page 36 you then deal with 
Advocate Doctor Torie Pretorius, will you please address the Chair in 
relation to your observations of the matt ers that Pretorius was involved 
in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s go back to the last point we were making about 
10 
Advocate Noko, so during her interview when she was a candidate for 
the position of NDPP recently she was asked about the matter relating 
to you by one of the panellists and she said when she became acting 
DPP the matter was already on the roll.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think the words she 
used Chair is she found it on the court roll.  
CHAIRPERSON:  She found it on the court roll. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and that was the end of that line of questioning?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so your understanding is in that way she was 
making sure she would not be asked about any decisions she took to 
recommend? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
That 
was 
my 
interpretation of what she was saying, that she did not want to go there 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 240 of 258 
 
because I think that possibly would have led to other questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair, at paragraph 36 
you talk to Advocate Pretorius, Dr Torie Pretorius.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it would be important to get a copy of the 
transcript of her interview if we don’t already have it here so that we 
can have a look at whatever may be relevant that transpired during her 
interview, 
including 
the 
point 
that 
Major 
General 
Booysen 
is 
mentioning. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that’s specifically, to make sure 
10 
I understand this, that’s specifically the t ranscript of the interview of 
Advocate Noko? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes of Advocate Noko, she is the only one, because 
Major General Booysen is saying she was asked about the matter 
relating to him and she said she found the matter already on the court 
roll and Major General Booysen says that’s false, there are objective 
facts which show that it was not on the court roll when she came, and 
she is the one who did the recommendation, so it would be good to find 
out exactly what the transcript reflects.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair with regards to 
Advocate Torie Pretorius I described him as a lightning conductor in my 
statement.  We have these prosecutors like Mahema and Noko and 
Mosing and a few others that are in the coalface in the courts but in the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 241 of 258 
 
background you have Advocate Torie Pretorius giving legal opinions 
and invariably those opinions are against the likes of myself, Pravin 
Gordhan etcetera.  Both him and and Advocate Mussenj ate and I think 
that is Advocate Abrahams as well, well it was Advocate Pretorius, 
Mussenjate and Abrahams they received notices of intention to suspend 
them by the then President for their role in the aborted Minister Pravin 
Gordhan matter.  They were eventually not suspended but I think it will 
be interesting to know what is written in their presentations because 
that might indicate where the decision to prosecute Mr Pravin Gordhan 
were politically motivated or not, but be that as it may Chair the fact 
10 
that Mr Torie Pretorius had involved himself in aligning with the 
prosecution of Mr Pravin Gordhan and we now know which had 
catastrophic effects on the economy of the country and as I previously 
alluded to the fact that the PCLU of which he is a member thes e 
investigations do not fall into the remit of the PCLU, but he constantly 
seems to get himself involved or either by default or by design and he 
also gave a legal opinion in the Cato Manor matter when we brought an 
application to have the matter struck off the roll, when he aligned 
himself with the prosecutors, Mahema at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next prosecutor that you then, 
the next advocate that you deal with is on page 37, and that is 
Advocate Raymond Matenjwa.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Chair 
Advocate 
Raymond Matenjwa was the initial prosecutor when the first batch of 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 242 of 258 
 
Cato Manor members were arrested.  I wasn’t present at court, I had a 
commitment with members from the FBI in the USA, in KZN but on 
various occasions he opposed bail, on various occasions he had to be 
called to order by the magistrate for his antis in court.  He’s involved in 
my investigation, like I said earlier on he was also involved in one week 
going to court for Glynnis Breytenbach an d during the same week a 
different province for my matter.  I have been told by two very senior 
advocates from the National Prosecuting Authority that there was a 
letter where a number of prosecutors had been promised promotion by 
Advocate Abrahams, I never saw this letter, but two independent 
10 
Advocates told me about this and Advocate Raymond Matenjwa was one 
of them that was going to be a promoted to a post at Nelspruit where a 
new post was to be created.   
 
My understanding from these two senior advocates  from the 
National Prosecuting Authority is that Advocate Abrahams had already 
drafted the papers, but it was at that time when the then State 
President was under pressure and he resigned, so he had not signed 
off on that, which eventually negated the prom otion of these 
prosecutors of which Matenjwa was one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the relevance of the promotion, of their 
20 
promotion is it that the promotion was linked to the work they were 
doing in relation to the prosecution of people like you, or it’s just being  
mentioned? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the people that 
were mentioned the majority of the people that were going to be 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 243 of 258 
 
promoted are some of the prosecutors that I deal with in my statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Now the people from within the NPA who 
gave you this information do you have any idea whether they would be 
prepared to come and give evidence about that to the extent that it may 
be deemed necessary or is that something you don’t know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the one might 
not, the other one might. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And you will give the names to the Legal 
Team? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I will Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At page 38 from paragraph 1 to 4 
you deal with the next Advocate who is Advocate Sean Abrahams, who 
appointed Advocate Sean Abrahams?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s common 
cause that he was appointed by the State President.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay.  Who is – who preceded, who 
was the previous incumbent to his position?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That was Advocate 
Mxolisi Nxana Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay and what was Advocate Mxolisi 
Nxana’s view in relation to the withdrawal of criminal charges agains t 
the Toshan Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Chair 
obviously 
...(intervention)  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 244 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Against who? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Toshan Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I don’t think he 
had a specific view but he facilitated after I deleted my letter to him he 
facilitated prosecutors to re-evaluate so in my view those were one of 
his sins that he was prepared to have all those cases that had become 
dormant to make them alive again.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   The second sin I 
10 
think he committed was it was under his stewardship that Advocate 
Nomgcobo Jiba was prosecuted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And that’s borne out 
Chair by and I refer to that in paragraph 127 of my statement, I was 
watching the evidence of Advocate Mohofe where Advocate Mohofe 
stated ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  In this Commission? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair.  
Where he stated that the then Minister of Police, Minister Nathi Nhleko 
20 
informed him that there is going to be an audience with the State 
President, which eventually happened, and during this conversation in 
spite of the fact that he had no relevant experience as a prosecutor , 
never mind to head the National Prosecuting Authority, that the 
President wanted him to become the new NDPP, that was while 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 245 of 258 
 
Advocate Nkosana was the NDPP and what struck me of his evidence 
Chair and that convinced me more than anything else that one of t he 
cardinal sins that I also committed was to be the complainant in a 
matter against Advocate Jiba.  According to Advocate Mohofe the State 
President was not happy with the fact that she had been prosecuted 
and in fact he offered him to become the NDPP and  I think the words 
that he used is that he would be the (indistinct) NDPP but Jiba was 
going to be the default. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The de facto ja. 
 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I think he used the 
word default ja, default DPP as long as Jiba was left alone.  Chair with 
regards to Advocate Abrahams when he assumed office two of the very 
first things he did was to call Advocates Ferreira and Van Eeden 
because they were the prosecutors appointed by Advocate Nxasana to 
prosecutor Advocate Jiba, and he wanted an opinion from them as to 
the strength of the case.  And I am aware of this Chair because those 
documents were attached to another application, I think it was in the 
Western Cape.  He procured that from the two Advocates himself and 
on a reading of that Chair it’s blatantly evident from their opinions that 
20 
there is a case to be answered by Advocate Jiba.  
 
The other thing that he did was to ask Advocate Gerrie Nel 
about the Panday matters.  That was in 2015 Chair and my 
understanding 
is 
that Advocate 
Gerrie 
Nel 
had 
made 
certain 
recommendations that a number of people in those investigations are 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 246 of 258 
 
prosecuted.  
 
So that was the very first thing he did and we now know what’s 
happened to those investigations, none of those people to date have 
appeared in front of a Court and with regards to the – it’s the first one I 
was mentioning, with regards to the Jiba matter that eventually Chair 
the trial was supposed to commence I think it was on a Wednesday, and 
I was consulting with the Prosecutor the week before that and we had 
to work from his files because the Prosecutor told me the docket was 
with Advocate Mogatle, Marshall Mogatle I think his name is.  What 
later emerged was that Ferreira had written an email to Mogatle to tell 
10 
him listen I need my docket, I’m cons ulting with a witness, the trial is 
about to commence and Mogatle’s response to that was in an email that 
the docket is with the NDPP, obviously Mr Abrahams, and that they 
should have an answer by the following day, which makes me think that 
because subsequent to the withdrawal of charges against Jiba they 
announced that the charges were withdrawn by Advocate Mogatle, but I 
firmly believe that they were actually withdrawn by Advocate Sean 
Abrahams and that was confirmed in an application to the High Court, I 
cannot recall whether it was Freedom under the Law or whether that 
was the Helen Suzman Foundation, there the judges all held, I think it 
20 
was a full bench Chair, all the judges held there that in spite of the fact 
that Mogatle and Mahema deposed deposed to affidavits under oath 
that it was Mogatle that withdrew the charges and not Abrahams.  The 
Court found that it was indeed Abrahams who withdrew the charges and 
not Mogatle.   
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 247 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
And 
Chair 
not 
surprisingly you have a High Court finding against Advocate Abrahams 
and the judges even in their judgment says it raises questions about 
integrity, and they also make other adverse remarks against Advocate 
Abrahams and Advocate Mogatle and I just find it curious  that up until 
today, in spite of those negative aspersions cast by High Court Judges 
absolutely nothing has happened to Advocate Mogatle and Advocate 
Abrahams, neither from the employer at the time who was the NPA and 
neither from – well the then GCB and I believe that there’s a new body 
10 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes.  Do we have that judgment that General 
Booysen is talking about in the bundle?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, it should be secured, we should have that.  Is 
your recollection that in that matter Advocate Abrahams had also filed 
an affidavit? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And whether his affidavit was saying that it was 
Advocate Mogatle who made the decision to withdraw?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say three judges rejected that version?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And said it was him who made the decision?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Ja, 
there 
was 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 248 of 258 
 
majority and a descending judgment but all the judges held that or 
found that it was in fact Abrahams who withdrew the charges and not 
Mogatle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   In spite of the fact 
that both deposed to affidavits in opposing the application.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and do you know whether that matter is 
somewhere in the Court system with appeals or not or is that something 
you don’t know at the moment?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair obviously what 
10 
happened with ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So basically what I am looking for is whether those 
findings still stand or whether they’re subject to some appeal 
...(intervention)  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair, sorry Chair, 
the Court held that the withdrawal of charges by Abrahams was 
irrational. 
CHAIRPERSON :  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And to my mind the 
criminal charges should be reinstated.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   But to date none of 
that has happened.  I found out through the Justice Mokgoro inquiry 
when they were pushed for an answer Jiba’s counsel then said to Judge 
Mokgoro they’re going to establish what happened and then the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 249 of 258 
 
following day they handed in a letter from an – I think he’s from, 
Advocate Smit, I can’t remember which Province he was from, 
Northwest, which he said that so obviously Advocate Abrahams had 
referred it to another Advocate again who then said no there’s no 
reasonable chance of success for prosecution.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   In my view he did not 
have the authority to review what the two other Advocates had already 
established. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, we need to have that judgment and it may be 
10 
that depending on when one reads the judg ment, it may or may not be 
necessary to have a look at one or more of the affidavits that may be 
affected on that issue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Male fides Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Were you involved General Booysen 
in the legal process which led to Nomgcobo Jiba’s prosecution?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I was the 
complainant.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And then related to her role in your case?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair, 
because in the Gorvan matter she and I accused her of being 
mendacious and she did not respond to that and it was based on that 
and the findings of the Court that I lay the charges, and I was privy to 
the charge sheet because she was going to be charged for perjury fo r 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 250 of 258 
 
lying under oath in that statement, in the litigation process, she also 
misrepresented facts which comprised, which I would say makes her 
guilty of fraud and then also for defeating the ends of justice.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In your view did you su ffer any 
consequences as a result of laying this complaint against Advocate 
Jiba? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair my view if – 
when I took early retirement, five months early, not that I am retired 
Chair, I am still working, Chair in my view an d that’s how I feel about it, 
if I just kept my mouth shut and either taken the golden handshake by 
10 
General Phiyega and disappeared into the sunset they would have 
forgotten about Johan Booysen.  The fact that I went back and 
reopened all these cases and Advocate Jiba was not prosecuted I am 
convinced 
that 
that 
prompted 
the 
reaction 
that 
I 
eventually 
experienced, that I was now re-prosecuted by Advocate Sean 
Abrahams.   
 
Chair all the evidence, or should I say the lack of evidence 
had been ventilated in fro nt of Judge Gorvan and he is very emphatic in 
his findings.  My assertions that the witnesses that they referred to, 
Aiyer, Dannicas, Londlo, every single one that Abrahams now purports 
20 
to rely upon the Judge there held over and above the fact that some of  
those statements weren’t even signed but even if they were, does not 
link me to the offences I am being prosecuted for, yet Mr Sean 
Abrahams uses the same statements with the addition of one, the 
statement of the Greek citizen in the Jiba application was never signed, 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 251 of 258 
 
and even if it was signed Judge Gorvan said it does not implicate me in 
the commission of an offence.   
 
Advocate Abrahams when I applied to have his authorisation to 
prosecute me reviewed and set aside in his answering affidavit he 
states that he had sent Advocate Mahema and Advocate Dawood Adams 
to Greece and they had now taken a signed statement of Dannicas, and 
he says the statement is now signed, I was satisfied and then he 
authorised my prosecution. 
 
Chair the problem with that is when I heard, when I saw that I 
said to my attorney please phone Advocate Mahema and ask him for a 
10 
copy of the signed statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because obviously it was relevant.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair.  Which Mr 
van der Merwe duly did and I was present when he phoned him and 
Advocate Mahema’s response was the statement is still in Greek it’s 
not been translated yet.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s still in Greek? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Still in Greek Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it hasn’t been translated? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
It 
hasn’t 
been 
20 
translated yet.  Chair as I sit here today in spite of a number of letters 
to Advocate Mahema I still do not have a copy of a signed statement, I 
understand that it eventually was translated but that’s probably almost 
a year after Advocate Abrahams re-authorised my prosecution which 
begged the question how could he have considered a statement which 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 252 of 258 
 
is in Greek, unless he is conversant in Greek which I don’t think he is..  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is he not conversant in Greek?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair most of this 
what they do to me is Greek, but I don’t think he is conversant in 
Greek. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Having said that General Booysen if 
I can ask you to go to page 182 paragraph 39 of the same bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s page 182, paragraph 39. 
CHAIRPERSON:  182? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well General Booysen I was saying asking whether he 
is not conversant in Greek because you know there are people in the 
country who are conversant in many languages so until one knows 
whether he is conversant in Greek ...  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I have actually 
challenged him in my answering, in my rep lying affidavit to which I have 
not received a response yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that was – is that in a matter that has been 
finalised? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair that matter 
is pending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
That 
review 
application ...(intervention)  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 253 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s pending Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON :  Yes, okay, okay.  So he would have to deal with that 
in his answering affidavit or in his affidavit? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He would have to deal 
with that Chair because I actually accuse him also of lying under oath, 
and I have invited him to file a fourth set of papers, to dispute what I 
am saying that he is not conversant in Greek.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and do you remember when the time will expire 
by when he should file his affidavit, or is it still coming or is it gone, 
10 
you don’t have to be exact, I’m just estimating.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I filed my 
founding affidavit in 2016 immediately after I was re-arrested and 
prosecuted.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  These proceedings 
have been occasioned by delay after delay occasioned by the National 
Prosecuting Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  First they filed the 
20 
record, because we asked for the rule 53 record, which they filed.  A 
week later they added material. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  To the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 254 of 258 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Then about two 
months later by then I had filed a supplementary affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  After I filed my 
supplementary affidavit they filed more so -called evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More material. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  More materials.  To 
the extent that I think it was in 2017 or – ja 2017 Chair where they 
undertook that because Advocate Jiba also had to file an affidavit, they 
then undertook I think that was roundabout August that she would file 
10 
by August.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  When August came 
they dumped a whole lot of new material which she said she had 
forgotten about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which she had also 
considered five years prior to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  By now that was the 
20 
third time that they had added material to the record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And we did not agree 
with that because that is not what the Rule 53 requires of the 
prosecutors.  And then we suggested to them that they should apply for 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 255 of 258 
 
condonation.  They refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  We then told them 
well you will have to.  And eve ntually they conceded that they will have 
to apply for condonation.  I think that was around about October, 
November.  But in spite of agreeing…  
CHAIRPERSON:  October, November 2018 or 17?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  17 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But in spite of that – 
10 
of them agreeing to file – to apply for condonation and I think it was 
November they only filed it in February the following year.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Eventually Chair we – 
we applied to have the – the matter struck off the role because we have 
appeared 20 times which 18 times I think we were in the high court.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And the case has not 
commenced yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And it is now after a 
period of almost seven years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The matter was not 
struck off the role.  The judge then Judge Lobe said what he is going to 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 256 of 258 
 
do he is going to take charge of these processes and he gave certain 
timelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  All of us have adhered 
to those timelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So the NPA and so did 
we except on one or two occasions where we would engage with each 
other because the papers were quite comprehensive.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  With the appointment 
of the new NDPP Chair the whole review application or the filing of 
papers are being kept in abeyance by agreement between the two 
parties and the Judge President has been informed of that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay so one is not sure what will 
happen with – with the matter in the light of the new NDPP but sill 
pending? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Now Chair so 
obviously there is a new bus driver for lack of a better phrase.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The respondent in this 
matter is the NDPP it is not the person.  
CHAIRPERSON:  NDPP.  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So in the current 
NDPP will have to decide whether she wants to proceed with the 
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 257 of 258 
 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And which event if she 
wants to proceed with the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Then Advocate 
Abrahams, Myema and Jiba will have to file.  
CHAIRPERSON:  File a [indistinct]. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  File a fourth set of 
papers if they take up my invitation.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I do not – sorry I do note the 
time but there is just one particular point with your leave?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Because notwithstanding the 
fact that it is General Booysen’s stateme nt that he has – that there has 
been a reauthorisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  For the charges under the helm 
of Advocate Shaun Abrahams.  It is important to place on record that at 
20 
page 182 of this bundle at paragraph 9 it is Gor ven J’s finding or 
remark rather and I shall read: 
“It is important to note that the above findings do not amount to a 
finding that Mr Booysen is not guilty of the offences set out in counts1 
and 2 and 8 to 12.  That can only be decided by way of a crimina l trial.  
02 MAY 2019 – DAY 87 
 
Page 258 of 258 
 
Setting aside the authorisations and decisions to prosecute also does 
not mean that fresh authorisations cannot be issued or fresh decisions 
taken to prosecute if there is a rational basis of these decisions.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Okay it is  five o’clock so we will adjourn.  
I think Mr Paul Pretorius had requested that I consider that we start at 
half past nine tomorrow morning and I think I may have agreed.  But I 
want to change that back to normal time at ten o’clock.  If you can live 
with that Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Certainly Chair.  It is your 
prerogative. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  My – well it is more because I am not feeling too well 
today.  So I might need a little bit of more time in the morning before I 
come here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the only reason otherwise I would not hesitate 
that we start earlier if it suited everybody including Major General 
Booysen.  So if it is fine let us start at ten.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is that fine with you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is fine by me 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  We will adjourn the proceedings for 
the day then until tomorrow morning at ten.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
