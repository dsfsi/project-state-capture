PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 24 JANUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair when we concluded yesterday I indicated 
that the legal representatives of Mr Tsotsi would like to ask some 
questions in re-examination and so if may hand over to my learned 
friend? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay now I seem to remember that I thought we 
were done with Mr Tsotsi.  Or did you tell me only after I had release 
him? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We – we concluded yesterday on the basis that 
we would be returning today for the re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I know… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So – but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think I had forgotten that part now.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at a certain stage yesterday I released him. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that must have been … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh no sorry that was Mr Jackson who was our 
witness who might have come up yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 3 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we finished I excused him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh goodness none of us were on the ball. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now what I am wondering is whether when I did 
so you had not told me that his legal team would like to re-examine him 
and that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No we – we had dealt with it before the tea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether you had already. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But unfortunately Chair I had not picked that 
up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I must have completely forgotten. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As did I.  I was not aware at that point that Mr 
Tsotsi had been released. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But thankfully he is here nonetheless. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is here.  Good morning Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I – I think when I released you I had 
20 
forgotten whatever had been discussed.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I do apologise for not picking that up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much but thank you for 
coming back.  Yes Mr Ngcebetsha you want to re-examine? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205

ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Mr Tsotsi there was some discussion 
yesterday on whether the board did apply its mind on the commercial 
value regarding the contract that it considered to ratify and ultimately 
did ratify.  Would you be kind enough to share with the commission 
what your understanding is in as far as that is concerned? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  When we were discussing the matter of whether to 
ratify the contract or to cancel it the matter of the contract being a bad 
one was premised solely on the idea and the knowledge that the 
10 
contract had been entered into irregularly.  That was the sole premise 
upon which the notion of a bad contract in our minds was premised on. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Just for clarity before you proceed.  That 
to you would have as a Board meant that to the extent that it is deemed 
to be irregular it is bad or is it that there is no value that Eskom was to 
acquire from the contract? 
MR TSOTSI:  No the contract being a bad one had to us not related to 
the value that Eskom could – could get out of the contract.  It was 
solely related to the fact that the contract was entered into irregularly. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Fair enough.  Now a lot was canvassed on 
20 
the legal opinion obtained from the attorneys firm Ledwaba Mazwai and 
invariably they gave you two options which was  
a. You may cancel the contract and they raised the obvious flag of 
there would be challenges in the light of the fact that there was 
no termination clause and therefore you could be open to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 5 of 187 
 
litigation. 
b. That you may consider to ratify the irregularity of the contract 
and thus be able to obtain some value.   
Now explain to me how you as a Board understood that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair our understanding was clearly that if we were to 
ratify the contract the only thing that we would have to insist upon is 
that some means of mechanism be found to extract as much value out 
of the contract.  So we then decided that it would be detrimental – it 
would be more detrimental to the company if we cancel the contract 
because we were opening ourselves up to claims of non-performance 
10 
and also possible legal costs that may arise out of that and obviously 
with no possibility of exercising any value out of the contract.  So it 
was the – shall I say the better of the two evils if you like for us in our 
– in our thinking.  And so given that we then took the view that let us 
then ensure that we get optimal value from what is left of the contract.  
So that was the position that we had taken and that is how we arrived 
at the decision we arrived at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed Mr Ngcebetsha.  Maybe let us 
just do this Mr Tsotsi in the light of the fact that I released you 
yesterday when you were still going to come and be re-examined.  Do 
20 
you confirm that you consider the oath that you took yesterday to be 
still binding on your conscience as you continue with your evidence? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chair.  So the extent to which 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 6 of 187 
 
you say you looked at what optimal value and choose between the two 
evils.  Let us just go through that scenario.  In your understanding as a 
Board and in your understanding as an individual who led the Board as 
Chairman had you exercised the option of cancellation?  What value?  
What were the implications of that as you understood the report or the 
advice from the lawyers? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well clearly there would have been what I would 
understand to be wasteful expenditure on the part of the Board if we 
had taken the option to cancel the contract.  Because we would – we 
would have incurred loss and the company would have had to be 
10 
subject to a claim and that is where the loss would arise from.  So I 
think that in our view the option of ratifying the contract prevent that 
loss from occurring was a better option. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Do you distinguish… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.   
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you accept that if the position was that there 
was no commercial value to the contract – in the contract to – for 
Eskom then having paid or paying R43 million could well actually also 
be a fruitless expenditure and when I use that terminology now I am not 
20 
being technical I am just using it as a lay person.  In other words if 
somebody says after the year or I cannot remember for how long the 
contract was that were you – Eskom was going to spend R43 million 
after a year or two or three comes and says, you have paid R43 million 
here what did you get in return if you are not able to put up something 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 7 of 187 
 
that says this is the value we got then somebody could say, so that R43 
million is wasted.  So that is – that is the meaning I am attaching to 
fruitless expenditure which might not be exactly the same as the 
technical meaning for accountants and auditors maybe.  But that is 
what I am saying.  In other words you might say – let us ratify because 
you are scared of litigation but if you ratify a contract that has got no 
value for Eskom you could still face the same situation on the basis 
that you cannot really justify the payment of R43 million in terms of 
how has it helped Eskom. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair there – I concur with what you are saying and in 
10 
fact I think that is what the lawyers were essentially saying by saying 
that it would be used for – advisable for us to establish commercial 
value of the contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the answer is you understand that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chair.  Let us just maybe 
establish what is the – what was the knowledge of the Board in terms of 
what this contract represented?  What were you getting as Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair the – the contract spelt out what the outputs would 
20 
be and I think if one wants to get into the detail it is there in the – in 
the contract itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the docket – in the contract. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 8 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:  So in terms of you know the bottom line outputs they are 
spelt out in the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if there are two ways of dealing with this.  One 
is if you think it is important to highlight those then the contract can be 
put in front of you.  But if you are happy that we can look at the 
contract later that is fine.  Mr Ngcebetsha can indicate what he prefers. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chair perhaps let me – let me 
see if we can make quicker progress of the different - perhaps let me – 
let me see if we can make quicker progress on a different… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without … 
10 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  And if needs be we will get there.  The – 
yesterday you mentioned that the evaluation of the commercial value 
ordinarily would have rested with the Executive team as they were 
negotiating the contracts. Is that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Was in your mind the Board seized with an 
evaluation of the commercial value or not at the time that you 
considered ratification? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Well the issue there for us was that the contract under 
normal circumstances would not have come to the Board in the first 
place.  Because the delegation of authority for that level of expenditure 
is within the competence of management.  The only reasons the 
contract came to us was because of the irregularity which was in fact 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 9 of 187 
 
occasioned by a member of the Board and because the Board was the 
only authority in the organisation that could have addressed that issue 
because it was beyond the level of management.  Because the Chief 
Executive is a member of the Board.  So the overriding consideration 
for us was this problem of the irregularity.  The Board would only have 
engaged itself on the issue of value only insofar as the fact that it is a 
normal course that there should be a value in any contract that the 
company enters into.  So naturally because we were now dealing with 
this issue the issue of value had to come up in the discussion.  But the 
substantive 
preoccupation 
of 
the 
Board 
had 
to 
do 
with 
this 
10 
transgression that occurred in the signature of the contract.  That was 
the primary preoccupation.  As a consequence therefore Chair the 
Board then insisted that management must do its - its utmost to get 
value our of this contract once – from then on because it is very clear 
that without extracting value out of the contract it will be an exercise 
which would result in fruitless expenditure by the company if the 
contract continues and there is no attendant attempt to exact value 
from the contract.  So we needed to – to add that to you know the – 
well it was added to the resolution that was passed.  The Round Robin 
Resolution.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  While Mr Ngcebetsha is looking at his notes I am 
trying to recall yesterday’s evidence.  Did we end up with the position 
that you said at the time of ratifying by the time the Board ratified the 
contract the question of its commercial value had not been determined.  
Is there where – what you said? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 10 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chair.  Principally what I am 
trying to get Mr Tsotsi and the witness – or rather the witness to clarify 
which I think he has done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Firstly is that the commercial value – let 
me just put it a [indistinct] position. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja put it with ja. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Firstly that the – this is my proposition as I 
understand your evidence.  Correct me where I am wrong.  Your 
understanding is the genesis that allows the contract to be entered into 
invokes the management to have considered commercial value.  Are we 
correct? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  That having done so they entered into a 
contract which later through the SNG Report corroborated by the 
Ledwaba Mazwai Report indicated that it was irregularly entered into. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  That further it came to the Board to 
consider the issue of irregularity principally? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Consequently the Board would have to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 11 of 187 
 
consider what position to take on cancellation versus ratification. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Now at that point what we now know is that 
the Ledwaba Mazwai Report says: 
“Absent of a termination clause if you cancel you are facing as a 
company the possibility of TNA accepting this as a repudiation which 
simply means that for non-performance you will pay them for the full 
balance of the contract without any goods or services being delivered.” 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  The alternative is that if you do ratify it 
10 
you would at least extract the value of goods or services, is that 
correct to understand? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  So – so did the Board apply itself to a 
commercial consideration perhaps different from the original one that 
the management team would have looked at?  That is the question I am 
trying to understand. 
MR TSOTSI:  The Board did apply itself to consider commercial 
considerations yes because it would not make sense for the Board to 
ratify the contract in the absence of some commercial consideration. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have anticipated my next question Mr Tsotsi.  I 
am glad you have anticipated it.  Okay Mr Ngcebetsha continue. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  And what was the commercial value than 
that the Board in its limited scope looked at? 
MR TSOTSI:  Sorry I did not get the question. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 12 of 187 
 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  What was the commercial value that the 
Board considered? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think – I think maybe if I could put it in 
another way. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe it should be preceded by any earlier 
question. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there value that the Board attached or conceded 
existed in the contract before it ratified? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  The Board did consider that there was value in the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then I think the next question, what was that 
value? 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  What we then – what we then looked at in terms of how 
the contract was initially – from inception how it was put together was a 
representation that Mr Matjila sent to the Board though he was not able 
to be there personally to make the representation.  So we then said we 
should reinforce the idea that there has got to be commercial value in 
20 
this contract.  There has got to be a realisation of the commercial value 
in the contract otherwise it is not worthwhile for the Board to ratify the 
contract.  We were not competent ourselves to establish what level of 
value there is.  I mean we do not have the capacity to quantify the – 
the quantum of value but we understood from what Matjila had put 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 13 of 187 
 
forward that there is an expectation that there will be deliverables on 
the basis of the contract which would then result in some value for the 
company.  So it was then up to management to then put together a 
capacity or a mechanism to ensure that value does get extracted from 
the contract. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Put differently and I give you another 
proposition.  On paper there would have been value and you chose as 
you put it the lesser evil. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  By taking the option that allowed you to 
10 
have a chance to re – convert that into writing – I mean into realilty. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes that is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just apologies just to note at this point.  It is 
very important in our submission for the weight that is ever to be 
attached Mr Tsotsi’s evidence that in re-examination he is asked not 
leading questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have raised this before in re-examination 
20 
so I would just caution my learned friend insofar as that is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you – you saw that as you were standing I was – 
I was smiling because… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On route to make the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think all three of us including Mr 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 14 of 187 
 
Ngcebetsha knew – knew that that was leading. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not being unfair to you Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Shall we – shall we rephrase it is fine? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  It is alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chairperson.  Do you yourself 
distinguish between commercial value assessment that led to the – at 
the genesis of the contract negotiation and the commercial value 
10 
assessment when the Board had to consider ratification?  Do you make 
any distinction between the two or not? 
MR TSOTSI:  Commercial assessment of the contract would have had 
to have been done at the inception of putting the contract together. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes let us be direct.  Do you make a 
distinction between the two?  Are they the – exactly the same thing or 
they are a little bit different? 
MR TSOTSI:  They are the same. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  If they are exactly the same then you have 
to clarify to the Chairperson why yesterday in your evidence you said 
the Board did not have to consider a commercial consideration and 
today you say it did.  Because on the face of it it looks like a 
contradiction.  What do you mean? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 15 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:  You see yesterday I was trying to explain Chair the focus 
of what the Board was considering and the reason why in any case that 
all of this was happening was because of the fact that there had been 
an irregularity that was picked up which irregularity then triggered the 
entire process that we went through. So the focus of the Board was on 
that matter.  The matter of commercial value of the contract was 
essentially raised as a result of what are the considerations that one 
must take into account when a contract of this nature is to be ratified.  
So that consideration then speaks to what was in fact intended in the 
contract?  Irrespective of it having been entered irregular – into 
10 
irregularly.  What was the intent in terms of benefit for the company?  
Was there any intent that there should be benefit for the company?  
And when I say this I am saying this is what the Board said that in any 
case there was an intention for the com – for the contract to benefit the 
company.  Not to the extent to which that would have happened we 
were not competent to quantify but what we do know is that there was 
an intent that the contract should benefit the company.  So this is 
where perhaps I did not put myself – I did not put it clearly or I did not 
make it clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think it is better that I should raise my – put 
20 
these questions to you now so Mr Ngcebetsha has the opportunity to 
ask you further question arising from them if there is anything that he 
thinks needs clarification.  Yesterday you had – you testified about the 
Round Robin Resolution and said that you signed it and admitted that 
you did not read it maybe as carefully as you should have.  You 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 16 of 187 
 
discovered afterwards that there were some errors in the statement you 
– you owned up to that as I understood your evidence.  That was fine.  
Now for me – oh the next thing is you said earlier on that the Board had 
to consider the issue of commercial value before it could ratify because 
otherwise and I may be putting words in your mouth, otherwise it would 
not make sense to ratify a contract that might not have any value.  Now 
I may be putting words into your mouth but that is because it is what is 
in my mind but when you answer you can clarify for the record where I 
am saying you said something you did not say.  But so for me it makes 
a lot of sense when you say, there is no way we could ratify as a Board 
10 
a contract without satisfying ourselves or without asking the question, 
is there value for the company in this contract?  Now as I understand it 
– as I understand your evidence you did consider that issue as a Board.  
The next question is, what did you do about it?  And I think at some 
stage I understood you to be saying, well we said to management they 
must make sure the company gets value out of this contract and so on.  
My difficulty is I would not expect a Board such as your – a Board of 
Eskom I would not expect any Board to ratify a contract without 
satisfying themselves that there is value in the contract – the contract 
has value for the company.  Now of course if you are told by somebody 
20 
that you have no reason to think they are misleading you – if you are 
told, no this is the value or blah, blah, blah, blah you might not need to 
go behind that to check whether that is true.   
You might not need to go behind that to check whether that is 
true.  That - that depends on how - how much you - trust you have in 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 17 of 187 
 
the person who tells you that there is value and maybe this is the 
value, but where there is - particularly where there is a lot of money 
involved I would expect that as a Board you would say - the Board 
would say you management wants us to ratify this. 
We - if we ratify it we take full responsibility for it and be - 
we will not ratify it unless you satisfy us that it has commercial value.  
Tell us where the commercial value is and if they say no - if they tell 
you something that you think is nonsense.  You must say we - then we 
are not ratifying depending or you must say well we ratifying even 
though there is no value, because of A, B, C, D. 
10 
Whatever the A, B, C, D is.  So that is - that is where my - my 
concern is. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you - you can address this concern in 
whatever way … 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you would like to. 
MR TSOTSI:  Thank you Chair.  Perhaps it did not come across as 
clearly yesterday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  But as I said not long ago that the commercial 
consideration at the time when the contract was being put together is 
what we understood to be the attempt to demonstrate value in the 
contract - commercial value or the existence or potential for commercial 
value. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 18 of 187 
 
So that in itself we did not relate that ability to demonstrate 
that via Mr Matjila with the transgression that resulted in the - in the 
regularity.  In other words what I am saying Chair is that we did not 
pass judgment on Mr Matjila’s capacity to demonstrate value in the 
contract based on the transgression that he incurred in signing of the 
contract. 
So that - that then says to me that even if this contract did 
not come to the Board and it proceeded in a normal fashion we as a 
Board would have understood that the responsibility of management is 
to make certain that there is commercial value for the company when 
10 
they enter into a contract. 
Now it is probably easy post facto to establish whether 
indeed to establish whether indeed the understanding we had at the 
time was correct or not, but I do not think that removes the latitude that 
one must give … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  To management when they say we are confident that the 
way we have entered into this contract will indeed result in value for 
the company.  That Chairman is the reason why I for one did not really 
see the - the reason to go back and - and re-establish - if you like … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Whether in fact there is commercial value in the contract 
or not, because it is not the first time that Eskom is doing something 
like this and like I say if we have found at the end of the day that in 
fact there was an error in judgment by management.  Then that would 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 19 of 187 
 
be something that would then have to be dealt with at that time, but we 
have to have confidence in their ability to execute the mandate that 
they have in the interest of the company and this occasion is no 
different and should not be confused by the fact that there is any 
regularity that occurred which the Board was seized with at the time.  I 
do not know if I am making myself clear Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if I say you do then I - I should not have another 
question.  Let - let me ask this question.  Am I correct to understand 
your - you to say as you ratify it - the contract - you had not satisfied 
yourself - yourselves as the Board as yet that there was commercial 
10 
value in the contract for Eskom, but what at least yourself maybe - here 
I think you did not want to speak for other people necessarily. 
You - your - your attitude was Matjila says there is value in 
the contract.  I do not want to second guess him.  Am I - is - am I under 
- am I understanding your evidence correctly? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Of course you - you would accept would 
you not that while that approach might give confidence to the 
management that we are allowed to determine what has commercial 
value and what has no commercial value for the company the Board is 
20 
accepting what we say they are not scrutinising. 
They - they are not second guessing us.  If later on it is 
shown that the contract had no commercial value.  Then it could be 
said that you had an opportunity to check whether there was 
commercial value before you ratified and because you did not do that 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 20 of 187 
 
maybe Eskom then lost a lot of money because maybe if you had 
checked you could have stopped the - the contract. 
Let us leave out for now the arguments about whether there 
was the route of going to court and declaring it invalid was there or not, 
but you - you - would you accept that there could be criticism from that 
angle? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  I do accept Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chairperson.  Just to round off 
this.  In the Ledwaba Mazwai report was the option availed that you 
10 
could actually go to court to - to get this contract cancelled? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or declared invalid. 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes.  Declared … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cancelled or declared invalid. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  No.  There was no such. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Ja.  To the best of my recollection three 
options were raised.  First ratification.  Secondly, cancellation at your 
20 
insistence the company.  Thirdly, approaching them on a goodwill basis 
to see if you could renegotiate the terms of the contract.  Is that 
correct? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Right.  So my last question here hopefully 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 21 of 187 
 
and then I can move onto another issue is did the Board understand 
that or let me put it differently was there any process that the Board set 
in motion to - to be considered to see if any party - in this instance 
Mr Matjila or any of the Executive Team Members - that in the event 
that there was no value that could be realised would face some 
consequences? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair, I - at the time when I was involved with this matter 
we had not reached that consideration.  It is possible that they could 
have arisen with the - with the Board after I left.  After they - they then 
had then some experience of - of the contract. 
10 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Fair.  Now I want to treat the second point 
for me which is the ratification - rather the round robin resolution.  In a 
discussion yesterday it became clear that there were some omissions if 
not inaccuracies in the round robin resolution.  Can we - are you able 
to identify what in your mind were those inaccuracies or incomplete 
omissions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you want to look at … 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The resolution that … 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  I think that would help me … (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe somebody can help - can help him with what 
page that is. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Page 145 of EXHIBIT MM3. 
MR TSOTSI:  145? 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Ja.  It actually starts on 143.  MM3. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 22 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Huh-uh.  MM3.  No.  This bundle.  143.  Yes.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  I have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I think the question was whether you are able to 
specify what errors or inaccuracies and I would add omissions you later 
identified in the resolution. 
MR TSOTSI:  The first one Chair would be the statement that says that: 
“The parties that were involved in this matter are no 
10 
longer within the sphere of Eskom’s …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page? 
MR TSOTSI:  Sorry.  One - 144. 
CHAIRPERSON:  144.  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Paragraph. 
MR TSOTSI:  The last - the second last bullet … 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  From the bottom of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Begins with that: 
20 
“The parties that were involved in this matter are no 
longer within the sphere of Eskom’s operations.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  I understood that to mean that both Mr Matjila and 
Mr Choeu are no longer … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 23 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Within Eskom and that was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not true. 
MR TSOTSI:  Not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to both of them? 
MR TSOTSI:  In regard to one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  It is true about Mr Matjila, but it was not true about 
Mr Choeu, because he was still working … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  In - in the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Was Mr Matjila at the time of this round 
robin resolution still a Board Member? 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  So he was no longer Interim Chief 
Executive nor a Board Member? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you and Mr Choeu was still an 
employee? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  That is right. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Right.  Now the key issue regarding that is 
what steps if any did you take to - to deal with this inaccuracy or 
omission? 
MR TSOTSI:  Alright.  Yesterday what we dealt with was the fact that I 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 24 of 187 
 
only picked up this matter after the round robin had been returned.  In 
fact the reason why I had reason to relook at it was because the 
Secretariat came to me and told me that the round robin had been 
signed and it was - and I wanted to see who had signed or had not 
signed the round robin and then on looking at the document I realised 
that there was a - there were these errors in it and I then elected to 
deal with this matter at the next Board Meeting, because it was not too 
far from then. 
I think it was something like a week or so before that next 
meeting and so at that next meeting - like I said yesterday.  I do not 
10 
recall whether I initiated the conversation regarding these errors, but 
what I do recall is that there was a remark which was made by one of 
the Board Members when the issue of the TNA was - was mentioned. 
That there had been an understanding that the round robin 
reflected the fact that Mr Choeu was no longer in the company and that 
was not - and - and understood that that was questionable.  I of course 
made the point that no.  There is an error in the - in the round robin in - 
in that regard and I seem to recall that I made an apology to the Board 
to say that not only was - not only was there an error, but also that 
there was some information that the Board had not received that they 
20 
should have received. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Now in - in your understanding as a Board 
and as your own personal self on whom did the duty to institute 
disciplinary proceedings lie on?  The Board or the management? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be - before that … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 25 of 187 
 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ngcebetsha you had asked him to identify the 
errors … 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has identified only one. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Okay.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There maybe more. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Okay.  So let us see if there is another 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us - let us complete that first. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Okay.  Then - the - the subsequent - the following 
sentence thereafter is clearly not correct also for the same reason that 
the first one is not, because it has nothing to do with Mr Chose.  The 
rotation of the Board had nothing to do with Mr Chose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Would it have anything to do with 
Mr Matjila? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  It was actually in reference to him that it applies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Ja.  So would you say it is - is it - is it 
20 
inaccurate? 
MR TSOTSI:  It is inaccurate.  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  As it relates to? 
MR TSOTSI:  To Mr Choeu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 26 of 187 
 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Is it inaccurate?  Does it relate to 
Mr Matjila? 
MR TSOTSI:  No.  It is not. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  I see.  What else did you pick up that was 
…? 
MR TSOTSI:  Okay.  Let us see.  I think those are basically the issues 
of the inaccuracy as far as I can remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I thought there were more than that, but it may 
10 
be because I - I may have misunderstood something.  I thought there 
was - you had said something also in relation to the paragraph that 
comes after the bullet point at page 1-4-5.  That says: 
“The Board recognises that there is value.” 
But I may have misunderstood you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair, the - the contention of Ms Hofmeyr yesterday was 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  This is incorrect, because her understanding was that the 
- the Board had in fact said that was no value in the contract … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  And then we then talked about commercial value … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Vis-à-vis, the intrinsic value of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you said the Board had not passed judgment 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 27 of 187 
 
on whether there was not … (intervenes)? 
MR TSOTSI:  What I said yesterday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Yesterday. 
MR TSOTSI:  If - if I recall correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Is that the Board did not say there was no commercial 
value … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  In the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  And the - the issue of value did not - was not an issue 
that the Board passed judgment on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  In terms of lack of value … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  In the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Vis-à-vis commercial value … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And that is the point I was trying to stress to say … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Notwithstanding the fact that there was the perception 
that the irregularity occasioned the problem with understanding that the 
contract was not favourable … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 28 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:  From Eskom’s perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Did not preclude the fact that there could and would be 
commercial value in the contract. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Ja.  So I - let me leave it at that.  I do not 
want to boarder into leading or ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Argument.  Ja.  Let us leave it at that.  I 
think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  I understand what you are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had asked a question about disciplinary. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  What was your understanding on who - on 
whom the duty to discipline an employee - full time employee of Eskom 
- where did it lie with the Board or with the Management Team? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair, my understanding is that the duty lies with 
management.  The execution lies with management. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  And you - what then would your - would 
20 
have been your reasonable expectation in - in the light of these clear 
transaction - transgressions in as far as the employee that remained in 
the manner - in the form of Mr Choeu? 
MR TSOTSI:  My expectation would have been that management would 
institute an inquiry which would lead then to a disciplinary process, 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 29 of 187 
 
because of what transpired at the time of the signing of this contract. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  So of course you left as you said on 
31 March 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Do you know if anything was done by then? 
MR TSOTSI:  No.  I do not know. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I wonder Mr Tsotsi - this is just a thought that 
comes to my mind as I listen to the evidence.  I - I wonder whether it 
would have been open to management or the Executives or CEO to 
10 
discipline any employee or Mr Choeu for what he did if subsequently 
the Board had ratified that contract. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you might not be able to say.  It is just a 
thought. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you say look I cannot comment.  I will accept. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  Chair, I - I would not know.  I think it would depend 
on the - on first of all what the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe reasons for ratification. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Reasons for ratification and I think it will also depend on 
how the management or rather not the management, but the Board 
views then that - that situation.  Whether in fact ratification will absolve 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 30 of 187 
 
him from - from being disciplined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because my - my understanding of ratification is that 
you are actually saying to somebody.  I approve what you did.  You 
understand what I mean? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I approve what you did.  You might have done it 
without checking with me whether I would give it my blessing, but now 
that I have seen it I approve.  That is - that is the ordinary meaning 
that I attach to ratifying.  It may well be that in a particular context it 
might mean something else, but we can leave it at that, but I was just 
10 
sharing with you what was going on in my mind.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  I thought that would apply to Mr Matjila … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  I think Mr Choeu would have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Charged with something different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  You - you must help me, because I might 
not recall the nitty-gritty.  Maybe - maybe it might be - it might apply to 
20 
Mr Matjila as you say.  Not to Mr Choeu. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might not recall the nitty-gritties about the 
difference in terms of what they did.  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Perhaps to assist to direct. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 31 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  What was the complaint against Mr Choeu? 
MR TSOTSI:  The complaint - if I recall very well against Mr Choeu - 
was the fact that he had been party to removing the termination clause 
in the contract.  That was the complaint which was raised by the SNG 
Report. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  And what - what were the implications in 
your mind of the removal of the termination clause? 
MR TSOTSI:  The removal of the termination clause then creates 
exposure for Eskom and it - it means that the ability of the Board and 
10 
management to protect the integrity of the company is diminished … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  By that action.  So from the Board’s standpoint there 
would have been a fiduciary problem that could be associated with the 
Board in - in that action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well now that you have reminded me exactly 
what he had done.  Maybe it applies to him as well … 
MR TSOTSI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he does something wrong in relation to a 
contract.  That contract in respect of which he did something wrong is 
20 
brought to you to approve.  You aware that - you are aware of the thing 
- the wrong thing that he had done - he has done to the contract and 
you say nevertheless we embrace the contract.  If you look at it from … 
MR TSOTSI:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The idea of approving.  You - you … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 32 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You embrace it with the absence of that termination 
clause. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not say no, no, no.  This - this is bad.  We 
cannot approve a contract that does not have such an important clause 
for Eskom to escape if it needs to escape from - from this.  So, but 
again I am just sharing thought that are going through my - in my mind.  
Giving you an opportunity to say that is not how we saw it. 
This is how we - we saw it or maybe we - we can see that 
10 
point, but we did not think of it or we thought of it, but because of A, B, 
C, D we nevertheless thought we would ratify.  I am just wanting to 
make sure that I do not skip these concerns in my mind … 
MR TSOTSI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and after you are gone I worry about them 
without hearing what you might say if - about them if you have anything 
to say. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja.  I - I appreciate Chair.  That interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  It - as I say I - maybe not … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You … 
MR TSOTSI:  Maybe not being conversant with the law.  I - I am … 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But feel free … 
MR TSOTSI:  I am limited in - in ability … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 33 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Feel free to - to say I do not think I can comment or I 
can comment - I cannot comment if that is the position.  I am - I was 
just sharing with you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you - you have something to say you can say, but if 
you feel that you are unable or it is something that might need further 
thought.  It is fine. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair.  I think - I think let me just leave it at that for - 
for my perspective.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Ja.  Thank you Chair.  I must say that the 
nature of this conversation is a bit leaning more on the legal technical 
side which ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I agree.  I agree. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  And my limitation is that I do not want to 
lead the witness, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Should the opportunity present itself to 
make submissions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  To - to present arguments.  Yes.  Ja.  No, no, no. 
20 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  In terms of argument ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  To contextualise our ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Understanding of the ...[intervenes]  
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 34 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  That - that is fine.  The - the whole 
idea is simply that something is presented to the Board that has got 
worrying features ...[intervenes]  
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And one expects the Board to apply their mind to - to 
the issues and then make a decision, maybe on some issues they may 
say we need advice, on others they say we can make a decision blah-
blah-blah, but as I say there should be an opportunity for argument 
10 
maybe in writing or something at a later stage ja. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   But more importantly on this question did 
Ledwaba Mzwai opinion deal with the issue of Mr Choeu, did they have 
a recommendation about him, whether he could be disciplined or not 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes they did deal with, they did deal with it, and they 
concurred in their comment with the SNG conclusion about the 
disciplinary. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Did the Board accept that advice to 
implement it? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes the Board accepted that advice. 
20 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you very much.   Now if I may move 
to the next issue and perhaps before I forget it’s at your initial stages 
of your testimony yesterday you mentioned you had been led to believe 
by Mr Dan Matjile the then Chief Executive that the contract  had been 
in place prior to your commencement as Chairman of your duties. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 35 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   And then later on my learned friend was 
ably able to demonstrate to you that the contract was only entered into 
in April of 2012 which would have been some few months after you 
commenced your role as Chairman of the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just raise your voice Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you.   My learned friend was able to 
demonstrate by reference to documents that the first contract was 
entered into sometime in April 2012 before your commencement of 
duties as Chairman of the Board. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s correct. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Now what is your comment there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I am not sure if that is correct, I thought 
that Mr Tsotsi’s evidence, certainly at the beginning was that when he 
was appointed as Chairperson of the Board Eskom had a contract with 
TNA already but I think Ms Hofmeyr sought to say it was entered into 
after he had been appointed, that’s my recollection. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   That’s precisely what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh no I think you may have said something different. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Alright, okay, maybe that was a slip of the 
20 
tongue, that is exactly what I am trying to say.   Do you want to clarify 
how that confusion could have come about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair yes I was not understanding that we were talking 
about the contracts to do with the broadcast, the breakfast.  Eskom had 
a relationship with TNA and that had to do with the newspapers, before 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 36 of 187 
 
I arrived, so there was some contract that existed which had to do with 
them selling newspapers to Eskom and to other SOE’s, so I – my 
statement was essentially just to say there had been some relationship 
with TNA, but the one that we were focusing on to do with this 
particular issue of breakfast came about after I came yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Came about after, ja, okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   The nature of such relationship were you 
privy to? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well I would not ordinarily be privy to them, to it, but in 
this instance because the newspapers were all over the place, I was – I 
10 
had an occasion to ask the Chief Executive why we’re having so many 
of his newspapers and I was told that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Were they noticeably many? 
MR TSOTSI:   They were in heaps Chair around – strategically placed 
...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I have heard some evidence that elsewhere 
also there were heaps and bundles and bundles of them.   
In other departments or SOE’s or Provincial Departments, so 
you noticed that there were lots of newspapers from – was it the – the 
New Age? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   It was the New Age ja 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was the New Age. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s when you enquired what’s the story and 
then you got to know. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 37 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   As a matter of fact would you have been 
privy to the details of this contract had there been no irregularity 
entered into by Mr Matjila, even the under subject of conversation now. 
MR TSOTSI:   Well we would not have been privy to the contract per se 
but because we were invited to this breakfast, sometimes even making 
a presentation obviously we would be aware of the but as to when 
contracts were entered into, even the value you would not know unless 
you specifically asked.   The delegation of authority for these contracts 
10 
was you know at management level, it was not – it had not exceeded 
management level to the extent that it needed to be decided by the 
Bard. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   As a matter of interest and I thought I 
concluded on this point but now that you mention it, you yourself were 
invited with management members to the breakfast sessions you say? 
MR TSOTSI:   On occasion I will be invited yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Would there be value in you going there 
for Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well clearly I would see value because I would get an 
20 
opportunity to say something, to present something. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Alright I don’t want to belabour the point, 
let’s move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that we have taken as much as we have taken 
because I have also been asking questions but I don’t know if you have 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 38 of 187 
 
too many things to clarify, I don’t know how much more time? 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Perhaps five to seven minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that’s fine. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you.   Now two points and then I 
think we will be done.  The first one is you mentioned something about 
a conversation you had with Mr Tony Gupta, which in your mind later on 
he made certain further statements that in your mind were threatening.  
Can you explain what you meant by that and maybe for the benefit of 
the Chairperson let me make the point that discussing with my 
colleague, the evidence leader, there is a session coming up to focus 
10 
on other aspects but this one still is within the TNI, so that’s why I want 
to cover it.  Thank you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes Chair following on the conversation that I had with 
Tony Gupta as I said yesterday at their office clearly he was not happy 
that I did not or was not willing to assist them, even though I tried to 
explain to them that Eskom was a process-orientated organisation and 
these things had to be done that way.  He was very unhappy about it.   
 
I then occasion to again run into him at the SONA which was 
now in February of the following year, in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.   I had had a meeting where the Minister had called 
me specifically ...[intervenes]  
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Which Minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   Minister Brown, whereupon the Minister had – well in this 
instance she was not happy about the fact that I was said to be 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 39 of 187 
 
interfering with management but that’s something we can deal with in 
my next submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   But what is pertinent here is the fact that on that same 
day I got a call from Tony Gupta, and he wanted to speak to me and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that before or after the  meeting with the Minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was after meeting with the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Essentially that meeting with the Minister was a fallout 
10 
between the Minister and myself, to be quite frank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the irony of it is that I got a call from Gupta, Tony 
Gupta for me to speak to him.  At that meeting he was very forthright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now is that a meeting between you and Tony 
Gupta? 
MR TSOTSI:   Tony Gupta yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he called you and asked if the two of you could 
meet.  Same day? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay alright, and you met, and it’s one of those meetings 
20 
where the person doesn’t even offer you a seat, and you talk standing 
and that’s the end of the conversation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you had had such a meeting with the Minister 
previously. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I seem to run into those kind of things. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 40 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Tony Gupta was very clear and he said to me Chairman 
you are not assisting us and by us I understood him to mean his 
organisation.  So I said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   TNA or the Gupta Family? 
MR TSOTSI:   I assumed he meant the Gupta Family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because he had asked me previously and that we will 
also deal with later on my other encounter with him, for some business 
favour so I understood him to be talking on behalf of their business as 
10 
an organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And entities ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said you are not assisting ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   You are not assisting us, those were his words. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I asked him, I said I don’t understand what you mean 
I am not assisting you.   He said every time we want something from 
you, from Eskom you are not coming forth with something, and mind 
you this would have been about the third or further or rather it had 
20 
occurred about three or four times that he asked me something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and was it true that each time you 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   I was not able to assist him each time and I think if one 
looks at the portfolio committee proceedings you would know what 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 41 of 187 
 
issues were raised there, and on this particular occasion then he then 
said to me Chairman we are the ones who put you in the position you 
are in and we are the ones who can take you out of this position, so 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And this would have been around February 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:   This was February 2015, the day before the SONA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then I said to him you do what you have to do and 
let me do the job that the cabinet has asked me to do, and that then 
was the end of the meeting, he simply showed me the door and I left.  
10 
So in essence Chairman this was –I took this to be a clear threat and 
that something was imminent and of course as had occurred I then left 
Eskom in the matter of a month later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, in about a month after that? 
MR TSOTSI:   In about a month after that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, and had said – did you say he had said 
they had put you there, they can take you out, how did he put it? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is exactly the way he put it, he said we are ones 
who put you there, and we are the ones who can take you out of there.  
So it was very unambiguous, it was very clear. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know what he was talking about when he 
said they were the ones who put you there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman I could only speculate ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is that something that you will deal with later, you 
could only speculate? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 42 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I could only speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had no personal knowledge of precisely what he 
was talking about. 
MR TSOTSI:   No I did not have a personal knowledge of precisely what 
he was talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   But I could connect the dots in terms of where this could 
be coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And what would be going on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you want to share that with me? 
MR TSOTSI:   Or is it a long story that you want to tell when you come 
back? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would rather we do that Chair when I come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s fine, as long as in the end we deal with 
it.   Yes Mr Ngcebetsha? 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   For what it – for the purposes of now did 
this failure as alleged on your part include the TNA conversation he had 
with you earlier in which he asked you, as you put it yesterday, make 
this thing go away. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh definitely, I was quite clear that that was the case 
because don’t forget this – that conversation took place I would say 
about a month and a half prior to him telling me what I have just said 
now, so that would have been fresh in his mind I would imagine. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   When you left Eskom end of March was it 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 43 of 187 
 
something that you had preferred to do or you did not? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman in my submission to Parliament I made the 
point that my exit from Eskom was orchestrated from somewhere, I still 
believe that and I hope that someone will have the decency to come 
here and tell us exactly what happened.   But when I connected those I 
still believed that it was orchestrated. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Last point, you did make mention 
yesterday of your interaction with Minister Gigaba. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   And how you received a telephone call 
10 
from him in which you viewed him to have been irate with you.  Do you 
want to tell the Chairperson and the Commission what the nature of 
your relationship had been with him? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair perhaps I should have said this yesterday but you 
know one reason why I was very perplexed at the approach by Minister 
Gigaba and the conversation was that I’d always had a good 
relationship with him, I worked very well with him and I think there was 
mutual respect, and I mean I had known him for quite some time, prior 
to my being Chairman of Eskom during his days of the Youth League of 
the ANC and when I was now Chairman I had occasion a number of 
20 
times to spend a substantial amount of time with him, work related time 
we are talking about, and whenever I needed to meet with him or speak 
to him about an issue he was always available, he would always make 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ja he was always – at the time? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 44 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes he was always available he always made the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had a good working relationship? 
MR TSOTSI:   Very good working relationship with him.  That is why I 
was able to pick up immediately, as I said yesterday, that somebody put 
him up to what he said, I don’t believe that this came from him, I 
believe that someone had put him up to it, and maybe he will be able to 
tell us, I don’t know but that is my conviction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes I mean you are saying that you had known 
him for a long time. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the time of his – when he was in the Youth 
League you had known him. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And after you had become Chairman of the Board of 
Eskom and he was Minister you had had a lot of time to work with him, 
spent a lot of time on work related matters with him, you had 
discussions with him, the type of person that, the type of relationship 
that you had with him was a very good one. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that what he said to you on the occasion 
20 
when he made that call to you, maybe you didn’t say this but this is 
how I understood, maybe the tone of how he spoke to you, you said but 
this is not the person that I know, it is like somebody that I don’t know.  
Is my understanding of your evidence correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Very correct Chair. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 45 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, it was out of character for him to act 
towards you in this manner. 
MR TSOTSI:   Very much so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To speak like this to you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Very much so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you very much Chair and thank you 
for indulging us, that is all that we have on re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Ngcebetsha.   It is a – it is always 
good when one is dealing with experienced practitioners. 
10 
ADV JOHN NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think one can tell.   Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, Chair there is an aspect 
evidence of Mr Tsotsi’s evidence today that is a development on the 
evidence yesterday and I wonder if there could be one or two follow up 
questions from my side, I don’t intend to take long at all, but with your 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just a few minutes? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is just to get a point of clarification on 
commercial value Mr Tsotsi, it seems to have dominated yesterday and 
this morning, but it is quite important for the records of this commission 
and any findings that may be made that we are absolutely clear as to 
your evidence on this.   
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 46 of 187 
 
 
As I understood your evidence yesterday you accepted at the 
time the Board took the Round Robin decision it itself had not assessed 
the commercial had not assessed the commercial value of the contract 
is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I understood you today though to give a 
different answer and say that no there had been consideration of 
commercial value and for that purpose you relied on what Mr Matjila 
had said in his representations and then you added a few other 
considerations, for example that this was not the first contract, that 
10 
Eskom had previously contracted with TNA, and so there would have 
been commercial value in it, did I understand your testimony this 
morning correctly? 
MR TSOTSI:   Not quite, when I said that there have been other 
contracts that Eskom had entered into and Eskom had had to 
understand that there is commercial value for itself I was not 
specifically referring to TNA, I was referring to contracts in general. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Then let me confine my question, did I 
understand you today to say that the Board took into account Mr 
Matjila’s representations on commercial value to arrive at a decision 
20 
that there was commercial value in the contract? 
MR TSOTSI:   The Board looked and in its discussion looked at what 
was before it and one of the things that was before it was in a 
presentation that Mr Matjila had made. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I really do want to get clear here Mr Tsotsi 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 47 of 187 
 
thank you.    
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Those were discussions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he might not have finished, have you finished 
your answer? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just finish it. 
MR TSOTSI:   I was saying that the Board had looked at what was 
before it and one of the things that was before it was this 
10 
representation by Mr Matjila.  The Board had wanted Matjila to come 
and make the representation in person, because that would have 
allowed us an even better opportunity to come to the conclusion, but 
what we then said was that we are not here questioning the fact that 
when the contract was put together there was a consideration that there 
would be commercial value in the contract.  That we were not 
questioning.   
 
And so we understood that in order that we should proceed 
forward we would proceed forward on the understanding that there has 
been a consideration that the contract would have commercial value 
20 
from Mr Matjila, so we were separating the issue of irregularity and the 
issue of the fact that ordinarily this contract would have had to have 
been assessed by management for its commercial value, hence we did 
not say the contract does not have commercial value because our 
understanding is that the contract necessarily would have been 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 48 of 187 
 
assessed for commercial value by the management. 
 
Now what then we said was that given that let us then ensure 
that management continues to extract as much commercial value in the 
contract going forward. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you accept that your lawyers advised you 
that yourselves as a Board determine whether the contract had 
commercial value  
MR TSOTSI:   They did make that statement yes, they did make that 
advice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And when you say it was necessarily the case 
10 
that management had previously assessed commercial value, why 
would that necessarily have been the case? 
MR TSOTSI:   Because that’s the mandate they have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes but this was an irregularly concluded 
contract, whys should reliance be placed by the Board being asked to 
ratify irregular conduct on the version of the person who committed the 
irregular conduct? 
MR TSOTSI:   My understanding is that Eskom has a commercial 
division and a division that looks after these kinds of contracts, and 
that work would have been by people in that division and this work is 
20 
not the first time they are doing this type of work.  What Mr Matjila did 
as a Chief Executive was to sign off on the contract, he himself 
probably was not involved in doing the work, so his action does not 
preclude the fact that Eskom as an organisation would have had the 
capacity to evaluate whether contracts have commercial value for the 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 49 of 187 
 
company or not and the Chief Executive also relies on these people to 
have arrived at that conclusion so his signature of the contract and 
irregular signature of the contract does not take away the commercial 
value of the contract in our view, that is what we say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you enquire of Mr Matjila whether he had 
assessed the commercial value himself? 
MR TSOTSI:   The Board did not have the opportunity to speak to him 
directly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Because Mr Tsotsi the evidence of Mr Choeu, 
who is the only other person who was involved from the division in 
10 
assessing the value of this contract was that it was Mr Matjila who 
instructed him to put together the proposal so that the R43mllion 
contract could be concluded, and then one Mr Choeu had done so they 
entered into contractual negotiations, removed the termination clause 
and then that contract was signed with Mr Matjila.  If you had known 
those facts at the time would you have with caution approached what 
Mr Matjila told you about the value of the contract? 
MR TSOTSI:   If we had known that Eskom did not do the necessary to 
evaluate the commercial value of the contract then not only would we 
have not taken forward the contract the way we did but we would have 
20 
certainly sought some retribution of some sort.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Thank you Chair those are my questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, just one last question.  Shouldn’t the 
Board have said we want to be satisfied that there is commercial value 
on this contract before we can ratify these irregularities that have been 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 50 of 187 
 
committed here, because if we – if you as management fail to satisfy us 
that there is commercial value for Eskom in this contract we would see 
no valid reason to ratify this contract and all of these irregularities.  
The only thing that can persuade us to ratify something that is so 
wrong, is if when we look at the commercial value of the contract we 
say it is with us, doing what we would normally not do, namely ratify 
these irregularities.  
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman you know I think in hindsight there is a lot of 
merit in what you are saying, I certainly agree there is a lot of merit in 
it, but at the time when we’re dealing with this matter I certainly was 
10 
clear on the fact that one needed to separate what ordinarily Eskom 
would do in a situation like this had there not been an irregularity. 
 
Even if for argument’s sake as a Board we had heard that 
Eskom was entering into a contract with TNA the first question we 
would have asked was is there any value in this contract for the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Precisely ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   That would have been the first question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That must be the first question yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  So I think if you picture the situation at the time it 
20 
was our understanding that this is what the company is supposed to do, 
their job is to ensure that contracts that are signed by Eskom have a 
value for the company, otherwise they have no reason to be in the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exactly ja. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 51 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:   So this is how we proceeded in terms of our 
understanding of the fact that necessarily there must be value in this 
contract if Eskom is signing a contract of this nature, irrespective of in 
fact who the contract has been contracted with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course. 
MR TSOTSI:   So the fact that we did not take the step ourselves to 
verify in hindsight to me says perhaps it would have been a bigger 
insurance for us to say we are certain that there is value in this 
contract but our understanding of value in the contract is because that 
is what management is supposed to do, that is what they have been 
10 
engaged by the company to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, mmm. 
MR TSOTSI:   And if the judgment as to the individual who was involved 
in the transgression shouldn’t have clouded or should not cloud the fact 
that the company has got the capacity and normally would have the 
capacity to ensure that its contracts have value for the company, so 
that is where we were in our minds, and by the way Chairman there is 
something also, which was at the time very important, and that was the 
fact that Eskom was in a going concern situation, and it was a very 
critical situation. 
20 
 
In fact I recall even ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say going concern situation are you saying 
that its status as a going concern was in danger or something like that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Serious danger. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 52 of 187 
 
MR TSOTSI:   To the extent that I called, I spoke to the FD, in fact the 
FD ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To who? 
MR TSOTSI:   The Financial Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the Financial Director. 
MR TSOTSI:   And he said to me Chairman we have a very serious cash 
flow problem in the organisation, we may not even be able to pay 
salaries come January, and I recall very clearly asking the Minister, 
calling the Minister and saying Minister – not asking but cautioning the 
Minister that there is a situation, it is a very serious situation for the 
10 
organisation.   
 
The reason I am raising this Chair in the circumstances is that 
that undoubtedly was the preoccupation that the company had, so this 
TNA matter though it was important it was certainly superseded by this 
consideration, so I think in fairness it is possible that had we been 
seized only with this matter   There could probably have been greater 
clarity in terms of how to deal with the situation, such as what you have 
just indicated, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that we felt the 
way did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well of course that might raise another issue or 
20 
maybe it’s not another issue but the question that arises is whether that 
situation that you have just talked about wasn’t a further reason for the 
Board to say what, R43million, when we are in this situation we need to 
know, not to suspect, that there may be commercial value.  We need to 
be satisfied if we ratify this that it is in the interest of this company to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 53 of 187 
 
have – for us to ratify this contract. 
 
What do you say to that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I would say the corollary to that would be if we did 
not ratify it, because don’t forget we had just these two options, if we 
did not ratify then we would be exacerbating the very situation I have 
just described by creating a loss for which we would have no 
opportunity to claw back any value because cancelling the contract 
would have been a worser evil, so I hear what you are saying but at the 
same time that has become also a consideration, in fact it was a 
consideration for some of the Board members in their statements at the 
10 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the difference between what I am thinking and 
what you have just said may be this, that what I am putting to you is 
that the fact that the company was in that precarious situation 
financially placed even – may have placed even a bigger obligation on 
you, not necessarily to decide whether to cancel or not to cancel but to 
satisfy yourself one way or another whether there was commercial 
value before you ratify it, as opposed to ratifying in the hope that 
management had done their job, you understand? 
MR TSOTSI:   I understand very well Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, I don’t know if you want to say anything but 
that’s what is going on in my mind. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes Chair I think on reflection it is a fair point to make, 
however as I say that was not a consideration at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no, no, no I understand, I just wanted to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 54 of 187 
 
make sure that you make an input on what is in my mind which may not 
remain like this later but at the moment that is what I was thinking. 
MR TSOTSI:   It is enriching Chair, it is enriching. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are done, I think now I can release you properly, 
thank you very much Mr Tsotsi, we will see you when you come back. 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair I note that we are just ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused, ja, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I note that we are just before the tea 
adjournment and we do need to rearrange things for the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could we take the tea break now and then 
return at half past? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, that will be enough time for you? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It will indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  We will adjourn for tea now and return 
at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.

Page 55 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair the next witness is Mr Joseph 
Jackson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If I could ask if he could be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes before that I just want to say something.  I do not 
want anything I say to be misinterpreted.  Earlier on before tea I made 
10 
some remarks about Mr Ngcebetsha’s experience.  Nobody must ever 
think that it was a comparison. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No offence taken I assure you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between yourselves and him.  It was simply the fact 
that although most of those who have appeared for some witnesses or 
implicated persons have been very good. There has been one or two 
exceptions where one – where I felt that I wish there was more 
experience.  So – so I am very happy with the performance of the 
present team.  Okay alright I just want to make sure that nobody 
misunderstands that.  Okay please administer the oath or affirmation? 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR JACKSON:  Joseph Frank Jackson. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR JACKSON:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 56 of 187 
 
conscience? 
MR JACKSON:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR JACKSON:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Jackson.  You may then 
continue.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair to start could I ask that the file 
containing Mr Jackson’s affidavit and annexures is admitted as Exhibit 
10 
MM5? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Joseph Frank Jackson’s affidavit and annexures 
thereto will be admitted as Exhibit MM5 and the lever arch file 
containing them will be marked accordingly.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Jackson the file in 
front of you is the file that contains your affidavit and annexures and 
some additional documents.  My intention is that we will stay in that file 
for most if not all of your evidence.  To the extent that we move away 
from it the files alongside you are numbered MM1 to MM7 and I will 
refer those to you at the appropriate time. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I start by asking you just to turn to 
page 1 of the – of MM.  Is that the affidavit that you submitted to the 
commission? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 57 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can I ask you to turn to page 15.   
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Is that your signature? 
MR JACKSON:  That is my signature, correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And are there are corrections that you would 
like to make to the affidavit before we begin? 
MR JACKSON:  No.  I am comfortable thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  So Mr Jackson let us pick it up 
at page 2 of your affidavit where you talk about the history of your role 
at Transnet.  Can you tell us when you joined Transnet and what 
10 
positions you have held since you have been there? 
MR JACKSON:  I will do that.  Good morning Mr Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Jackson. 
MR JACKSON:  My employ at Transnet started on the 16 August 1994. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  At Spoornet in Kimberley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  I was employed at Spoornet now known as Transnet 
freight Rail as a communications practitioner.  From January 1997 until 
September 2006 two years of which the last two years I spent in Cape 
20 
Town where I was responsible for the Regional Communications 
Department on behalf of Transnet.  Between October 2006 and 
December 2014 I was appointed as the Brand and Publicity Coordinator 
for Transnet Group Corporate and Public Affairs and they were based in 
Johannesburg.  At the end of December 2014 I joined Transnet Group 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 58 of 187 
 
Capital as an internal Communication Specialist a position I still hold.  
All these positions I was appointed into by a normal recruitment 
process albeit the last one which was a lateral transfer.  My role as 
Brand and Publicity Coordinator was the first of its kind for Transnet.  
What Transnet wished to achieve was to establish whether there was 
any brand equity in the Transnet brand.  That being the commercial 
value derived from the consumer perception of Transnet’s brand.  The 
view then would be either to change the brand in totality, keep it as it 
or maybe then just refresh certain aspects of it.  So following from a 
brand development statutory development and an implementation plan 
10 
it was then decided and this was after extensive research Mr Chairman 
in 2006 that indeed they would rebrand as Transnet.  That meant 
changing the logo, the names of operating divisions, our signage, our 
livery, its entire corporate identity.  And it is the Transnet we now know 
it to be.  My major function then as Brand and Publicity Coordinator at 
the time was to manage and facilitate and monitor the rollout of this 
brand throughout the organisation.  And all its operating divisions.  
Also to the public specific stakeholders as well as to the media.  I 
would have to look at the approval of certain implementation strategies 
as they pertained to the brand and the production of the annual report.  
20 
As Brand and Publicity Coordinator I reported to the General Manager 
Transnet Group Corporate and Public Affairs and that was Mr Mbonisa 
Sigonyela.  I would also just like to mention maybe it might be 
something I can say that my affidavit as it relates to the information I 
have provided is specific to my role as Brand and Publicity Coordinator.  
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 59 of 187 
 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. And so what that means is that 
we are interested for today’s purposes in the position you held really 
between 2006 and 2014. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Now I understand your evidence to be that 
ordinarily that position would not entail responsibility for advertising. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So how – how did it come to be that 
10 
advertising fell within your range of responsibilities? 
MR JACKSON:  Mr Chairman we had a – an incumbent appointed 
during my period as an advertising manager, Mr Archie Masebe also the 
first such a position.  However he resigned in July 2011.  Towards the 
end of that year Mr Sigonyela had requested I assist with some of the 
responsibilities of the advertising manager until such time that a 
permanent replacement could be found and that is how I came about 
assisting. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just explain to us how those functions – 
those advertising functions differed from the – the other functions that 
20 
you did in the normal course of your job? 
MR JACKSON:  Okay so the main responsibility obviously for 
advertising would be to promote the Transnet brand.  Obviously to also 
make our consumers as well as customers aware of our services.  From 
a brand point of view I was responsible for its identity.  So that would 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 60 of 187 
 
include logos, correct templates, the correct font being used, design 
layout etcetera.  Whereas advertising you work closely with an 
appointed advertising agency who then looks at placement of 
advertisements.   Who looks at sponsorships and recommends on an 
advisory capacity on where to place certain advertisements or 
campaigns based on your strategy.  So ja – that – I do not know if that 
answers the question. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  But it was – it was a different added responsibility. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  And can you just explain to us 
10 
what kinds of advertisements a company like Transnet would be 
placing? 
MR JACKSON:  Well primarily in the absence of any major campaign or 
some strategic objective it is normally your tender recruitment 
advertisements mostly because that is always as part of our business 
Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you – you referred to working together 
with agencies. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What was the name of the agency that was 
20 
employed during your tenure? 
MR JACKSON:  I do believe that was in 2011 Transnet had via an open 
tender process seeked the services of an advertising agency and they 
were appointed and they were called The Agency.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  The commission has heard 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 61 of 187 
 
some evidence on the role that agencies play in providing services in 
the context of advertising and sponsorship.  Can you just sort of briefly 
explain to us what role The Agency played for Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  Okay so The Agency would be our advisor.  An expert 
in their specific expertise which was the placement of advertisements 
where and why depending your – what your desired outcome would be 
as far as the campaign is concerned.  So for instance they would be 
able to advise on demographic reach, number of circulation.  They also 
had the opportunity to negotiate on your behalf.  So you knew that you 
would most likely get the best price based on their relationships but 
10 
also buying power within that environment.  Ja I think that is what we 
would do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Now if you can turn to page 5 of 
your affidavit at – at paragraph 21 you refer to an advertising guideline. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That was prepared by your predecessor Mr 
Masebe. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But you say that it was never approved or 
made official. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Why was that? 
MR JACKSON:  It was prepared and a draft had been provided as I 
have stated however there is a certain process that had to – that 
needed to have followed – been followed it – for example it needed a – 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 62 of 187 
 
an eventual signoff by EXCO to make it official.  However it never 
reached that stage.  So it was never formalised in the sense that it 
became company policy. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  And – and so what – what guided 
Transnet’s advertising strategy? 
MR JACKSON:  Honestly there was no policy. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we go to the policy briefly?  The draft 
policy. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I will refer to it as.  Because even though it 
10 
was never made official it is – I think it is useful to look at what its 
author envisaged. 
MR JACKSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If you turn to page 21 of your bundle that is 
at the JJ1 tab.   
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you look under purpose.  It says: 
“The purpose of the policy is to utilise Transnet 
advertising resources and reach the target market in 
the most cost effective manner.  To have a framework 
20 
for setting and achieving advertising objectives.  To 
enable advertising measurement so the organisation 
knows what works and what does not.” 
Mr Jackson even though this was never adopted as a policy would you 
say that those were kind of advertising principles by which Transnet 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 63 of 187 
 
sought to adhere? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes.  Generally I would agree. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can return to your affidavit. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At page 6.  And particularly from page 23 – 
sorry paragraph 23 where you describe the pressure that your superior 
Mr Sigonyela exerted on you to use TNA for newspaper advertising.  
Can you first describe what role it was that you specifically played in 
relation to the placement of an advertisement in the newspaper? 
MR JACKSON:  Okay.  I would say at the state that Mr Sigonyela had 
10 
requested I assist with the advertising portfolio he also requested I 
become more involved in the placement of recruitment and tender 
adverts which meant that from a branding point of view I took sole 
responsibility for the placement of the ads and how they looked Mr 
Chairman.  So they needed to be in the correct format, correct font and 
consistent throughout the organisation which I had to sought of sign off 
on.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what instruction did Mr Sigonyela give 
you in respect of the placement of advertisements? 
MR JACKSON:  At some stage he then instructed me to advise my 
20 
colleagues that they must advertise these recruitment and tender 
adverts in the TNA. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And why did he say that? 
MR JACKSON:  There was no reason except you must do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 64 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  He made it clear that it – I must just – it is an 
instruction it must be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  He gave no reason as to why advertisements 
should be placed specifically in TNA? 
MR JACKSON:  No he did not Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that to mean all advertisements or … 
MR JACKSON:  Specifically… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or that at least some should go there? 
MR JACKSON:  No.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  All? 
MR JACKSON:  So it is specifically recruitment and tender which I had 
an oversight on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  From a branding point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  Those all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACKSON:  Had to be advertised in the newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In New Age. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  In New Age. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And had he told you before or since to – to 
use particular publications for advertisements? 
MR JACKSON:  No. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  On page 6 of your affidavit at paragraph 24 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 65 of 187 
 
you refer to an email from Rajeshree Moodley of Transnet Freight Rail 
is that one of the operating divisions of Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you to turn to that email it is JJ2 
on page 36?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Page 36 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So this is an email from Rajeshree Moodley 
it is to Mr Sigonyela and it refers to a telephonic conversation that they 
10 
had had and you will see that at item 2 it says: 
“In addition to the current publications currently 
being utilised we should also use the New Age and 
Sowetan” 
That is Ms Moodley recording a telephonic conversation she has had 
with Mr Sigonyela.  Does that accord with the kind of instruction that 
you were given? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes that is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If I can ask you then to turn just two page 
forward to page 38.  And this is an email from Samantha Baadjies at 
20 
Transnet Property Durban.  
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Is this also an operating division of 
Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  It is a specialist division. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 66 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  A specialist division. 
MR JACKSON:  Within Transnet correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And she says: 
“Hi Joseph I have changed the font to …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you – you are – I must catch up with you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Apologies Chair.  We are on page 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we got there what position did Rajeshree 
Moodley hold at Transnet Freight Rail at the time? 
MR JACKSON:  I almost am of the opinion she was from procurement.  
I could be mistaken but … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is your recollection. 
MR JACKSON:  That is my recollection yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay alright.  And then what page did you say 
we must go to? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Just two pages forward Chair on page 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At the bottom is an email from Samantha 
Baadjies to Mr Jackson and it says: 
20 
“I have changed the font to Tahoma as requested.  I plan to advertise in 
Sunday Tribune or Zululand Observer.  I will however confirm once I 
receive the quotes as there is a limited budget.” 
Mr Jackson can you read your response? 
MR JACKSON:  Okay.  Mr Chairman my response says: 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 67 of 187 
 
“Hi Samantha, thanks for this it looks good.  We can 
also recommend you make use of the New Age 
newspaper.  Thanks.  Regards.  Joseph.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that – was that when you were starting to give 
effect to the instruction? 
MR JACKSON:  Correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Mr Sigonyela? 
MR JACKSON:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Apart from Mr Sigonyela’s instruction did 
10 
you have any particular reason to suggest the New Age newspaper? 
MR JACKSON:  None. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Did you know anything about its circulation 
within that area? 
MR JACKSON:  No.  Mr Chairman it was a new newly founded 
newspaper so indeed it would not have any circulation figures.  We 
would not be privy to any demographic reach they would have or 
readership numbers.  So no.  There would – I would not be able to 
recommend it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just said it is Sigonyela but I suspect it is Sigonyela. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know? 
MR JACKSON:  I – I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure it is Sigonyela because I see his first name 
is Mboniso so that probably… 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 68 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  Mboniso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that probably is Mxhosa or… 
MR JACKSON:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Zulu so – but I – in which case it would be 
Sigonyela as opposed to Sigonyela.  Ja okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Jackson you – you say 
– you attach a lot of importance to the words recommend in that email.  
Can you explain why you used that word? 
MR JACKSON:  Mr Chairman I was of the opinion that operating 
divisions were not compelled to – to advertise in any newspaper based 
10 
on our instruction.  There – as much as they followed the same 
communication strategy as we had they were autonomous in who they 
customer was and also as far as their budget.  So I was of the opinion 
that if they did not have budget or there were certain circumstances 
that indicated that they – they could not afford this other newspaper 
that they were at the discretion to use the newspapers they had 
decided upon.  So instead of instructing you must I decided to use the 
word recommend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that you used the word recommend. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the reasons that you have given. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that have been in line with Mr Sigonyela’s 
instruction to you or was it contrary to it? 
MR JACKSON:  It was contrary Mr Chairman. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 69 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  It was an instruction that they must. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  It was not a – an option. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you chose consciously. 
MR JACKSON:  So I consciously … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say recommend. 
MR JACKSON:  And in some of them I would include if your budget 
10 
permits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja okay. 
MR JACKSON:  So it is your discretion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR JACKSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In fact Mr Jackson your evidence in your 
affidavit is that Mr Sigonyela did not react well to the use of the word 
recommend? 
MR JACKSON:  No he did not Mr Chairman.  I was verbally 
20 
reprimanded for not having followed an instruction.  I was told to be 
incompetent and if I were to continue doing this he would find someone 
that would follow his instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the way you worked in regard to this portfolio 
involving advertising did you yourself sometimes place advertisements 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 70 of 187 
 
in newspapers or was the position that other people made those 
decisions or other people placed advertisements in newspapers but 
they could not do that without hearing from you first and that is where 
you would come in to say, place it in that newspaper or in that 
newspaper or not in that newspaper.  What was the position? 
MR JACKSON:  I think this is how the position played out Mr Chairman.  
There was no such official process in place to do that.  Ja.  The real – 
how it came about was my involvement when I was asked to be more 
involved in the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Involved. 
10 
MR JACKSON:  From a brand point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  And have a consistency throughout the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  And through means I received the instruction now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  Now why do you that?  You must instruct them to 
advertise in the New Age newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so… 
MR JACKSON:  So that is not what would normally… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your role ended with – was supposed to end with 
recommending? 
MR JACKSON:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were instructed to instruct? 
MR JACKSON:  Instruct yes. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 71 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at least in the – on the instances that has been 
referred to up to now you recommended. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you just said that Mr Sigonyela reprimanded you 
for that and threatened that if you were not following his instruction he 
would find somebody who would follow his instruction. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Jackson if we can then turn to paragraph 
41 and following in your affidavit that is on page 7.  Here you talk about 
10 
the big interview.   
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you tell us what the big interview was? 
MR JACKSON:  The big interview was a weekly insertion in the New 
Age newspaper which profiled a media personality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am interrupting both of you.  You have – 
you have given evidence about this but maybe there is value in just 
reading that paragraph 27 of your affidavit. 
MR JACKSON:  27 Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR JACKSON:   
“Between late 2013 and mid 2014 Mr Sigonyela 
requested verbally that when approached for such 
advise I should tell Transnet’s operating divisions 
that the recruitment and tender advertisements must 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 72 of 187 
 
be placed in the TNA newspaper.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay I just thought that that is important. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am grateful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Jackson we were at paragraph 31 and 
following and you were about to explain to the commission what the big 
interview was. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes.  Mr Chairman the big interview was a week insert 
10 
into the New Age newspaper which aimed at profiling a media 
personality and then profiling and showing them in their both public and 
private life.  That was what that had aimed to achieve or do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they would – they would have a space reserved for 
that? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe there will be a picture of that person and his 
or her story? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Did the people interviewed have anything to 
do with Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  No. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you to turn to page 33 this is the 
approach that is made to Transnet with a proposal for the big interview. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 73 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if we go to JJ4 at page 40. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you earlier on say 33?  Or did I? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Apologies Chair I am in paragraph 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Jackson refers to it from paragraph 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  So I must go to 40? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But I am going to ask you to turn to page 
40. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Which is where the email correspondence is 
contained. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if we start Mr Jackson at the bottom of 
page 40 where Mr Jacques Roux. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Emails Ms Natasha Minnie. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And says: 
“Hi Natasha” 
20 
And if you go over the page. 
“As discussed telephonically herewith please find our 
proposal for Transnet to sponsor the big interview.” 
Who is Jacques Roux? 
MR JACKSON:  Jacques Roux introduced himself as a representative 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 74 of 187 
 
or I would imagine a sales marketer on behalf of the New Age making 
this proposal. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Ms Minnie? 
MR JACKSON:  Ms Minnie was the Executive at the Agency responsible 
for the Transnet account Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Natasha Minnie? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Mr Jackson if we turn to page 42 that - 
that is the proposal that is attached to Mr Roux’s email? 
10 
MR JACKSON:  That is the proposal Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you take us through this?  What - what 
is being proposed here? 
MR JACKSON:  Okay.  It - it says: 
“Please can you clarify?” 
Because this is obviously what he had proposed as part of what he 
shared with Ms … (intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry Mr Jackson.  I am - I am asking you 
about page 42. 
MR JACKSON:  Oh.  Sorry.  Sorry. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Where - where the actual proposal is 
contained. 
MR JACKSON:  Oh.  There we go. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And … 
MR JACKSON:  You will see that it includes as part of the proposal ear 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 75 of 187 
 
piece - spaces which is basically on the side of the page.  That would 
be a logo being placed.  Strip add which is more … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - I am sorry.  So that is a proposal signed by 
Jacques Roux that we just talked about and it is addressed to - what?  
The Agency. 
MR JACKSON:  Correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what was the Agency again?  I know we … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The Agency Chair … 
MR JACKSON:  They were actually. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry. 
10 
MR JACKSON:  Sorry.  Mr Chairman they were actually called the 
Agency.  Ja.  That was - they operated under the name the Agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is new The New Age? 
MR JACKSON:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is that? 
MR JACKSON:  The agency that was appointed by Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  That is  
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was their name? 
MR JACKSON:  That was their name. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Alright.  So this was addressed to the 
Agency? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was a separate entity from Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  Correct. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 76 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But related to Transnet … 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not related? 
MR JACKSON:  No.  They were.  We had an open tender process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A subsidiary or something? 
MR JACKSON:  No.  We had an open tender process seeking the 
expertise of an advertising agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  No … (intervenes). 
MR JACKSON:  And the account was awarded … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR JACKSON:  To them.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I missed something earlier on.  Ja.  Okay.  
Alright.  Okay.  So - yes then you can continue … 
MR JACKSON:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the proposal. 
MR JACKSON:  Okay.  So Mr Chairman they proposed ear spaces 
which is either side of the - of the newspaper … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR JACKSON:  Where a logo would - you had the opportunity to put 
your logo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR JACKSON:  A strip add which was at the bottom of a newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR JACKSON:  Again you could design something specific with the 
Transnet logo or a message. Whatever you - you deemed - you would 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 77 of 187 
 
want … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR JACKSON:  And then obviously naming rights.  So the big interview 
would call the - be called the Transnet big interview and you would 
have those rights as part of your - your sponsorship. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you will see there that there is a price 
in the table - in the main table of R327 576,00.  Over what period would 
that amount be pay - payable? 
MR JACKSON:  I think and this is where the confusion came.  This 
seemed to be the total for the entire campaign.  Right.  It is - it is for 
10 
the month. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Right. 
MR JACKSON:  It is only for the month. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and if you look to the top left at that 
smaller table. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Where it says total value. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Would that be the - the total over the entire 
six month period? 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Six months.  That is correct.  The R1 965 456,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is - what - how much was the space that would 
be given to Transnet for this purpose? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 78 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  It was a page Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The whole page? 
MR JACKSON:  The whole page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - I am sorry.  So you would - if you accepted the 
proposal as Transnet.  You would decide what you are going to write in 
that space and what picture - whose picture you want to put in? 
MR JACKSON:  No Mr Chairman.  That was not part of the initial 
agreement.  It was at their discretion.  What … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was at … 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was to be at their discretion? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but what was their discretion? 
MR JACKSON:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or what to put in their? 
MR JACKSON:  According to the proposal as they - they set it about.  It 
would have been a - a media personality who would have been of 
interest to the public.  So based on that it could be anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To do what with Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  It - it did not serve its purpose for Transnet. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I mean Transnet could pay and they go and take 
whoever they liked? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is - what is - what was the need for 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 79 of 187 
 
Transnet on - on that basis? 
MR JACKSON:  The - the items listed here as part of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to put your logo? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, if you look in the proposal you will 
actually see a list of some of the people that they have included in this 
interview in the past.  Piet Byleveld, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, SABC 
CEO Phil Molefe etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but really it is nothing for Transnet or am I 
10 
missing something? 
MR JACKSON:  No Mr Chairman.  You are not missing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just - the proposal wants - wants you as Transnet 
to just … 
MR JACKSON:  Put money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sponsor their business? 
MR JACKSON:  Again if - if you were to ask you should be able to 
influence your customer or stakeholder … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  Directly through these sort of interventions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  But we were not at liberty … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 80 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  Or we did not have that as part of this agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  (Coughing) excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you got it from me. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can then turn to page 40 Mr Jackson.  
That is JJ4 … 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA: 
 
And 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
page 
Hanlie Van Eck sends an email to Jacques Roux and she says: 
“Hi there Jacques, please can you send me a visual 
10 
example of the sponsorship.  Please can you also 
clarify …” 
And then the first bullet point. 
“…that 
the 
cost 
for 
the 
sponsorship 
is 
R327 576,00.” 
Your evidence a moment ago was that was in fact the monthly 
price? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes.  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  
It 
appears 
that 
Ms Van Eck is 
from 
something called Planet Media SA. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What is that? 
MR JACKSON:  It is the advisory service specifically that an expert in 
media placement and would be able to establish value or return an 
investment on advertisements that were placed in newspapers or any 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 81 of 187 
 
media. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then further up the page Martha Moremi 
emails - forwards the email to you and says: 
“We are still waiting for the publication to answer 
the 
questions 
before 
we 
can 
finalise 
the 
evaluation.” 
Who is Ms Moremi? 
MR JACKSON:  Ms Moremi was the Account Executive assigned to the 
Transnet account by the Agency Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and what evaluation is she referring to 
10 
when she says before we can finalise the evaluation? 
MR JACKSON:  She refers to the email below from Hanlie to 
Jacques Roux wanting to establish the - the facts as they appear in his 
proposal in view of wanting to give the - the advice back as to whether 
this would be of any value to Transnet. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  If I can then ask you to turn to 
JJ5 which is at page 44 and this is from Natasha Minnie to - to 
Hanlie Van Eck and she says: 
“Hi Hanlie, not sure if I sent this to you, but 
somehow I think I did.  Client has phoned and is 
20 
putting me under pressure for an evaluation of this 
proposal.” 
Who would have been applying that pressure? 
MR JACKSON:  As the client that would be Transnet.  That would be 
my - my boss - Mr Sigonyela. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 82 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and was there any particular urgency 
associated with this proposal? 
MR JACKSON:  Not as far as I am concerned Mr Chairman.  It was 
following process.  If I do not - I do not - I cannot say that there - there 
should have been any pressure. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, we have an affidavit from Ms Van Eck 
from - from Planet Media.  If I can ask you to turn there Mr Jackson.  It 
is at page 139.  Chair unfortunately the - the email correspondence has 
been - is - is contained within the body of the affidavit and this text is 
quite small.  We have got a magnified version of it.  If you turn to page 
10 
146. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Chair, Ms - Ms Van Eck’s affidavit is 
obviously at this stage only presented to the Commission on a 
provisional basis subject to your - your direction in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Jackson, at the bottom of the page 
Ms Moremi sends an email to you and Mr Sigonyela and that is on 
14 December and there she - she confirms what I understand you to 
have said about the - the cost of the sponsorship at 327 000 per month 
20 
or 1.9 million over six months. 
MR JACKSON:  Yes.  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that stage when she advises on this - these 
costs still the only benefit - if any - that Transnet is guaranteed is 
whatever benefit would flow from placing its logo on the relevant page? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 83 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Thank you and for that in six months you would 
pay just under two million? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes sir.  Yes Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then just the - the email immediately 
above.  Ms Van Eck responds and says: 
“Hi there all, based on this cost the sponsorship is 
extremely expensive and not worth the ROI.” 
I assume Return on Investment? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  “I recommend we do not proceed.  
As per my previous mail to Jacques (see attached) 
the total cost was confirmed at 327 576 for 22 
weeks.  At this deal it was fantastic, but not as it 
stands now.” 
So as I understand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What was fantastic?  Is - is paying so 
much to - for - for putting your logo on - on a newspaper page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, as I understand it and Mr Jackson 
please … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  Ja.  No Mr Chair.  She was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  There was something else? 
MR JACKSON:  Correct.  She was under the impression that it was 
confirmed at 327 576 for 22 weeks.  So it was a longer period. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 84 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if it was … 
MR JACKSON:  Even if it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is my question. 
MR JACKSON:  Even at - she says at least it would have been better … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  But still she is of the opinion that was too expensive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that she says it was fantastic.  I mean I do 
not know.  Maybe you communications people … 
MR JACKSON:  I just think it was sub - sub … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you communications people know that there is 
10 
some value.  I do not see much value if all - all you are going to have 
is just put the - the logo unless there is some message that goes with 
it, but maybe people in your field say no.  There is some value. 
MR JACKSON:  For 22 weeks we could consider … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MR JACKSON:  Or look at … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACKSON:  And maybe  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACKSON:  Like you rightly put it … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  Provide messaging that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  Talks to an - an audience … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 85 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  But not at what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  That amount was - was then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  Agreed to.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can then turn to - back to the 
annexures to your page affidavit to page 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that.  If all you will put in the 
newspaper is Transnet’s logo.  What purpose - what value does that 
10 
give Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  You see Mr Chairman you have the opportunity in that 
instance for - from - I am talking from the brand point of view.  That you 
are top of mind in people’s everyday life.  What makes this difficult in 
this scenario is that we have not tested the reach of this newspaper or 
who is reading it. 
So there - at this stage we could not say that indeed we 
would be getting awareness or anything of value to be honest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see maybe I could understand a situation where a 
new company that is not known comes up and says we want to - to be 
20 
known in the market.  We want our customers to know about us.  One of 
the ways we will do is have our logo in front of - in their eyes each time 
they pick up this newspaper.  Even if there is no message. 
Let them just know there is an organisation like this.  Maybe I 
could understand that, but when you talk about Transnet.  Whatever 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 86 of 187 
 
names - there have been a change of names.  Really Transnet is known 
- has been known for a long time.  Why do you want it to be known 
more than that for? 
MR JACKSON:  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you must help me.  Maybe because I am not in 
communications there is something i do not understand, but I am saying 
it is - it is a known entity. 
MR JACKSON:  I - I agree with you Mr Chairman.  I think in this 
instance I would like to respond by and this is my using my 
communications … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  Hat.  All publicity is good publicity, but in this instance 
I cannot defend it and that is what I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  I want to be clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR JACKSON:  What is difficult as well is when you also sponsor … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  You would hope that there is some association with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Who you are getting involved in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  To - be beneficial to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  In this instance nothing can be further from there, 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 87 of 187 
 
because we do not know this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  New publication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  So we had no benefit either.  Even in that - in that 
sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  There was no association. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  So from a - from that business point of view. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  It - it should be - you are right in questioning.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean when - before the Commission started with its 
hearings there was some suggestion that the Commission could engage 
- you know - specialists in communication and so and so on, but I 
decided no, because I said the Commission is there.  A lot of people 
have interest in it.  The media will be talking about it. 
People will get to know about it.  We will call media 
conferences and the media will come.  People will talk about the - the 
Commission.  So why should we pay money to specialist.  To do what 
20 
for the Commission?  The - the Commission is known and will be known 
even more as it does its work.  So I look at Transnet and say really. 
Why, but I do not want anybody to start thinking there is no 
need for communication specialists.  I am sure - I am sure there is, but 
that issue of just placing a logo just seems - I have difficulty in 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 88 of 187 
 
understanding what value, but maybe I will get to understand as I hear 
more evidence, but it would be different if there is some message that 
goes with the logo for me.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Jackson, can I ask you 
to turn to page 57? 
MR JACKSON:  Just say that again.  Sorry.  57? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  57.  It is Annexure 8.  Have you got 57? 
MR JACKSON:  I do.  Oh sorry.  This is 157 - 57.  Sorry about that.  
Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And this is another email from Ms Van Eck.  
10 
She starts by setting out the proposal.  Can I ask you to read from 
below the - the last bullet point? 
MR JACKSON:  Sure. 
“So based on the above costs we cannot justify this 
feature.  From the point of view of no interim ABC 
having 
being 
provided 
as 
yet 
and 
verified 
circulation 
is 
concerned. 
 
However 
from 
an 
association point of view this feature is definitely 
well written and it would be beneficial to be 
associated with this.  It is a shame that the TNA is 
20 
not prepared to offer more value so that it becomes 
a partnership.  At this stage the offer stands as it 
is.  As the offer stands at the moment it is the 
recommendation not to support the sponsorship.  
Kind regards, Hanlie Van Eck.” 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 89 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Can we go back to where it 
says? 
“From a value point of view no interim ABC has 
been provided.” 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What is - what is an interim ABC? 
MR JACKSON:  That is a - an indication of a newspaper’s circulation 
numbers.  It is reach and the specific demographic that it targets.  So it 
is - it is statistics we can use in order to understand where specifically 
if it is targeted at a specific audience or a message we wish to - to 
10 
communicate.  So the TNA at this stage had none of that available. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed.  ABC - the evidence we have heard 
already is the Audit Bureau of Circulation and Chair in the course of 
Mr Pretorius’ evidence we obtained an affidavit from the Audit Bureau 
of Circulation to confirm that TNA never applied for a - accreditation 
and so in other words you knew nothing about the circulation of the 
newspaper into which you would be placing the advertisement? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that on its own would have been critical to know.  
Is it not? 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Absolutely Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because otherwise you may be wasting money. 
MR JACKSON:  It is a huge risk Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR JACKSON:  It is money spent. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 90 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is fruitless.  Ja.  It might be fruit … 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If - if we can then just two pages over to 
page 59 and - and this is another email from Ms Van Eck and it is over 
a conversation that she has had with Mr Sigonyela and she says: 
“As per our telecon it would be great if we could get 
some free advertising space to give us value for 
this proposal.” 
She sets out there - what does FPFC stand for? 
10 
MR JACKSON:  It is Front Page Full Colour ads that would be added.  
So it would appear as - on the front page additional advertising which 
again Mr Chairman would be a Transnet logo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be? 
MR JACKSON:  A Transnet logo … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JACKSON:  On the front page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  So they - they agree to additional. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and she concludes by saying: 
20 
“If that were the case I would recommend we 
support the sponsorship.” 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - maybe it might be worthwhile reading that 
email in full - if we have not read it - into the record. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 91 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That email reads: 
“Hi there Mboniso, as per our telecon it would be 
great if we could get some free advertising space to 
give us value for this proposal.  Six FPFC ads or 12 
Half Page FC …” 
Which is Full Colour? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  “…would give value of 775 000,00.  
10 
Four Full Page Full Colour ads or eight Half Page 
Full Colour would give value of R516 672,00.  Of 
course the six Full Page Full Colour ads (12 Half 
Page ads) would be preferred, but even if we only 
get four Full Page Full Colour ads (eight Half Page 
Full Colour ads).  It would assist in justifying the 
cost to value ratio of the proposal.  If that were the 
case 
I 
would 
recommend 
we 
support 
the 
sponsorship.  Please let me know if you have any 
additional - if you need any additional information.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is the difference between what she would not 
support earlier and what she will - is prepared to support now?  Is it the 
size of … 
MR JACKSON:  Mr Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 92 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:  Basically they had agreed or they had now negotiated 
additional advertising space.  So it would be included.  Not only inside 
the publication, but on the front page as well you would be given the 
opportunity to advertise by your - your logo.  So in her mind that 
constituted further value and she would then be in the position to - to 
support or try and justify the costs that were associated Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of front page was it still just going to be 
putting logo - a logo without necessarily any guarantee … 
MR JACKSON:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or - or putting a message? 
10 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman.  It would have - it would 
have been a logo and it would then have most likely a big interview.  So 
the - the logo with the association of the sponsorship of the big 
interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the - the interview now could be anybody? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who might have nothing to do with … 
20 
MR JACKSON:  Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must confess I still struggle to see the value even 
with that.  Okay.  Alright. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 93 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Well Chair in - in Mr Jackson’s affidavit he 
does too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we go there to page 10 Mr Jackson at 
paragraph 46? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You - you say that you found the decision to 
- to now participate in the big interview suspicious and you did not see 
it as justifiable.  Can you elaborate on that? 
MR JACKSON:  Mr Chairman, as I have said in my affidavit I - I was 
10 
suspicious because the advice received was clear.  It was not worth the 
money we were requested to participate in the sponsorship and literally 
a day later that decision changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  Based on fee advertising as you rightly put.  Really did 
not mean anything more than what we - what we agree.  So I - that was 
my - my thought and became suspicious as to why - why this change 
and remember again.  It is a new newspaper.  So even if it was front 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR JACKSON:  There was still no guarantee as to what return on the 
investment we were going to receive.  So we were putting the spend - 
spending of this money - it was at risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  We had no way to - to justify it regardless of what we 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 94 of 187 
 
said was adding value and ja.  That is what I believe. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At - at this stage you still knew nothing 
about the circulation data? 
MR JACKSON:  None. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You knew nothing about who the newspaper 
was reaching? 
MR JACKSON:  No.  Remember it still has been a new public - they - 
they had nothing.  We could not even guess or have them guess. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Hm. 
MR JACKSON:  It - it was completely new. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and did you raise these kinds of 
concerns with Mr Sigonyela? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes.  I did Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was his response? 
MR JACKSON:  That it was not important at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was not important? 
MR JACKSON:  My question and my concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what he said? 
MR JACKSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he … 
20 
MR JACKSON:  And that was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was basically dismissive? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct.  That was the end of the conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can then turn Mr Jackson to the - the 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 95 of 187 
 
first internal memorandum that approved the sponsorship.  That is - 
that is at JJ11 on page 66. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just remind me what was - oh 
Mr Sigonyela was General Manager Corporate and Public Affairs? 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the whole of Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:  For the whole of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and he was the person to whom you 
reported? 
10 
MR JACKSON:  That is correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, we were just going to page 66.  The - 
the internal memorandum continues there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am there. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  Can you tell us who that is from and - 
and who it is addressed to? 
MR JACKSON:  It is addressed from the General Manager from Group 
Corporate and Public Affairs Mr Sigonyela who is my - who I reported to 
the Group Chief Executive - Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And there - there are one or two aspects of 
20 
this proposal that I would - I would just like to pause on.  The first is in 
paragraph 2 where is says: 
“The New Age publication is one of the key 
publication that Transnet targets for positioning its 
brand and its image as part of its reputation 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 96 of 187 
 
management strategy.” 
Was that true? 
MR JACKSON:   No it was not true Mr Chairman, I am not aware of 
such a strategy or why a decision for the TNA would be part of that. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Was the New Age one of the key 
publications that Transnet targeted? 
MR JACKSON:   Well in the sense that from an instruction point of view 
yes, but I mean from a campaign or a strategy there was never ever 
mention of the New Age Newspaper. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And if we turn the page to 67 the bullet 
10 
point at the top starting, this platform, 
 
“This platform will afford Transnet the opportunity to send key 
 
messages to our stakeholders’, 
 
How was it going to achieve that? 
MR JACKSON:   Like I said my thoughts would be, if you were given a 
stripper ad you could be given the opportunity to address or make a 
certain statement of importance relating to a stakeholder you would – 
that however, was not the case and again, Mr Chairman you didn’t know 
who these stakeholders where or who these – this newspaper would 
reach.  So you cannot verify or justify it as true. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And then if we just turn over one more 
page to page 68 this is where the recommendation is concerned, it 
says, 
 
“We recommend that the GCE approves the proposal for the 
sponsorship for the New Age, the big interview, that the sponsorship 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 97 of 187 
 
will be reviewable every three months”, 
 
It’s compiled and recommended by Mr Sigonyela and it’s 
signed by Mr Molefe.  Can you tell us the date of the signatures of each 
of them? 
MR JACKSON:   The first compiled and recommended by Mr Modisa 
Sigonyela is on February 12, 2012 and its final approval date is by Mr 
Brian Molefe, Group Chief Executive on the 23 r d of February 2012. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that – I don’t know if it’s a lady or a man, Ms or 
Mr Zolo Stiffen did not sign, do you know why he or she did not sign? 
10 
MR JACKSON:   I would be speculating Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay that’s fine, I thought there might be 
significance in the fact there’s no signature there, okay. 
MR JACKSON:   Maybe let me add Mr Chairman in normal process 
there need to be all the signatories if they were included you cannot, 
not – because Miss Zola Stiffen would be Mr Sigonyela’s direct boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ordinarily if a document like this reaches the 
person whose signature appears last if there is somebody who has not 
signed who was supposed to have signed already then he’s supposed 
to find out why? 
20 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chair, he wouldn’t sign it either 
…[intervenes].   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because he would be signing on the 
recommendation of that person immediately before…[intervenes]. 
MR JACKSON:   Correct, who was his direct report. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 98 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because that person is the supervisor of 
the…[intervenes]. 
MR JACKSON:   Correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Jackson I’d just like 
us to take note of the date of Mr Molefe’s signature which is the 23 r d of 
February, we’ll return to that in a moment.  Can I ask you to just go to 
page – back to page 66 which is the cover page of the memorandum 
and you see the subject is the sponsorship of the New Age, the big 
interview.  
10 
MR JACKSON:   66 yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    The subject will you just read the subject 
line? 
MR JACKSON:   The sponsorship of the New Age (TNA) the big 
interview. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you and this was a proposal for a 
sponsorship? 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    I’ll return to that in a moment.  If I could 
then ask you to turn to page 72…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry before you go there, if you go back to page 
66, paragraph 4, bullet point 3,  
 
“This 
sponsorship 
opportunity 
will 
afford 
Transnet 
the 
 
following benefits, naming rights on the page border”, 
 
 
What did that mean, name rights on the page border? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 99 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:   Ja as explained the advertising on the front page, 
which included the logos Mr Chairman would then have the word, The 
Big Interview or the words The Big Interview so that it assumes the 
association with Transnet so it was a Transnet initiative and owned the 
rights to the Big Interview, I don’t know if that makes sense. So that 
was what was placed on the front cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Naming rights would normally mean, I can say, this is 
going to be – the stadium will be called FNB Stadium, isn’t it? 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This competition will be called Nedbank competition 
10 
okay, now with that understanding does that understanding apply to this 
naming rights here? 
MR JACKSON:   That is the correct understanding Mr Chairman and in 
this sense it means that it was called The Transnet Big Interview so 
that was the naming rights associated to Transnet by virtue of this 
sponsorship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is going to be called the Transnet Interview 
why is it that Transnet is not the one who decides on who will be put 
there, who will be interviewed? 
MR JACKSON:   I agree Mr Chairman, it should. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Chair we thought it might be helpful to see 
an example of the Big Interview…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh that will be helpful yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    The text of the actual article is illegible it’s 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 100 of 187 
 
too small but it gives you a sense of the layout. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that will be helpful. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   We beg leave to hand that up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Could we approach the witness to give him 
a copy? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And Chair we’ll suggest that this is 
inserted –sorry I’ve left the second page behind.  We’ll suggest that 
this is inserted into MM5 with paginated page number 181. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay,  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Mr Jackson certainly from this picture it 
doesn’t appear that it’s called the Transnet Big Interview? 
MR JACKSON:    Mr Chairman – you are correct but I just want to 
highlight this will be the future – the initial agreement which is the 
inside, you’ll see it’s page 20 so there would be another version which 
would include the front page where it would state, Transnet the Big 
Interview. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    I see. 
MR JACKSON:   And that would be the naming rights that came as 
20 
additional but otherwise this is how it appeared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Transnet was just being robbed, I mean really. You 
say they must pay over – close to R2million and – just because you are 
going to come up with an interview and you’ll call it the Transnet Big 
Interview and it might have nothing to do with Transnet, I’m not missing 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 101 of 187 
 
anything? 
MR JACKSON:   You are not Mr Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Mr Jackson can I ask you then to turn to 
page 72 and the email at the top of that page.  It’s an email from Hanlie 
van Eck it’s to Jacques Roux who you say is from TNA, 
 
“Hi there Jacques, long time no speak, hope the year has 
 
been a great one so far.  I have had an instruction from 
 
Transnet to proceed with the sponsorship”, 
 
So as I read that, Ms van Eck who works for Planit Media 
10 
which is a sub-contractor to the agency has received an instruction 
from Transnet to proceed with the sponsorship.  The date of this is the 
15 t h of February 2012, who would have given that instruction? 
MR JACKSON:   The only delegated person who could give such an 
instruction, Mr Chairperson, is Mr Mboniso Sigonyela. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And was there the necessary internal 
approval at this stage? 
MR JACKSON:   No I think if we recall the earlier memo that approval 
was only given on the 23 r d of February, formally.  So that was an 
internal process that was done in order to participate in this 
20 
sponsorship.  So this, is in fact, earlier than what was formal. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Right. 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    So Ms van Eck had been given an 
instruction to proceed before formal approval had been internally 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 102 of 187 
 
obtained? 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can we then go to JJ13, that’s on page 77, 
at the bottom of that page Ms Moremi from the agency says, 
 
“Hi 
Joseph 
herewith 
the 
flow-plan 
for 
the 
New 
Age 
 
sponsorship for your approval”, 
 
What’s a flow-plan?    
MR JACKSON:   It would state, Mr Chairman how it would be inserted 
and on which dates into the newspaper. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And it says the sponsorship is for six 
10 
months starting on Wednesday 29 February 2012. The date of this is 
the 21 s t of February, this is still before Mr Molefe has signed?  
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Can you read your email immediately 
above? 
MR JACKSON:   Okay I say, 
 
“Hi Martha, thanks for this.  Just to confirm and for clarity the 
 
sponsorship will only continue if the formal requests for 
 
approval, internally – sorry the request is approved internally. 
 
We are still awaiting the sign-off from our seniors.  The flow-
20 
 
plan therefore, will only be considered when we have 
 
obtained approval and dates might have to change, regards 
 
Joseph”. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    So you’re intervening to tell Ms Moremi 
that, actually you can’t proceed with this until we obtain the necessary 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 103 of 187 
 
approval? 
MR JACKSON:   That’s correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Which is the signature from Mr Molefe? 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Did Mr Sigonyela at all speak to you about 
this? 
MR JACKSON:   He spoke to me to the extent that I was hindering the 
process as he called it and it was far too slow according to him, except 
that I was of the opinion that process was being followed and until such 
time we’re doing what we’re supposed to, Mr Chairman. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    In fact, in your affidavit, if we return there, 
at page 12, at paragraph 54 you talk about the pressure under which 
you were being put by Mr Sigonyela…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At what page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Page 12 Chair in the affidavit and its 
paragraph 54. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Just elaborate on the pressure he was 
putting on you and what he expected from you. 
MR JACKSON:   Ja I say that throughout the process I was under 
20 
significant pressure from Mr Sigonyela, he was extremely eager to have 
this arrangement in place as soon as possible. As I’ve said Mr 
Chairman he said that I was hindering the process and in order to make 
sure that I’m doing my job as he had instructed I was to provide him 
with a formal report in establishing if I’m doing my work and in so doing 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 104 of 187 
 
I provided him with a chronological sequence of events as to how the 
process is being handled and where it was at that point. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Can we go to that chronological sequence 
of events, it’s at page 87, it’s JJ15, is this the document…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry what page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Sorry Chair, it’s 87…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m not doing very well in keeping up. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    No Chair, I’m going too quickly, I 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    It’s page 87 JJ15, and Mr Jackson is the 
chronology you drew up in response to Mr Sigonyela’s…[intervenes]. 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman, I believe that in order to 
provide the report as – I put it in a sequence of events detailing exactly 
what’s happening on which day and this is what I had provided yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Had you ever done this before or since? 
MR JACKSON:   No I have not. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    So the pressure that Mr Sigonyela was 
putting you under in respect of the Big Interview in the New Age was 
pressure that you hadn’t experienced from him before? 
20 
MR JACKSON:   No not to this extent, this was as if my job was 
determined by proof that I’m doing my work. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you.  You also say that Mr 
Sigonyela, at some point tried to cut the agency out of the process. 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 105 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   How did he try to do that?  
MR JACKSON:   Well he raised the issue around their – obviously they, 
as far as he was concerned in also concluding this sponsorship and had 
raised the question as to what stops Transnet from approaching and 
dealing with the TNA directly and he made it clear that I share that with 
the agency.  They needed to, basically, prove their value and the 
pressure to get this done. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Then Mr Jackson if we can then turn to the 
various memoranda, internal memoranda that were compiled and 
approved. You detail those at – from paragraph 59 of your affidavit on 
10 
page 13, they run from March 2013 to May 2016. 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    I don’t intend to take you to each one of 
them but there are just two that I’d like to draw particular attention to.  
Can we first go to JJ22 that’s at page 115, Chair, are you there? 
MR JACKSON:   I’m there yes, yes I am. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And if you turn the page to 116, who 
compiled this memorandum? 
MR JACKSON:   This was compiled by myself. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And given the doubts that you had about 
20 
all of this, that you’ve shared with us today, why did you compile it? 
MR JACKSON:   It seemed as if the deal was done based on what I was 
sent, in my head, it wasn’t even a negotiation. More so my concerns 
was put aside by, it’s not important but what is important to me, 
however, was that a formal process in the form of a sign-off of the 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 106 of 187 
 
sponsorship be done, which at this stage was not, so I had hope that in 
making this formal, questions would be raised regarding value 
especially if the final signatory is our Chief Executive. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And if you look at the – if you go back to 
115. 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Which is the cover page of that 
memorandum, you’ll see that it says, 
 
“The renewal of the New Age the Big Interview partnership”, 
 
Previously I drew your attention to sponsorship. 
10 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Do you have any understanding of why it 
was changed from sponsorship to partnership? 
MR JACKSON:   I do not, I really do not recall but its no different to 
the original agreement, so indeed I believe its still a sponsorship. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you.  Then if you can turn to page 
121, this is a memorandum of the 9 t h of November 2015, you see that? 
MR JACKSON:   I do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Can you see who compiled that 
memorandum? 
20 
MR JACKSON:   Yes this is a former colleague of mine, Mr Chairman, 
Belesa Ngoma to Mr Mboniso Sigonyela, the GM at Corporate and 
Public Affairs. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Chair Ms Ngoma was sent a Rule 33 notice 
arising from Mr Jackson’s affidavit, she has filed an affidavit and 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 107 of 187 
 
there’s a few aspects of that affidavit that I’d like to put to Mr Jackson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Can I ask you to turn to page 174 that’s 
where Ms Ngoma’s affidavit is contained and 174 is, in fact, the cover 
letter to her affidavit, she says at paragraph 2, 
 
“I have read Mr Joseph Jackson’s affidavit, save to state that 
 
I acted on the instruction of my superiors in the preparation  of 
the memoranda referred to, I do not dispute that I compiled  the 
memoranda” 
 
If we then turn to the actual content of the affidavit, can I ask 
10 
you first to go to paragraph 10, here Ms Ngoma is talking about 
business breakfasts.  I appreciate, Mr Jackson, that business 
breakfasts were not within your terrain but I would like to ask whether 
this accords with your experience of being given instructions by Mr 
Sigonyela.  She says that, 
 
“It was during this period that I received instructions from the 
 
Head of Department, General Manager Corporate and Public 
 
Affairs Mr Mboniso Sigonyela either directly or through my 
 
line manager to compile memoranda for Transnet to partner 
 
with SABC in the hosting of the New Age business breakfasts.  
20 
 
The instructions for the memoranda would come with a brief 
 
outline or guidance of what the memoranda should state.  Mr 
 
Sigonyela would then edit and revise the content before 
 
signing approval”.  
 
Was your experience of compiling a memorandum similar to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 108 of 187 
 
that? 
MR JACKSON:   It would be similar Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Would Mr Sigonyela give you an outline of 
what it was that needed to go into the memorandum? 
MR JACKSON:   He would, very specifically at some point but like Ms 
Ngoma states to revise and edit as he saw fit. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And then if we can turn to paragraph 27, 
that’s at page 179 she says there that, 
 
“Prior to December 2014, Mr Joseph Jackson who was the 
 
brand 
and 
publicity 
coordinator 
managed 
Transnet’s 
10 
 
partnership in support of the Big Interview within the New Age 
 
Newspaper”. 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   She says you left in December 2014 and 
then she says in paragraph 30, 
 
“Upon Mr Jackson’s departure I was instructed, by the 
 
General Manager Corporate and Public Affairs, Mr Sigonyela 
 
to manage Transnet’s continued support of the Big Interview 
 
segment”. 
 
Does that accord with your understanding of events?  
20 
MR JACKSON:   It does Mr Chairman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Mr Jackson I only have one or two 
questions remaining, the – you say at paragraph 62 of your affidavit 
that Transnet ultimately spent a total of R24.8million on the Big 
Interview.  Was there ever any assessment done of whether that gave 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 109 of 187 
 
Transnet value for money? 
MR JACKSON:   There was no assessment or evaluation done Mr 
Chairman since the time I had been there and left, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Over what period was R24million spent? 
MR JACKSON:   From 2011, Mr Chairman to 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So that’s – is that five years. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So roughly, on average you may have been spending 
about what, R5million? 
MR JACKSON:   Yes correct Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or just under that. 
MR JACKSON:   Just under that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And Mr Jackson, in your own view, did 
Transnet get value for money? 
MR JACKSON:   In my own view, personal view, no Transnet did not 
receive any return on investment.  It is – and this is an opinion, based 
on where the TNA eventually, from a reputation point of view had 
ended, the association most definitely did not do us any favours.  If 
anything, it led to a negative reputation and outlook, the mere 
20 
association.  So no, my answer to that would be it did not receive 
any…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Initially the arrangement or agreements were for 
three months at a time is that right or six months? 
MR JACKSON:   Six months. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 110 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Six months? 
MR JACKSON:   Six months, yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There had been a proposal of three months at some 
stage isn’t it? 
MR JACKSON:   Yes I do believe in one of the emails they speak 
about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe during the quotation stage. 
MR JACKSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but it was six months at a time. 
MR JACKSON:   That’s correct Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Starting from 2011. 
MR JACKSON:   2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know – do you remember whether that was 
starting from the beginning of 2011 or from mid-year? 
MR JACKSON:   I think it actually started in April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In April, oh okay. 
MR JACKSON:   Because the approval was the 23 r d so I think there 
was then a request for a flow-plan which then they needed to then look 
at space and how it would – and I’m under correction but that is ore or 
less when I estimate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   That was in 2012 Mr Jackson. 
MR JACKSON:   In 2012? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   In 2012 yes sorry in 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So for this period of five years was this arrangement 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 111 of 187 
 
renewed at the expiry of every six months from when it started in 2012 
up to when it ended in 2016? 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of what Transnet was able to place on 
the newspaper did it, throughout remain – did the position remain as 
that Transnet would just have its logos or did that change at some 
stage.  
MR JACKSON:   It did not change Mr Chairman, it remained exactly the 
same throughout the duration of …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to put their logos on. 
10 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No message at all? 
MR JACKSON:   No message Mr Chair, exactly as it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and throughout the period was this space used 
for interviews with media personalities as you say? 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And all the time the person that would be interviewed 
was not chosen by Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:   No Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or were there times when Transnet chose? 
20 
MR JACKSON:   No not that I’m aware, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether they were consulted about the 
persons to be placed…[intervenes]. 
MR JACKSON:   I don’t…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 112 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:   I don’t know, no sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and did you – were there any people from 
Transnet who were interviewed over that period? 
MR JACKSON:   As far as I’m aware, none. 
CHAIRPERSON:   None? 
MR JACKSON:   None. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you keep an eye on this space, on this 
newspaper over that time to see what was coping up, not necessarily 
every day but generally? 
MR JACKSON:   Generally yes, Mr Chairman I made it my point – 
10 
especially when it came to payment, remember you have to justify that 
you’re paying for services rendered, so I would insist on what you call 
a [indistinct] which would be included as part of the invoice, so that 
gave me the assurance that indeed, it was placed for anything else 
which was the agreement but that was the extent yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who made the decision to renew each time this 
arrangement was renewed, who’s decision was it? 
MR JACKSON:   The decision or the signing, the delegated authority 
was Mr Brian Molefe, the Group Chief Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was the one that made the decision? 
20 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes with the recommendation of the same people 
who may have recommended the first one like Mr Sigonyela? 
MR JACKSON:   They all remain Mr Sigonyela…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All their names are there. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 113 of 187 
 
MR JACKSON:   Ja it’s compiled by, that changes but it’s recommended 
and then approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ultimately the person that could say stop this or 
continue would have been Mr Brian Molefe? 
MR JACKSON:   That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and he never said stop? 
MR JACKSON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which year did he leave Transnet to go to Eskom do 
you remember or did this stop after he had left Transnet? 
MR JACKSON:   It still continued, it was – I believe it was 2014 or 
10 
2015 Mr Chairman, so I’m almost – no I think its 2015 that he had left 
for Eskom and then ran until 2016 and then ended, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it’s interesting maybe Mr Brian Molefe will come 
here and explain this and maybe he will make us see what we can’t see 
now in terms of what value got from this when it was paying so much 
money but I can’t say I don’t remember evidence that’s been given in 
this Commission that was given in this Commission by Mr Jonas.  Mr 
Jonas gave evidence and part of the evidence he gave was the he had 
a meeting with one of the Gupta brothers at the Gupta residence in 
Saxonwold on October 23, 2015 and one of the things he says, the 
20 
Gupta brother that was there told him is that he gave hi certain names 
of people that he said are working with them, with the Guptas, and he 
said – Mr Jonas said the Gupta brother that was in that meeting told 
him that those people were safe, nobody could touch them because 
they were working with them and Mr Brian Molefe was one of the names 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 114 of 187 
 
that was given there. I mention this for the legal team’s recollection as 
well.  Another person who was mentioned was Ms Lynne Brown, we 
heard evidence earlier on about Eskom and Mr Tsotsi having certain 
interactions with Ms Lynne Brown and with Mr Tony Gupta.  So maybe 
Mr Molefe will come and will explain this and maybe we will all see 
what we can’t see now but there is that evidence that has been placed 
before me by Mr Jonas to say, this is what he was told by one of the 
Gupta brothers on the 23 r d of October, that, effectively they were 
looking after Mr Brian Molefe and that nobody would touch him and of 
course we do know that he went from Transnet he went to Eskom and ja 
10 
okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Chair I see that we are at six past one, I 
have no further questions for Mr Jackson I would just like to check 
whether there’s any prospect of us sitting late today just because it will 
impact on our arrangements with other witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think it’s good you raise it.  No there isn’t a 
chance of sitting late today but we can do one of two things, we can 
find a date next week or we can – I can’t remember whether Ms 
20 
Hofmeyr said she would be able to make use of Tuesday the 4 t h but if 
Tuesday the 4 t h is available we could use Tuesday the 4 t h or we could 
find a date immediately after or even during the [indistinct] two weeks 
that we have got, so – but if the other days are full we could try and 
use the next available business day. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 115 of 187 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    Thank you Chair, we will use the lunch 
break to speak to the witnesses and each other and revert after the 
lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright I think in the afternoon we may have to 
stop maybe at about quarter to four or 4 o’ clock I’m not sure but that’s 
fine.  So we will adjourn for lunch and we’ll resume at ten past two, we 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought I had said we would resume at two o’clock 
10 
but he tells me I said quarter past and one of my protectors is 
corroborating him.  So I was hoping to get corroboration from you but I 
am told you were not sure? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We were not.  We all I think thought like you it 
was two o’clock Chair but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I thought I said ten past two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay because when we… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Broke up it was after. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was a bit beyond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it was beyond. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 116 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they denied they said I said quarter past.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just deal with some 
housekeeping matters before we swear Mr Phatlane our next witness in 
because it just relates to the arrangements for the remainder of the 
afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We used the lunch break to talk to Mr 
Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who is our second witness after Mr Phatlane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The fourth witness for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The position is as follows.  We think it is 
unlikely we will start Mr Mkhwanazi today because given the slightly 
earlier finish time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will comfortably complete we hope Mr 
Phatlane’s evidence but are unlikely to start Mr Mkhwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we would need to reschedule Mr 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 117 of 187 
 
Mkhwanazi’s evidence.  We have had discussions.  Our proposal at the 
moment is that date of the 4 February we did fill with actually the last 
TNA witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who comes from the aviation side, Mr Kona. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that has already been set up.  But we think 
that it is very possible that in the course of the three weeks of aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is an opening somewhere. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so we have engaged with Mr Mhkwanazi he 
has general availability over that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He has given us a few dates which will not work 
for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so our proposal is with some warning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To him when we see an opening arising. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We can be in touch and he has very kindly 
indicated that he should be able to return for that evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To fit in. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 118 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine then.  That is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in the light of that if we could ask that he 
be released. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the remainder of the afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he is released.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I could then ask for Mr Phatlane to be sworn 
in? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR PHATLANE:  My name is Daniel Kagiso Phatlane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. [indistinct] affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes make sure it is an affirmation if the witness wants 
an affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR PHATLANE:  My name is Daniel Kagiso Phatlane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection in making the prescribed 
20 
affirmation? 
MR PHATLANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 119 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Phatlane’s statement and 
relevant annexures to it and other documents are contained in what we 
propose be marked Exhibit MM4.  If we could have that entered into the 
record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Daniel Kagiso Phatlane’s statement and annexures 
thereto will be admitted and marked Exhibit MM4 and the lever arch file 
in which they are contained will be marked accordingly as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Phatlane in front of you 
10 
you have that exhibit in a file.  I do not actually envisage barring on 
one occasion moving to other files.  So you can keep that in front of 
you.  And I will make reference to it throughout and you will look at the 
top right hand corner for the page numbers that I refer to in the course 
of the evidence.  If I could take you then to page 1 of that file.  You will 
see I think you are at an index page.  If you just over and look for page 
1 at the top.  Can you tell us what that document is? 
MR PHATLANE:  It is my statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And was that provided to the 
commission? 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes I did it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And could you go over to page 7 of the same 
Exhibit MM4.  Can you confirm whether that is your signature on the 
page? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes it is my signature. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 120 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Phatlane I am next going to ask 
whether you confirm the contents of this statement as being true and 
correct but before I do that you did alert me this morning to the fact 
there is a particular correction you would like to make in respect of 
paragraph 6.  But it is a correction that requires quite an explanation.  
So my suggestion Mr Phatlane is when you confirm the correctness we 
note that you are going to make a change to paragraph 6 and when we 
get to that in the evidence you will give your account of where the 
change occurs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you comfortable with that? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So if you will just indicate whether 
you confirm the contents but for paragraph 6 which we will deal with in 
due course? 
MR PHATLANE:  I do Chairperson I do confirm the statement as true 
with the changes that I will make on paragraph 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Phatlane let us start if we may 
with some background.  Can you please tell the commission when you 
20 
first joined Transnet and in what position and then take us through your 
progression in the organisation? 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson I joined Transnet in 2011 August 16 from 
there – for Department of Education.  I was given the position of Senior 
Coordinator Stakeholder Relations.  I have been in that position for 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 121 of 187 
 
long until 2018 that is when I got promoted to be a senior manager 
Stakeholder Relations.  And I am currently still on that position. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who did you report to in that period 2011 
until 2017? 
MR PHATLANE:  I reported to the General Manager Mboniso Sigonyela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we – I am sorry when we – when the witness 
who preceded you gave evidence I maybe have been mistaken but I 
thought Mr Sigonyela’s first name was Mbonise. 
MR PHATLANE:  Mboniso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is Mboniso? 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if I Mbonise either I saw something that was not 
there or somebody might have thought it is Mbonise. 
MR PHATLANE:  I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The correct one is Mboniso. 
MR PHATLANE:  It might be only written. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And error. 
MR PHATLANE:  It is Mboniso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I do not know if anybody had picked 
anything like that that there was an I at the end. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will certainly check it if I just go 
through the bundle in front of me certainly whenever he is signing off 
on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The various memoranda it is Mboniso. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 122 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it may be that it is – it was an email from 
somebody else. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It could have been.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not from him.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will just have a look for it so we can locate 
it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right so Mr Phatlane you were explaining 
between 2011 and 2017 you reported to Ms Sigonyela, is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson and then in 2017 to current I am 
reporting under General Manager Mr Lekhethe, Molatwane Likhethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is L-i-k-h-e-t-h-e. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes L-i 
CHAIRPERSON:  Likhethe.  L-i 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Molatwane. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  Molatwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  M-o-l-a-t-w-a-n-e.  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And can you explain to the 
commission and the Chair what your role was holding that position in 
Stakeholder Relations? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 123 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  Well Chairperson as a coordinator my responsibility 
was to assist the – the GM in terms of making sure that we build 
relations – we helped Transnet to build it – it is stakeholder relations 
and also to drive thought leadership by engaging and informing our 
critical stakeholders.  So ideally we will come up with platforms so we 
think we need to be able to invite certain stakeholders so that we can 
either be able to inform them or pursued them or just give them 
information about Transnet just so that we are building that relationship 
with them.  And well there were other responsibilities so – such as the 
language unit which came later and also assisting in other activities 
10 
within the department. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did sponsorships and donations fall within 
your area of responsibility? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson part of it it was making sure that we 
– I process the sponsorships on behalf of the GCE because that 
mandate was not directly within the GM.  It was a mandate that was at 
the level of a GCE. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is GCE – can you explain to us what that 
stands for? 
MR PHATLANE:  GCE will refer to Group Chief Executive.  To say the 
20 
budget regarding sponsorships they were sitting with the GCE’s office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what would the ordinary 
process be for approval of sponsorships? 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson ordinarily what will happen is that an 
interest – a party with an interest will send a proposal to Transnet to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 124 of 187 
 
say, we will wish Transnet to sponsor a course that the – a course that 
they are interested in.  And we will look at it whether it is in line with 
the draft sponsorship and donation policy to say, is this course part of 
what we can support?  And then we will then request – do what we call 
due diligence.  Request to check if it is legitimate – do they have a 
bank account and all that and they will send those documents so that 
you see that here you are dealing with a company that is existing and 
that is legitimate and what they want it is – it makes sense and it will 
help Transnet because if it is a sponsorship it is different from if it is a 
donation.  If it is a donation we will put that money – there is not much 
10 
attachment is that we believe in whatever objective you want to do you 
can go ahead, here is our support.  But if it is a sponsorship we will 
want benefits.  What is it that is in for Transnet?  And then we will 
assess if these benefits are in line with what we want and what is it 
that we want to achieve with that particular sponsorship?  So after that 
a memorandum then will be generated to – to the GM who was the one 
who will approve depending on the amount.  If it is within his DOA it 
will be approved then and there and then we will execute and see to it 
that this – whatever that has been promised in the proposal or in the 
memorandum we get as Transnet.  And – but if it is beyond the – his 
20 
DOA he will push that it goes to the next person who has a DOA.  More 
often because the budget of the sponsorship… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The DOA being Delegation of Authority. 
MR PHATLANE:  Oh sorry Chairperson.  Yes Chairperson it refers to 
Delegation of Authority.   Sorry. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 125 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes continue. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  Then it gets approved.  Once it is approved we 
will prepare a contract now so that the party that has requested this 
sponsorship will then sign off to say, this is what you are going to give 
Transnet and this is what Transnet is going to do.  Then the processes 
of payment will follow. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Phatlane.  I would like to take 
you to the relevant Delegations of Authority that operated over the 
period of time that we are interested in in Transnet.  Because there is 
an important respect in which the Delegation of Authority changed at a 
10 
point in time and I am going to link that back to the evidence as we go 
through it.  So if we can just start with the 2011 Delegation of Authority 
and you will find that in your bundle Exhibit MM4 at page 113.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe while we doing that I wanted earlier on to ask 
you to give me a few of Transnet’s stakeholders that you are talking 
about when you talk about sponsorships at that time when you joined? 
MR PHATLANE:  When I joined for – already Transnet was sponsoring 
National Arts Festival.  We – we will go during that festival and brand.  
There was a – there is an area called – it is a stadium like where you 
will have this – the activity is happening there.  We own the naming 
20 
rights there.  It was called a Transnet Village – Transnet Green Village. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  So we will brand around there. We will have – we had 
a kiosk where we will give people the – whatever that – the branded 
materials that we have.  Whether it is bags, whether it is whatever so 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 126 of 187 
 
that as they buy around there these small items they will be walking – 
they will be moving around with a Transnet branded so you kind of put 
your company’s brand out there so that people can remember that while 
there is Standard Bank also being a sponsor on this side but we – we 
were also on this side so that we kind of competing for the same space.  
Because the same environment they have got more places that they are 
sponsoring but we have got only the Village which we need to make 
sure that people do not remember Standard Bank but remember 
Transnet.  So it is one of those.  Then we will invite our stakeholders.  
We will decide to say, since we have got a presence there this year 
10 
who can we take around there to go and see the activation of – of a 
brand in a particular – or when you are supporting a particular cause.  
So we will take either our Board members to say okay this year let us 
take about five or six of our Board members that they be there and feel 
the experience.  Or we could take customers and identify which 
customers do we think they need to be there and see – see the 
experience – or experience Transnet being there and the brand being 
out there.  So it depended – it depended on the kind of the activity or 
cause that we were supporting.  You will have Nedbank.  Nedbank will 
take our customers there the Nedbank Golf Challenge.  We will take our 
20 
customers there so that there is this interaction between certain senior 
managers or certain managers of Transnet with certain customers so 
that they can be – discuss critical issues that need to be – to – where 
they need to align or where they need to unlock challenges.  So it will 
work kind of like that. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 127 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can understand completely in the case of 
Standard Bank or Nedbank and so on them getting involved like that to 
promote themselves because they may be wanting that the people come 
to that event.  They think about Standard Bank and Nedbank and maybe 
they could open an account with them and so on.  I am not sure that I 
can understand why Transnet would do anything like that for any 
purpose other than if it is a donation, helping somebody’ cause that is 
considered to be a worthy cause.  But I am not sure that I understand 
all of that and I may be missing something and I would like you to 
assist me.   
10 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson the response – one responsibility of 
communication is to build the brand I think which was not necessarily 
directly linked to what I was doing but they kind of interlink.  You 
building the brand.  You want people to associate with the brand.  
While you are doing that branding exercise there are other benefits that 
comes with that sponsorship which … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Such as? 
MR PHATLANE:  Such as you get a platform.  Let me give you an 
example of – of Nedbank.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Nedbank I will understand. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  You will understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is Transnet and that … 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Eskom that – I think I am struggling about. 
MR PHATLANE:  Let me say… 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 128 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us talk about Transnet because that is where 
you coming from. 
MR PHATLANE:  Ja I am look – I just want to – Chair to clarify the 
linkage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  The linkage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR PHATLANE:  The linkage with a particular brand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Start with – start with Nedbank or Standard Bank and 
then we can take it from there. 
10 
MR PHATLANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  Nedbank will create a platform to say, here is a brand 
that everyone will come here.  Now different companies, different 
brands will say, this is an opportunity for us to be – if we position 
ourselves in this because there is this kind of people that comes here 
who are associated to our brand.  Now if we buy for instance a marque 
and be part of that it will – it will help us to be able to get those critical 
stakeholders because we will then invite them into our marque so that 
there is discussions.  If the brand is bigger it is Nedbank Golf 
20 
Challenge but we also have still some small brands in there that are 
trying to utilise or to exploit the bigger opportunity.  So – also with 
National Arts Festival.  It will open up to companies to say, here is an 
opportunity we are giving you so many people coming to this place who 
is entrusted to be able to tap into these people coming there.  Then as 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 129 of 187 
 
an organisation like Transnet will sit down and say, look some of our 
customers they go there.  Some of our – let me say stakeholders they 
go there.  Why do we not increase our presence because we want to be 
associated with certain brands or with certain platforms that are being 
created from stakeholder point of view and also from brand activation?  
So we will choose those platforms or those events that we think they 
will – that we think they will add value to the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see when you talk about a private – well I say 
private company maybe even if it is not a private company if it is a 
company that maybe needs to have customers, needs to have clients to 
10 
make business to make profits or to sell something for me that branding 
idea fits in very nicely.  I can understand it.  So when it comes to 
Transnet I am saying to myself, so what is the actual tangible benefit 
for the money they would be spending on those kinds of events? 
MR PHATLANE:  I agree Chairperson to say Transnet deals with 
business to business you know it is not business to consumer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Which you will find that those that are – they deal 
with consumers they will put money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  We – that is why we – during that time Transnet was 
not you know putting a lot of money in terms of branding.  We will use 
those platforms because if you look at the spending then it was not as 
steep as those companies you are talking about that were paying.  We 
were not for instance we were doing above the line advertising.  We 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 130 of 187 
 
were relying on below the line advertising which is this…e were relying 
on below the line advertising which is this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What kind amount for example?  I know Ms Hofmeyr I 
am taking you off. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I want to understand this.   
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson I might not be a guru on advertising but I 
know that if we were to calculate for instance the amount that you put 
for billboards and TV it is way above R100 000.00 on a campaign so we 
are not – we are not doing those. And when I joined Transnet I found 
10 
that they were not doing those kind of campaigns.  They were doing 
what we call PR.  This small way you see an event and you – you 
partner with them and then try to get value out of that instead of going 
on TV and on billboards because it is expensive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see if we were do advertising for the 
commission – advertising I am putting it in quotes the purpose would be 
to make sure that we attract people who can come to the commission 
and give a lot of important information for purposes of our 
investigation.  With – with Transnet that exposure that it was seeking 
was going to help it get what? 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson it is multi-fold.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Remember Transnet as big as it is it has still to – has 
a responsibility to recruit the right people.  Now the right minds, the 
right talent they – they want to go to organisations that they think are 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 131 of 187 
 
top.  Transnet also deals with communities where we need to support 
communities in terms of our citizenship responsibilities.  Now you have 
got a responsibility also the build the brand that it is known so that the 
people that you also serving it is not only serving customers it has a 
responsibility within the communities.  Now our responsibilities to build 
that brand to be seen as a brand either that is vibrant.  A brand that is 
current.  A brand that is topical.  It is part of communications role also 
to do that.  While I do understand that we might not be like companies 
that deal with customers, direct business to consumers directly.  Our 
approach would be different. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will actually in the course of Mr 
Mkhwanazi’s evidence we will look at the actual budgets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of marketing etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I just put a pin in that for the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When he returns we will be looking at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we can then go to the first Delegation of 
Authority relevant for the time and that you will find at page 113 of 
Exhibit MM4 Mr Phatlane.   
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 132 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  113 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  113. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we were talking about the sponsorship 
provisions in the Delegation of Authority.  You will just note at the 
bottom of page 113 what is the effective date of this Transnet Group 
Limits of Authority document? 
MR PHATLANE:  Oh 1 June 2011. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you will just put on the – and Mr Phatlane 
feel free to leave it on.  It does not affect our microphones if you just 
10 
keep yours on.   
MR PHATLANE:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just for the record again what is the 
effective date of this Delegation of Authority document? 
MR PHATLANE:  Is the 1 June 2011. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I would like to take you to the 
provision governing sponsorships.  That you will find at page 138.  138.  
You will see the top table on that page appears against the number 
5.8.5 and that is headed Sponsorships and Donations, do you see that? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am interested in is what was the 
Delegation of Authority to the GCE, the Group Chief Executive at the 
stage of the 2011 Delegation of Authority? 
MR PHATLANE:  It was up to nought exceeding R30 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We are going to return to that and 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 133 of 187 
 
where it is relevant I will remind you of these delegations.  But we have 
got in 2011 at least from the 1 June 2011 we have got the Group Chief 
Executive having authority over sponsorships and donations up to but 
not exceeding R30 million, right?  I am going to take you to the 2012 
Delegation of Authority next so that we can see how that position 
changed under the 2012 delegation and you will find that commencing 
at page 141 – 141.  When was this Delegation of Authority framework 
effective from? 
MR PHATLANE:  It says effective from 1 May 2012. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So how do we understand the two in relation to 
10 
each other?  When did the previous Delegation of Authority cease to 
operate? 
MR PHATLANE:  It says it – or it means it will have ceased at – on the 
30 April 2012. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So from the 1 May 2012 this is 
what operates and I will take you to the sponsorship provision.  You will 
find that at page 167.  And again there Mr Phatlane if you go to number 
5.8.5 you will see a heading Sponsorships and Donations.  What does it 
now provide in relation to the Group Chief Executives extent of 
authority? 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  It says he can sign sponsorship and donation up to 
but not exceeding R10 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if it is above R10 million who decides on 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think I am looking at a wrong… 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 134 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking at 5.8.1. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies 5.8.5 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just further down on the page.  You will see a 
heading Sponsorship and Donations there.  Do you have that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Against 5.8.5 and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you track it across excellent. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to R10 million? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Up to R10 million indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I was asking Mr Phatlane if it exceeded 
R10 million who then would have authority? 
MR PHATLANE:  It will be what do you call the Ramsack.  It is a Board 
Committee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the – at that time? 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  If it exceed R20 million it will be the Board itself that 
needs to ratify. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would go up to R10 million to the Group 
Chief Executive.  Correct me if my understanding is accurate.  Between 
R10 million and R20 million it would be the Social and Ethics 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 135 of 187 
 
Committee is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And above 20 million it would have to go to the 
Board? 
MR PHATLANE:  It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We have included the 2013 
Delegation of Authority in the bundle as well, but it is not necessary to 
go there, because that position they had obtained in 2012 carries 
through into 2013, but Mr Phatlane what I am interested in is as we 
have looked at these documents until 30 April 2012 the Group Chief 
10 
Executive had authority up to 30 million.  Is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  The other point we should just make 
interestingly.  If you go under the table at page 5.8.5.  Can you tell me 
- read into the record what is written at the bottom of that table?  You 
were at page 1-6-7.  So at page 1-6-7 you will see the heading against 
5.8.5 “Sponsorships and Donations”. 
There is a table and then there is some language and words 
beneath the table.  Can you please read what that says into the record? 
MR PHATLANE:  “Approval limits are accumulative per 
20 
annum.  E.g. the OD - Operating Division - CE can 
approve a total amount of five million per annum for 
sponsorships and donations.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what does that mean?  Is it over the course 
of a year they can only approve up to five million? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 136 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  Well - well my - my understanding - I am - I am not an 
expert on this.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sure. 
MR PHATLANE:  My understanding is that at per - a transaction it must 
be - it must be this - this amount and the whole amount for a particular 
… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Year. 
MR PHATLANE:  Must be - must not exceed the five million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR PHATLANE:  So he can sign one for a million. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  One for two million, three for - you know - but the 
total must - must be not above the five million that is here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right or the - or the 10 million if we dealing 
with the … 
MR PHATLANE:  Oh.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Group Chief Executive.  Is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do - I do not think that what you read means 
that, because if it - if it meant that there would be no need for the 
20 
inclusion of the word “cumulative” in that sentence.  I - I want you to 
think about - about that and may - and tell me whether you think it 
means the way you read it would - would still hold. 
MR PHATLANE:  That is why Chair - Chairperson I am saying because I 
was not necessarily responsible for this document I - I might not be 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 137 of 187 
 
very accustomed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I accept … 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I accept that.  I am - I am just - I am just 
testing your understanding of it.  I accept that you did not write it.  It 
seems to me that what it means is that in a year if your Delegation of 
Authority is five million the sponsorships that you approve over - over a 
year should not exceed in this case mentioned after the column five 
million - five million. 
So you might approve two million in January.  Another two 
10 
million in June and you - but you must not then in November approve 
four million. 
MR PHATLANE:  I think we are in agreement Chairperson.  Maybe I did 
not clarify myself very well.  That is - that is what I was saying.  My 
understanding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Is that what you are saying? 
MR PHATLANE:  That is what my understanding was. 
CHAIRPERSON: Oh.  No, no. 
MR PHATLANE:  To say the five million will be the curb. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I - then I misunderstood you.  I thought you 
20 
were saying per transaction. 
MR PHATLANE:  No, no.  I was saying you will have 10 transactions …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 10 transaction. 
MR PHATLANE:  But all of them when you put them together they must 
give you this … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 138 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  This number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  Or less. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think when you said 10 transactions … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said per transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that clarification Mr Phatlane.  
10 
So I was just summarising the position then and correct me if my 
understanding is deficient in any respect.  The 2011 Delegation of 
Authority operated until 30 April 2012.  Is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  That - that is my understanding Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And sponsorships at that time gave a 
Delegation of Authority to the Group Chief Executive up to but not 
exceeding 30 million and that was cumulative over the course of a year.  
Is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  That is my understanding.  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then from 2012 - from 1 May 2012 - that 
20 
changed because the Group Chief Executive could only approve up to 
but not exceeding 10 million in the given year.  Is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  Is correct.  Ja Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if it went above that there were two 
successive entities it would go to.  First it would be the Social and 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 139 of 187 
 
Ethics Committee up to 20 million and after that any amount above 20 
million would go to the Board.  Is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  It - it is correct.  (Indistinct). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  That is going to be an important 
backdrop to when we go through the contracts as they develop over 
time and that is what I would like to take you to if I may.  If we then go 
back to your statement Mr Phatlane.  You can pick it up at page 1 of 
EXHIBIT MM4.  Right. 
There at paragraph - well the numbered paragraph 2 you talk 
about the initial stage of The New Age Breakfasts.  Can you tell us how 
10 
The New Age Breakfasts came to your attention at all at Transnet 
originally? 
MR PHATLANE:  In 2011 - I think I had joined - when - when this issue 
of TNA Breakfasts coming.  Before I had done these - these small 
sponsorships and donations which were 100 000, 50 000 - you know - 
and they get approved.  So the issue of DA was not much of an issue, 
because the GM had DOA as I was informed. 
Then there was a gentleman Jacques.  I think Mr Joseph 
spoke about him, but I forgot his surname.  Jacques - Jacques … 
(intervenes). 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would it be Roux?  Jacques Roux. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  Jacques Le Roux … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  Or Roux.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 140 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  He came - he came around our offices to see our GM.  
He has been coming for a number of days.  We - we did not know what 
they were - what was the discussions about, but he was frequenting - 
let us say - our offices.  Then later it appeared that there was an issue 
around a newspaper. 
I - I am not sure whether it had started, but I remember it - it 
was around the - The New Age thing had started.  So … 
CHYAIRPERSON:  Your GM at that time was Sigonyela? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  It was Mr Sigonyela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Sigonyela. 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  Around September - I think - around September the 
first propose - the first request actually - the first one was not even - it 
- it was a - a proposal from TNA that says we need to sponsor a - a 
breakfast.  A TNA Breakfast. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Phatlane, if I could take you to it.  Just 
while you explaining in your evidence.  You will find it at page 15 - 1-5 
of MM4. 
MR PHATLANE:  These breakfasts they started as just ad hoc.  One - 
20 
one or - or two breakfasts.  It is like you supporting any other breakfast 
that would be there, but this one was TNA where we - we were billed 
735 000 for that session … (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that - was that a single … 
MR PHATLANE:  That was …. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 141 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Business breakfast that they were making a 
proposal for? 
MR PHATLANE:  They - they were making a proposal for - for two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Each in the amount of R735 700,00.  Is 
that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we just look at this page for a moment?  
What is the heading of - well first of all who - who addresses this letter 
and to whom is it addressed? 
MR PHATLANE:  It is Jacques Roux requesting Mr Mboniso Sigonyela. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is the heading of the proposal? 
MR PHATLANE:  It is a proposal for sponsorship opportunity in - in The 
New Age Business briefing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you will just read what is said in the 
proposal after Dear Mr Sigonyela. 
MR PHATLANE:  It says: 
“We thank you for the ongoing commitment to this 
engagement and take pleasure in confirming our 
offer for an exciting sponsorship opportunity to our 
20 
extremely popular business briefing for December 
and January as appended below.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then what appears below? 
MR PHATLANE:  Below it is - it is a - it is a proposal of how much it is 
worth if you participate in this. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 142 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go over the page to page 16 
what then happened after Transnet received that proposal from TNA? 
MR PHATLANE:  What - what happens is we started now - I was - I was 
instructed that I need to put together a - a memorandum suggesting 
that we - we need to participate here in - in this breakfast. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to look at some of what is 
stated in this memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am - I think Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us - let us read that … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Proposal into the record … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think it - it is important. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the first document or proposal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, we have had Mr Phatlane read that first 
paragraph … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Under the introduction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Should I summarise what is then contained in 
the table? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 143 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can - you can summarise. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can summarise. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted the person who is reading the transcript 
… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To get … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The main features without going to the … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actual page. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So below what Mr Phatlane read into the record 
is as table.  He did The New Age Business Briefing.  It has a proposal 
date of 12 September 2011 and it indicates that the period is December 
and January and there is in small type a proposal overview. 
“High profile business breakfast with suitably 
profiled guest speaker to promote readership of The 
20 
New Age amongst business elite and create an 
excellent co-branding opportunity.” 
And then there are certain columns which detail items such 
as the venue which is identified as a Ballroom at the Sandton 
Convention Centre.  It estimates the number of guests which is 500.  
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 144 of 187 
 
The guest - the suggested speaker under the column of December is 
Minister Malusi Gigaba and under the column for January there is a 
TBA which I take to mean To Be Announced and then you get venue 
hire costs set out. 
Advertising coverage.  It says 10 times 30 by six adverts.  
There is something under advertising costs of R538 200,00. Catering 
costs of R147 500,00 and then a total of the R735,700,00 and then it 
goes on to read: 
“TNA Media is committed to ensuring the highest 
possible profile of speakers will be secured for 
10 
these exclusive events and similarly the guest lists 
will be careful constructed to ensure the optimal 
target audience for both or organisations.  We thank 
you once again for the opportunity of submitting 
this proposal and look forward to being of service at 
all times.” 
And then it is signed off by Jacques Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Phatlane that is or that is dated 
12 September 2011 and then we move over to page 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe Ms … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hofmeyr.  I note that in the heading this proposal 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 145 of 187 
 
says The New Age Business Briefing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not Breakfast. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there may or may not be significance in that.  So 
you … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was your understanding?  Was there a 
difference between the business briefing and the business briefing 
breakfasts or the business breakfasts or are those all the same thing? 
MR PHATLANE:  Chair, Chairperson the - the - they will - they change 
10 
the names.  I remember sometimes it will write it will be briefing, but it 
- it was the same - same event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they sometimes said breakfast without briefing.  
Sometimes they said briefing without breakfast.  Sometimes they said 
briefing breakfast. 
MR PHATLANE:  No.  I think from Transnet when - when we were 
writing we will refer to them as - as breakfast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Instead of - of briefing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you recall what they - what TNA called them 
20 
most of the time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   
MR PHATLANE:  No.  It was the same.  It was briefing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Briefing all the time? 
MR PHATLANE:  All the time. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 146 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR PHATLANE:  That is why I say I remember Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no reference to breakfast? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well … 
MR PHATLANE:  I cannot - I cannot - I do not want to ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may be confusing … (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Not at all, but if I may just be of 
assistance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it is of course asking Mr Phatlane to 
10 
go back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In some time.  If we go for example to page 30 
which was a later proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3-0? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  3-0 Chair. 
MR PHATLANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see there the heading of that proposal 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is The New Age Business Breakfast … 
CHAIRPERSON:  New Age Business Breakfast. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sponsorship. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 147 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it does seem certainly as we have seen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  These proposals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No.  That is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The terms are moved interchangeably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Phatlane, if we can then return to page 16, 
because this is the memorandum that you indicated in your evidence a 
moment ago.  You were then required or - or asked to prepare.  Who 
10 
asked you to prepare it? 
MR PHATLANE:  Mr Mboniso Sigonyela instructed that I - I prepare a 
memorandum … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  For participation in - in these sections. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what due diligence did you do before 
preparing it, because you explained to us earlier the usual process 
was.  You receive an input from a sponsor - a proposed sponsorship 
and then you do a due diligence to assess whether it makes sense for 
Transnet to engage with this proposed sponsor.  What due diligence did 
20 
you? 
MR PHATLANE:  Let me say Chairperson.  When it started because is 
where new activities that - that one did not get into before.  The 
magnitude of the amounts and all that.  What one will do is to go - we 
will go to the GM.  He will give you ideas as to what you need to plug in 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 148 of 187 
 
and then what you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In - in the memorandum or what? 
MR PHATLANE:  In the memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  To say look at this, because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  Because this - this if you read it.  It also talks about 
branding and which - which branding was not my - my forte. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  You know.  It - it was other colleagues’ responsibility.  
10 
So it - it will talk about media which not also my forte.  So you - you 
now and then will need guidance from also colleagues’ with - within the 
department, because this was an all-encompassing.  It was not just one 
- a - an only stakeholder activity - position for - for - it was not a 
platform for stakeholder engagement only.  It had other elements. 
So you - you move around.  Getting colleagues to - to assist, 
but the process that we will do which came later.  Initially here it will be 
just take the sponsorship. Interpret it.  Look at - at what Transnet can 
benefit from that, because sometimes they - they will write to say what 
is it that we will get in there and put those elements to say this is what 
20 
we are going to get from there and go to the Managers to advise in 
terms - in terms of the amount, because this like I said it was big. 
I - I had not done this before. Whatever that we had were 
small amounts.  So then the GM will advise us to whether it is correct 
or you will take - you will take it back and - and correct to check 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 149 of 187 
 
whether the - the due processes which is just to check if the company 
is - is there.  If there is a proposal and - and all that.  That you will do 
and then it goes to him for ratification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Phatlane, if we go to paragraph 2 on 
page 16.  You record there that: 
“The New Age publication is one of the key 
publications that Transnet targets for positioning of 
its brand and to improve its image. 
Where does that come from? 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  Well this is what we instructed to write about, 
because he will question to say, but I - I look at this from sponsorship 
point of view.  Where it is not - it is not - to me I am not looking at 
media site.  The media site has somebody.  Now if it is a sponsorship 
that we talk about the publication.  How do we deal with that? 
Then we are told to - to add - add this, because as - as you 
write you take it to him.  He changes - he will take … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now your … 
MR PHATLANE:  The G - the G … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The General … 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Sigonyela. 
MR PHATLANE:  Mr Sigonyela, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MR PHATLANE:  So … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 150 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR PHATLANE:  It will - it will come to him to say he is not happy what 
- with what you have written. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well maybe before Ms Hofmeyr follows up.  
When you got this pro - when you saw this proposal for the first time.  
Was it when it was sent to you or given to you by Mr Sigonyela? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson.  He - he will call you into his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes and - and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Talk about - show you this, but start talking about it.  
This … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  This is a new publication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  All of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  So is your evidence that you 
were guided by him in including the content of paragraph 2 there? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it goes on to talk about the two 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 151 of 187 
 
breakfasts.  It seems … 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe let us just make sure it is clear. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying Mr Phatlane as far as paragraph 2 
is concerned you cannot vouch for what is said there?  It was not 
coming from you to say: 
“The New Age is one of the key publications that 
Transnet targets for positioning of its brand and to 
improve its image.” 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson, during - during our era you will write it 
10 
the way you - you write other small sponsorship proposals, but this one 
you will be guided - you will write. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
MR PHATLANE:  Then there will be - there will be correction, 
correction, correction, correction.  It is as if you have not - you have 
not done anything and it will go to an extent where sometimes it 
becomes personal.  Where you - you will find your memorandum.  You 
will have to pick it up down there. 
It is - it is - it look like either you are not following what I am 
20 
saying or you do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  So- so that - that was the - the era in which we were 
in.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 152 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  So you then end up taking whatever.  Oh.  There is 
correction as they are.  You put them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  You take it back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  It is - it gets taken to the next level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take that answer to be … 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the effect that it is a yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You - you were writing what you were told to 
write. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as - at least paragraph 2. 
MR PHATLANE:  What has been reviewed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  Ja.  It will not necessarily be said directly.  He will 
write there what - the way he wants it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  On the memorandum. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then over the page at page 17 
there is an indication of the financial implications.  What was going to 
be the total cost of this initiative if it was supported as a sponsorship? 
MR PHATLANE:  It was going to be worth 1.471 million.  It is 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 153 of 187 
 
1 471 000. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and then what happened with that?  Was it 
approved? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well during this - this time it was not approved.  
Mr Maboma by then.  He was acting.  He as a legal - a legal - he was a 
Legal Service Group Executive if I am not - but he was - he was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was in the Legal Department? 
MR PHATLANE:  In - in the Legal Department at a higher position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  So he - he was Acting on behalf of Ms Zola - I have 
10 
forgotten the surname, but Ms Zola were reporting - she was reporting 
to him directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I think it is the one I saw earlier. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  So it was not - it was not approved.  Mr Maboma 
did not agree with - with this sponsorship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That is why he did not sign? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  He did - he did indicate that he will not sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he - Ms Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I was going to ask a question and I remembered … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I must leave it to you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 154 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you were still going to ask him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not at all.  Chair please and I will follow up 
afterwards if it is necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he indicate why he - he was not prepared to 
approve this sponsorship? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well - well because I am not the one who will 
definitely - will take it to him.  Normally it is the process.  It will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Once - once I have done my job it will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  In the office of the - of the GM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  And then the - the assistant in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  GM will - will take it there, but when it comes back 
definitely I will know this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  It is not signed, because we need to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  to take to - to the next level of … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Having a contract and all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - so you - you do not know what reasons … 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 155 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had?  He might have articulated? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well by that I was still new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In this case. 
MR PHATLANE:  I did not - I did not have a closer relationship to say 
even I could ask on the side.  I - I cannot remember what was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  His decision with Mr - with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  What I am thinking is you escalate this to 
the next person and you signed and then your General Manager 
10 
Mr Sigonyela signed.  I thought maybe when it comes back and you are 
told it was not approved.  Maybe you might have been told why 
Mr Maboma did not sign. 
MR PHATLANE:  No.  What I was told was just leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR PHATLANE:  Ja.  It was like we are parking it for now, because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  We parked it on the side, but it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR PHATLANE:  We started the process again. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well if we go over to page 18.  We will get the 
next memorandum related to the proposed sponsorship of the New Age 
Business Briefing sessions.  It seems that we are back to the language 
of business briefing there.  What was …? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 156 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe - maybe.  I am sorry Ms … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hofmeyr.  Maybe you can assist me here Mr Phatlane.  
As - as the proposal - as you signed the proposal this one that we are 
talking about.  Were you in support of Transnet’s sponsoring these 
briefings or breakfasts? 
MR PHATLANE:  Initially Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This particular one. 
MR PHATLANE:  Initially Chair when they came - remember they are 
new. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  We have been hearing about New Age there.  New 
Age what, what.  There are breakfasts that - now - now when it comes 
remember that you do not have the contents.  So there - there has to 
be discussions between myself and - and also the other Managers.  
There were - there were - there was also a - a level of other Managers. 
You need to find out now how do you go - go about and if - if 
we are told the - the history of Transnet to say we have never been or 
TV whatever.  We - we do not go above the line.  This is an opportunity 
- this is an opportunity for Transnet to be on TV and - and you - you 
20 
buy into that narrative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  It says - it says this amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Now you - now the brand is going to get this 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 157 of 187 
 
exposure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  More so you will - I am looking at it from this - from 
the stakeholder point of view to say I will - I will be able to have a - an 
opportunity to invite key stakeholders to - to be part of that.  To go and 
- and either drive the - the thought leadership or listen to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Thought leadership. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  You know.  So I - when it started … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were in support? 
MR PHATLANE:  I - I support it.  I support it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  I do not want to really lie.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and what you thought was the value for 
Transnet was the exposure on TV? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  The - the mileage of the brand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  I also looked at - at that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  And also this platform that is being created for us to 
be able to invite … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 158 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  Our stakeholder - our stakeholders and we will choice 
which ones for - for the benefits that we are getting off the two tables 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  And also the opportunity that we will be able to talk … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR PHATLANE:  (Indistinct) that we should invite key Transnet 
leadership to  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Leaders or managers to go and speak there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  So it looked cosy and it looked well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  From my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and - and the amount seemed justifiable? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well because it - it had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Certain elements that - that were not necessarily 
areas that I was familiar with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  Like advertising … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Which - which was brought in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  I looked at - additional - additional benefits.  You 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 159 of 187 
 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  So if they have charged this way, because with 
eventing I know roughly okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  I do events.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  There will be this, but now when they added this - the 
exposure on the newspaper and whatever which is media related. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  I - I thought it was fair then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I - I am indebted.  I actually 
do have a follow up question if I may arising from yours.  If we go back 
to page 15, because remember that is the first proposal that Mr Roux 
sends through.  I am just interested in how they breakdown the costs 
that they are going to be charging Transnet of R735 700,00 per briefing 
breakfast. 
20 
Did you interrogate that at all?  Did you for example query 
why Transnet would be paying for catering at the business breakfast 
and whether that would derive money value for Transnet? 
MR PHATLANE:  No.  I do not think we - I do not think one interrogated 
it that way. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 160 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  There are certain things that you took it that they are 
part of eventing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  You know.  Now this is a proposal.  It is a package 
that either you as Transnet you decide and say no we do not think it is 
fair or we do not do it or whatever.  So I - I looked at it from that angle 
to say this is - this is a package, but also with the discussions that we 
are having with other Managers and other colleagues that says.  You 
know.  We have not - we have not being on above the line and it is an 
10 
opportunity. So you get swayed in a way to say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  This looks like it is a fair price. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had Transnet ever paid for catering before at 
breakfasts it had attended or sponsored? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.  We did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And right if we can then go to the next 
memorandum which is page 18 and that is a memorandum dated the 
20 
20 t h of March 2012, do you see that, we’re at page 18? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you involved in the preparation of this 
memorandum? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes I was involved Chairperson. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 161 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you read for us what the subject of the 
memorandum was? 
MR PHATLANE:  It says, 
 
 “Sponsorship proposal for the New Age Business briefing 
 
sessions”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now what was this proposal for, how many 
business breakfasts and at what value? 
MR PHATLANE:  They wanted, now, a contract now, so that we don’t do 
ad hoc because we had started with Adhoc, two adhoc sessions, now 
they’ve brought a proposal that says they want a contract of 16 
10 
sessions worth R16million, now they’ve increased from 735 it went to a 
million per session.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the ones you had already done before they talked 
about a contract now, the ad hoc ones, that you had done, I think you 
said two is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are you able to tell me that was tangible that 
Transnet gained for paying the kinds of amounts that it paid? 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson with branding it’s different…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There’s no tangible thing. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  I just want to explain, sorry Chairperson I want to 
explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s different one, like I’ve explained earlier, you try to 
build the top of mind, your brand to be top of mind, you also want the – 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 162 of 187 
 
for the public to see that you are part of driving thought leadership.  
You necessarily have to have a Transnet speaker speaking there, when 
you’re driving thought leadership, you’re saying the public or the 
community must know the topical issues and you are going to bring that 
to their attention and now with this partnership with SABC I think that – 
to me that’s what swayed me because you’re getting airtime that is not 
worth for this money. You’re getting two hours of play or with Transnet 
banners behind being seen beyond South Africa into other African 
countries…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so what Mr Phatlane they see the banners they 
10 
see the name Transnet, the logo and so what, it’s not a private 
business, even if it’s public you’re not trying to get the public to buy 
anything, that’s what I’m struggling to get, to understand when you 
spend so much and maybe you’re not responsible because you’re not at 
the level of making decisions but I’m asking you these questions, just 
as I was asking the earlier witness, because I’m trying to understand.  I 
want to understand and put myself in the position of people who said, 
these kinds of amounts must be spent, tax payers’ money must be 
spent on these kinds of things.  If you explain, maybe I’ll understand so 
don’t get frustrated maybe it’s just because I’m trying to understand.  I 
20 
mean Transnet is a parastatal, is a SOE. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is there for various reasons if you ask a lot of 
people in the kinds of places where I grew up they will think, when you 
say Transnet, they’ll think about trains, they’ll think about trains you 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 163 of 187 
 
know, they might not know a lot of other things.  So maybe part of my 
difficulty is that I’m also – maybe I haven’t moved too far from that so 
I’m – so when I think about Transnet I’m thinking okay now, what’s 
important is that Transnet must service people properly, you know, 
people must get trains that run properly but of course Transnet does 
much more than that but that’s where I’m coming from, do you want to 
give it a try again to make me understand? 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson I think…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m certainly not – my mind is not closed I’m just 
trying to understand, maybe I should do some course in branding, 
10 
branding 101. 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson I think while you are explaining you are 
even assisting me maybe to be able to explain some.  It’s not 
conclusive there could be more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Let me give you one example from the branding 
exercise point of view.  There’s a confusion outside where people still 
regard Transnet as Spoornet, that exercise is not necessarily going to 
happen on it’s own for people to forget or remember, or this. There’s 
confusion also o people thinking Transnet is PRASA so anything that 
20 
happens at a station they’ll send complaints or whatever to us.  So as 
communication you also have that responsibility, while you have a 
responsibility to customers but you also have a responsibility to 
communities to educate and to inform them so that when they see, for 
instance what you do to communities to [indistinct] it’s Transnet they 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 164 of 187 
 
are able to associate the brand with good work.  So the thinking that we 
had, especially from me when I talk about the exposure on TV, it’s 
closely associated with that to say, you’re putting this brand awareness 
just to be on top of people’s minds so they know this company that 
transports goods, it – that transport goods which we thought was 
Spoornet is Transnet but also they’re – they’re not only dealing with the 
hard core faring of goods but they’re also are encouraging dialogue in 
the country, they’re supporting good community ship within.  So as 
communication its just unfortunate that part of us is to sell that simple, 
that light kind of information to communities. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Phatlane I’m going to come back to he value 
that you were able to get out of the business breakfasts because your 
affidavit indicates that  towards the end of the period of these business 
breakfasts your approach changed when the management changed 
within your area and much move value, as I understand your affidavit 
was able to be taken from these events, but I’m just flagging for you, I 
haven’t left this topic because I will want to return to it when we can 
contrast what Transnet was getting at this time and what it got 
ultimately because I think it will be a useful illustration in due course to 
20 
conclude this aspect but if we could just return to the memo at page 18 
that is a memorandum you indicated that you were involved in 
preparing and you indicated that it related to sponsorships and you 
were confirming for us that it was 16 sessions that would cost now a 
million rand per session and so the total was R16million.  If you go to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 165 of 187 
 
page 20, could you tell us who, ultimately approved that this contract 
be entered into? 
MR PHATLANE:  It was approved by the Group Executive then Mr Brian 
Molefe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the date on which he approved 
it? 
MR PHATLANE:  23 r d of March 2012. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now if we just go back to your evidence earlier, 
that is when the 2011 delegation of authority was still operative, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes I think…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that was until the end of April 2012, is 
that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I recall, that delegation of authority, we 
don’t need to go to it now, but it gave the Group Chief Executive 
authority 
over 
sponsorships 
up 
to 
R30million 
within 
a 
year, 
cumulatively, is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE: It’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So did it raise any flags for you that Mr Molefe 
20 
was approving this sponsorship at R16million within the course of that 
year? 
MR PHATLANE:  No like I said, my responsibility was just to put this 
together and then I give it to Managers then they look at it, it has to go 
to the next person for approval. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 166 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But give us a sense, if you may, what did 
R16million look like relative to the rest of the budget that your division 
had, do you have a sense of that? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well I can’t remember how much the budget was but it 
was – this was a big chunk, like I said we were doing smaller 
sponsorship then who had recently joined but we were doing a hundred 
or what so when TNA came it was this big kind of a budget – amount 
that we had to pay or to sponsor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you then go over to page 21 you’ll see the 
agreement 
which 
I 
understand 
from 
your 
affidavit 
was 
then 
10 
subsequently concluded, is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE: Page 16? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies if you start at 21 that’s the first page 
of an agreement. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go to page 27 it was signed on the 
7 t h and the 14 t h of May, is that correct?  
MR PHATLANE:  Yes that’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Am I correct that your evidence previously was 
in terms of process, the memorandum would be prepared, it would then 
20 
go through the various levels up to your superior, Mr Sigonyela and 
then ultimately for approval by the Group Chief Executive, is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  You’re correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then thereafter a contract would be put 
together and signed is that correct? 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 167 of 187 
 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let’s just look at page 21, what is the title of 
this agreement? 
MR PHATLANE:  It says, Sponsorship Agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then I’d like to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second, can we go back to page 27, I 
see that the person who signed for Transnet was Acting Group Chief 
Executive, do you know who was that? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes I found out Mr Chairperson it’s Ms Nongugolego 
Shishi. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay thank you, and it was at a time, it seems when 
Mr Brian Molefe was already Chief Executive so he must have been 
away or something? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, as I understand it the approval was given, 
that’s page 20, back in March of 2012, is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the version of the content that’s 
ultimately signed occurs in May 2012 not on this occasion signed by Mr 
20 
Molefe but by Ms Shishi, is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay but did it depend on Mr Molefe’s prior 
approval? 
MR PHATLANE: For us to have a contract going out to the other party 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 168 of 187 
 
there must be, already an approval because you need to have the 
memorandum done and then you are able to write a letter that informs 
the other party to say, we’re approving your proposal and this 
agreement will follow, then we will send the agreement to the party first 
to sign, to come to us for signing also and then for archiving. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Phatlane.  There’s one aspect of 
this agreement I’d like to draw your attention to because it s a theme 
that we are seeing emerge in the course of the evidence before this 
Commission in relation to these TNA contracts and you’ll find the 
relevant clause at page 25 within this agreement.  Do you see there 
10 
that there’s a clause on this page that’s been struck out? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was that clause before it was deleted? 
MR PHATLANE:  It was a clause on early termination. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did it provide? 
MR PHATLANE:  It provided that Transnet reserves the right to 
terminate this agreement upon giving 30 days’ notice to TNA media, 
further that Transnet will be entitled to terminate this agreement in 
writing for failure of TNA to perform its responsibilities. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know why that was deleted? 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  I don’t know, I prepared this and it will go – it went 
with the memo so that you don’t have the GC signing the memo and 
then later you take, again the contract for signing, we prepared 
together but the next time I saw it signed, it was when it was on my 
desk signed and with all this cancellation and all what I did was to 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 169 of 187 
 
archive it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Tell us about, ordinarily, in these types of 
contracts, would there ordinarily be an early termination clause 
included? 
MR PHATLANE:  This is a standard – it’s a Transnet standard contract 
which I found there and it’s important that it has a termination clause 
because it protects Transnet in case performance is not up to standard.  
So this one, I made sure that it has – it’s a standard contract, it has all 
the elements but when it was signed – because normally it will come 
back to me for me to send it out first to the parties, so that they sign 
10 
and then I’ll take it to the office of the GC but then I realised it was 
signed at the particular time and with this termination clause cancelled 
out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The signature or initialling next to the – to clause 4.1 
and 11 one of those signatures appear to my eye to be that of the 
Acting Group Executive is that right? 
MR PHATLANE:  No it’s that of Ms Shisi who was acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’m saying…[intervenes]. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it is? 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  And the …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the other one? 
MR PHATLANE:  The other one is that of Mr Howe from TNA. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 170 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  There seems to be – there are no witnesses 
who witnessed the signing of this agreement, it seems, am I right? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s true Chairperson, I don’t see witnesses when it 
came like this because you’ll see as we go on how my agreements will 
look like, they are standard there was a template where you have the 
main parties, you have the two witnesses so I don’t know how it 
changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you prepared it and sent it upstairs as it 
were for signature, it had witnesses or you are not sure? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes because I don’t even see page 12 where I’ll write 
10 
who are the parties because I’ll normally also write the names of the 
parties to say, from the TNA who’s the COO, who’s accountable from 
the side of…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there may be page 12 missing ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the space for witnesses will not be on page 12 it 
would be on the last page which is 13, is that right because the 
witnesses don’t come before the signatories. 
MR PHATLANE:  I hear you Chairperson I don’t also see where the 
witnesses signed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you sure that the one you sent to them did 
have provision for witnesses on the last page, or you are not sure 
about that? 
MR PHATLANE:  Chairperson let me say I’m not sure but remember this 
is a template that Transnet had, it’s not a template that I created. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 171 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was there? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes so for me I do not think that Transnet would have 
really – I’m not Chairperson…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes since the time that you have been at Transnet 
have you ever had a sponsorship agreement signed that didn’t have 
witnesses, spaces for witnesses, is it something that does happen? 
MR PHATLANE:  No that’s why I’m saying as we move forward, I have 
those 
templates 
that 
I 
remember, 
this 
is 
how 
the 
template…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You’ll try and get page 12 somewhere? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed, there was a page 12 we picked up in a 
later agreement missing but we seemed to have missed that this one 
was omitted so I’ve just asked our investigator to assist us there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I can then take you, Mr Phatlane to page 30 
and I’d just like to orientate ourselves in time because this is where the 
delegation of authority becomes quite important.  You’ll recall that 
when Mr Molefe approved the last R16million sponsorship agreement, 
20 
that was in March of 2012 and that was a month or so before we moved 
to the new delegation of authority provisions, is that correct Mr 
Phatlane? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now at page 30 we have a document, what is 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 172 of 187 
 
this document? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s another proposal from the TNA, New Age yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and what is its date? 
MR PHATLANE:  7 March 2013. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So now we are in the time when the second 
delegation of authority, the 2012 delegation of authority applies, is that 
right? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And please remind us what was the Group Chief 
Executive’s 
limit 
under 
the 
2012 
delegation 
of 
authority 
for 
10 
sponsorships. 
MR PHATLANE:  R10million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  R10million? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what had it been previously? 
MR PHATLANE:  R30million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, so this, you said was a proposal 
dated the 7 t h of March 2013 from TNA and please just read for us what 
the heading was? 
MR PHATLANE:  On page 31? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On 30, their proposal. 
MR PHATLANE:  “The New Age Business Breakfast Sponsorship”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if you go to the last paragraph 
there, will you read that last paragraph into the record please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr I’m trying to catch up with you 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 173 of 187 
 
as well, what was the page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I’m sorry we are at page 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that, we’ve been told, is a proposal letter 
received from TNA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Dated the 7 t h of March 2013, so we’re now in 
the delegation period where the limit of the Chief Executive 
Sponsorship authority is R10million, it’s dropped from the previous 
R30million and Mr Phatlane was indicating this was received from TNA 
10 
it was a proposal for the New Age Business Breakfast sponsorships and 
Mr Phatlane I asked if you would read the last paragraph into the 
record. 
MR PHATLANE:  “We thank Transnet Stock Ltd for supporting these 
 
business briefings over the past two years and we look 
 
forward to an ongoing mutually beneficial relationship.  It is 
 
with pleasure that we submit the following proposal for the 
 
period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 for sponsorship of 20 
 
business briefings for a total investment of R20million 
 
excluding VAT and agency commission.  The proposal 
20 
 
provides a summary of key benefits to the sponsor and 
 
illustrates the strong return on investment, Kind regards”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if we go over the page is 
another memorandum it’s the next one in the sequence of the big 
contracts for which a memorandum was prepared.  Did you prepare this 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 174 of 187 
 
memorandum? 
MR PHATLANE:  The one on page 31? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes I assisted yes, on this one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now can  you just help us with the subject –
well first of all the date of it, what is the date of this memorandum? 
MR PHATLANE:  The date is 11 March 2013. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And to whom I is it addressed? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s addressed to Mr Brian Molefe, Group Chief 
Executive. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: And please read the subject for us. 
MR PHATLANE:  “Request to renew the SABC New Age Business 
Briefing Partnership”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now what I’m interested in there, Mr Phatlane 
is in all the previous memoranda this transaction, this type of 
contracting with TNA has been described as a sponsorship but now it’s 
being described as a partnership.  Why did that language change? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well I had a discussion with the GM because I’m 
responsible for sponsorship management now why should we use this, 
he said, no use partnership and now there was no clarity as to why and 
20 
you see you’ll ask you don’t get the answer, either you’re dismissed 
and then you need to go and write. So when I went I wrote as a 
sponsorship because I did not know any partnership or a document that 
guides on partnership so I went on default of making this a sponsorship 
like the proposal was saying. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 175 of 187 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then why did it change to partnership then? 
MR PHATLANE:  I was told to say, I told you we don’t use [indistinct] 
don’t use sponsorship, use partnership and I had to change it to suit 
what my manager…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what governs partnerships in Transnet? 
MR PHATLANE:  To me I don’t know any document, let me say it’s not 
there I will not seen a document that governs partnerships. So to me 
sometimes I take it, it’s a word that is used loosely to mean either 
sponsorship or whatever any other person wants to justify but I know 
sponsorship because we had a draft sponsorship document – policy by 
10 
then. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the value of this contract? 
MR PHATLANE:  The value was – they wanted R20million and then he 
said, no we can’t give them R20million make it R15million then you go 
and alter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who was he, in that? 
MR PHATLANE:  The GM, Mr Sigonyela. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who approved the R15million at page 32? 
MR PHATLANE:  It was approved by Mr Molefe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now can I just be clear what date did he 
20 
approve it? 
MR PHATLANE:  April 4, 2013. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: In April 2013 did Mr Molefe have the delegated 
authority to approve a sponsorship for R15million? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well according to the DOA [indistinct] we went through 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 176 of 187 
 
he did not have that…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the limit to his authority to conclude 
a partnership agreement for Transnet? 
MR PHATLANE:  It was R10million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: No sorry the limit on a partnership agreement 
what limit, if any applied to Mr Molefe’s authority to conclude 
partnerships for Transnet? 
MR PHATLANE:  No I only know about sponsorships I don’t know 
partnerships which was R10million by that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was R10million by that time? 
10 
MR PHATLANE: I’m talking about the limit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  On the DOA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes previous – but that dealt with 
sponsorships, correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I’m asking, was there any limit on the 
authority of the Group Chief Executive to conclude a partnership 
agreement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says he doesn’t now. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh thank you, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON: He says he only knows about sponsorships. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right super thank you, I thought – we kept 
going back to R10million limit so I was scared that, that was going 
to…[intervenes]. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 177 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Did I understand you correctly? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, can I just ask you, do you have – did you 
ever get to know why, in regard to sponsorships the Group Chief 
Executive’s delegation of authority was reduced so substantially from 
R30million to R10million? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s an exercise that company secretary will always 
do, I think sometimes if there’s somebody from the office of the GCE to 
go and support that because they normally reduce because of either 
moratorium or whatever or either the revenues are getting low. So 
10 
somebody from the office of the GCE because it’s can’t be the GCE 
himself [indistinct] go and say whether does it make sense or not, if 
not, if there’s no presentation made they conclude and take it to the 
Board for ratification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we can move to the agreement itself 
which was concluded, you’ll find that at page 33 and just – the 
description of this agreement in capitals at the beginning of that 
document, what is this agreement now called? 
MR PHATLANE:  It’s now called, Branding and Advertising Partnership 
20 
Agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what had the previous one been called, do 
you recall? 
MR PHATLANE:  Sponsorship Agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  There are two aspects of the terms 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 178 of 187 
 
of this agreement I’d just like to highlight and have your evidence on 
Mr Phatlane, the first appears at page 37 in terms of Transnet’s 
commitment under the agreement.  So I would like, in the course of 
your evidence to see, how the obligations of Transnet became more 
onerous over time. You’ll see at clause 7 on page 37, what does clause 
7.2 provide? 
MR PHATLANE:  It provides Transnet’s commitment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and 7.2? 
MR PHATLANE:  That parties agree that the cost of the event shall be 
kept at the sum of R12 000.00 – R12 million excluding VAT. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at 7.3? 
MR PHATLANE:  Additional R3 million excluding VAT would be made 
available. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And carry on. 
MR PHATLANE:  And utilise as and when required based on mutual 
agreement by both parties and as approved by Transnet Group Chief 
Executive or his designate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at 7.4. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are told how payment is going to work 
20 
under the agreement.  What does it provide? 
MR PHATLANE:  That payment as in 7.2 above will be made by 
Transnet 7 days after this agreement has been signed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just help me with that.  What is happening 
as I understand these agreements is Transnet is contracting for a year 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 179 of 187 
 
of business breakfasts, is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in this case it was contracting for 15 of 
them and it would be paid in two tranches R12 million initially and then 
R3 million dependent on a discretion it seems that the Group Chief 
Executive would exercise, is that correct? 
MR PHATLANE:  The contract says like that yes Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And how about payment.  When was 
payment of this R12 million going to be made to TNA? 
MR PHATLANE:  Well let me just also clarify.  I prepared the 
10 
memorandum but I see the contract as you see it says Branding and 
Advertising partnership.  It is prepared by somebody else. Because it is 
moving away from sponsorship. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  As you see it says Branding.  I might – I will answer 
on what it meant – my understanding on 7 days. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
MR PHATLANE:  Because later we – I also – we paid them according to 
that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  But this contract it was prepared by somebody from 
our team.  I cannot recall who that is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand that. 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes because this is not my – the wording that I would 
normally use.  But I can talk to the 7 days.  Later we were advised by 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 180 of 187 
 
the – by the GM Mr Sigonyela to say apparently he had a meeting 
either with them I do not know but it was kind of like there was an 
engagement.  I do not know whether it was telephonically or what.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And sorry is them TNA? 
MR PHATLANE:  Oh TNA – ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR PHATLANE:  With these colleagues from TNA.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  To say now they want us to pay within 7 days.  I do 
not know the rationale was either the issues of overheads or whatever 
10 
but it was – he was making us aware to say that is going to be the way 
forward.  We have to pay them within that period. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would that not have a cash flow implication for 
Transnet?  Maybe not given the size of its budget I realise probably not 
a cash flow issue but was that usual that you would pay for the full 
extent of a year’s contract within 7 days of signing an agreement? 
MR PHATLANE:  I know of small suppliers that there was a push to pay 
them faster but I will not speak on authority on actual finance because I 
did not really deal with that even invoices when they come.  We will 
channel to him to sign off and – for payment so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before this change that Mr Sigonyela told you 
about that they will have to be paid within 7 days what was the 
timeframe within which Transnet used to pay the New Age or TNA? 
MR PHATLANE:  The – Chairperson the previous agreement was 30 
days – 30 days after they have presented their invoice. 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 181 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And those ones would Transnet pay the whole 
amount within that 30 days on – or only for that particular session? 
MR PHATLANE:  I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the payment be for like for a whole six months 
or a year or only within 30 days in respect of the particular session? 
MR PHATLANE:  The contract ones when they present they present let 
us say R60 million invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  It will be paid at once. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if it said like 5 breakfast sessions or whatever it 
10 
would be for the whole amount? 
MR PHATLANE:  For the whole amount Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the whole contract? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if they are still – the last breakfast will be in ten 
months’ time you have already paid long before that? 
MR PHATLANE:  That is – yes Chairperson that is the understanding it 
was like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then I would like to move if we may to 2014.  
20 
We are at page 46 now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  46? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  46 Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I am mindful that we very close to quarter 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 182 of 187 
 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I guess we are not doing as well as … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We would like.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is important to clarify these things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise we unnecessarily bring people back. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we can – ja let us try maybe we will see – five 
to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This is a memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if we do not finish then maybe – well I do not 
know we talked about dates earlier on. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it suits all concerned I could sit in the afternoon 
on Monday.  I have a commitment at the court in the morning.  But I 
could sit in the afternoon on Monday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will just have to check – oh no.  We 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 183 of 187 
 
unfortunately Mr Mbikiwa and I are… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not available. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In endless meetings with witnesses preparing 
for the aviation sessions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the other two weeks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The following week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So unfortunately Monday afternoon he is 
reminding me we do not actually have available at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  And for the rest of the week I guess? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The rest of the week is very full.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is a challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be – I know that you said that the Tuesday the 
4 t h is filled. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may be that we could start with him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And finish. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No that should not be a problem at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it is short.  We did not want to fit a 
whole new witness in on the 4 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I do not have a difficulty at all given what 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 184 of 187 
 
we know of that day’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For us just to complete Mr Phatlane there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we will go a little further if we may?  What I 
want to look at at the memorandum at page 46 Mr Phatlane is how the 
price of the business breakfasts are now increasing over time.  So what 
is the date of this memorandum? 
10 
MR PHATLANE:  This one was written on the 24 January 2014. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you involved in its – in writing it? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes I was involved Chairperson. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now what – how many breakfasts was this for 
and what was going to be the cost of each breakfast? 
MR PHATLANE:  These breakfasts were two and then they charged us 
R3 million which it moves from there R1 million per session.  Now they 
are charging us double.  The question I asked my GM to say, but this – 
this is not fair because it is not long that we had a contract with them.  
Why will it have increased so much?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  By 100%? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  And I tried calling the – my partner on the side of TNA 
at my level that was Vida Talliep why this and the justification.  No it is 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 185 of 187 
 
a President.  A President will be speaking at SONA for President now 
we charge times two but it is not fair.  Now because we are not moving 
we are at the same level now it had to – escalated to the CO Mr Howe 
to say I am rude I do not want to act and then there was discussion 
with my GM.  I do not know that – how what happened but ultimately I 
ended up having to write this and it got approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PHATLANE:  But I did question this because it... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PHATLANE:  Actually from 735 it was as if every time you do a 
10 
breakfast it is going up by 300 or 400 000 then you question to say, we 
at 735 when you started why now a million.  You do not win on that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would be during the same twelve months or 
something? 
MR PHATLANE:  Yes even if it is after a year it cannot escalate that 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it cannot escalate like that ja. 
MR PHATLANE:  You see but then it ends up here because I talk only 
to my peer on the other side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PHATLANE:  But if I am instructed to say, go ahead process you 
have tried your bit to save the company but you could do up to that 
level yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Phatlane.  Just to clarify in 
relation to your question Chair.  For the record at page 37 the prior 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 186 of 187 
 
agreement which was for the 15 sessions was going to conclude on the 
30 March 2014 and at that stage they were charging R1 million a 
session. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But this proposal which then gets approved is 
still within that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The 24 January and it has gone up to R1.5 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shoo. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Phatlane you said the explanation you 
were given was that the President was coming.  Well that was certainly 
for one of the breakfasts.  Was any explanation given to you for why 
the other breakfast should also be charged at R1.5 million? 
MR PHATLANE:  No, no they said they were charging SONA, State of 
Nation Address at R2 million so the other one will remain R1 million.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh my goodness.  Okay. 
MR PHATLANE:  Technically it is the same.  It is either is R1.5 – R1.5 
but that is the rationale I got and I was questioning to say but we have 
– we have hosted the President before you did not double it.  Why it 
20 
gets doubled?  But ja they tell you it is – it has to be like that it is like 
that and you know so you try and – ja but if you then get an instruction 
that says no process this as is – as per the proposal.  You do so 
ultimately. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair that may be a convenient place at which 
24 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 205 
 
Page 187 of 187 
 
to – and given that we will not complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.
