Page 4 of 150 
 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:   Initial R.  I am an attorney from KZN 
Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:    I am instructed by General Phiyega. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:    Judge we have not submitted an affidavit as 
yet but there has been an indication that the general will reserve her 
rights to either cross-examine or testify in the proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:    Thank you Judge. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess you mean she will reserve the right to apply 
for Leave to Cross-examine? 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:    If necessary thank you Judge 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not for the right to cross-examine. 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:    No to bring an application for Leave to 
Cross-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Thank you. 
ADV MANNIE KLOW [?]:    Thank you Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay I understand.  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes we are Chair.  Chair the 
20 
evidence that we are presenting today is that of Mr Kobus Roelofse. He 
is a member of the South African Police Services the Directorate of 
Priority Crime Investigation.  The evidence that he presents falls within 
his personal experience as an investigator over the years but specific 
to certain investigations that he has led.  The nature of his evidence 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 5 of 150 
 
falls within the Terms of Reference 1.9 in that his evidence interrogates 
transactions and benefits that relates to the South African Police 
Services Secret Services Account.  Chair before you; you have one 
bundle.  The bundle with your leave in order of priority or in order of 
sequence rather has been marked KK2.1.  It consists of the main 
affidavit and annexures to the affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the affidavit of Mr 
Kobus Demeyer Roelofse an annexures will be marked Exhibit KK2.1. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  Chair we have 
three additional bundles but one lever arch bundle.  In fact let me 
10 
correct myself.  We have three additional bundles.  Two of which are 
reference bundles.  The legal team has taken the liberty to compile one 
bundle which is – constitutes legislation, some regulatory framework 
and case law that this evidence refers to in his affidavit. And the bundle 
is a bundle of diagrams which has been prepared to assist in the 
facilitation of this evidence.  The last additional bundle which is marked 
again by your leave KK2.2 is in fact a supplementary affidavit that this 
witness has provided and the purpose of the witness talks specifically 
to key individuals that are mentioned in his main affidavit.  The witness 
through his evidence will address you on that when so necessary and 
20 
that particular affidavit encloses a sealed bag which contains a list of 
names.  With your leave may I hand these – this up to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What is KK2.4?  Just the Regulatory framework? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And case law bundle yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not contain his supplementary statement? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 6 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair it does not.  In the little 
soft file – there are two of those soft files.  The one which is marked by 
your leave KK2.2 is the supplementary affidavit with the brown sealed 
envelope. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you say the purpose of this supplementary 
affidavit is insofar as you – if it is not something you are not supposed 
to state publicly? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair that particularly affidavit was 
prepared by the witness in that there are certain… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I see paragraph 14 is with what the purpose of 
10 
the affidavit – supplementary affidavit is.  Okay but do you want to talk 
to that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair the witness will in fact 
talk to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you need me to address you on 
it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think you want to confirm the purpose of the 
supplementary affidavit? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair.  The purpose of the 
20 
supplementary affidavit is that it concerns the protection of the 
identities of certain individuals who may still be working as agents 
within Crime Intelligence of SAPS.  The affidavit which is the sealed – 
which attaches the sealed envelope – the sealed envelope contains a 
list of names alongside which numbers have been allocated.  The main 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 7 of 150 
 
affidavit of this witness therefore does not refer to the identities of 
these individuals but only to the numbers as indicated on the list itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us just clarify that.  Is the position the 
following? 
That is in the course of his evidence Mr Roelofse will not use the true 
names of certain people for certain reasons but has allocated those 
people numbers.  So they may be Peter that he will decide not to call 
Peter but will call by a number.  He might refer to I do not know 
whether Mr 1 or Mr 2 or Mr Number 2, Mr Number 20, Ms Number 15.  
Is that how – it that is what is going to happen? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as not to divulge their names? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But those names he knows the true names and those 
names are in the sealed envelope that you have given to me?  Not 
envelope file.  Is that right? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This one? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And ultimately if I open here I will find certain names 
20 
and a number? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when I want to know who he was referring to 
when in his evidence he referred to Ms 15 for example and I found – I 
will find 15 and I will find a name that – to which 15 is assigned? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 8 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I will know that that is the person he was 
talking about? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you – you are saying? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reasons for not divulging that is that 
something you are going to deal with during his evidence? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And just for accuracy the numbers 
are preceded by the letters FM that was a choice of the witness 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja for all the numbers? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For all the numbers.  So for 
example… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it will be FM1, FM2 and so on. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay alright.  Now do you want me to 
make any order with regard to this exhibit? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What order? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The request is that by virtue of the 
sensitivity of the list of names the names not be placed in the public 
domain for public consumption.  Steps have however been – are being 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 9 of 150 
 
taken by the commission to establish to what extent some of those 
names may be put into the public domain but there is no clarity around 
that at that stage – at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay 
let 
us 
complete 
the 
scenario. 
 
The 
nondisclosure of the true names of some of the individuals to which his 
evidence will relate is at this stage provisional? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pending establishing certain information and once 
that information has been established then I will be approached either 
to lift the order of secrecy as it were or to make it final? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Are you done? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In accordance – in accordance with 
that bearing in mind that I do not even have a copy of the list of names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I have been informed that redactions 
have taken place in the annexures to his statements for the very same 
reason of not disclosing the identities. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair the next point that I need to 
bring to your attention.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that the evidence of this 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 10 of 150 
 
particular witness required declassification of documents and all the 
documents that have been requested for declassification was done 
apart from one document and I am obliged to bring this to your – I am 
obliged to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So declassification was effected in regard to all 
documents except one. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In my obligation to bring this to you 
it was by agreement between the commission and the National 
10 
Commission of Police that this one document is presented for your eyes 
only but subject to certain conditions and requirements which was 
communicated to them in a letter sent to the National Commissioner on 
the 13 t h September and with your leave I need to place it on record.  
The letter which was sent to them informed: 
“That on the 16 t h August 2019 the commission agreed 
with the SAPS proposal on the disclosure of the 
sealed document in un-redacted format to be placed 
in a sealed envelope before the Chairperson of the 
commission. 
The 
SAPS 
appreciates 
that 
the 
20 
disclosure of the sealed documents does not in any 
way detract from the witness giving evidence in 
relation to the sealed documents or its contents.  
The agreed form of disclosure of the sealed 
documents themselves will not in any way detract 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 11 of 150 
 
from testimony being delivered on the contents of the 
sealed documents for admission as evidence and due 
consideration.  The sealed documents will be 
declassified accordingly and it was on 22 n d August 
2019 that the sealed documents were hand delivered 
to 
the 
commission 
although 
not 
declassified 
accordingly and no reasons were provided” 
So by as a consequence of that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the process of declassification still pending? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In relation to the sealed document 
10 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the regard to the document? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is understood that they have 
provided the document but for your eyes only Chair.  The witness is not 
prevented or precluded from giving evidence in relation to the 
document but it is the document itself that cannot be disclosed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but what I want to find out is whether a request for 
dis-classification was done and it is still pending or it was done and the 
request has been turned down or what is the position?  Or was the 
request no such request was ever made? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is our understanding that the 
request for declassification was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the outcome?  What was the outcome? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The document was not declassified 
for public consumption.  It was only to be provided to you in a sealed 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 12 of 150 
 
envelope Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was – was – was the request declined?  Was the 
request approved? Was the request partially approved? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The request was – it is a bit of an 
anomaly Chair with respect to the discussions that were had in that it is 
understood that the document has not been declassified as such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but did the legal team find out why it was not – 
why the request was not approved for declassification. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No reasons were given Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it is the legal team which must ask for 
10 
reasons.  If you do not ask for reasons you will not get reasons.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair I am happy to 
stand this point down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Until such time that reasons are 
once again sought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   From the South African Police 
Services obligation to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I except for really maybe extreme cases I am not 
20 
so inclined to see information that I may not share with the public.  If 
we have to have that situation it must really be a compelling situation 
because I – decisions that I make I must justify them publicly.  I am not 
saying that there can never be a situation where it would be justified to 
have a situation where I am the only one who sees certain information 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 13 of 150 
 
but I would like to reserve that for a very rare cases.  So you can raise 
that issue after you have found out exactly what happened. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair there is one other point that I 
need to bring to your attention and that is the second annexure to this 
witness’s statement is an affidavit by a Colonel Jacobus Johannes 
Hendrick Roos. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the surname? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Roos. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   R-o-o-s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For the record.  It is five paged 
affidavit.  It was deposed to on the 6 t h November 2013.  With your 
leave Chair although the – Colonel Roos has informed our investigation 
team that he is available to give evidence should the Chairperson so 
wish.  It is requested that his affidavit be submitted as evidence.  In 
accordance with that we have sent out Rule 3.3 Notices.  They are not 
only in relation to Mr Roelofse’s affidavit but also in relation to Mr 
20 
Roos’s affidavit.   In this regard if I can just quickly alert you Chair to 
the 3.3 Notices that was sent? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes why are we dealing with that now because Mr 
Roos might be called later is it not? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 14 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If this witness has need to refer to the affidavit 
he can refer to the affidavit for what it is worth but if we are going to – 
you are going to call the witness later let us deal with that later. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We will be guided by your direction 
on that Chair.  There were 53 Rule 3.3 Notices that were sent in 
respect of both Mr Roelofse’s affidavit and Mr Roos’s affidavit.  49 of 
those Notices to date have been sent and received.  12 of which was 
short of the 14 – of a 14 day period but nonetheless have in fact been 
received. 1... 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much short of the 14 day period? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   3 of the 49 – sorry 3 of the Notices 
were sent 13 days before the time.  2 of the Notices were sent 12 days 
before the time. 4 Notices were sent 11 days before the time and 1 
Notice was sent on 8 days before the time, 1 Notice 7 days before the 
time and 1 days 4 days before the time.  The 4 day Notice period 
though was consequent upon a delay of receipt of the actual Notice 
which was originally sent out in time.  But at some stage there was a 
failure on the – on the email that was sent and it was subsequently 
discovered that the company which is LLVS Trading Services has since 
been de-registered.  So accordingly the Notices were then sent to the 
20 
last referenced directors of that company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the Notices to some of the people was very short 
for this.  Do they know that Mr Roelofse is giving evidence today? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair they have all been 
notified.  The responses that we have received outside of Gen – Major 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 15 of 150 
 
General Phahlane whose representative is here is letters and emails 
received from Colonel Tximba[?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I know you do not have to give me 49 or more 
names. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mention depends what the point is you want to make.  
I am concerned simply about the 4 days and I think 8 days or 
something. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They know that he is giving evidence today? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair they have all received – they 
have all received the Notices so they are fully aware that he is giving 
evidence today.  In line with Rule 3.3 it is our submission though that 
the Notices have been given within a reasonable period of time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In order for them to address any 
concerns and prepare to either be here or to take the necessary steps 
proceeding forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I do have to however address the 
20 
one Notice that has not been received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At all.  Chair that Notice relates to a 
General Chris Ngcobo.  His evidence in the context or rather this 
witness gives evidence in relation to this particular gentleman when he 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 16 of 150 
 
was the acting Deputy Commissioner of Crime Intelligence.  I 
understand that extensive steps and measures have been taken by the 
investigators to try to trace General Chris Ngcobo unfortunately to no 
avail.  Some of the steps that have been taken are they have contacted 
senior – senior officials within Crime Intelligence and DPCI.  They have 
contacted DIRCO.  They have searched all social media platforms.  
They have addressed platforms of the home – of Home Affairs.  It was 
established that his wife was an employee of SARS and they have tried 
several occasions to try to contact his wife but to no avail.  I am – I 
understand from the investigators that as late as last night they were 
10 
still trying to call numbers for his wife but none of which have been 
successful.  In relation to the searches that have been done on Mr or 
General Chris Ngcobo there were at least 17 numbers dating back a 
few years that they have contacted in trying to establish his 
whereabouts.  He is no longer on the SAPS system and so there has 
certainly been no joy in trying to contact – in trying to trace him and 
this search has been continuing for about over three weeks which even 
started before Mr Roelofse’s affidavit was signed off on the 27 t h 
August.  The only thing I need to bring to your attention Chair is that 
they have not yet gone out to an address that they have.  There is no 
20 
clarity, certainty, verification that this address is in fact the address of 
General Chris Ngcobo.  Save for physically going out to an address that 
they found every other possible steps have been taken.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in this regard our submissions 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 17 of 150 
 
are as follows: 
We accept that the Rule 3.3 was not sent. 
We submit that Rule 3.3 impresses an object and a purpose to protect 
the rights of persons who are or may be implicated but however in 
affording such protection Chair we submit that the work of the 
commission must also be safeguarded and should not be overlooked. 
It is respectfully submitted that this proposition is supported when one 
reads Rule 3.3 with Rule 11.2.  And Rule 3.3 as Chair would know 
requires that where a – the evidence of a witness implicates or may 
implicate reasonable notice needs to be provided. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   However… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it is fine you have told me what efforts have 
been made to try and see where he could be served.  We can proceed if 
contact is with him he may apply for such relief as may address his 
concern that he did not get the Rule 3.3 Notice.  Because it would 
appear that extensive steps were tried to try and locate him for 
purposes of serving the Rule 3.3 Notice.  Yes are you done? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly Chair we have 
received correspondence as early as this morning … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In relation to certain individuals who 
has requested that the evidence of this witness be postponed because 
they believe that they require more time in order to prepare for this 
hearing today.  Having said that there are four individuals which form 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 18 of 150 
 
part of the Richard Mdluli family and that includes Richard Mdluli 
himself, Ms Vusiwane Mdluli, Busisiwe Mdluli and Theresa Lyons. 
The communication that we received this morning requested 
that the evidence be postponed in respect of them but it is our 
submission Chair that timeous notice has been given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no substantive application? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  None whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact the other requests for 
postponement of the evidence by other individuals is also not supported 
by any substantive application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then with your leave if I may 
request that the witness please be sworn in.  Unless there is anything 
else you wish me to address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Legal representatives of certain affected parties - I 
have not picked up anything that Ms September said in respect of which 
you might wish to say anything but if there is you must just indicate 
20 
that there is something to which you want to react.  I do not see any 
indication.  Okay, alright.  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Kobus Demeyer Roelofse. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 19 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  If so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So help me God. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Before we proceed the file marked 
10 
EXHIBIT KK2.2 which has a sealed envelope and written supplementary 
affidavits and annexures of Kobus Demeyer Roelofse is not to be made 
public at this stage until I decide otherwise and is to be kept separate 
from the other files to minimise any chances that unauthorised persons 
may have access to it and then Ms September there is this other file 
KK2.3 - diagrams. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are diagrams relating to certain structures. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  In fact the diagrams have 
been prepared to assist with the - the facilitation of presenting this - 
20 
the evidence of Mr Roelofse and it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Been prepared by Mr Roelofse’s 
consent and instruction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 20 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which aligns to his evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file containing diagrams written EXHIBIT KK2.3 
will be marked KK - EXHIBIT KK2.3.  Did we admit KK2.4? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think so.  The file - lever arch file containing 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
and 
case 
law 
under 
the

ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am - I am not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Let us start. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before the - the witness gives the 
evidence that he has been brought hereto - to inform the Commission 
about today.  He has informed the legal team that there are certain 
things he would like to place on record at the outset. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Roelofse. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you Chair.  I am … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is Mr Roelofse - you know the police have got all 
kinds of titles.  Is there a title that I should use or …? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Mr Roelofse is fine Chair.  I am 
not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 21 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Too worried to about (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No I - I just want to make sure because I 
do not understand all of them. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I think testimony you probably 
would be able to distinguish between (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us hope so.  Yes.  I understand you wish to say 
something before you start. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I was just a little bit 
10 
perturbed.  The last couple of months in preparing for this affidavit I 
have received increasing - information to the effect that which I 
consider as - as trying to inhibit me from - from testifying at the - at the 
Commission.  I have it in good authority.  I do not wish to mention 
those names at this point in time because I need to protect them as 
well but I - as I said I was not expecting that. 
To me it is a little bit of a - to me it was a little bit sad that it 
happened.  It is not affecting my testimony in the Commission.  I must - 
I will still testify and testify as to what I know.  I just want to place that 
on record that - that it has happened and I am - I am actually perturbed 
20 
by it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No thank you.  Thank you for coming to give 
evidence to the Commission and to share what you know in terms of 
what has happened where you have been working and investigations 
that you have conducted.  It is - it is very unacceptable when people 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 22 of 150 
 
who want to come and assist the nation by assisting the Commission to 
understand events that fall within its terms of reference are threatened 
or intimidated. 
It is really unacceptable because it is really important that 
the Commission should get as full a picture as possible of what has 
been happening because without getting a full picture it cannot make 
proper recommendations that need to be made to make sure that 
certain things which may have happened in the past do not happen 
again which is quite important for a country. 
I - thank you for not been deterred by those threats from 
10 
coming to give evidence.  We appreciate that very much. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is - it is a pleasure Chair and I 
also believe in the Commission.  I believe this is where we are 
supposed to make things right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and obviously you are quite knowledgeable 
in terms of security issues and measures to deal with threats and so on 
but if you think that there is anything that the Commission may be able 
to do with regard to the threats to which you have referred please share 
that information with the legal team and the investigators.  So that we 
can do what we can. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you Chair.  I will do so if it 
is necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Roelofse can I ask you - in 
Bundle KK2.1 which is the main bundle containing your affidavit - can I 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 23 of 150 
 
ask you to please turn to page 4 of that bundle?  Do you recognise this 
document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is correct Chair.  It is my - it is 
my affidavit or the first page of my affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to then turn to page 72 
please?  Whose signature appears on this page? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It would be the person that 
administered the oath Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct and if you were to turn to 
page 71 whose signature appears at the bottom? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is my signature Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you go back to page 72 you will 
note that there is a difference in date of the - at the top which is 
marked 29 August 2019 as compared to the stamp which is dated 
27 August 2019.  On which day did you depose to this affidavit before a 
Commissioner of Oaths? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I deposed to the affidavit on the 
27 t h.  It is - it is a mistake in terms of the - of the date there Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If I can then ask you to turn to 
page 20 of this bundle.  At paragraph 60 you brought it to the attention 
20 
of the legal team that there was another date typographical error. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please clarify it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  The date 
should not read 24 October.  It should read 21 October. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 24 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And now could I ask you to turn to 
EXHIBIT KK2.2 please in particular page 2?  Do you recognise this 
document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  That is my 
affidavit.  My supplementary affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And whose signature appears on 
page 3 of this affidavit? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is - it is both my signature and 
the person that - that deposed - I mean that - that confirmed the 
affidavit. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
is 
there 
a 
similar 
date 
typographical error/ 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  It should - 
should read the 27 t h and not the 29 t h because I made this just after the 
other one. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if I could ask you then turn to 
page - turn back to page 2 of this affidavit.  At paragraph 3 you 
highlighted another date typographical error. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes it should - should read the 
27 t h Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Because that is the date on which 
you deposed to your affidavit in itself. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is correct, ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So subject to the corrections do you 
confirm that all the facts stated in both your main affidavit and the 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 25 of 150 
 
supplementary affidavit are true and correct and within your personal 
knowledge unless indicated otherwise. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then start off with EXHIBIT 
KK2.2 because it is inextricably linked to your main affidavit.  What is 
the 
purpose 
of 
you 
deposing 
to 
the 
supplementary 
affidavit 
Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair during - during compiling the 
affidavit I - I do work with names relating to people that were in the - 
they were appointed in the HM Program in 2011.  At this point in time I 
10 
do not know whether some of those individuals are still in the HM 
Program are involved in projects. 
So to side - to err on the side of safety I decided to - to 
address them by - by a number and then supply the name to - to the 
Chair because I do not know if they are currently projects and busy with 
- and busy with undercover operations and I do not want to put that into 
jeopardy.  That is the reason why I am doing it - it this way. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then turn to page 4 of the 
main bundle which is KK2.1.  Mr Roelofse is it correct that you are a 
Colonel in the South African Police Services and employed at the 
20 
Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigations in the Western Cape? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  Although I 
spend most of my time currently up in Gauteng. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How did it come about that you came 
to - that you give evidence before this Commission? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 26 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I was approached by 
investigators of the - of the Commission and they have - they inquired 
about investigations that I was involved in and then that is how I was - 
that is how I came about being here. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 5 you talk about your 
career in the SAPS. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before you address your career can 
you please clarify what your - your academic qualifications are please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I have a - a BA Degree and - 
10 
and my main subjects were International Politics and Political Science.  
I also dabbled a little bit with the law.  So that is where I am in terms of 
my - my degree. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to speak a bit louder? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let - let me just check.  Can everybody at the back 
hear clearly?  No.  Okay.  It looks like - I think if you could raise your 
voice.  Maybe Ms September too.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When did you join the South African 
20 
Police Service? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I joined the police in 1986 - in 
January 1986. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 5 of your affidavit you 
have a table of your career at the South African Police Service.  Can 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 27 of 150 
 
you please take the Chair through your career at the South African 
Police Service and the experience that you have acquired as an 
investigator? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as I said I - I joined the 
South African Police Service in 1986.  I was - I was a section leader at 
Unit 19 - Public Order Policing at the time up until 1987.  Then I went 
to Cape Town.  I was lucky enough to get a transfer there and I have 
been there since.  I have worked with the - at the Cape Town Police 
Station at the Tactical Crime Prevention Unit at Cape Town Police 
Station. 
10 
Then I went to a Shift Commander as - at Radio Control 
which is commonly known as - as 10111 and then between 1990 and 
1995 I was a Group Commander in Intelligence Gathering and 
Coordination.  I was in - I was recruited into the then security branch in 
1990 and we were part of the transfer of the ANC Intelligence into - into 
SAPS and through that period I was - I was involved in - in Intelligence 
Gathering Community. 
In 1995 to 1996 I went to Serious Violent Crimes where I did 
Information Coordination regarding gangs.  Then 1996 my career in 
terms of investigation started.  I was first involved with investigations 
20 
into tax violence.  Then I was involved with investigations into religious 
extremism counter terrorism which is the - which was commonly known 
as PAGAD at the time in Cape Town. 
In 2002 I joined the DSO - the Directorate for Priority - 
Special Directorate for - there are so many abbreviations now.  The 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 28 of 150 
 
DSO - the Directorate for Special Operations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The - the Scorpions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Scorpions? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Scorpions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  During that period I was involved 
with - again with PAGAD.  I also was - did the investigation into the 
travel scandal that was related to Parliament.  Then I did various Local 
Government corruption cases.  So I got involved with corruption and 
10 
fraud in roundabout 2004. 
Then I was also involved in the - in the Fidentia matter which 
I investigated and then in 2010 the Scorpions were disbanded and we - 
and I elected to join SAPS again and since then I have been in the 
DPCI where I was involved the Crime Intelligence matter which I am 
testifying today about. 
Also fraud and corruption with - within SASSA as well as SITA 
and later on we would become involved in the Supply Chain 
Management Processes of SAPS and fraud and corruption that takes 
place there. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Forgive me but I am even struggling 
to hear you.  Could I ask you to speak louder please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay.  I am - I am so sorry.  I will 
speak louder. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 29 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Must I repeat some of it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No, please continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay and that is where - and that 
is my - my experience.  I am currently on - and I use the term loosely.  I 
am seconded to - to IPID.  In - Independent Police Investigative 
Directorate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And again seconded to the ID.  
The Investigative Directorate.  So I am currently working with the 
Investigative Directorate in terms of the investigations that they are - 
10 
that they are commissioned with which includes investigations from the 
State Capture Commission. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who does your position report to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I still report to my - my Directorate 
is still General Lebeya - Lieutenant-General Lebeya from the DPCI but I 
do in terms of the investigations report to IPID as well as now the ID 
which is Advocate Cronje. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it therefore correct that you 
have more than 20 years of experience as an investigator? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it also correct that the evidence 
that you present before this Commission arises out of your experience 
as an investigator specific to particular transactions? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  That is part 
of the investigations that I dealt with and what happened during that 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 30 of 150 
 
investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Have you given evidence at any 
other inquiry? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  I have given evidence 
before the Mokgoro Commission.  My evidence related directly to the 
actions of Mr - Advocate Mrwebi at the time and to a lesser extent 
Advocate Jiba but more with respect to Advocate Mrwebi. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then for the record the Mokgoro 
Commission of Inquiry which you refer to is correctly stated as the 
inquiry in terms of Section 12(6) of the National Prosecuting … 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Authority Act. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  As stated in 
paragraph 6 of my affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before we turn to the purpose of your 
affidavit on page 6 I would ask you to please look at KK2.3 which is the 
diagrams bundle and in particular the first diagram.  If I can please ask 
for the diagram to be projected.  Page 1.  Chair you will remember that 
this is the diagram that was presented at the outset of this particular 
stream of law enforcement and this has been presented to this witness 
20 
for identification as to which divisions, clusters or departments his 
evidence relates.  Do you …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I cannot recognise it anymore but if you say I - it 
was presented it must have been presented.  Yes, you may continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair through you Mr Roelofse is it 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 31 of 150 
 
correct that all of the blocks or circles that have been marked in a 
colour are those - are either offices or institutions or departments that 
your evidence refers to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so for the record if we look to 
the cluster of police … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you look where? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To the cluster of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Police? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Police … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the far left hand side.  The - the 
departments that you have highlighted in addition to the offices to 
which your evidence relates for the record is listed as Crime 
Intelligence or rather let me start from the top.  The Commissioner of 
the South African Police Service, the National Head, the Deputy - 
Deputy National Commissioners, Provincial Commissioners and then 
the four divisions of Crime Intelligence, the South African Police 
Services, DPCI being the Hawks and IPID. 
Under 
SAPS 
you 
have 
particularly 
highlighted 
Crime 
20 
Investigation Services General Detectives.  Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And under DPCI you have highlighted 
Serious Commercial Crime Investigations and Serious Corruption 
Investigations.  Is that correct? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 32 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct - correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You have also highlighted the Office 
of the Minister of Police? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If one then looks to the - the Cluster 
of Justice.  For the record you have highlighted State Attorney’s Office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The National Prosecuting Authority, 
the Office of the NDPP, the Office of the DNDPP and NPS.  In particular 
the Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Collectively 
you 
have 
then 
centralised an additional highlight under the Parliament Cluster and 
that is the Auditor-General’s Office and the Parliamentary Oversight but 
in particular the JSC on Intelligence and Portfolio Committees? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And lastly on the Cluster of Finance 
you have highlighted National Treasury and the - and the AG’s Office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so in highlighting these different 
20 
divisions, aspects, departments and offices your evidence either 
mentions them or raises issue or concerns which arises out of either 
the positions or the offices as highlighted.  Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair and if I may 
add it - it also includes the Inspector-General of Intelligence. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 33 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Thank you for that and so if 
we can now turn to - if we can now turn to page 6 of your affidavit.  
What is the purpose of the evidence that you present to this 
Commission Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair the purpose of my affidavit 
is to place before the Commission evidence into the legal activities of 
senior and highly placed officers within Crime Intelligence which is a 
department within South African - the South African Police Service.  As 
will come - become clearer later on my initial concern in terms of this 
specific affidavit related to a murder investigation that I was requested 
10 
to do which then led to the investigation which I am - which is called - 
which I call the SSA looting investigation and I also wish to make it 
clear to the Commission that I have got no view in terms of the - the 
guilt of innocence of any of the people that I am mentioning in my 
affidavit because that is the function of a court of law if and when such 
evidence is presented at a trial. 
My evidence - in my evidence I - I am trying to point - point 
out the seriousness of the allegations that was made at the time and 
the lack and failure of the investigation or assistance in the 
investigation to finalise these investigations.  That is what my - that is 
20 
the second part of - of my testimony of - in terms of what I want to deal 
with in - in my testimony. 
As I said I also deal with anything that hampered the 
investigations and - and events that - that frustrated the investigation 
which included senior members of SAPS as well as senior members - 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 34 of 150 
 
senior members of the NPA and I am of the view that in doing so these 
- these individuals became part of the problem in that they were 
supposed to do what is expected - expected of them in terms of their - 
the office that they hold and they did not and therefore I think that they 
in my view they - they obstructed the course of justice and defeat - and 
defeated then the - the ends of justice. 
 
As I said the transactions I deal with in my affidavit originated 
or facilitated by an operational unit which I call, it’s my term and 
operation unit within the Crime Intelligence that was led by Major 
General Solomon Lazarus he was the Chief Financial Office of the 
10 
Secret Services account at the time and General Lazarus had the final 
financial authority in terms of his delegation in respect of the 
transactions that I am testifying about.  He was also instrumental in 
appointing certain members within the operational unit that allowed him 
to manipulate financial transactions and to – for himself, to benefit 
himself and others. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If you could then just pause there is 
it then correctly stated that your evidence basically deals with – to be 
addressed in two parts, the first deals with investigations that you’ve 
been involved in and the second relates to interference in those 
20 
investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct, Chair, the first 
part I deal with in my affidavit just to emphasise the importance of the 
seriousness of the allegation that was made, as I said earlier it’s not 
about whether the people are guilty or not it’s just the seriousness and 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 35 of 150 
 
the fact that it needed further investigation and what happened 
afterwards in terms of the non-assistance in terms of that investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you, how would you explain 
the chain of command within Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair, at the time when I got 
involved General Mduli, Naggie Mduli was Richard Naggie Mdluli he 
was the Divisional Commissioner at Crime Intelligence and as such the 
head as – or Crime Intelligence within SAPS.  The second person I 
mentioned which I’m focusing on is General Lazarus who was the Chief 
Financial Officer within the SSA account, the Secret Services Account, 
10 
the third person I am – although a lesser amount I am focusing my is 
Colonel Heine Johannes Barnard, he was a Section Commander within 
the supply chain management unit at Crime Intelligence and he was a 
Procurement Officer which I call as company X and if I can clarify 
company X was a front company used by CI, Crime Intelligence, it 
forms part of the clandestine operational set-up of Crime Intelligence, 
in other words they would do financial transactions through the 
company, in order to hide agents and sources that is the reason why it 
is dealt with in that manner.  So I do not think it is fair of me to 
disclose the company name at – because it does not take what I’m 
20 
testifying about any further. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it thus correct that Colonel 
Barnard reported to General Lazarus who in turn reported to General 
Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct and General Mdluli 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 36 of 150 
 
would in turn repot to the National Commissioner at the time, whoever 
the National Commissioner would have been. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And who was the National 
Commissioner of Police at the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was General Bheki Cele. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the National Commissioner of 
police at…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry who was it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   General Bheki Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay what time are we talking about? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I do have the timeframes 
but I do not have them in front of me now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’ve got them somewhere? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but for the time to which your evidence relates 
in relation to this account General Bheki Cele was the National 
Commissioner, is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe for part of the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It’s part of the time Chair quite 
20 
excessive years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay over a long period so there are – there is 
another time 
when 
it 
was 
somebody 
else 
who was 
National 
Commissioner or there other people who were National Commissioners 
at different times that’s covered by part of your evidence? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 37 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, or acting 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the National Commissioner of 
police, in turn to reported to whom? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He reports to the Minister of 
Police as well as Parliament. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And for purposes of your evidence 
who was the Minister of Police at the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   At the time it was Minister Nathi 
10 
Mthethwa. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Again we need to check the at - the time. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   At the time of General Bheki Cele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh at the time okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes my timeframe starts in 2009, 
so I’m not talking 2009 up until when – I can’t remember when the 
Minister was going somewhere else ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Changed, okay.  Well it’s just that it’s important that 
– I mean you are still going to give your evidence, you don’t want 
20 
somebody to complain that you are saying throughout the events 
covered by your evidence he was National Commissioner if, maybe it’s 
only a quarter of that time that he was National Commissioner or 
Minister that’s why it’s important to make that clear. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I agree Chair, and I think we dealt 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 38 of 150 
 
with it during the affidavit and stipulated timeframes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair I’ve been alerted to the fact 
that it is 11h15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s take the tea adjournment and we’ll resume 
at half past eleven.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Roelofse can 
you please explain to the Chair your understanding of the financial 
delegations of authority within Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair my understanding of the 
financial authorisations within Crime Intelligence is the fact that you – 
that from a specific rank or position you are allowed to approve certain 
transactions up to a certain value and the higher your rank goes the 
higher the approval – the financial approval that you – that you are 
entitled to give.  In that regard it would then General Lazarus and 
General Mdluli who would have within CI the highest authority in terms 
20 
of the approval of financial – the financial authorities. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so within those positions there 
are escalating thresholds of financial authorities, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chairperson as I 
said it will – I think it starts from a – it starts from a Captain if I am not 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 39 of 150 
 
mistaken and then the threshold gets higher as the position that you 
hold is seniority of the position that you hold and depending on where 
you are within the – within Crime Intelligence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   You mentioned the company 
Company X.  When Company X transacted on behalf of Crime 
Intelligence who was the main representative for the transactions which 
involved Company X? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Well in terms of the procurement 
Colonel Barnard would assist and recommend procurement in respect of 
whatever they identified that they need and then the authority to – to 
10 
approve those – those transactions would lie with General Lazarus in 
general.  But at times when it exceeds his authority it would go to 
either General Mdluli or the National Commissioner for that matter if it 
goes beyond a certain – certain limit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Sorry – and for purposes of your 
evidence what is the time frame that your evidence covers? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson my – the evidence 
covers the timeframe since March 2011 or specifically 23 r d Marcy 2011 
up until to date in respect of the events – the investigation that I had 
dealt with and I am relying on affidavits submitted by witnesses given 
20 
to me during the course of that investigation.  And either by witnesses 
and affidavits I – I made myself during that – during that period.  The 
information that I have obtained as well as the exhibits as well as the 
information – the witness statements are in my possession and if 
needed; I will make those available to the commission but it is too 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 40 of 150 
 
voluminous for me just to add it.  As I said when I – when I refer to 
specific evidence and affidavits, exhibits or annexures I am in 
possession of such documentation.  Unless attached to my affidavit I 
will make the documents available to the commission on request. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so it is correct then that some 
of the matters that you refer to before this commission relates to 
criminal investigations which are still pending? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  That is one 
of the reasons why I could not attach them. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For purposes of your evidence there 
10 
are various concepts that you refer to and some of those concepts are 
elaborated upon from paragraph 13 of your affidavit to paragraph 26. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For the benefit of you evidence can I 
ask you to then address some of these concepts.  The first being on 
page 8 The Secret Services Account.  Before you do so though please 
clarity what is the mandate of Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the mandate of Crime 
Intelligence is and I am now – I am taking this from the SAPS Annual 
Report which is dated 2017/2018.   
20 
“It is to manage crime intelligence and analyse crime 
information 
and 
provide 
technical 
support 
for 
investigations and crime prevention operations.” 
That is the mandate of Crime Intelligence.  And the strategic objectives 
of crime intelligence are inter alia the following: 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 41 of 150 
 
To gather crime intelligence in support of the prevention combatting of 
the investigation of crime. 
To collate, evaluate, analyse, coordinate and disseminate intelligence 
for the purposes of technical operational and strategic utilisation. 
To 
supply 
intelligence 
products 
relating 
to 
National 
Strategic 
Intelligence to the National – to National Intelligence. 
To institute counter-intelligence measures within the South African 
Police Service. 
To prevent and fight crime through enhance international cooperation 
and innovation on police and security matters. 
10 
So in effect their mandate relates to crime within South Africa – the 
fighting of crime.  In – and by doing so in assisting then the 
investigative arm of the police service in doing so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So would – would the intelligence gathering function 
of crime intelligence include information if for example in a community 
certain people plan to stage a protest and in the process they want to 
burn some government buildings.  Would that be the kind of thing where 
crime intelligence is the part of SAPS that should get that information 
in advance, that intelligence in advance? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  In respect 
20 
of in the example that was mentioned now it is expected of crime 
intelligence to have the necessary intelligence for the South African 
Police Service specifically your uniform police or visible policing to 
make the necessary plans and arrangements to either prevent or to 
make sure that when this happens they are in a position to deal with it.  
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 42 of 150 
 
So it is part and parcel of the crime intelligence that they need to – 
need to gather for SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What is the Secret Services 
Account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the Secret Services Account 
is money that has been made available through National Treasury and 
those monies are made available to Crime Intelligence, Military 
Intelligence as well as the National Intelligence.  Although they have 
got different mandates but it – it comes from the same source.  It 
10 
comes from government – it is government money.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So would all funding that is given to Crime 
Intelligence for purposes of carrying out its functions fall within this 
account?  So in other words it would be – it is the only account that 
Crime Intelligence uses? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja it – that is correct Chair that is 
their source of funding. They might have more than one account 
number into which the money has been [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but they fall under the same? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   They fall under the same that is 
20 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So the functioning of all crime 
intelligence gathering activities of the South African Police Service is 
largely dependent upon a recruitment utilisation of information – of 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 43 of 150 
 
informants.  That is what they – that is their core business.  SSA 
supplied the funding to obtain and maintain the recruitment utilisation 
of informants which in turn supplies the information to obtain the above 
strategic objectives.  Simply put South African – the Secret Services 
Account is a financial management system in the SAPS.  It is funding 
and utilised by Crime Intelligence structures.  For inter alia the 
payment of agents, renting of safe houses, purchasing of assets and 
the covering of costs and expenses for covert operations.  Similarly as 
I stated earlier the State Security Agency as well as Military 
Intelligence operate in a compatible system although be it with different 
10 
mandates.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What exactly is a safe house Mr 
Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it is – it is a – a premises 
identified by – by Crime Intelligence which they would utilise for 
various functions.  It could be – it could be a business premises within 
a business park that will be part of that objective in terms of that 
specific project that they are dealing with.  In other words they would 
need that or it will be a house where they would be able to safely 
debrief informants without going out to the public.  They can go and 
20 
see them there.  So there are various reasons or various utilisation of 
specific safe houses as to why it is needed and why it is used.  It is not 
used for – it cannot be used for private – for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Private purposes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Private purposes that is correct 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 44 of 150 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it would be premises other than normal 
offices of Crime Intelligence an those premises would be used for any 
part of the operations of Crime Intelligence which may require some – 
which may require secrecy? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and that is 
what makes it – that is what makes what they do it places a special 
responsibility on them.  Because under those circumstances it becomes 
very easy to abuse the assets of the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So there is – there is a special 
condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Procedure? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja on them to – because they are 
put in a position of trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So – and that is which is larger 
than for instance a visible policeman that is part of the visible policing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So basically if somebody within Crime Intelligence 
who has got the right to authority believes that there is somebody 
20 
within Crime Intelligence needs a place to conduct certain operations 
either in office or a house subject to following certain procedures 
maybe a house or office maybe identified which would then be either 
purchased or leased by Crime Intelligence for purposes of carrying out 
those operations? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 45 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  There is 
normally a procedure that they follow.  They would have a – a 
registered project.  Then they would have certain goals and objectives 
within that registered project and then if it needs for those goals and 
objectives to be attained and they need to for instance lease a safe 
house then they would do it in terms of that. So that – a memorandum 
will then accompany such an application which then either will be either 
approved or disapproved – or turned down and then based on that they 
will then continue with the lease or not,. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   You mentioned that the Secret 
10 
Services Account is used to fund the purchasing of assets.  What type 
of assets are you referring to by way of example? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I am referring to any asset.  
I think with the right motivations they would probably be able to buy a 
submarine.  But the fact of the matter is you need to motivate what you 
need and certain scenarios would need special equipment. So for the 
safe house for instance you would need to – to supply furniture.  For an 
office park – office building you would need to supply furniture as well.  
But I think the bulk of the – of the monies in terms of the assets goes 
to the purchase of vehicles because that is a very important aspect or 
20 
very important tool within their – within what they do. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is the Secret Services Account the 
only financial account of the South African Police Services? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair there are two accounts 
that the South African Police Services use.  The one is not open to – 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 46 of 150 
 
the Secret Service Account is not open to the rest of the South African 
Police.  We have another account which we call the Open Account.  
That account is utilised for normal day to day travelling costs.  If I have 
to travel to Gauteng for instance they would pay my travel cost and my 
accommodation until I have to go back.  So that is what that account is 
utilised for. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is the Secret Services Account and 
the Open Account audited in the same way? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair it is not – it is both 
audited by the Auditor General but there are safeguards in place in 
10 
terms of the Secret Services Account.  The Auditor General has the 
right to go and have a look at documents relating to – to the acquisition 
of – of assets.  But those documentation are normally classified so 
there is – there is a different – there is also a special unit within the 
AG that deals with it.  The Secret – the South African or the Open 
Account is audited through a normal process like any other department. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it therefore correct that off the 
back of your evidence National Treasury pays monies to the South 
African Police Services which has two accounts, is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I am not exactly sure where 
20 
it is paid into but I think there is two separate streams of payment.  The 
one goes in as part of the budget which is the open budget and 
discussed in Parliament I think on the other end in the Portfolio 
Commission – Portfolio Committee of the South African Police.  And the 
other one is a budget that will be discussed at Portfolio Committee on 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 47 of 150 
 
Intelligence.  I think that is the correct name for it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Well then at least insofar as the 
Secret Services Account and the Open Account is concerned both of 
those funds are state funds? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct – that is correct 
Chair it is both – it is state funds. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the funds of the Secret Services 
Account is then focussed to meet the mandate of Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph – on page 9 at 
10 
paragraph 19 you outline the regulatory framework which is applicable 
to the functioning of Crime Intelligence and the Secret Services 
Account. Chair for your – just to highlight to you KK2.4 includes the 
first three pieces of legislation which is the South African Police 
Services Act, the Public Finance Management Act and the Secret 
Services Act but it does not include the Policy Directives and 
Procedures for Crime Intelligence gathering which is a classified 
document.  The next concept that you talk about is the classification of 
documents and there you deal with the different types of classification 
and the process for doing so.  We now at paragraph 20 on page 9 of 
20 
your affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Why are documents classified? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are you at the right page – are you on the 
right page? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 48 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I am on page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Paragraph 20 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay paragraph 20. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Why are documents classified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the documents are 
classified – there is various reasons but one of the most important 
reasons would be there to – to hide the identity of agents as well as 
informers.  Not to divulge the – the physical addresses of safe houses 
10 
and – and business premises. So those would be – those would be the 
reasons within – it will fall within that framework that documents are 
classified 
within 
the 
SAPS 
environment 
or 
Crime 
Intelligence 
environment. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What document governs the 
classification of documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is the Minimum Information 
Security Standards Document which is commonly known as MISS or the 
MISS document which was adopted by I think it was adopted by 
Parliament or the cabinet at some – in early 2000’s. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it is correct that this document 
is classified as restricted but it is available on the internet? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  By virtue of 
Right To Know – the Right To Know Campaign they have placed it on 
the internet. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 49 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair this document too you will find 
in Bundle KK2.4.  From – at page 10 you talk about the different levels 
of classification.  What are the key levels of classification? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair before I – before I get there 
I just want to – to draw the attention of the Chair to paragraph 22.  This 
is a caveat within the MISS document and it states clearly that 
classification mentioned above are described below and there is a note. 
“Security measures are not intended and should not 
be 
applied 
to 
cover 
up 
mal-administration, 
corruption, criminal actions etcetera or to protect 
10 
individuals, officials involved in such cases.” 
So that is – for me that is really important note within that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Why is that particular paragraph 
important to you Mr Roelofse for purposes of your evidence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The purpose of my evidence is to 
show the problems – the problems that arise from classification or over-
classification of documents and then the – the not understanding that 
you cannot use classification to hide criminality.  And I think that is – 
that is the purpose of – of the – or one of the purposes of my testimony 
20 
here today. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it your assertion that the 
classification of documents was used to not further investigations that 
you have been involved in? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is my assertion Chair I am – 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 50 of 150 
 
what I am saying is that the documents were classified.  The non-
classifications of those documents as far as I am concerned allowed for 
the non-prosecution of those members involved in these alleged 
transactions.  And the classification is used as an excuse not to – not 
to continue with the – with the – with their various investigations or to 
hamper the investigations.  And in most of these instances the 
individuals involved are the ones that classified the documents.  So it 
becomes very difficult to get the documents declassified because 
declassification can only take place by the author or the National 
Commissioner or someone delegated by him. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And whilst you have explained who 
classifies documents who is entitled to declassify documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I just said it would be 
the author of that specific document who classified it in the first place 
or the National Commissioner. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What – how many levels of 
classification are there for classification of documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there are four levels of 
classification.  According to the MISS document which is restricted, 
confidential, secret and top secret. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what is the differences between 
these levels of classification? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there are – there are 
various differences it is set out in my affidavit.  I will – I will just allude 
to the explanation in the – in the MISS document.   
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 51 of 150 
 
“A restricted document as explained is used when – 
when the compromise of information can cause 
inconvenience to a person or institution but cannot 
hold a threat or a damage – threat of damage.  
However compromised of such information can 
frustrate everyday activities.” 
Confidential definition and then there is a test that deals with that and 
then there is an explanation on page 11. 
“Confidential 
is 
used 
when 
compromise 
of 
information results in undue damage to the integrity 
10 
of a person or institution but not entailing a threat or 
a 
serious 
damage 
of 
serious 
damage. 
The 
compromise of such information and other can 
frustrate 
every 
day 
functions, 
lead 
to 
an 
inconvenience and bring about wasting of funds.  The 
inhibition of systems, the periodical disruption of 
administration.  For example logistical problems, 
delayed 
personnel 
– 
delayed 
personnel 
administration, 
financial 
relapses 
etcetera 
that 
inconvenience institution but can be overcome.  The 
20 
[indistinct] 
and 
routine 
cooperation 
between 
institutions and or individuals being harmed or 
delayed but not bringing functions to a halt.” 
In respect of this secret classification.   The explanation as provided by 
the MISS document reads as follows: 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 52 of 150 
 
“Can result in a disruption of the planning and 
fulfilling of tasks i.e. the objections of a state of 
institution in such a way that it cannot properly fulfil 
its normal functions and can disrupt the operational 
cooperation between institutions in such a way that it 
threatens the functioning of one or more of these 
institutions.” 
And then Top Secret.  The explanation for top secret according to the 
MISS document. 
“The function of state and or institution being 
10 
brought 
to 
a 
halt 
by 
disciplinary 
measures, 
sanctions, boycotts or mass action.  The severing of 
relations between states and the declaration of war.” 
So the threshold is quite high. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   When it comes to top secret and 
secret as to why you want to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Classify the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At the back if you are still fine you can still hear 
20 
you do not have to make any indication but if you do not hear give me 
some indication?  I think they can hear you.  Okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   To state the ob – what may be 
obvious then there ascending levels of classification; the lowest level 
being restricted.  The level above that being confidential.  The level 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 53 of 150 
 
above that being secret and the level above that being top secret. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is the security clearance of an 
individual important or relevant at all in relation to a document which 
has been classified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in terms of the author it 
cannot have any bearing in the sense that a person do now know what 
information he is going to receive.  Information that he receives – 
received might be of such a sensitive nature that he has to classify the 
document as top secret before disseminating the document any further.  
10 
So it depends on the circumstances Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct that you need a 
particular level of security in order to access a particular document 
which has been classified at a particular level? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  You can – 
you can access the document which is similar to your – your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your ranking in terms of confidentiality. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Your access. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or secrecy. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Classification ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The last concepts that you address 
is on page 12 and you talk specifically to the ranks within the police.  
Can I ask you to turn to page 74 please which is annexure 1 to your 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 54 of 150 
 
affidavit?  Do you recognise this document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What exactly is this document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This document was a document 
that was compiled by the – by the South African Police Service.  It was 
just prior to the changing of ranks in 2010 which – which changed the – 
the previous ranking system which was more a civilian ranking system 
to again a military ranking system.  And this was the ranking system 
that was adopted in April 2010. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In particular the 1 s t April 2010, is 
10 
that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it therefore still current to the 
ranks of today? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is still current to the ranks of 
today Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page 75 
please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I am there. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   There is a difference in markings 
20 
between commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers which is 
marked on the line on the right hand side. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please explain what is the difference 
between commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 55 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the simple difference is a 
commissioned officer is an officer within the South African Police 
Service.  In terms of the current ranking system which – I stated earlier 
it is still the same however it has changed because the rank of 
Lieutenant that fell away as well the rank of Major has fell away.  They 
were collapsed into Captain and to Lieutenant-Colonel.  That happened 
not too long ago. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But in any – but in essence you 
would have a non-commissioned officer is – is police officers of the 
10 
rank of Warrant Officer, Sergeant or Constable and then above that it 
would be then a commissioned officer who is either part of junior 
management, middle management or senior management. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then for the record this 
particular document on the left hand side lists the police rank in the 
current – or it rather lists the current police rank as it was at that time 
and the column alongside it lists the new police rank which was since 
adopted on the 1 s t April 2010, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now how would a member of the 
20 
police progress from one rank to the next? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair there are - there is more 
than one way but the police structure is - is - there is a - there is a 
specific post allocated to a - to - if I can take an example for instance a 
police station.  You will have 50 posts allocated to that police station.  
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 56 of 150 
 
One of those posts would be the Station Commander.  One would be - 
one of those posts would be the Head of Visible Policing and the Head 
of Detectives and so forth as you go down. 
So when you want to get a promotion a promotion can take 
place through that post being vacated either by - by death, by - by that 
person being promoted somewhere else that person leaving the South 
African Police Service.  There are various way how that post can open 
up and then you can - you can then apply to - for that post.  A process 
will then be followed. 
You will be shortlisted and if you are successful you will then 
10 
be appointed in that post and the - and the rule is that you have to stay 
in that post for at least two years before you can be - before you can 
ask for a further promotion. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So along - if one looks again at page 
75 alongside the middle column which is the current police rank there is 
another column called “Post Title” where you have from the top 
National Commissioner, Deputy National Commissioner, Divisional 
Commissioner, Provincial Commissioner and so forth.  What is the 
difference then between a Post Title and a Rank? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I - the difference as far as 
20 
IO am concerned.  I am not an expert on this but the Post Title is just - 
it is the - it is how you would refer to a specific post regardless of the 
person in that post.  So the National Commissioner will always be 
General.  Deputy National Commissioner is a Lieutenant-General. 
You can only get Acting Deputy National Commissioners if 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 57 of 150 
 
they are not Deputy National Commissioners and I am - and I am 
talking under correction there but it is based on the seniority that you 
have.  You will have - if you look at the structure of the South African 
Police Service - you will have the National Commissioner on top. 
Then you would have his three - five or six Deputy National 
Commissioners who are all of the - who are all having the rank of 
Lieutenant - Lieutenant-Generals.  Then you will have Divisional 
Commissioners in respect of if I can refer to General Mdluli who was a 
Divisional Commissioner. 
Then you will have Provincial Commissioner and you will 
10 
have Assistant Commissioners or it will be Component Heads and so 
forth. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So is it to be understood correctly 
that the post is a - is an office within the organogram structure? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is as far as I know.  
Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the rank is something that is 
particular to the individual who occupies … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  A particular post? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is how I understand it Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and then is it also correct that 
when - in order to progress from one rank to the next when an applicant 
then applies for a post that requires a particular rank if that applicant 
meets the requirements of that post that individual assumes that rank? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 58 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it possible to jump from one rank 
to - to another? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Are you talking about more than 
one rank at a time? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  Apologies for that.  Is it 
possible to progress more than one rank at a time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it is not supposed to be but I 
see - I have seen it happen before.  I think there is exceptional 
circumstances where it can happen.  For instance if a person has got 
10 
special skills.  He has studied and he needs to be appointed within the 
forensic laboratory for instance and he - and he is now a - a chemist or 
whatever - whatever the - the position might be. 
That - he might have been a Sergeant and he is now been 
appointed in a - in a Captain’s position because of the skills - the 
scarce skills that he - that he has or she has. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can we then go back to page …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  You have different ranks but whenever there is 
a vacancy on a certain rank that would be advertised.  Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  Most of 
20 
those advertisements would be internal but you would also - if you look 
at your provincial commissioners and - and so forth you would - you 
would get external … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Advertisements for those but most 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 59 of 150 
 
of it is internal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where a post is advertised there would be no 
restriction.  Would there be to say only people who fall into certain 
ranks may apply.  In other words I maybe at rank - I maybe at - let me 
see the ranks here.  I maybe at the rank of Captain and then there is a 
position for Director - Brigadier. 
If I think that I have got - I meet all the requirements and I 
have got what it takes.  I may apply for that position.  Is it not? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair nothing stops you from 
applying but I do not think you would qualify in respect of your 
10 
application because you would not have the necessary skills and the 
necessary - you would not have the necessary skills to - to apply for 
that.  So you - you would fall out in the application process but there is 
nothing stopping you from applying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that - would that relate to the experience part 
but in terms of the formal - for example - formal educational 
qualifications I may qualify in terms of that but maybe I might short - 
fall short of the requisite experience …. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you are talking about?  So what I am 
20 
trying to establish is whether the fact that I am at a certain rank may 
exclude me completely or whether it might not exclude me completely 
but I am unlikely to be shortlisted because there would be so many 
others above my rank for example. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I can answer it in the 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 60 of 150 
 
following manner.  If you - the only exclusion that I am aware of at this 
point in time is the exclusion - the two year rule.  In other words if you 
have been appointed in a specific rank you cannot apply for a - a 
promotion within that two year - two year period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In terms of the others.  If you - the 
difference between a non-commissioned officer and an officer is your 
academic qualification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So if you - if you are a 
10 
non-commissioned officer and you want to apply for a commissioned 
officer post then you would have to have the necessary academic 
qualifications.  If you - well you can - the fact of the matter is you can 
put in your application but in terms of the requirements you will not - 
you will not be considered. 
If you are commissioned officer and you are a Captain and 
you want to apply for the General’s post I think you are most welcome 
to do so but within the - but within the requirements that is needed for 
that specific post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So in - in the normal course of 
business those applications will fall - will fall to - will fall out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would the position that - would the position be that 
the norm is that people would - people who would be appointed to a 
certain rank are people who were occupying the rank immediately below 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 61 of 150 
 
that one as a norm but that sometimes it happens that somebody was 
occupying a rank that is two ranks below the one he or she is applying 
for gets appointed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  We - we 
term it going through the ranks.  That is the term that we use.  So that 
is the norm.  As I said there are instances where there is exceptional 
circumstances - exceptional circumstances where there is special skills 
required … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Where that can happen. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So that is - that is in a nutshell as 
to how I understand it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could ask you then to turn back to 
page 13 of your affidavit where you document your frustration in 
securing classified documents.  Can you please elaborate on the 
frustrations that you encountered as you document in your affidavit? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as part of my investigation it 
- it became evident - evident that the classification of documentation 
was utilised precisely to cover up maladministration, corrupt, criminal 
actions and/or to protect individuals involved in such instances.  
Exactly what the MISS document says you cannot do. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 62 of 150 
 
Therefore in my view I think that many of the classified 
documents were incorrectly classified in that the information contained 
in such a document did not warrant the high level of classification and - 
and then secondly since May 2012 that is a period more than seven 
years.  The management of SAPS and CI have frustrated the 
classification of documents which in my view has been tantamount to 
refusing the classified - declassified documents to me. 
This concerns both documents that I have requested to be 
declassified and documents that is already in my possession awaiting 
declassification.  To place the undermentioned crime intelligent 
10 
investigation into context I will deal with specific instances regarding 
my investigation into the SSA looting investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So before you - you go there.  So what you are 
actually saying is that you have to - you are meant to conduct certain 
investigations and those investigations or some of them relates to the 
Secret Service Account and that in order to carry out your function - 
your mandate to do your job.  
You have over the years needed certain documents which are 
classified but the management of both SAPS and Crime Intelligence 
have frustrated your investigations by refusing to declassify documents 
20 
which you need for your investigations.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that has happened over seven years I think you 
say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  It happened 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 63 of 150 
 
over quite a long time and various role players within that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When - when senior management of SAPS and Crime 
Intelligent frustrate such investigations that are being carried out by 
somebody within SAPS what remedies have you got?  What have you 
had to do or are you just stuck because they - they are refusing?  Is 
there a door on which you - you are allowed to go and knock and say I 
am being frustrated here by people who should assist me with this 
investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if you will allow I think that 
will come out at - at a later of my or the … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The second part of my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In terms of what - what I have 
done … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In order to get this documentation 
declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  As long as you address it at some stage. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is the second part of - of my - 
of my evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because part of what I will be looking at is what it is 
that the Commission might be able to do to try and make sure that you 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 64 of 150 
 
are not frustrated in your investigations.  So - so - but we will deal with 
it when you come to that part. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you Chair.  I appreciate it.  
I just want to make it - put it - put it on record I am not here - I am not 
at the Commission to ask the Commission to - to help me declassify the 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I am here to explain why it did not 
happen and that something needs to be dealt - something needs to be 
done to rectify that specific situation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no I am - I am not necessarily talking about 
the declassification.  I mean obviously in investigation the types of 
investigations you are doing is very important and if they are being 
frustrated that should be a concern and to the extent that the 
investigations may relate to matters of corruption … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maladministration. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The whole country has an interest in knowing whether 
there are valid reasons for certain officials not giving you cooperation.  
20 
So that - that is the angle. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As - as we move into the different 
types of investigations that you have been involved in it may be 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 65 of 150 
 
important for you to first clarify how investigators in DPCI are assigned 
to matters. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair normally what happened is 
that and I am not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to mention again DPCI being what is normally 
called the Hawks? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  The Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Normally what would happen on - 
and I am talking about the provincial - on the provincial level now.  You 
10 
have three - three streams of investigations or three - three units which 
is Serious Organised Crime, Serious Financial Crimes and Corruption 
and a specific docket investigation would come into the unit. 
It will be then decided does it fall under organised crime, 
does it fall financial - Serious Financial Crime and then based on that a 
decision will be taken to give to a specific unit within the DPCI or 
within the Hawks and then that Commander of that specific unit would 
then 
decide 
Investigator X 
will 
receive 
this 
investigation 
and 
Investigator Y will receive that investigation. 
It is to make sure that the - the work is allocated equally to 
20 
members and to allocate it to members that if there is a certain skill 
that is required that that member gets that specific investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
What 
then 
happened 
on 
21 March 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I was - I was called 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 66 of 150 
 
Lieutenant - currently Lieutenant-General Matakata.  She was then the 
Major-General Matakata.  She was the Head of the Hawks in the 
Western Cape.  She requested me to attend a meeting which I did.  In 
the meeting there were other individuals which included herself, 
Major-General Sibiya and Major - Lieutenant-General Petros who was 
the Provincial Commissioner at the time in Gauteng and a - and 
Colonel Viljoen. 
We - we were then requested by Sibiya - General Sibiya to - 
to take over an investigation that was conducted by the DPCI in 
Gauteng.  Now various reasons were given to us as to why it was 
10 
needed to be done.  One of them that the investigators were the - the 
current investigators - those investigators were intimidated and the 
second one was that they needed someone from the outside with - to 
look at this objectively. 
That was the reasons that was advanced to myself and 
General Matakata then told us to continue with the investigation.  That 
is how I got onto this investigation and it is within General Matakata’s 
right and mandate to appoint me to investigate any matter as the 
Provincial Head of the DPCI within - within the West - Western Cape. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what investigation are you 
20 
specifically referring to here? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I am referring to what we are 
calling the Mdluli investigation which is a murder - which was a murder 
investigation.  For the purposes of the Commission I am referring to it 
as the Vosloorus case because that is where it happened. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 67 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you were called into this meeting.  
You were assigned to this case and who was the lead investigator for 
this investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair by virtue of my rank I 
became the lead investigator of - of this investigation.  As I was the 
senior - I was the senior in respect of - I was Colonel Viljoen’s senior 
at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What happened on 31 March 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair on 31 March we made an 
arrangement with General Mdluli to hand himself over at the Boksburg 
10 
Magistrate’s Court which he then did and he was then placed on the 
court roll and he was detained at that point. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what were the charges against 
him? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At the - at the time the charges 
were the following:  it is a charge of murder and attempted murder and 
other charges relating for - relating or ranging from intimidation, 
kidnapping, assault and defeating the ends of justice. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
What 
then 
transpired 
on 
7 April 2011? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair on 7 April that was after we 
conducted a bail application.  General Mdluli and three others who were 
his co accused at the time were granted bail and the case was 
postponed.  I think, ja until 30 September 2011 for further investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that it was also 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 68 of 150 
 
postponed for the allocation of a High Court date? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja.  In respect of 30 September a 
High Court date would have been allocated for this matter as well as 
the indictment would have been - would have been given to the accused 
at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it also correct that it was on 
14 February 2012 that the matter was set down for trial? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  On 
30 December the matter was set down for - for trial on 14 September - 
14 February 2012 at Gauteng South High Court in Johannesburg. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did the trial proceed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  The trial - trial did not 
proceed regardless of - regardless of the fact that the charge sheet was 
drawn up and the indictment was given.  The matter was then referred 
for a - for an inquest … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On whose instruction was it referred 
for an inquest? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair from what I know it was an 
20 
instruction of the DPP of Gauteng South which is Advocate Chauke. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And was that decision challenged? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  The 
decision was challenged by Freedom Under Law in - in first the High 
Court and then it was confirmed in the Supreme Court of Appeal. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 69 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair both of those judgments have 
been included in Bundle KK2.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I see the statement does not say much about what 
they say.  Could you cover that just briefly? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In relation to the? 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what the judgment said what - what was the basis 
for challenging and what was the basis for the decision.  Just so that 
there is proper context or is - is that something you might - might be 
more convenient to deal with later? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Just maybe when we come back from 
lunch. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Following the decision 
of 
the 
Supreme Court of Appeal what following steps were taken? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You are talking about the decision of the 
Supreme Court of Appeal? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was an appeal you mean? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The first judgment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us - let us start from there. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 70 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the judgment of the High Court in Pretoria was 
a judgment of Judge Murphy … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he set aside the decision of the DPP.  Is that 
correct - Mr Chauke? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there was an appeal against that judgment … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the appeal went to the Supreme Court of Appeal 
and you can just - formally just say what happened at the - at the 
10 
appeal. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The Supreme Court of Appeal 
effectively 
endorsed 
the 
judgment 
of 
Your 
Learned 
Brother 
Judge Murphy and in the result the charges were reinstated against 
Richard Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  That is fine.  Then when we come back 
from lunch if you can just touch on just whatever maybe important in 
relation to those without necessarily through the witness.  Just to - so 
that the context is known and those listening can appreciate what 
happened. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is the importance of the 
Vosloorus case to the Secret Service investigations that you led? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair at the time we did not 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 71 of 150 
 
concentrate on either Crime Intelligence or the Secret Service Account.  
Our focus on the - on the Vosloorus case itself but during the 
investigation of the Vosloorus case there were members of Crime 
Intelligence that came to me and to Colonel Viljoen and they - they 
gave us certain information which led us to believe that there are - that 
there were acts of criminality being committed within Crime Intelligence 
especially with funds from the Secret Service Account. 
Although we received the information quite early or fairly 
early into the Vosloorus case we did not have time at the time to follow 
up on - on all the allegations that was made because we were 
10 
concentrating on the Vosloorus case to finalise that but as the work - 
as we finalised the work into the Vosloorus case we were able to - to 
spend more time with the information given to us by other members of 
Crime Intelligence. 
The second thing that happened and I think that is probably 
the one that opened it up is the fact that we were - as part of the 
Vosloorus matter we did a search and seizure at the home of 
General Mdluli in - I cannot remember the exact date now - but it would 
have been in - just either early April or late April or early May but I 
think it is - it is in - it is in April.  During … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which - which year? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  20 - sorry.  I am - I am talking 
about 2011 now. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 72 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  20? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  If there is something that will refresh 
your memory you can have a look. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay.  I will do so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair.  I just want to see if I can 
get that date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will - I will have a look for the date 
10 
for the life of me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I cannot recall that one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay.  I will come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I will come back and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And share the date with you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  During the search and seizure we 
- we were able to find or we found two vehicles on the premises of 
General Mdluli.  Those - the two vehicles - the two vehicles I think the 
one was a ML Mercedes Benz and the other one was a - a BMW.  A 3 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 73 of 150 
 
Series BMW. 
Inside the 3 Series W - BMW we found an invoice relating to 
the acquisition of that specific 3 Series BMW and at the bottom of that 
invoice there was a - there was a note stating that a specific vehicle 
has been traded in, in lieu of the vehicle that we have now before us 
and when we followed up on that we established that that vehicle 
actually belonged - it is a private vehicle of General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that had been traded in? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The one that had been traded in, 
yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The details of the vehicle was the 
one that was traded in which is at the bottom of that specific invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but the vehicle that - the two vehicles that you 
found on his premises were Crime Intelligence vehicles or not really? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  They were Crime Intelligence 
vehicles bought by Crime Intelligence by the Secret Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So it was for purposes of agents 
and - and informants to be utilised in their capacity as agents and 
20 
informers.  Following up on that we were able to establish the - the 
dealership that was involved in the transaction.  The dealership was 
identified as Louie Hayes in Pretoria. 
When we approached the dealership they assisted us and 
they - and they cooperated with the investigation.  They gave us the 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 74 of 150 
 
vehicle files and then part of those vehicle files we found in the 
transaction and they explained to us exactly how the transaction 
worked and … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And since you are addressing this 
aspect now, please proceed to explain to the Chair how the transaction 
worked? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The transaction at Leeu Huis 
happened as follows.  The vehicle that – there were two vehicles – 
Crime Intelligence came to Leeu Huis and asked them for a vehicle, a 
BMW and then they also asked for them to put on the floor on their at 
10 
the dealership the private vehicle of General Mdluli to be sold privately 
out of hand because he was still – an amount, and I’m talking under 
correction of R80 000 more or less there outstanding on this hire 
purchase of that vehicle, so they needed to cover that amount for him 
to get rid of that specific vehicle.  Then the arrangement was made that 
the profit that or the discount that would go to the one BMW would then 
be transferred the – the outstanding amount in terms of the balance of 
the hire purchase of that specific vehicle, the private vehicle of General 
Mdluli, however, that was not enough I think that amount to about 
R40 000 so what happened after that is, another company by the name 
20 
of – or dealership by the name of Atlantis Motors, which we will deal 
with later, provided R50 000 to Leeu Huis which then allowed them to 
finalise or to settle the debt on the vehicle, the outstanding amount on 
the vehicle, the private vehicle of General Mdluli. 
 
However, the R40 000 had to be paid – the R50 000 had to be 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 75 of 150 
 
paid back so in – in order to do that Crime Intelligence said they will 
buy two vehicles, the other vehicle, the second vehicle was then bought 
for – was then, the vehicle wasn’t immediately available and was only 
delivered later on so the discount that was supposed to go to that 
vehicle wasn’t available at the time when Mdluli settled his amount, so 
that vehicle came later and the discount then went back to Leeu Huis 
and that money was then paid back to Nissan Atlantis as part of the 
funds that was used to settle the debt on Mdluli’s vehicle.  So that is, 
in essence how it worked, the two vehicles in question are both 
vehicles bought by Crime Intelligence through the Secret Service 
10 
account and approved by General Lazarus and arranged by Colonel 
Barnard, that is, as I said that is, in essence the case that unfolded 
before us as part of our investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I just want to understand the whole transaction, 
so Crime Intelligence did – as you understand the transaction did Crime 
Intelligence need to buy two vehicles, or you can’t say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair later on it transpired when I 
received the documents, now these are the documents that I cannot 
utilise, when it transpired that the vehicles that the memo that the 
company – the payment for these vehicles or the memo that the 
20 
company request to buy the vehicle were indeed false, the reasons 
supplied in there does not support the actual use of the vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So it was bought – the reasons 
given was something and then was used for something else, so there 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 76 of 150 
 
was a misrepresentation to the Secret Services Account as well as the 
South Africa Police Service in terms of the monies that was used there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but ultimately two vehicles were purchased by 
Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and for – 
and the two vehicles that was bought, the one went to – I will have to 
have a look at the number within that document that I gave you Chair 
as well as the other vehicle went to General Mdluli for his use. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they were – were they registered under Crime 
Intelligence or they were bought with - or Crime Intelligence money was 
10 
used to buy them but otherwise they were registered under General 
Mdluli’s name? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I cannot remember General 
Mdluli’s vehicle, I don’t think it was registered specifically in his name 
it probably was registered in a front company used by Crime 
Intelligence but the other vehicle was registered in the person that 
used the vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know I’m talking about just the two. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes I’m talking about those two 
yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you say you don’t think that any of them, those 
two were registered in General Mdluli’s name, you don’t think so? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No what I’m saying is the one 
vehicle, if I remember correctly was registered – in other words the 5 
series BMW was registered in a front company’s name used by CI and 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 77 of 150 
 
the other vehicle was registered in one the individual’s names which is 
in that list in front of you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay so would it be correct to say that 
whoever was key to the purchase of these two vehicles didn’t want to 
hide the fact that these were Crime Intelligence vehicles but they may 
have wanted to have unlawful use of them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair to a certain extent that 
is why company X is used to hide it from the public that it is a Crime 
Intelligence vehicle, that is a requirement, I would consider a legal 
requirement for them to give a vehicle to someone who is involved in 
10 
actual projects for the safeguard of that specific person or that project 
but in this instance that is not what I found. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the private vehicle where now it comes in was 
any money used that should have been for the benefit of Crime 
Intelligence but ultimately was used to benefit an individual? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson in respect of that 
transaction the monies that is supposed to accrue to Crime Intelligence 
in the form of discounts which related to about R90 000 or R80 000 as I 
said the exact amount is mentioned later in my affidavit, that amount 
should have accrued to Crime Intelligence, that discount but instead it 
20 
went to cover the cost of the final instalment amount of General 
Mdluli…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The private…[intervenes]. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Of General Mdluli yes, a private 
individual. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 78 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so would that money have been paid directly to 
him or would it have been paid to whatever he was going to pay to 
settle that debt? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson from – I haven’t 
looked at all the detail but from what I can remember that money was 
paid 
by 
Leeu 
Huis 
to 
they 
banking 
institution 
that 
still 
had…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That he owed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can then take you to page 17 
before we continue with the earlier part of your evidence you talk 
specifically to the role of Colonel Barnard in purchasing the BMW for 
General Mdluli, is it correct then that this is exactly the same 
transaction that you were now referring to as you were explaining it to 
the Chair? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chairperson, this 
is the transaction that I just explained to the Commission. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And is it then correct they had to 
break down what you said that it was company X that was represented 
20 
by Colonel Barnard in the purchase of those vehicles, on behalf of 
Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry I didn’t hear the question? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct that it was Colonel 
Barnard who represented company X in the purchase of the vehicles by 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 79 of 150 
 
Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and payment 
was authorised by General Lazarus. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the trade-in vehicle was the 
vehicle which belonged to General Mdluli and what was the settlement 
amount on that vehicle as you’ve indicated in paragraph 42? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the settlement amount was 
R560 526.01 I see that I did not mention the value of the vehicle which 
was then, obviously subtracted from the settlement amount which 
amounted to about R90 000. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in essence the evidence that 
you’ve given so far is that Colonel Barnard, on behalf of company X 
purchased two vehicles for Crime Intelligence, so to speak, in order for 
them to finance the shortfall on the trade-in vehicle of General Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what has been the outcome of 
this particular investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this is the – this was the 
beginning, General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard was arrested and my 
evidence before the Mokgoro Commission relates to this specific 
20 
transaction and on the 14 t h of November the case was withdrawn in the 
Regional Court or the Commercial Crime Court in Pretoria. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now having explained the link 
between the Vosloorus case and this Secret Services Account 
investigation you mentioned that you were approached by various 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 80 of 150 
 
members within Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair especially in 
the early part of the investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Did these members approach you 
openly? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair they would give you a 
call and you would have to go and meet them somewhere, somewhere 
clandestine where they feel comfortable talking to you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Why were they scared to meet with 
you? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair from what I understand, 
what they told me, is that they are scared, they didn’t want to come 
forward and when coming forward in the past they were basically told 
you cannot do this or you must stop your investigation or why are you 
asking these questions, so they didn’t feel comfortable speaking to 
their 
senior 
officers 
within 
Crime 
Intelligence 
because 
that 
conversations or reprimands came from their own officers, their own 
senior management. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph 38 on page 15, just to 
take you a few pages back you talk about an affidavit of Colonel 
20 
Jacobis Johannes Hendrik Roos, if I’m pronouncing that correctly? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja I think it is Jacobus and not 
Jacobis? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Apologies for that, if I can then ask 
you to go to page 83 of the same bundle, do you recognise this 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 81 of 150 
 
document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I do, it is the – it is an 
affidavit that we received from Colonel Roos, if I’m not mistaken on the 
-  it was commissioned on the 6 t h of November 2013 and I obtained the 
affidavit as part of the Crime Intelligence investigation or the SSA 
investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So were you involved in any 
interviewing or taking down this particular affidavit at all? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, I 
interviewed Mr Roos on various occasions regarding his involvement 
10 
and what had happened to him because it was important for me to 
understand and to realise the difficulties that he has gone through 
which, at the time seemed very much similar to the ones that I’m going 
through and that is the reason why I also took his affidavit to explain 
where we are in respect of our investigation, the SSA investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what’s the important features of 
this affidavit and the evidence that he gives in this affidavit? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair, in essence what Mr Roos 
has said is that he has in the past brought to the attention of senior 
management within Crime Intelligence and this now spans from 2004 
20 
which did not include the timeframe that I investigated, that he was 
struggling to get senior management to cooperate and assist with – 
which I would consider serious accusations towards members of Crime 
Intelligence.  The one, for instance dealt with a company that was used 
by a member of Crime Intelligence to clean safe houses but he does not 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 82 of 150 
 
declare it and there’s overpayment that takes place.  So you need to – I 
think for the Commission to understand his position, Colonel Roos was 
an auditor, internal auditor at Crime Intelligence so it was his work to 
audit the Secret Service’s account.  So in terms of that he had access 
to those documents.  He started an investigation in 2004 and he was 
immediately stopped by General Mphego in a manner that’s not even – I 
don’t even consider professional…[intervenes]. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry and what position did General 
Mphego hold at the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As far as I know General Mphego 
10 
was either the Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence or he was 
the acting Divisional Commissioner, I’m not exactly sure but he was the 
leading person at Crime Intelligence at the time when this took place. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What happened after General 
Mphego stopped Colonel Roos in his investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Well that’s the point nothing 
happened he was not allowed to continue with his investigation and the 
important part for me came in 2009 with the appointment of General 
Mdluli and that relates to the testimony I’m giving today and that is why 
I asked for an affidavit.  Basically what Mr Roos is saying that after the 
20 
appointment of Mr Mdluli or General Mdluli in 2009 he was appointed 
on the 1 s t of June if I’m not mistaken of 2009, he then…[intervenes]. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes correct – first of July 2009. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry Chair it’s the 1 s t of July 
2009, he immediately, well immediately is probably the wrong word but 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 83 of 150 
 
within the same month he requested Colonel Roos together with other 
members, I think they all form part of the audit team but I’m not sure 
about the other two, to do an investigation into the Secret Service 
account and with specifically focusing on General Lazarus as the CFO 
of the account.  He was given a written instruction to do so and his 
investigation for a while, a couple of months, he provided General 
Mdluli with progress reports in terms of his investigation.  He then – at 
the time he decided to continue with the investigation that was stopped 
in 2004 and he also picked up some other anomalies which he then 
wanted to investigate.  He was then – after giving the second progress 
10 
report he had difficulties in obtaining documents in his own 
environment as the auditor and those difficulties, according to him, 
came from General Lazarus who stopped him from getting the 
documentation that he needs to finalise the investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it to be understood that he was 
stopped by the very person that he was asked to investigate? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He then, in writing, requested 
General Mdluli to – or he prepared a document for General Mdluli for 
20 
his signature which would allow him access to these documents.  
General Mdluli then refused to sign it and on the 3 r d of December 2009 
General Mdluli removed him from the investigation and stopped that 
investigation and didn’t continue, he wasn’t given reasons apart from 
the fact that he should stop the investigation.   So to me that became 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 84 of 150 
 
important because that was part and parcel of what I have experienced. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What happened in November of 2009 
we are on page 16 of your affidavit paragraph 39? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   My affidavit page 16? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In November 2009 General 
Lazarus, he facilitated a trip abroad for General Mdluli and his current 
wife which is Theresa Lyons to Singapore, shortly thereafter he 
facilitated another trip abroad for General Mdluli and his ex-wife, Mrs 
Vusiwane Lilly Mdluli to China and then as I said I deal with this in 
10 
more detail later on but as on the 3 r d of December then General Mdluli 
stopped the investigation into General Lazarus and the Secret Service’s 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this was an investigation into General Lazarus 
facilitation of the trip for General Mdluli and his wife to Singapore? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair, the investigation did not 
relate to that the investigation related to the LLVS information, 
company that was identified and other issues relating to the abuse of 
the Secret Service’s account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And for the record are you referring 
to LLVS Trading Services? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Now what is the importance of you 
mentioning the investigation that Colonel Roos was involved in and 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 85 of 150 
 
then following up with trips that you unearthed to have been arranged 
by General Lazarus for the Mdluli family, followed up by the stopping of 
the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair during the course of the 
investigation, and I’m talking about over the period it became evident 
to me that General Mdluli, when he was appointed as the head of – 
Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence, came there with an 
intention to, let’s call it, clean up Crime Intelligence.  Unfortunately, he 
was then – at that stage I would call him the victim of General Lazarus, 
who set in motion certain events to compromise General Mdluli which 
10 
includes these two events and based on that, General Mdluli had no 
option but to stop any investigation because his own actions would 
become known at that point in time and that is the reason why I’m 
mentioning it in this fashion.  Now you’ll see from when I testify further, 
this is not an isolated incident it happens later on in the affidavit as 
well where people are getting drawn into a situation and then 
afterwards they are not able to walk away from that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we could now then go to page 18 
of your affidavit at which you talk about the process that you went 
through 
to 
obtain 
classified 
documentation 
relevant 
to 
the 
20 
investigations that you were involved in? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair it is paragraph 47 that the 
date we searched for appears and that is that on the 6 t h of September 
2011 the search and seizure warrants were duly authorised. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 86 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that date correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the date is correct but it’s 
not the same – I’m not talking about the search and seizure at the 
home of General Mdluli here, I’m talking about a different search and 
seizure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay will you get that corrected in a supplementary 
affidavit Miss September? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair, we’ll then actually need 
to find the correct date for the search and seizure.  This search and 
seizure then that was obtained on the 6 t h of September 2011, what did 
10 
it relate to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it related to the information 
that we received from members of Crime Intelligence, firstly, secondly it 
relates to the, let’s call it the Mdluli Barnard investigation the BMW 
investigation.  So we were looking for documentation either to prove or 
disprove whether these transactions took place and based on that we 
applied for the search and seizure warrant which was issued on the 6 t h 
of September 2011.  Unfortunately, or fortunately – I don’t know how 
you want to phrase that but I felt that at the time I cannot – it’s not 
good governance to serve a search and seizure warrant not only on 
20 
another department but on the same department that you are working 
for and I think the constitution also tries to avoid that kind of situation.  
So I then spoke to General Dramat but at that point in time we were – 
we didn’t get any cooperation so we were – our hands were forced to 
get search and seizure warrants.  At the time I asked General Dramat 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 87 of 150 
 
who was the – this is now September 2011 who was the head of the 
DPCI or the Hawks at the time…[intervenes]. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that is Anwa Dramat? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   General Anwa Dramat, I asked for 
his assistance because we were – in respect of the Crime and 
Intelligence investigation because I worked – we’re now working from 
Gauteng out of head office, I reported directly to General Dramat not to 
General Matekate anymore.  We then asked him, due to the sensitivity 
of the matter whether he will be able to intervene and speak to the 
heads of Crime Intelligence, those departments so that we can settle 
10 
how we’re going to get hold of the documentation that is needed for the 
criminal investigation.  On the 13 t h of September 2011 there was a 
meeting at Oliver Tambo International Airport and the meeting was 
attended by General Sibiya, General Godfrey Lebeya who is the current 
head of the DPCI Hawks, at the time he was the head of detective, if 
I’m not mistaken and therefore Crime Intelligence would have fallen 
under his command, we had General Major Vele Simon Matshatshe 
there, General Matshatshe was the acting head of Crime Intelligence at 
the time and Colonel Viljoen and myself.  Now during the meeting an 
agreement was reached between the various heads of those different 
20 
units within SAPS and it’s basically General Dramat and General 
Lebeya because they were the ultimate responsible persons for those 
units and an agreement was reached that a person from Crime 
Intelligence would be appointed to facilitate the process, in other words 
to make sure we work within the boundaries of the Act as well as 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 88 of 150 
 
making sure that we don’t compromise any current projects or agents or 
anything like that and in that regard Major General Hankel was 
appointed to assist us in that process.  Major General Hankel is from 
Crime Intelligence and he then, together with a Brigadier van Graan 
who was situated or who was from the National Legal Services from 
SAPS, they then assisted me with obtaining the documentation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So was the search and seizure 
warrant executed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The search and seizure warrant 
was never executed it was never necessary to execute the warrant 
10 
because we – there was an agreement reached between us and a 
voluntary participation and the process  took place because it’s exactly 
why I approached General Dramat to make sure that we don’t have to 
use – go to that extreme extent to get documents from another 
department within SAPS. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And through this facilitation process 
did you receive any documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair I received 
documents from General Hankel and as part of the information at we 
required were the information relating to agents – well seven agents 
20 
that was appointed within the programme, the Crime Intelligence, what I 
would call a 250 post, it was a recruitment by Crime Intelligence in that 
period to …[intervenes]. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What period sir? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   We’re talking about the period of 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 89 of 150 
 
2010, 2011 to attract people from outside to assist with – to strengthen 
Crime Intelligence with various skills either IT skills or whatever the 
case may be, so that was the reason behind the, what we call the 250 
recruitment process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This might be the right time to take the lunch 
adjournment, let’s continue after lunch we’ll resume at 2 o’ clock. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair to address your first query in 
relation to the terms of office of the Minister of Police and the National 
Commissioners of Police our investigator was kind enough to extract 
two pages of a presentation at the start of the stream which by your 
leave I ask that I could hand up? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then Chair in relation to the 
high court judgment which is the full Freedom under Law judgment 
20 
which is at Tab 8 under KK2.4 of that – of this bundle.  It was Justice 
Murphy who handed down the decision and essentially the decisions 
that were sought to be reviewed related to decisions concerning 
General Mdluli it – in particular then concerned the review and set a 
siding of those decisions.  In that regard the high court had set aside 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 90 of 150 
 
three decisions.  The first decision was the decision to withdraw… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The disciplinary proceedings. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The withdrawal of the disciplinary proceedings and 
his reinstatement.  And then the withdrawal of the criminal charges. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair and it is those 
particular criminal charges which are the fraud and corruption charges 
that this witness speaks to in relation to General Mdluli and Colonel 
Barnard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   There was also a decision taken to 
withdraw 17 criminal charges by Advocate Chauke but having said that 
the high court also granted an order which was an interdict to reinstate 
the criminal charges against General Mdluli and so to reinstate the 
disciplinary proceedings against General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In addition to ancillary orders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The Supreme Court of Appeal 
through Justice Brandt confirmed the setting aside of the decisions in 
20 
relation to the withdrawal of the corruption and fraud charges against 
General Mdluli so to the decision to withdraw the disciplinary 
proceedings against General Mdluli and so to the decision to reinstate 
Mdluli as the Head of Crime Intelligence.  So all those three were then 
set aside.  However the court was not prepared to confirm the orders 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 91 of 150 
 
which called for the reinstatement – sorry the court did not agree with 
the ordering of the interdicts to reinstate because it found that the 
interdicts were inappropriate transgressions of the separations of 
power doctrine.  It also went so far as to not agree with the setting 
aside of Advocate Chauke’s decision to withdraw those 17 criminal 
charges but what it did do is that it gave effect to the NDPP’s 
undertaking to decide which of those 17 charges which included murder 
and related crimes which were withdrawn are to be reinstituted and to 
make that decision known to Freedom under Law within two months of 
the order and to provide any reasons if it does not reinstitute any of 
10 
those charges.  In addition to ancillary orders Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we could then continue at page 19 
of this witness’s affidavit?  And that is bundle KK2.1 for the record.  Mr 
Roelofse what happened on the 18 t h October 2011?  I think your 
microphone is off. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair on that specific date I had 
an arrangement to see one Colonel Naidoo – DG Naidoo.  He worked at 
Crime Intelligence and from the documentations that I received from 
Crime Intelligence as part of the request for – for documents from them 
20 
I received seven files relating to the – relating to specific agents that 
were appointed within the 250 appointments which we referred to as the 
250 appointments.  In respect of those files I was able to establish that 
this Colonel Naidoo was the person that actually dealt with these 
individuals as well as do – did the administration surrounding their 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 92 of 150 
 
work at Crime Intelligence within the agent program.  So based on that 
I requested Colonel Naidoo to come and see me and I interviewed him.  
I also interviewed him regarding the trip to Singapore which I alluded to 
earlier and – and I confronted him with the documentation that I had in 
my possession.  Colonel Naidoo from – from my understanding…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo from my 
understanding and from what he has told me he reported – he worked 
for General Lazarus within the operational group which I have earlier 
[indistinct] and he reported directly to General Lazarus. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And how exactly would you describe 
the relationship as he described it to you between Colonel Naidoo and 
General Lazarus? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo described to me 
that he is – that he is friends with General Lazarus and that they are – 
that they are related in terms of family albeit not closely but they are 
related in terms of their family.  Family relationships.  So he knew him 
and he worked with him for at that point in time for quite some time. He 
was also – Colonel – General Lazarus was also instrumental in bringing 
him from Kwazulu Natal to Gauteng where he can work for him at the 
20 
Crime Intelligence office.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what transpired then at the 
interviews that you held with Colonel Naidoo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I interviewed him.  He was 
actually quite forthcoming in the – in the – on the 18 t h but I could also 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 93 of 150 
 
see that he was reluctant to fully disclose as to what his role was and 
where he was involved in.  I then said to him I concluded that interview 
for the interview for that day and I asked him to come back the next day 
which he did.  I then spoke to him on the 19 t h and … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the 19 t h of which month and 
year? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry 19 t h October in other words 
the next day, the 19 t h October 2011.  And he then decided – he made a 
decision to assist me with the investigation; Colonel Naidoo.  And as 
part of that he – he briefed me and he told me about allegations that 
10 
was – allegations in respect of the abuse of the Secret Service Account 
as well as his own role in the abuse of the fund.  He then – he – he 
then went on that according to me he went on that day – he went back 
to his office – this is now after he decided to assist me and his – and 
he alluded to certain things.  Obviously it was not an extensive list but 
he started to cooperate.  He then confided in – he confided in Colonel 
Barnard on that day which is the 19 t h according to me and… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that is the 19 t h October 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   19 t h October 2011 sorry – sorry 
Chair.  And on that same day he was fetched from his home by General 
20 
Laz – well not General Lazarus – this is now where I come to – come to 
mention the code names or the numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And it was – it was FM08 and 
FM09 that came to fetch him from his home. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 94 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  MF9? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   FM08 and FM09. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   They came to fetch from – at his 
– at his residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   They took him to the residence of 
General Lazarus; the private residence of General Lazarus and they 
wanted to know from him – they accused him that he – that they know 
for a fact that he is working with the DPCI.  And they wanted to know 
10 
from him what he told the DPCI meaning now me.  An additional 
individual in – also came there which I marked as FM10 – 10,10 and 
they – he joined them at General Lazarus’ home.  Colonel Naidoo 
according to him he denied the allegation that he was working with the 
DPCI because he thought that will be prudent at the time that he did 
not know what they want to do with him so he denied that he was 
working with us.  It was during that conversation that – that FM10 also 
told him that the Hawks informed him – and I do not know who these 
Hawks are that Colonel Naidoo admitted to certain things and it is now 
on the side of the DPCI.  Colonel Naidoo told me that he again denied 
20 
the allegations and there was – and he was able to deflect the 
suspicion regarding their accusations.  He then states to me that the 
conversation then turned to general topics and at some stage they talk 
about a company called Westville Travel and air tickets that were 
purchased through that company.  FM08 then says that according to 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 95 of 150 
 
Naidoo that Hankel requested certain documentation from him 
regarding the air tickets.  FM10 and FM – FM 10 told then according to 
Naidoo FM08 that he must try and destroy the records pertaining to the 
air tickets.  On the 20 t h October 2011 that during the discussion on the 
19 t h he was – on the 19 t h at General Lazarus’ home that he – that he 
heard them discussing a placement of a newspaper article in the – 
relating to General Dramat and General Sibiya and it is an article 
regarding – regarding the rendition matter that General Dramat was 
later accused of.  He said that General Lazarus wanted to use 
[indistinct] within the media to write a story in order to take the focus 
10 
away from them.  This according to Colonel Naidoo is a strategy 
employed to cast suspicion on those perceived to be threat.  General 
Lazarus reviewed Dramat – General Dramat as the Head of the DPCI as 
the force behind the investigation into Crime Intelligence.  I was then – 
I informed General Dramat at the time of what was told to me and then 
a newspaper article appeared on the 23 r d October 2011 in the Sunday 
Times.  General – General Mdluli in terms of his representation and I 
am jumping a little bit here – he made a representation to the NPA with 
regards to his prosecution.  Part of that representation indicated that 
there is a conspiracy against him and that – and – and they used that 
20 
according to Naidoo to – to cast suspicion on General Dramat and the 
investigating team.  So these newspaper articles the information is 
leaked to cast suspicion on individual that wants to do their work.  I – 
as I said on the 23 r d October 2011 this newspaper article surfaced in 
the Sunday Times.  I was not aware that the newspaper article will be 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 96 of 150 
 
published in the Sunday Times.  That was not said, he did not know 
that.  He just said a newspaper article will be published.  And then I – 
later on I became aware that the Sunday Times published an article on 
the 13 t h October – ah no – at a later stage I became aware the Sunday 
Times published a further article or must I – I rephrase that – an initial 
article on the 13 t h October which I did not know about at the time 
continuing to implicate General Dramat in the rendition scandal see an 
– and I have got that as Annexure KDR4 to my statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September.  The witness wants to – wants 
guidance from you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Humble apologies Chair I was just 
[indistinct] into the record. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I just need to know whether I 
should go to KDR4 the annexure to this – to paragraph 59.1. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In fact since you are on that page.  
The information and intelligence that you then received through Colonel 
Naidoo is it correct then that such intelligence proved true through the 
publications in the newspaper which you are wanting to refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  The 
information that he provided to me indicated about the rendition article 
20 
implicating General Sibiya and General Dramat and that is what I then 
subsequently found in the article of – dated the 23 r d October 2011. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And can I ask you then to turn to 
page 104 of the same bundle please?   And on the left hand side you 
have a title called Hawks and SA Police Arresting Suspects and sending 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 97 of 150 
 
them over the border to be murdered.  Is that the article that you were 
referring to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is the article I am referring 
to.  Which I took to be the article that Colonel Naidoo was referring to. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And Chair the same article has been 
typed up in a bit more of legible terms on page 105 to 106. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct then that there was a 
further article that was published on the 13 t h October 2012 along the 
same line? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja it was not a further article I 
presumed that was the first article, this is the further article.  The one 
on the 23 r d. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Oops humble apology I am getting 
my dates confused.  If we could turn to then page 108.  And again on 
the far left hand side you have an article titled Dramat to be 
interrogated over claims that he facilitated illegal deportation of men 
who were tortured and killed and Zimbabwe headed up by the bigger 
heading of Hawks Boss fingered in rendition scandal.  Is that the article 
that you referred to? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is the article that I referred 
to and which I subsequent to Naidoo informing me about the 23 r d 
October 2011 article which I then went back and I saw this article which 
– which was published on the – on the 13 t h October 2013. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And Chair once again as with the 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 98 of 150 
 
previous article this is too been typed up in a more legible format on 
page 109 and 110.  What then happened on the 21 s t October 2011 Mr 
Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   On the 21 s t October I was – I was 
called by Colonel Naidoo he was quite upset at the time and I then went 
to see him.  During our discussion there he said he was again fetched 
from his home that morning and taken to the Crime Intelligence offices 
where Barnard, FM07 and FM10 were present and he felt unsafe.  That 
same evening I placed Colonel Naidoo together with his family in the 
witness protection program to alleviate his – his concern regarding his 
10 
safety.  And that was now the 2 n d or 3 r d attempt of intimidating Colonel 
Naidoo at that point in time.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph 61 you talk to the 
authority of Lazarus to release funds from the Secret Services Account 
and his relationship or alleged relationship rather with reporters and 
lawyers.  Can you please amplify on that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I can only state here and as 
I stated in this affidavit – in this paragraph I can state what – what 
Colonel Naidoo has told me and then subsequent what I found 
afterwards.  Now Colonel Naidoo has informed me that General Lazarus 
20 
had the authority to release funds from the SSA which is a fact.  He has 
that – he has that authority.  He was able to control funds being paid to 
sources and contact persons which is also correct.  He then states that 
reporters are used to publish and withhold articles to drive a certain 
narrative.  According to Colonel Naidoo these reporters are paid from 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 99 of 150 
 
the Secret Services Account.  I am also aware that General Lazarus 
used funds from the Secret Services Account to directly appoint 
defence lawyers to represent him after the search warrants were issued 
in respect of the two CI officers and I refer to the date of the 6 t h 
September 2011 which were eventually not executed by agreement. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   How do you know this about the use 
of funds from the Secret Services Account to appoint defence lawyers? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair at the time I sat in the car.  
The call came through to Colonel Viljoen and we were on our way to a 
meeting as I alluded earlier at Oliver Tambo with General Lebeya and 
10 
General Dramat and General Sibeya.  And there was an instruction or 
there was a communication from the defence lawyer who spoke on the 
phone and I heard the conversation it was on loudspeaker.  That he 
said he was appointed by Crime Intelligence to – to represent them in 
terms of the search and seizure warrants that were issued.  And I did 
not – I did not take any notice of the call I said we are not – we will not 
be – we will not be talking to them.  Because that was not the – that 
was not the proper procedure that – that was followed.  He ought to 
have gone to the SAPS – SAPS legal services to appoint lawyers 
through the State’s Attorney’s office and not directly approach us.  That 
20 
is the proper way of dealing with – with that kind of representation.  In 
my view there was no legal basis to challenge those warrants and I am 
of the opinion that the payment for – for these legal representatives 
came from the Secret Services Account. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it your opinion or is it fact? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 100 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   From – I have – I had – I thought 
about this again after – after – after making the affidavit. I cannot state 
it as a fact.  I know what he said.  He said that he is representing the 
Crime Intelligence.  I took that as a fact that Crime Intelligence is 
paying him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so whilst it may be that you are 
aware that there were certain defence lawyers that were involved in the 
issue relating to the search warrants you do not know for a fact that 
state funds through the Secret Services Account was used to pay those 
lawyers? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No I am not and I based my 
opinion on the – on the conversation that I heard on the telephone – on 
the telephonic call. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph 62 of your affidavit you 
talk about certain communications with the Chairperson of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Intelligence, Mr Cecil Burgess. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can you please elaborate on this 
further and how you came to learn of this information? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This information came via 
20 
General Hankel who was appointed as the let us call him the liaison 
officer between myself and Crime Intelligence.  He said to me that 
General Lazarus approached – approached the Chairperson of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Intelligence Mr Cecil Burgess on various 
occasions without notifying the acting divisional commissioner who was 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 101 of 150 
 
General Matshatshe at the time.  General Lazarus was apparently 
according to General Hankel trying to convince Mr Burgess that the 
investigation that we are conducting are compromising national 
security.  A letter from Mr Burgess stating that General Hankel must be 
removed from the investigation was sent to the acting divisional 
commissioner of CI which was General Matshatshe and I have had sight 
of that letter.  In fact there was more than one letter requesting 
General Matshatshe to take – remove General Hankel from – from 
assisting us. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was General Hankel’s continuation 
10 
in the matter affected at all? 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  I asked that they switch off the air 
conditioner because I have a little bit of flu but I want to check I do not 
want to punish people in case it is too hot already.  Are people feeling 
that the – they should – they should switch it on?  Okay I get an 
indication that it is manageable.  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What happen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  What happened 
with General Hankel’s involvement in the investigation or continued 
20 
involvement with the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   His continued involvement was 
terminated.  He was not allowed to – to assist me any further and he 
was transferred out of Crime Intelligence together with General 
Sinthumile and General Matshatshe at the time. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 102 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then what was the consequence 
of General Hankel’s removal from the investigation to your – the 
investigations that you were conducting?  How did it impact your 
investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I received documentation 
through General Hankel on request as part of the agreement that was 
set down in August.  With his removal I did not receive any further 
documentation from Crime Intelligence.  I did not receive any further 
assistance from Crime Intelligence in respect of the investigation.  It 
stopped there. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Is it correct that you together with Colonel Viljoen 
obtained additional search and seizure warrants? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in relation to which matters or 
investigations rather did you obtain these search and seizure warrants? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as any – as – when you 
continue with an investigation if you cannot get your documentation 
from that source you – you go then to – to try to take the – another 
route.  We knew that an instance or certain instances that they made 
use of private companies.  They cannot – those companies cannot use 
20 
the excuse of classified documentation because the documents are not 
classified.  So we – we applied for search and seizure warrants on 
some of those companies.  One of them would have – is a company – 
well as part of that application for the search and seizure I also applied 
for access to IT equipment, computers, hard drives, etcetera.  Now at 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 103 of 150 
 
the time the – unit that dealt with – with that investigation or the unit 
that I would approach to assist me to – to – to seize those kind of 
equipment from a crime scene was based within Crime Intelligence and 
they work under the direct command of General Lazarus.  And we – I 
found is that as part of the procedure that was followed within Crime 
Intelligence that commander of that unit which is called the Technical 
Support Unit had to inform General Lazarus of each and every – as part 
of his normal course of duties of each and every search and seizure 
that they are going to take part in.  So I found myself in a position 
where the very person that I am investigating is now being reported to 
10 
in terms of a search and seizure that I want to go and do in terms of 
people that has been implicated with him in wrongdoing.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then take you to para - tab 
five - Annexure 5 which starts at page 1-1-3 of your bundle.  Please 
identify this document. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I - I drew up this document 
in the period between February and March - beginning of March 20 - 
2012.  This document was borne out of the fact that I - at that time I 
was quite despondent.  I did not know what was going on.  I could not - 
the matters were withdrawn in the - in the High Court as well as the 
20 
Regional Court. 
The reasons did not make sense to me and it seems to me 
that or it seemed to me at the time that we are not fighting necessarily 
the individuals that is involved in the criminality but officials within - 
within Government or within the NPA and SAPS to get these people to 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 104 of 150 
 
book and that is - that is one of the reasons why I drew up this - this 
report and as part of the report I then listed certain incidents as to 
what we tried to do to make sure that this matter stays on the court roll 
and to get it back onto the court roll. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if we can then pause here.  It is 
correct that you were brought on board to lead up the investigation into 
what you call the Vosloorus matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is also then correct that 
through your investigations in the Vosloorus matter you had discovered 
10 
additional information which related to the Secret Service Account and 
in particular the looting of the Secret Service Account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And you obtained this information 
through several members that you interviewed some of which you 
obtained affidavits.  Others of which you just interviewed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair of which the 
most important would then be at the end of the day Colonel Naidoo 
which I interviewed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the information that you then 
20 
received from Colonel Naidoo did that information lead to various 
investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  That - that 
triggered various investigations relating to the information that he has - 
that he had provided to me at the time. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 105 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to 
EXHIBIT KK2.3 which is the diagrams bundle page 2? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Diagram 2? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The - the diagrams bundle, yes.  
Page 2. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Page 2 or diagram 2? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Page 2 or diagram 2. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Diagram 2, sorry.  Can we project it 
please?  Okay.  Is this a fair representation of the investigations that 
10 
you have been involved in and led? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is.  Yes, yes Chair.  It is a fair 
representation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct then that through the 
evidence that you have given to this Commission your entry 
investigation into the Secret Service Account was the Mdluli/Vosloorus 
case?  As you have termed it to be. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And out of your investigations in that 
matter at least 11 investigations have ensued? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Are these the investigations that you 
will now specifically talk to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who has been the main source of 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 106 of 150 
 
information for these investigations that you have led? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That would be Colonel Naidoo 
together with our independent investigations into Atlantis Motors. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If we can then turn to - turn 
back to page 22.  Having looked at that diagram now which lists 11 
investigations is that an exhaustive list of all the investigations that 
arose out of the information you obtained from Colonel Naidoo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair it is not - it is not an 
exhaustive list.  I deal with these because I have - I was able to 
corroborate either fully or to a - to a certain extent what 
10 
Colonel Naidoo has said to me in terms of these investigations.  There 
are others - other investigations which I could not conduct. 
I never received the documentation which I - documentation 
which 
I 
requested 
from 
Crime 
Intelligence 
to 
finalise 
those 
investigations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  On page 23 paragraph 66 you 
talk specifically to an engagement that you had with General Mothiba 
during late 2011 or early 2011.  Can you please elaborate on that to the 
Chair and how it came about that you had this engagement? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair right from the start when I - 
20 
when I just - after I spoke to - to Colonel Naidoo I involved - involved 
General Hankel in my discussions because I did not want to be seen as 
- as irresponsible when working with this kind - in this environment.  So 
General Hankel was aware of what Naidoo said.  He was present during 
one - during some of these - these briefings that we had. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 107 of 150 
 
As part of that General - General Hankel also reported back 
through his structures and I reported back through my structures 
through General Dramat as to what we have uncovered and then based 
on that I was approached by - by Brigadier De Villiers Odendaal who 
works for the Legal Services Department at - at the National Office for 
SAPS. 
He then introduced me to General Mothiba who was at the 
time the Head of Detectives and he then said to me that they want to 
come and see me so that I can brief them in terms of what we have 
uncovered.  They came - they flew down to Cape Town and they - and I 
10 
went to see them and I informed them about the information that I 
received from - from Colonel Naidoo and - and the information that I 
received from Colonel Naidoo mainly - mainly concerns the Provinces 
of KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Western Cape. 
A decision was taken that the (indistinct) investigation into 
those allegations would be dealt with by General Mothiba and hence 
the reason why he came to see me in order to inform and brief - debrief 
him on in terms of what was said to me and I was then later informed 
that 
Brigadier Simon Madonsela 
and 
Captain Ramesh Hiralel 
were 
appointed to do the - to conduct a disciplinary and criminal 
20 
investigations which relate to KwaZulu-Natal and that was - I asked for 
that because I was not in a position to go to KwaZulu-Natal also and 
investigate there when I am busy in Gauteng.  So that is how that came 
about and why General Mothiba came to see me. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
so 
then 
it 
was 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 108 of 150 
 
Brigadier Simon Madonsela and Captain Ramesh Hiralel whose focus 
area was to address matters within the KwaZulu-Natal Region? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct together with the - 
the disciplinary matters that was supposed to be instituted. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that just to make sure I 
understand.  When we are talking about matters within KwaZulu-Natal 
we are talking about as you have mentioned the disciplinary matters 
that were within that region.  In addition to any investigations relating 
to the Secret Service Account arising out of that region. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chairperson.  It - it 
10 
arose from the information given to me by - by Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Can 
we 
now 
address 
the 
investigations one by one?  The first one being as you have termed it: 
“One 
Stop 
Travel 
and 
Tours 
Durban 
Flight 
Arrangements between late 2009 to October 2011.” 
What is important is for us as the Commission to understand 
what 
you 
did 
with 
the 
information 
that 
you 
received 
from 
Colonel Naidoo and what the outcome was of the specific investigation 
that you led in relation to each matter and with that in mind can I ask 
you to please clarify to the Chair as to what Colonel Naidoo told you in 
20 
relation to this investigation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I will do so Chair.  When it comes 
to the first part of this narrative or of my affidavit it basically relates to 
what Naidoo - Colonel Naidoo has told me.  What he has informed me 
is that on several occasions he had to arrange for General Mdluli and 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 109 of 150 
 
his wife Ms Lyons and two children to fly up to - to Johannesburg and 
back to Cape Town and these visits were private in nature and they 
were paid for by the Secret Service Account. 
The Secret Service - Secret Service Account maybe utilised 
to pay air tickets in as far as it is for agents and informers on official 
Crime Intelligence business but not for private matters.  Flights for 
General Mdluli were also paid out of the Secret Service Account and 
these flights were also private in nature according to Colonel Naidoo. 
General Mdluli was not allowed to - was not allowed to travel 
utilising SSA funds as his flight should have been financed through the 
10 
S - South African Police Service open budget. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On that - on that point you say it 
ought to have been financed through the SAPS open budget but you 
also say that it needed to have only been for official business. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  There is - there is a … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Under - under what circumstances 
can Secret Service Account funds be used to fund air travel for its 
members? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please clarify. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair for instance if an agent has 
- has to - the agent is based in Cape Town.  He has to come up to 
Johannesburg to attend a meeting with - with a source of his or to 
attend a meeting with a crime grouping or whatever the case maybe.  
That is - that is official in nature.  This - he will get - funds will be 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 110 of 150 
 
withdrawn from the Secret Service Account and an air ticket will be 
bought. 
He would fly down.  He will go back up - back down to Cape 
Town and that cost is borne by the Secret Service Account.  It also 
follows that you will find that there is a memo with the information after 
such a trip stating what had happened and what the information was 
that was retrieved during that - during that engagement.  So in that - in 
that instance it has happened before and it will happen again because 
there is nothing wrong with that but it is not there for the utilisation of 
private trips. 
10 
When it comes to General Mdluli as the Head of Crime 
Intelligence he is not a - he is a public figure.  He is not an agent and 
as such he must make use of the open account.  He cannot fly to 
Durban and state that it is for a - it is for - it is a covert operation 
because he is a public figure.  He is not. 
So it would not - it would not assist him that - that he flies 
with - on the Secret Service Account.  With that I am not saying he 
cannot.  I am just saying it is - it is not the norm and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not advisable?  It is not advisable? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Not advisable.  Yes, yes Chair … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because he has got other means 
to pay for that - for that official trip. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were there any other individuals who 
benefitted from air travel according to Colonel Naidoo? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 111 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
According 
Colonel Naidoo 
General Lazarus benefitted from - from the air travel.  Then a pastor 
from the - from the African Dream Centre. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I just correct that?  We have 
been informed that it is not the African Dream Centre but the African 
Dream Family Church.  Please continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about is that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is the last line on page 23 in 
paragraph 68.  The Commission is … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what is the correct name. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The Commission received a letter 
from them which informed that it is African Dream Family Church and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Not African Dream Centre. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So get that corrected in the supplementary. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you know anything about African 
Dream Family Church? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I do know that General Lazarus is 
a - he is a member of that specific church. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But once again this is information 
that you received from Colonel Naidoo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes.  I received that information 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 112 of 150 
 
from him and I was able to confirm it at a later stage. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was the process that you 
understood in how flight to accommodation bookings were made? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair according to Colonel Naidoo 
he would in respect of the bookings that he made when he dealt with 
family members of General Mdluli he would phone the consultant at a - 
let us call it the satellite office of One Stop Travel and Tours which is 
called Westville Travel.  He would speak to one Mahesh Parekh. 
Mr Parekh would - would then make a booking on his behalf 
in respect of the individual that wants to fly.  He would make that 
10 
booking through the parent company which is One Stop Travel and 
Tours.  The booking would be made.  The - the ticket will be bought and 
an invoice would be sent to Westville Travel.  Westville Travel and 
there on via Mr Parekh would then create his own invoice which he 
would then forward to Company X. 
Company X would then pay One Stop Travel and Tours into 
their account.  The - what we have - when we found the - the various 
invoices we were able to establish that there was a lot of large over 
invoicing of Company X as part of this whole process to create a credit 
on the company account within the books of One Stop Travel and Tours. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So having received this information 
from Colonel Naidoo what was the outcome of your investigations into 
such information? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Based on his information we - we 
again applied for a search and seizure warrant which was - which was 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 113 of 150 
 
given to us.  I also received remittance and licence - remittance 
advises from General Hankel relating to payment from Company X to 
One Stop Travel and Tours and - and according to the general ledger 
account from Company X more than a million Rand has been paid to 
One Stop Travel and Tours since - as from March 2010 up until the date 
that we did the search and seizure which was in - I think 1 November or 
very - on the 25 t h - the 21 s t - 25 November 20 - ag not November, 
October 2011. 
So during that year and six months more than a million Rand 
has been paid to One Stop Travel and Tours in terms of air tickets. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But were you able to establish 
whether or not all of that funding was part of a scheme which ought not 
to have taken place? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair I was.  In between we 
did find that agents did actually travel and - but the majority of the 
funding did not go - was not used by agents in the official capacity or I 
would assume that when an agent flies it will be within his official 
capacity. 
So I did not take that any further but we are talking about 
family members and - and friends that - that made use of this account 
20 
to fly.  In fact Mr Parekh also saw it fit to fly his own family and friends 
to various parts of the country paid for by the Secret Service Account. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
So 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
your 
investigation was sourced from remittance advises that you received 
from General Hankel? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 114 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the other hand you also obtained 
a search and seizure warrant on 25 October 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair and - and 
based on - and - and during that search and seizure we were able to - 
to seize the documents relating to the account with the invoices and - 
and so forth from Westville Travel as well as One Stop Travel and 
Tours. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please give a little bit more detail in 
relation to what happened on the execution of such search and seizure 
10 
warrant obtained on 25 October 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair when - when I arrived there 
and General Hankel was with me and a few other members.  Mr Parekh 
was waiting for me in - in the office and next to him was a bundle of 
documents and he said to me that he was told to prepare these 
documents for me.  Now we did not tell anyone that we are coming 
through or that we are planning to search this - this specific premises. 
He had copy for himself and copy for me available and I - I 
then asked him you know who informed him that I was going to search 
the premises and his answer to me was FM08 had informed him.  At a 
20 
later stage I obtained an affidavit from Mr Parekh.  He says that and I 
am quoting from his affidavit: 
“Between the 19 t h and 20 October 2011 I received a 
call from FM08.  He told me that personnel from 
Johannesburg or Pretoria would be coming down to 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 115 of 150 
 
Durban to pick up the invoices from Company X and 
keep them - and keep them ready.  He also told me 
to add the name of the travellers to the invoices 
before I print it.  I had to give these invoices to the 
personnel from Johannesburg or Pretoria.  FM08 
also requested me not to reflect the names of the 
following passengers on the invoices.” 
And 
in 
that 
sense 
he 
reflects 
then 
to 
FM01 
Sentimule (?) Mashulu (?), Gavin Lazarus, Sandra Lazarus.  He then 
states further he did not get round to doing that and in - in other words 
10 
he did not - he did not take it - he did not take it out from the invoices. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was your assessment after 
reconciling the documents you received through the search and seizure 
warrant with the documentation or remittance advises that you received 
from General Hankel? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Financially it is the following:  I 
was able to establish that cheque payments from Company X to One 
Stop Travel and Tours between April 2010 and 25 October amounted to 
R1 168 500,31 million - R1 168 500,31.  That was as per their 
worksheet and then I was able to establish that in terms of 
20 
General Mdluli, General Lazarus and Mr Marimuthu regarding services 
rendered for their air travel. 
General Mdluli and his family it was R306 909,00 - R919,00.  
General Lazarus and his family was R160 124,00 and Mr Marimuthu 
was R215 131,00.  That is a total of R682 174,00 which is more than 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 116 of 150 
 
half the total amount that was paid to - paid from - from Company X. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 And 
that 
was 
for 
the 
period 
April 2010 to 25 October 2011? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Was there anything else that you 
established through that reconciliation process relating to identities of 
passengers? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  I was able to establish 
that on at least one occasion the children of General Mdluli did actually 
fly.  The actual passengers was the children and then looking at the 
10 
documentation from Crime Intelligence which I received the remittance 
advises and the invoices that were submitted to them. 
Attached to that bundle of documents there is a key which I 
call key.  The key would then - would be filled in by FM08.  The key 
would inform the Auditor-General that a specific invoice which is 
nameless in terms of a passenger was actually used for that agent or 
that agent and giving the agent number. 
Now in respect of the children the - the misrepresentation 
that was made to the employer is the fact that the children flew as - as 
agents.  As if they were agents.  It was claimed as if it was agents that 
20 
flew. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were you able to establish who 
authorised payments for these - air travel? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair we were not able to get all 
the documentation because we were in the middle of getting that 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 117 of 150 
 
documentation when my - when General Hankel was transferred.  So I 
did not receive everything but the ones I do have was signed by - by 
General Lazarus … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were …? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  As the CFO of the SSA Fund. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were there any other police officials 
who benefitted from air travel through this particular organisation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  In this regard 
General Sentimule and her husband benefitted through that as well as 
General Muchachi (?) benefitted through that.  However there is a - an 
10 
explanation given to them.  They testified subsequently in the 
disciplinary hearing of Mr Lazarus and they explained what had 
happened there which I will inform the - the Commission later - 
Commission later. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please do so now. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay.  According to both General 
Sentimule as well as General Muchachi they received calls from 
Mr Marimuthu inviting them to come and visit or attend church in 
KwaZulu-Natal.  It happened on more than one occasion and in terms of 
General Sentimule she went there with her husband on more than 
20 
occasion and General Muchachi I think once with his family. 
His wife and kid and they were under the impression and that 
impression according to him was - was given to them by Mr Marimuthu 
that the church are paying for these expenses and when they - when 
they do go over it will be - do go to Durban it will be on the expense of 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 118 of 150 
 
- on the account of the church and General Lazarus did not inform them 
that actually the - that actually that - that the Secret Service Account 
paid for those actual trips. 
So they were as I explained earlier they were placed in a 
position where these things could be used against them at a later stage 
without their knowledge. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
You 
mentioned 
earlier 
that 
General Mdluli for the period of April 2010 to 25 October 2011 
benefitted in the sum of R306 919,00 and that is not only for 
General Mdluli but his family too which amounted … 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To more than half of the total budget 
for that period? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  If you - if 
you add all three of them together. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did General Mdluli have access …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is it - is it more than half? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja.  It is more than half Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is more than half. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you talking about the figures on page 26? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Oops sorry.  Sorry.  My mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I ahead of you? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No, no.  No, no.  In fact Chair you 
are in fact correct. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 119 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The total amount of 600 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  306 - R306 000,00 are you saying is about 50 percent 
of 682? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No.  In fact Chair.  I made the - I 
made the mistake and thank you for correcting me.  It is actually the 
totally amount of 682 which is in excess of half of the total amount.  So 
I retract.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just repeat that.  I just want to make sure I … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not misunderstand what you are saying. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I retract that statement and my - 
what I would like to confirm is that General Mdluli and his family 
benefitted to the value of R306 919,00? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so my question to you which is 
now hopefully correctly stated is did General Mdluli also have access to 
any other funds for travel arrangements? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  As stated in 
my affidavit.  He also made use of the normal SAPS budget.  In other 
20 
words the open account for travelling arrangements for official - official 
travel and he paid - in this regard more than R700 000,00 was paid 
towards his air travel during the period July 2009 to March 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the travel that he paid for under the open 
account do you know whether those were all legitimate official travels? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 120 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In respect of the open account? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I can only - I can only deal 
with what is on face value in terms of the documentation presented to 
me from - from Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It appeared to be? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes and it - and it looks as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looks? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was official travel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In terms of the open account.  Yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so would one be able to say for official 
travelling he used the open account and then for travelling that was not 
authorised or was not lawful then he used the other one or it is difficult 
to say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as I said I mean it is - it is 
not normal procedure to use this account for your own travelling 
especially the position that he held - he holds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  What I can say is that - ja, when I 
talk about the family it does not only include his kids.  It also includes 
his ex-wife together with his brother and his sister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
So 
it 
is 
- 
under 
those 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 121 of 150 
 
circumstances … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could that be - could that be - could that have been 
lawful? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  It cannot be lawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could not have been lawful? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  They are not police officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Not all of them.  I am talking about 
the children and I think the brother.  They are not police officials … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and … 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of the regulations or policies or 
conditions under which that account could be used is it contemplated 
that it could be used for family members? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  It is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is for a specific purpose? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is for specific purposes only.  
Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is - that is really for - for agents whose 
identify must not be known publically? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  Agents or 
informants for that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja.  That is - that is why you say it could not 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 122 of 150 
 
be him because he was public. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is what I am saying.  
Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Did 
your 
investigations 
reveal 
anything in relation to the African Dream Family Church and the 
allegations of Colonel Naidoo that certain pastors had benefitted from 
flights and accommodation paid for by the Secret Services Account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  I was - I do not 
mention the names here but I was - in terms of the actual passengers I 
10 
was privy to the names and there were quite a few pastors and clergy 
that flew on that account or that flew and which - which expenses were 
paid for from the SSA account and it - it normally follows with 
Mr Lazarus going from - Mr Lazarus going from either Durban back to 
Jo’burg - Johannesburg or coming back. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Was any disciplinary action taken 
against General Lazarus in relation to these allegations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  In respect of this 
specific allegation there were and he was as far - he was found guilty 
of misconduct in respect of General Sentimule and General Muchachi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may request … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is happening? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  May I request your indulgence and 
request a five minute adjournment? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 123 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In order to address certain matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  We will adjourn for five minutes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes proceed please.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We are indebted to you for the 
10 
indulgence Chair.  Mr Roelofse the next investigation that you talk to is 
at page 26 of your affidavit and it is titled Joe Mark New World Notice 
Procurement of Vehicles.  Before you get into the detail of this 
particular investigation do you know what the procurement process is to 
acquire vehicles within Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson it is essentially the 
same as each, as a normal procurement within the open account, with 
the difference that they can source specific vehicles, for specific 
requirements, so it is, there must be the, there must be a proper 
motivation for the purchase of a vehicle and based on that motivation 
20 
and the use of that vehicle then the vehicle can be purchased.  The 
difference is that do not necessarily, they don’t go out on tender 
because they buy a vehicle on, they buy vehicles basically on a – as 
the need arises they would buy a vehicle for a specific purpose, but 
they also do buy bulk in a sense that they would estimate that they 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 124 of 150 
 
would need say 15 or 20 vehicles for that specific year for their 
members and that can also happen. 
 
So it is a process that they follow with the proper paperwork 
that needs to be in place for that acquisition to take place.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Which department within Crime 
Intelligence would be tasked with the procurement of motor vehicles? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That will be the SSA account or 
the unit within the SSA, the Secret Services Account, which fall directly 
under General Lazarus. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in particular to what extent 
10 
would Supply Chain Management be involved in this process? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Crime Intelligence their – they 
have a unit within the Secret Services Account which is involved in the 
supply chain management process of acquiring these vehicles of which 
Colonel Barnard plays an integral role. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is there a particular register that is 
kept in relation to vehicles purchased by Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair when – it works like any 
asset register, for any State Department, they just call it the Secret 
Register if I am not mistaken, they use the abbreviation SR, so you 
20 
would have a SR vehicle, SR furniture, those – all those items would 
get a number, SR50, SR51 whatever the case may be and that is 
attached to that specific vehicle as proof of purchase and to account 
for the actual vehicle, or the actual acquisition. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was this particular investigation 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 125 of 150 
 
initiated through information that you obtained through Colonel Naidoo 
or was it initiated in a different way? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair this specific investigation 
was initiated by going through the actual documents which we received 
from Crime Intelligence, now right in the beginning it is part of our 
agreement and in some of the files we discovered the name New World 
Motors and we could ascertain from those files that New World Motors 
were involved in the reparation of vehicles and the servicing of SI 
vehicles, so based on that we then continued with the investigation 
regarding them.  We were able to establish that, and this is what 
10 
piqued our interest is the fact that one vehicle would have a 
windscreen replacement three, four, five times in a very short period of 
time which didn’t make sense to us.  Based on that I asked my 
members, who assisted me at the time, to go to New World Motors, not 
as police members but as a member of the public, and ask whether they 
can – whether they provide the service of replacing wind screens.  They 
came back to me, and reported back to me that they don’t, so that 
piqued our interest in New World Motors. 
 
Colonel Naidoo amplified the information at a later stage when 
he spoke to me.   
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In relation to the inspection that was 
conducted if I ask you to turn to page 28, paragraph 83.4, you talk 
specifically to the date of 23 September 2011, is that the date on which 
your team went to visit the premises? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, that’s the 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 126 of 150 
 
date when I asked them to go and do that investigations for me, 
conduct that investigation for me. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then what happened shortly 
after that day? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I requested, because of what we 
found and because of what my members has told me I then requested 
General Hankel that I want to see the financial statements relating to 
the total trade between company X and New World Motors, similar to 
the one I requested for one stop travel and tours or wasteful travel.   I 
wanted, as I said I wanted to establish the trade between the two 
10 
companies and that would have been for me it would have indicated as 
to whether or not to pursue that line of inquiry. 
 
General Hankel informed me on the following day that he had 
spoken to General Lazarus regarding my request and that General 
Lazarus informed him that I am not entitled to information relating to 
New World Motors due to national security issues.   
 
This incident clearly indicated to me the ridiculous position 
that I found myself in, in that I had to enquire from the suspect, in this 
case General Lazarus, whether or not I could get access to 
documentation needed to either prove or disprove his or others 
20 
involvement in this allegation, so – and the mere fact that he used the 
term national security issues was actually a red flag to me, saying that 
we are on the right track, we are looking at something that is bothering 
him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then if you go to paragraph 82 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 127 of 150 
 
you talk about certain information that Colonel Naidoo provided you 
with in relation to this investigation.  Can you please inform the Chair 
of the information that Colonel Naidoo provided you with? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo informed me of 
the closed tender process.  As part of the Crime Intelligence had to sell 
their vehicles at some stage when it gets boarded, and they used the 
closed tender process for security reasons, purposes, there is nothing 
wrong with that in terms of that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so a closed tender process is 
the normal course of business? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   With respect to the SR vehicles at 
the time, in other words the Secret Services account vehicles, because 
you could use the details of that vehicle to trace back who the owner 
was, so that is why it was sold through a closed tender process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, please just explain that again, why should 
there be secrecy about selling cars that the Crime Intelligence doesn’t 
need anymore? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if you look on the – when 
you do a trace on a vehicle it would provide you with all the previous 
owners of that vehicle, so that is what they want to mitigate, the fact 
20 
that you are – that you would see the previous owners, because the 
previous owner is either a member of Crime Intelligence or an agent, 
because the vehicle was registered in that person’s name or it is a front 
company, it was registered in the name of a front company, and that is 
what you want to, you wanted to mitigate that risk for those members 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 128 of 150 
 
and companies not to be identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well would they normally be registered under the 
name of somebody like an informer, an agent? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson yes it happens, in 
fact that’s the norm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it is registered in the name of SAPS or Crime 
Intelligence then there should be  no need for secrecy or should there 
be? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja if it is registered in the name 
of SAPS or – but it cannot be registered in the name of Crime 
10 
Intelligence because you want to keep the identify, you want to keep 
any association, you want to remove any association with the police 
service, you want to avoid that at all costs, because you don’t want the 
agent to be associated with the police service, that could compromise 
him in his work, in the project or whatever he needs to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if whoever tries to trace it won’t get to know an 
agent who was using it or if it wasn’t registered in the name of an 
agent, it was simply registered in the name of SAPS or Crime 
Intelligence, that alone should not be a problem isn’t it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously Crime Intelligence has got vehicles? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes they do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and everybody would expect them to have some 
vehicles in their name. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I actually, what I am explaining is 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 129 of 150 
 
what was explained to me, and the reasons given as to why it is done in 
that specific way.   I understand the issue regarding taking care of 
people’s – of people ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agents ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The agents and their safety, I 
understand that, but as you pointed out it could have been just 
reregistered to SAPS and then sold, that could have happened, but 
that’s not what they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that’s why I was asking because I wanted to see 
whether what room there is of abuse in the system when there is 
10 
actually a way which would not reveal the identity of any agent that 
could be used. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In as far Chair, in as far as I 
know this system that I am talking about now has been changed 
because of the abuse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So that has been changed, that is 
what was, I was informed of that, whether that happened or not that I 
cannot tell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay, okay.  Now the one that is used now 
20 
is it more transparent? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   From what I understand Chair it is 
more transparent yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct then that the system that 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 130 of 150 
 
you are referring to now is the one that was explained to you by 
Colonel Naidoo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo at the time when I 
interviewed him yes, that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And when is this that you 
interviewed him?   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That was over the course of many 
months, but the first interview started in October, I think it was as I 
testified the 18 t h of October 2011. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So this is certainly about eight years 
10 
ago?  
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay, please proceed to explain 
what Colonel Naidoo described to you to be the process of procurement 
for vehicles.    
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   His explanation to me was that 
there were ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, on what page are you now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We are on page 27 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  37?    
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Two seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two seven, oh.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is the top paragraph. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He explained to me that as far as 
he could recall or as far as I recall in terms of what he explained to me 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 131 of 150 
 
there were five bidders in total, the bidders were preselected, two of 
which shared directors/members, who are family members of Mr Joe 
Mark of New World Motors. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Sorry, if I could just get clarity from 
you, who was Mr Joe Mark relative to New World Motors? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Mr Joe Mark was the owner of 
New World Motors.  Colonel Naidoo indicated that the closed tender 
process is a sham as Colonel Barnard and General Lazarus informs Mr 
Mark beforehand of the tender amounts from the other bidders.  Mr 
Mark would then adjust his bid to be just higher than that of the other 
10 
bidders.  He would then be awarded the tender and buy the vehicles. At 
the end of 2011 Mr Mark has approximately 80 vehicles registered in 
his name and/or New World Motors name that they bought from 
company X, as part of this closed tender process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   To what extent were you able to 
verify any of this information through your investigations? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair through the search and 
seizures that we did at the premises of New World Motors we found 
certain documentation which would indicate that there was - no 
competitive bidding process had taken place.  The companies that 
20 
represented Mr Mark and his family there was an actual book that we 
found where you could see the different amounts pencilled into that 
book for the specific tenders and that is in respect of both of those 
companies. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What information did Colonel Naidoo 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 132 of 150 
 
give you in relation to the condition of these vehicles? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo said that most of 
these – well that’s his information, most of the vehicles would be sent 
just prior to the vehicle being boarded to new World Motors, then they 
will provide extensive servicing for that vehicle, buy, put on new tyres 
and service the vehicle properly and then the vehicle would then be 
placed on the closed tender process.   It would then be bought by Mr 
Mark and at times it would be sold back to the member who drove the 
vehicle in the first place, at the discounted price.  Unfortunately 
because of the documentation that wasn’t given to us, weren’t provided 
10 
any further to us we were not able to verify that specific allegation 
regarding that, so – but that is part of the allegations that he – we were 
able to identify that they did buy vehicles and that there was a tender 
process in which they participated. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was there any information that was 
given to you in relation to the pricing of these vehicles when they were 
sold, or purchased? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I alluded to before the – 
if it is a member that is buying his own vehicle which he used as a 
Secret Service Account vehicle the amount would be less than New 
20 
World Motors would have paid for it, if it is a vehicle that they just 
bought through the closed tender process with them having the – or 
them selling it on towards someone else then that amount would also 
be just higher than the closest tender, so that they can acquire the 
vehicle and then sell on to a third party at a profit. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 133 of 150 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  So is it then 
correctly stated that the vehicles were sold at inflated cash prices? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes, that is the information that I 
received.  As I said I did not receive the documentation from Crime 
Intelligence to compare the amounts, what I did receive or what was 
told to me is that there was minor repairs done to those vehicles and 
the vehicles were in good condition when it was sold to New World 
Motors. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in this regard the information 
10 
you received from Colonel Naidoo that the cars were sold at inflated 
prices were you given any other information as to what happened to the 
cash surplus of the inflated prices? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair, the inflated prices with 
regards I was just actually looking at my affidavit now and I forgot 
about this point, at times according to Naidoo these vehicles, Colonel 
Naidoo, these vehicles would be sold back to Crime Intelligence which 
was just placed on a tender and they would be sold back to Crime 
Intelligence at an inflated amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say back to Crime Intelligence do you 
20 
mean to individuals within Crime Intelligence, or to the institution? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair I am now meaning the 
institution yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so they were sold out from the institution and 
then later on they are sold back? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 134 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, that is 
according to information from Colonel Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As I said I could not, we were 
able to corroborate some of this but not everything yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not everything. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was there any other information that 
was given to you as to what that cash surplus was used for? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair according to, as I said I 
will refer the Chair to Naidoo when he says to me something, according 
10 
to Colonel Naidoo he – the surplus that has been created where there 
is a surplus created, that monies would be utilised, and I want to make, 
and I want to take an example, when General Mdluli went to Singapore 
he received an advance amount from the Secret Services account in 
cash so that he can go and – so when he leaves he has cash in his 
pocket where he can, then he can pay his accommodation and then 
when he comes back he provides the necessary invoices to cover that 
cost. 
 
So in some instances according to Colonel Naidoo when senior 
managers came back from overseas trips like this and he was 
20 
specifically referring to General Mdluli as well, they would not have the 
necessary receipts to back up the expenses that they, or the fact that 
they do not have the money anymore, so they had to devise a situation 
where they had to get, had to – they had to – how can I put this, they 
had to create cash for that to be used to pay back the outstanding 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 135 of 150 
 
amount in terms of the advance that was asked for in the first place. 
 
So that is one of the instances where the cash would have 
been used to cover the advance that was taken out by the specific 
member, and in this regard what Colonel Naidoo said he as well as 
other members of Crime Intelligence did, was to receive fraudulent 
invoices from New World Motors, relating to the repairing of wind 
screens, where the actual repair did not take place, but an invoice was 
provided so that they could put in a claim for a replacement of the 
window or the windscreen and that money would then be used to cover 
the cost of other – of claims that was not paid in full, was not paid back 
10 
in full. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so then to summarise what you 
have said, and please correct me I’m wrong, it was the information of 
Colonel Naidoo that vehicles were  procured and sold by Crime 
Intelligence through a closed process which was in fact a sham? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is also his evidence that these 
vehicles were sold at inflated prices, be it to third parties or be back to 
Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja, he was referring to inflated 
20 
prices back to Crime Intelligence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Apologies yes, Crime Intelligence. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes., 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But there were instances where it 
was sold to the individuals of Crime Intelligence as well? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 136 of 150 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes and at a discounted price. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And any surplus that was then 
derived from these inflated prices did not go to the benefit of Crime 
Intelligence but went to the benefit of others? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It went to the benefit of New 
World Motors and Mr Mark as well as others yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And those funds were in fact State 
funds? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At page 27 paragraph 83.3, 
10 
apologies page 28 paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms September, the reference to SR is it 
nothing more than simply a reference to Secret Register or is there 
some other significance about it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair you must excuse me, I am 
just using the language that people from Crime Intelligence use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that you might be familiar with, oh okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes, so SI would indicate if I talk 
about the SI vehicle if you see that Chair then it means that it is a 
vehicle bought through the Secret Services account. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph 86 of your affidavit, 
page 28 you refer to another search and seizure warrant that you 
obtained for execution.  Please inform the Chair about this. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I have already testified to 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 137 of 150 
 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, Ms September I thought you wanted to 
cover 83.3, or did you change your mind? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No, Chair I – no, no it was actually 
86. 
CHAIRPERSON:  86? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   86 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have covered 83.3? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We have covered 83.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  You may continue. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  Is it correct that 
part of the documents that you then seized dealt with the time period 
that company X has been in business with New World Motors? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, if I may 
Chair I just want to go back to 83.3, I have testified to the fact that I 
received certain documentation from Crime Intelligence and that led me 
to interrogate New World Motors and the invoices that were submitted 
as part of those files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So that is where I refer, this is 
20 
83.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In respect of what I said earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, yes, okay, okay.  And that issue about 83.4 
has also been covered? 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 138 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About wind screens and so on. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct Chair, the order of the 
evidence as it is recorded in the affidavit is told through the prism of  
how this particular witness went about in establishing his investigation 
and the information that was the received from Colonel Naidoo.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Some of it which is not all in the 
order unfortunately as it has been recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then on page 29 you reference 
certain concerns in relation to the appointment of particular individuals, 
in relation to Mr Mark 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, Colonel 
Naidoo informed me that a family member of Mr Mark was also 
appointed as a captain within Crime Intelligence at the time, during that 
same timeframe and during the 250 appointment process.  And I would 
confirm this was General Hankel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So you independently verified this to 
be correct? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was there anything wrong for a 
family member of Mr Mark to be appointed in Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair there is not necessarily 
something wrong with it, I think that in terms of the relationship that 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 139 of 150 
 
was – that happened between Crime Intelligence and Mr Mark this 
should have been disclosed to either General Mdluli and I do not know 
whether it was disclosed or whether it was disclosed to a third party 
outside Crime Intelligence, because the relationship are too close for 
them – for this not to be disclosed.  New World Motors does business 
with Crime Intelligence, General Lazarus is at the head of that Secret 
Service Account, who approves these transactions, Mr Mark is a service 
provider to Crime Intelligence, his son gets appointed within Crime 
Intelligence of which General Lazarus is the person in charge of the 
250 appointment process. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so what you are say is based on 
your conclusions of the events that you had become aware of, but not 
necessarily factual conclusions of any wrongful or illegal appointment? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No you have to look at this 
holistically and in terms of the relationship that has taken place, the 
quid pro quo relationship that has taken place, because according to 
Colonel Naidoo General Lazarus and himself also benefitted financially 
from this – from these transactions, in the sense that certain – that 
some of the monies that was paid to Naidoo or that was created 
through supplying of false invoices to Crime – to Secret Service 
20 
Account, some of that cash was shared between him and General 
Lazarus, according to Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next investigation starts on 
page 29, and it is titled General Solomon Lazarus promotions and 
appointments of family and friends to Crime Intelligence.  Where did 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 140 of 150 
 
you obtain information in relation to this investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the initial information came 
from – came from Colonel Naidoo and then based on his information I 
then requested certain documentation.  And Colonel Naidoo explained 
his own relationship also to me in relation to this – this incident and 
how – he said to me that he is – he got to know Lazarus through 
playing volleyball in the – volleyball in the late ‘90’s in KZN.  They used 
to same – to play in the same league in Tongaat.  Colonel Naidoo was 
promoted from being a Warrant Officer to the rank of Lieutenant-
Colonel by General Lazarus through the covert advertisement process 
10 
the 250 posts that we – that I was referring to earlier in 2010.  He was 
not only a member of CIA who got promoted.  He was not the only 
member who got promoted in such a way.  Various others – other close 
confidants and family members of General Lazarus also got either 
promoted or appointed in senior positions without following due 
process.  General Lazarus was also intimately involved in the 
appointment of family and friends whereas he should have recused 
himself from that specific process.  And then I went and I tried to – and 
I requested information regarding the appointments and the table which 
is table 2 as part of my affidavit it then sets out the – the various 
20 
appointments and in which rank they were appointed.  And these – in 
respect of this you will see that the relationship in the column 
relationship I would then use the number FM1 – FM and in his instance 
it will be FM0 to FM12. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So your investigations had verified 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 141 of 150 
 
that there were twelve individuals who had been appointed through the 
250 co – 250 posts process who were then either family or friends of 
General Lazarus? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  I can 
include colleagues as well but when I talk about family and friends it 
includes colleagues with which he was friends. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if we can just look to this table 
which stars on page 29.  The first column is titled Relationship.  The 
second column is Status and what exactly do you mean by status? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair by status I mean at the time 
10 
when I drew up this column and it was now for the purpose of this 
commission I – I was able to gain access to the [indistinct] Up system 
which would then show me the individuals involved.  So the Status 
column would then state that at the time when I did this the person was 
active.  In other words still working within the South African Police 
Service. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next column is the Date of 
Appointment in Rank followed by a column titled Rank.  Next column 
Level, following column Date of Promotion/Appointment in Rank, 
followed by another column called Rank and the last column on the 
20 
right hand side which is Level.  Now when you referring to rank is that 
then the rank as you indicted under Annexure 1 to your affidavit which 
you addressed earlier today? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  If I can just 
be of more assistance.  If you look at the date of appointment in rank 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 142 of 150 
 
the first date this would mean that that person was already appointed 
within SAPS on the 1 s t March 2001. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Just for clarity of the record are you 
referring to the third column? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I am referring to the third column 
and I am referring to FM06. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As an example.  That person was 
appointed as an admin clerk on a level 6. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that was on the 1 s t March 20 – 
10 
sorry 2001. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   2001 that is correct Chair.  On the 
15 t h February as part of this process the 250 process that person was 
appointed as a captain on a level 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether that means he jumped from 
admin clerk to captain or he did go through other ranks but it did not 
reflect them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He – Chair in respect of this he 
jumped at least one rank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – on – at least one rank? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In terms of – ja – in terms of what 
is stated here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He jumped at least one rank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 143 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If we look at the next line item which 
is FM07 can you take us through that as an example too please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As a result of this one it is – he 
was appointed on the 1 s t August 2005 as a captain under level 8.  On 
the 1 s t March – on the 1 s t March 2010 he was appointed as a colonel on 
the level of – on a level 12 which means he jumped basically four 
levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is completely unusual jump? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And by way of a last example if we 
look at line item number 4 FM04 can you take us through that because 
in the third column it appears blank? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  So in 
respect of this specific individual he or she was an individual – I mean 
a civilian and who was appointed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel 
which is on a level 10 on the 1 s t March 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that means that one did not go through the ranks 
at all? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair he or she did not go… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He or she jumped everything? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is – is it about rank number 567 from 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 144 of 150 
 
bottom? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It starts if I am not mistaken it 
starts at level 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The ranks within – how the levels 
within SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no what I am thinking is if you start from 
Constable how many ranks do you… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I have to check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it requires actual counting? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is six ranks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Six ranks. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  If one were then 
to consider the full table which starts on page 29 and ends on page 30 
is it correct that other than FM11 where there is a retention of a rank at 
level 10 the remaining individuals have either jumped from a lower rank 
to a much higher rank alternatively have appointed into a senior rank 
as a civilian? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it is correct that you confirmed 
these appointments? 
MR 
KOBUS 
DEMEYER 
ROELOFSE: 
 
 
Ja 
I 
confirmed 
these 
appointments on the – on the [indistinct] Up system prior to my – me 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 145 of 150 
 
finalising my affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next investigation that you deal 
with is titled General Lazarus abuse of safe house.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   How did you come to learn of this – 
of the allegations under penning this investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson – Chair it is again 
General – Colonel Naidoo that informed me of – of this incident.  At the 
time General Naidoo – Colonel Naidoo was – travelled with General 
Lazarus and they were in close contact with each other.  They also 
10 
stayed in more or the less the same vicinity.  According to General – 
according to Colonel Naidoo General Lazarus did some extensive 
renovations to his private property to such an extent that he could not 
stay there anymore.  He had to vacate the premises. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And during what period was this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This was during 2005/2006.  He 
then stated to me that the rental amount was approximately R6000.00 
per month and according to Colonel Naidoo he was responsible for 
paying the rent out of the Secret Services Account. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who was responsible? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Colonel Naidoo was responsible.  
In other words he had to withdraw money from the Secret Services 
Account, pay it and then provide the invoice to cover the cost of the 
payment.  He states further that the premises were rented only for the 
period that General Lazarus and his family made use of it and it was 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 146 of 150 
 
exclusively furnished from monies from the Secret Services Account.  
After the lease period expired – had expired the furniture was written 
off.  The furniture was still in excellent condition and Colonel Naidoo 
and General Lazarus took some of the furniture for themselves.  
According to Colonel Naidoo General Lazarus took various items 
including mirrors, coffee tables and lamps for himself.  I then requested 
Crime Intelligence at the time when I was still allowed to get 
documentation to confirm whether this rental took place or not.  I was 
given the actual documentation.  I was able to corroborate what Colonel 
Naidoo has told me.  It was for approximately one year that General 
10 
Lazarus stayed there.  The Secret Services Account was responsible 
for the maintaining of the garden, the DSTV or DSTV and other 
expenses within the household of General Lazarus at the time.  That is 
as far as I can take it at this point in time Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is there any prohibition against a 
member of the police using a safe house for personal benefits? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the correct procedure is the 
following:  If there is a – if there is a threat on your life and whether 
you work for Crime Intelligence or whether you work for the commission 
or whether you work for SAPS a risk assessment needs to be done and 
20 
that is done by Crime Intelligence.   
 
Based on that risk assessment a decision will be taken 
whether it is required for that person to be protected and whether that 
protection means personal protection or protection at his home it does 
not actually – it is the same thing.  When it comes to protection at 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 147 of 150 
 
home the correct procedure after that is that you have to engage the 
Department of Public Works who would then; based on the decision that 
there is a threat make sure that the – that the necessary security 
upgrades has been – has been – or is being done to your home in as 
far as the threat exists.  That is what is supposed to happen.   
 
I could not find any security threat that was part of the 
documentation that I perused; that was given to me so I could not find 
any evidence that there was a security threat or security risk on Mr 
Lazarus.  And even if there were the funds should have come from 
somewhere else and not the Secret Services Account for the payment 
10 
of that property. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But now there is a marked 
distinction between benefiting from a safe house and obtaining funds in 
relation to an upgrade for security reasons? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The process… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that true? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No that is true but the process 
would still be the same.  The funds that you would need to cover the 
cost of a rental as part of your – as part of your safety procedures 
comes from the Open Account not the Secret Services Account.  And 
20 
you have to have a proper motivation as to why and there must be a 
risk assessment as to why you have to stay somewhere else. And in 
this case the motivation does not speak to the reason as to why Mr 
Lazarus – the actual reason according to Naidoo – Colonel Naidoo as 
to why Mr Lazarus stayed there. 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 148 of 150 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But then is it correct that or rather 
let me ask you the question.  Are there any instances where state funds 
from the Secret Services Account can be used to house a member of 
the police? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if it is for official purposes 
then it is possible.  But it is highly unlikely.  Because you would not 
have policemen staying at – at that kind – at that premises.  That 
premises is being utilised for something else.  It is being utilised for 
conducting your work, seeing informers, seeing agents and that kind of 
thing.  It is not {indistinct]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you cannot live in it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair you cannot live in it.  It 
is not [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can go there for meetings or whatever operations 
but you cannot live in it as a member of the police? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair you cannot because 
then you benefited from – benefiting from – from that safe house in 
your personal capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And then you are not allowed to 
20 
do that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next thing – or rather what is 
the status of this investigation Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This investigation was dealt with 
– was dealt with and then – and the – and we received the – the 
17 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 165 
 
Page 149 of 150 
 
documentation relating to this.  The documentation has not been 
declassified. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next investigation that you deal 
with is titled General Lazarus abuse of SSA – purchase… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at four. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Of vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Maybe now is an opportune time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we – we will stop with your evidence Mr Roelofse 
now and we will proceed tomorrow at ten. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair before we do with your leave I 
would like to place it on record that Colonel Naidoo is in fact a witness 
who will be called by the commission.  By virtue of the fact that he has 
been placed under the witness protection program there is an 
application that will brought before you Chair in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am not sure whether you should proceed with 
that matter.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to adjourn.  You can approach me in 
chambers in regard to the other matter.  We are going to adjourn for 
20 
now.  It may or may not be that we will resume to deal with another 
matter or I might deal with it in chambers.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
