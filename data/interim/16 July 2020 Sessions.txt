PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 16 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you want to – you wish to place 
certain matters on record with regard to… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ambassador Maqetuka 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  DCJ Ambassador Maqetuka gave 
evidence on Friday the 10 July.  We sat until approximately 
10 
eight o’clock in the evening when proceedings had to be 
stopped because of loadshedding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At that time the witness Ambassador 
had 
almost 
completed 
the 
evidence 
on 
his 
written 
statement.  In fact, he had three paragraphs to go.  And the 
remaining part of his evidence would have dealt with his 
response to affidavits that had been supplied during that 
week by officials of the African National Congress.  There is 
not much controversial in that response and in fact largely 
20 
the contents of the affidavit and the Ambassador’s response 
will be common cause save for perhaps a few observations 
that the witness might want to make.  So it has been 
determined by your leave Chair to produce the remainder of 
the Ambassador’s evidence on affidavit and then after that 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 4 of 232 
 
he may return for cross-examination from various implicated 
parties and suitable arrangements can be made in that 
respect.   
 
The second point is that he will also provide sooner 
rather than later hopefully a supplementary affidavit which 
will deal with various corrections and clarifications that are 
required that emerged during his testimony.   
 
In 
addition, 
it 
may 
be 
that 
there 
are 
certain 
documents which are declassified in the interim that may 
also be put up as partly supplementary affidavits. 
10 
 
So in short Chair the affidavit of the Ambassador will 
be concluded by way of affidavit.  He will reappear if you so 
rule for cross-examination in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no thank you very much I just 
wanted to make sure we have got the way forward with 
regard to his evidence on record as well as exactly what 
happens so that whoever reads the transcript understands 
what happened and what plan was put in place.  Okay that 
is in order thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair I have discussed with members 
assembled in the room today if they have a difficulty with 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 5 of 232 
 
me removing my mask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I have – they have indicated that they are 
sufficiently comfortable about the distance between us.  My 
challenge is that my glasses mist the whole time while I 
have the mask on.  So with your leave I request that I 
remove it when I am questioning Mr Mothibe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And when I remain at the podium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you may take it off.  I – as I 
10 
understand it when we speak, we may take it off. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so that is in order. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  And to the extent that the 
witness also might not be clearly audible when he speaks, 
he can take it off as well.  Ja okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I propose this 
morning before we commence to swear in the witness just to 
orientate ourselves as to where we are. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In the aviation evidence in particular 
because we have had quite a number of months break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I do need to be reminded where 
everything fits in. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 6 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So if I may proceed to that?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair in February this year we had a 
session of aviation and related evidence and it was towards 
the end of that session that we began looking at the role of 
auditors in the SAA group of companies.  And you will recall 
that we heard evidence from Mr Polani Sokombela who was 
a business executive in the office of the Auditor General 
10 
and he was the person who led the audit at SAA and its 
groups of companies for the 2017 financial year.   
 
Chair you will recall that before the Auditor General 
took over SAA’s audit in 2017 the group had been audited 
by joint auditors comprising PwC and Nkonki Incorporated 
for the previous five years.   
 
In February we had intended to move straight from 
Mr Sokombela’s evidence to the evidence that we are in fact 
going to receive today from Mr Mothibe. 
 
Mr Mothibe was the audit partner from PwC assigned 
20 
to the SAA audits for the years 2014 to 2016 but we 
unfortunately ran out of time during the February evidence 
session and so we have returned today to present Mr 
Mothibe’s evidence. 
 
Chair in the public sector auditors have a particular 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 7 of 232 
 
role to play.  In addition to the usual responsibilities that 
they have when they audit private companies they are 
required when they audit public SOE’s to assess amongst 
other things the levels of that state owned enterprises 
compliance with legislation including and importantly for our 
purpose the Public Finance Management Act which we 
colloquially call the PFMA and which really sets the test for 
regular procurement in a state owned enterprise context. 
 
Chair 
we 
propose 
to 
explore 
in 
Mr 
Mothibe’s 
evidence a number of factors related to auditors in the 
10 
public sector.  And the question will be whether they 
properly discharged those obligations.  Those obligations 
which are additional to the ones that they bear when they 
audit private companies. 
 
Chair we submit that this inquiry is relevant to the 
commission’s mandate.  Because one of the questions that 
you have emphasised repeatedly over the years now that 
this commission has sat is the how question.  If this 
commission concludes that state capture, corruption or 
fraud did take place in the public sector then it is supremely 
20 
important for this country and for its future for us to 
understand how it occurred and indeed why it went 
unchecked. 
 
Chair auditors are a watchdog institution.  I gave 
you the reference last time to the case law that establishes 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 8 of 232 
 
that.  And given their role and function it is therefore fair to 
ask if all this corruption and looting was potentially taking 
place in our public institutions in the past how was it that 
auditors did not pick it up? 
 
In 
the 
context 
of 
SAA 
that 
question 
becomes 
particularly pressing because he – after PwC and Nkonki 
had completed their five years of auditing for the group the 
Auditor General stepped in to audit SAA for the 2017 
financial  year and found its finances in a state that can 
only be described as shambolic. 
10 
 
So today we are going to focus on the following with 
your leave Chair with Mr Mothibe. 
 
The first aspect we will probe is the fact that except 
for the first year of PwC and Nkonki’s appointment all four 
subsequent 
years 
they 
were 
appointed 
without 
any 
procurement process being followed and this was against 
the advice of the Bid Adjudication Committee of SAA at the 
time and a legal opinion that was later procured. 
 
Their 
own 
appointment 
therefore 
constituted 
irregular expenditure for four solid years and yet it was 
20 
never disclosed as such in the financial statements. 
 
We will then explore why it was that PwC and Nkonki 
both had joint business relationships, made payments to an 
auditing firm called Kwinana and Associates during their 
audit work for SAA. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 9 of 232 
 
 
Now Kwinana and Associates was the auditing firm 
of Ms Yake Kwinana who was both a non-executive member 
of the Board of SAA for the period that these two firms were 
auditing the work – doing audit work at SAA but she was 
also the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee at SAA.  The 
very committee which year on year would approve the audit 
fees to be paid to auditors. 
 
We will then in the third place explore why not one 
of the significant transactions that have been dealt with 
extensively in the evidence before this commission and 
10 
which there are indicators may have been the subject 
matter of fraud and corruption and possibly state capture 
within SAA and were products of the decisions of the Board 
of SAA and in one occasion SAA Technical was not 
identified by these auditors as reportable irregularities.  
And we will spend some time just traversing with Mr 
Mothibe what reportable irregularities are.  We had a bit of 
evidence on that from Mr Sokombela but not much so I plan 
to pursue that with Mr Mothibe today. 
 
That obligation on auditors to report reportable 
20 
irregularities is an important one, a serious one and their 
failure to do so is in fact a crime under the relevant 
legislation. 
 
We submit that in the end the commission will need 
to determine whether any state capture, corruption or fraud 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 10 of 232 
 
that it finds to have taken place in the public sector was in 
any 
way 
facilitated 
by 
the 
auditors 
of 
state-owned 
enterprises. 
 
If it was then the next question will be whether that 
facilitation was due to mere negligence, auditors simply not 
doing their jobs as they were supposed to or something 
more sinister than that? 
 
Chair we submit that even if it is only the former 
even if state capture, corruption and fraud was not picked 
up by auditors of state-owned enterprises because of 
10 
nothing more than their mere negligence it is still important 
to expose that.  Because public funds were used to pay 
them for inadequate and substandard work and the public 
deserves better than that from a watchdog institution. 
 
It may be Chair once these matters have been 
traversed not only in SAA but other SOE’s you may consider 
recommendations like the Auditor General should be better 
capacitated and should be running all the audits at state 
owned 
enterprises 
with 
the 
level 
of 
dedication 
and 
commitment that we saw from Mr Sokombela and his team 
20 
as he dealt with in evidence before this commission over 
two days. 
 
Or it might be that you make recommendations that 
the annual review that the Auditor General is required to do 
under the legislation at the moment to approve external 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 11 of 232 
 
firms coming into SOE’s should be stricter.  There should be 
additional criteria. 
 
Those are the sorts’ recommendations.  It may well 
be that this commission wants to consider in due course.   
 
And so Chair it is with that background in place and 
just a reorientation of where we are that without further ado 
I have two procedural matters just to mention and then I 
would beg your leave to swear in the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation.  Persons – all persons who are in the room 
10 
must take responsibility to make sure that there is proper 
social distancing between themselves and the next person.  
I do not think that if you are sitting in the one row and there 
is somebody sitting immediately behind you in the next that 
that is one and a half meters or two meters.  So do consider 
– there may be constraints that I do not know but I just want 
to make sure everybody remembers that we must still try 
and…   It may be that for TV or whatever there are other 
constraints I leave it to you to think about that but there is 
enough room to make sure that there is proper social 
20 
distancing.  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Pule Joseph Mothibe. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 12 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  No objections. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth, if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR MOTHIBE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may – you may be 
10 
seated. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   Just a few procedural 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Before I begin with the questioning.  Mr 
Mothibe is represented by a legal team.  They did 
previously introduce themselves to you on the last occasion 
but I wonder if I could seek your leave for them simply to 
place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us do that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair it might be convenient for Mr 
Chappel to do so as he is seated at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that we do not have to move the 
podium. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 13 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And sanitise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do that.  Good morning – good 
morning you can just put on – ja.  Yes. 
ADV TONY CHAPPEL:  My name is Tony Chappel from the 
law firm Norton Rose Fulbright and I have with me two of 
my colleagues Ms Mdluli and Ms Thompson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Then on two final 
procedural matters.  Insofar as a Rule 3.3 Notices for Mr 
10 
Mothibe’s evidence is concerned that was done way back in 
February.  There was one notice sent to Ms Yake Kwinana.  
We received simply a two or three paragraphed email in 
response from her. 
 
Chair 
you 
have 
previously 
indicated 
in 
these 
proceedings that you require a proper and formal response 
to any affidavit that is sent to implicated persons.  Ms 
Kwinana does not purport in that email response to seek 
leave to cross-examine or any such thing.  She simply puts 
up a few points in that email.  I do not propose to deal with 
20 
that with Mr Mothibe today.  It is in any event the intention 
of the commission and we have engaged Ms Kwinana about 
this to have her come and give evidence in due course and 
so any matters arising there will be dealt with in that 
evidence. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 14 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then the final procedural matter Chair 
is I understand that the commission has received an 
affidavit from Mr Simon Mantell whose company Mantelli’s 
Biscuits was awarded an SAA tender in 2014 which shortly 
after the award was summarily withdrawn.   
 
I had intended to question Mr Mothibe on possible 
relevant matters arising from Mr Mantell’s affidavit but I 
have been informed that his affidavit is forming part of a 
different process within the commission.  I have not 
10 
considered it as a result and I will not be traversing matters 
with Mr Mothibe today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In relation to Mr Mantell’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder what process it is part of 
because the last I knew was that one of things you were 
considering is seeing whether the information that Mr 
Mantell gives in his affidavit could be used to question Mr 
Mothibe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am not aware what that process is 
and nobody has talked to me about that process.  So I am 
concerned about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair you are… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you – you had considered it as a 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 15 of 232 
 
possibility. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I had indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe during the tea break you could talk 
to me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am concerned about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
know. 
 
Because 
also 
I 
think 
correspondence that may have gone to Mr Mantell may have 
alerted him that this was a possibility. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he might not have been told anything. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he might be concerned to say, this is 
– I was told was a possibility but now it is not happening. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And nobody has bothered to tell me what 
is going on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair can I say in response I – I share 
your concerns.  I do – it had always been my intention but 
20 
late last week I was given this information.  But let me if I 
may over the tea break raise it further with you.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair then to move to Mr Mothibe finally.  
Apologies for the delay Mr Mothibe.  Mr Mothibe’s evidence 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 16 of 232 
 
Chair is Exhibit DD19 and I request that we enter it into the 
record as such.  It comprises initially a first statement and a 
series of annexures and then additional documents.  But 
since the evidence in February of Mr Sokombela Mr Mothibe 
then supplied a few weeks ago supplementary statement 
and so we have also just inserted that in the appropriate 
place in the bundle that had previously been prepared.  And 
it spans more than a single file so I beg your leave to enter 
it as Exhibit 19A and B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is the lever arch file marked DD – 
10 
Exhibit DD19A and then there is one marked Exhibit DD19B. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – I guess that the – the first 
statement is the one in A? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the supplementary would be 
whereabout? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is just after it.  It commences at page 
30.1 because we slotted it in so that it could – his two 
statements together would appear at the commencement of 
20 
the file.  So you will see his first statement runs from page 
1 of DD19A to page 30, 30 with its annexures and then 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry did you say 15 
something or 50? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 17 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No.  Apologies Chair 30, 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  53? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No 30, 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  30 30.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So 30 and then the second statement 
commences at 30.1, 30.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I found it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is in 19B? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is the further additional documents. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continuation of annexures.  Ja okay 
alright.  In the meantime, since the last time I am not sure 
we have been emphasising that the – the file is not the 
exhibit but the statement is the exhibit and for convenience 
what has been done in regard to – in some of the matters is 
to call the file Bundle Something. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the statements is Exhibit whatever 
and its annexures. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so we will – when we talk about the 
exhibit it will be a reference to the affidavit and its 
annexures. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – ja okay.  The affidavit of Mr Pule 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 18 of 232 
 
Joseph Mothibe dated or deposed to – or is it in the form of 
a statement?  It is a statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is the form of a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It was a request that it be provided as a 
statement so it could be confirmed under oath today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay no that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you will see it is signed on page 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  On the 22 January 2020. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The statement of Mr Pule Joseph 
Mothibe – I do not think it has got a date – or it does have a 
date.  Dated 22 January 2020 is admitted together with its 
annexures as Exhibit DD19A.  Now the other statement or is 
it an affidavit that one? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No that one is also a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I just saw on page 31 saying affidavit 
so… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is somebody else.  No I am sorry I 
20 
think that is somebody else. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is another person’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is another person. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is from Ms Sassa we will come to 
that. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 19 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Supplementary 
– 
a 
supplementary 
statement now we – we from what you said earlier on I think 
you intend that we take this as a separate exhibit rather 
than an annexure to the other statement or? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair my suggestion is that we keep it in 
Exhibit 19 A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because it has been separately identified 
by its pagination numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  30.1 to 30.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I would like to suggest we keep it in 
Exhibit 11 – 19A because that is how the referencing for my 
questioning today has been prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  It might not be mentioned as 
an annexure because it is a separate statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They are separate yes.  So it might be his 
supplementary statement which appears from page 30.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  To 30.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now the – I see there is an affidavit 
later on.  Is that – is that – that is not an annexure to 
anything so… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No these are – once you finish this… 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 20 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it will be an annexure to the first 
statement? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No it is actually now the additional 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So once you complete the second 
statement or what we calling the supplementary statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The remainder of A continuing into B is all 
the additional documents that have been produced. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And discovered in the course of the 
commission’s investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But they are pertinent to Mr Mothibe’s 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They do include affidavits of others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And when I was going to come to them, I 
20 
would explain the circumstances of their inclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  None of them are contentious but from 
page 31 then in DD19A it is a series [audio stopped due to 
power outage].  Maybe loadshedding. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 21 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that they – somebody should sort it 
out [audio stopped due to power outage]. They have 
previously promised that – loadshedding they would bypass 
us so that we could [no sound].   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We were at the point where I was trying to 
think whether... what we should do with documents that are 
not annexures ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...to the statement because normally I 
would say the statement is admitted as exhibit so and 
so...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...together with its annexures. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it is easier.  But if it is documents 
that are not annexures ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...they might need to be separately 
20 
identified but admitted as exhibits in their own rights. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, which we can do because we can say 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 22 of 232 
 
Mr Mothibe’s statement is EXHIBIT DD19A. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we say BCD...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...up to wherever. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be easier to do that immediately 
or as you refer to each document? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I think as we go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What I am going to ask, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I just be assisted.  There is a new member 
of the legal team, Ms Amy Armstrong, who is assisting me 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She will be presenting evidence tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If she can just keep running a list for me of 
where we are in the alphabet? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No, that is fine.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Then, as and when, I refer to a new 
document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  ...we will enter it appropriately. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 23 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  No, that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, as I have already indicated, the... Mr 
Mothibe’s statement dated 22 January 2020, would it be 
submitted as EXHIBIT DD19A together with its annexures.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m. 
STATEMENT WITH ANNEXURES OF MR PJ MOTHIBE IS 
HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT DD19A 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it has got a few annexures.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I think what comes after that... I 
think the annexures will probably go up to... just before the 
supplementary statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is exactly right.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe, we may as well just deal with the 
supplementary statement as well. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, that is not a problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Mothibe’s supplementary statement, 
it is undated.  The supplementary statement, undated 
supplementary statement.  It reads: 
“Supplementary 
Statement 
by 
Mr 
Pule 
Joseph 
Mothibe, concerning joint audit of South African 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 24 of 232 
 
Airways Groups, SOCL (Ltd) SAA...” 
 
It will be admitted as EXHIBIT DD19B.  It appears on 
page 30.1.  
UNDATED STATEMENT BY MR PJ MOTHIBE IS HANDED 
UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT DD19B 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then others, we will...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...deal with as we go along. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair.  I am indebted.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  And then what will... well, what will 
be necessary to do, is that on the spine of the file, it should 
be reflected ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...what exhibits ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...are inside.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, then to commence.  Oh, if you 
can just put your microphone on.  I understand there is no 
difficulty with you leaving it on and it is just easier.  Then 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 25 of 232 
 
you do not have to worry about turning it on and off in the 
questioning. 
MR MOTHIBE:  [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, if we start with your first 
statement.  You will see it begins at page 2 and it runs to 
page 14 of EXHIBIT DD19A.  Can you confirm that that is 
your signature on page 14? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say it starts from page 2? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Page 1.  If I said 2, that was an error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is certainly from page 1 to page 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is my signature. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And can you confirm that the contents of 
the statement are true and correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  The statement... or rather, the commissioned 
statements are true and fair, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And are there any corrections you would 
like to make to the statement? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  There are no corrections, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Mothibe, can I just suggest 
for your convenience that you move... yes.  I think it will just 
be a little bit easier for you and it also helps to amplify your 
voice. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 26 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then there is your supplementary 
statement which we have admitted as EXHIBIT DD19B and 
that runs from pagination 30.1 to 30.6.  Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, I do Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And can you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Ms Hofmeyr.  I am concerned 
that for some reason, I do not know whether it is mic.  
Whenever you mention the page number of that statement, I 
always hear fifty.  [laughs] 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  [laughs]  Maybe I must try and articulate a 
little bit more clearly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether the transcribers are 
hearing ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...thirty or fifty. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Fifty.  Let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now they right the wrong thing. [laughs] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let me be clear.  It is thirty with a three-
zero.  So it is 30.1 to 30.6.  Do you have that Mr Mothibe? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  I have got the statement, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  This was not signed.  That is not a 
problem.  I understand the challenges under lockdown when 
you were producing this.  Can you simply confirm for us 
under oath today that its contents are true and correct? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 27 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  The contents are true and correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  Mr Mothibe, I am 
concerned.  Your voice is quite soft.  I do not know whether 
it is because of the mountain of files next to you. 
MR MOTHIBE:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  And or... did you want to try and raise it? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I will raise my voice, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much better, yes.  Thank you. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And just to check.  There are no 
corrections that you would like to make to that statement, 
are there Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  There are no corrections, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Mothibe, I would just like to 
start with some background.  If we may? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You indicate in your first statement, that is 
in EXHIBIT DD19A at page 1, that you are a registered 
auditor.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Can you tell the Chair when you completed 
your articles? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I have completed my articles at the 
end of December 1995. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 28 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what qualifications do you hold? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I have got a Bachelor of Commerce Degree 
and a Higher Diploma in Accounting.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  And when did you become a partner at 
PWC? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I was admitted to partnership on the 
1s t of July 2003. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And when did you take over as audit 
partner for the SAA Group of Companies? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I took over as partner on the South African 
10 
Airways Groups of Companies on the 31 March 2014 
financial year. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And did you remain in that position until 
the 31 March 2016 audits were completed? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And how many years did PWC in total audit 
the SAA Group with its audit partner, Nkonki Inc.? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, it was for a period of five years. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move to 
the topic of the requirements for auditing state owned 
20 
enterprises and talk a bit about auditing procedures.  Could 
you tell us, who designs the auditing procedures for an audit 
Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, the auditing procedures would be 
designed by the audit team.  That is the audit firms that 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 29 of 232 
 
instituting the assignment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now, in the course of preparing for your 
evidence Mr Mothibe, you provided to the Commission some 
of the working papers for those audits that you still retained 
as PWC. 
 
And we took a look at those and try to decipher from 
them what sorts of procedures you and your team had 
devised for the audits that you conducted at SAA. 
 
And so I would like to check with you if we are correct in 
understanding that one of the things that you would do in 
10 
your procedures was to study the minutes of meetings that 
took place within SAA.  Is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, one of the procedures that we do 
carry out is the review of the minutes of boards on 
committees and other relevant committees. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So you have mentioned the 
board.  So you would consider board minutes, would you? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And would you consider the minutes of the 
Bid Adjudication Committee as one of the committee? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that would be considered by the team 
that is carrying out work in a specific audit area.  It may be 
one of the areas that they look at but there are other areas 
would also consider. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, I do not have a difficulty with there 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 30 of 232 
 
being other ones as well.  I just want to get clarity on 
whether it would be part of the audit procedure to consider 
Bid Adjudication Committee Minutes? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, to the extent that it is relevant, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  When would it be relevant? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, if one is looking at a contract and 
there may be following procedures relating to approvals. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  Mr Sokombela in his evidence on the 
21s t of February 2020, this year... Chair, I do not suggest we 
go there.   
10 
 
I am just for the record going to give you the reference.  
It is in the transcript at page 103, lines 8 to 10.  He said that 
his 
team 
certainly 
considered 
the 
Bid 
Adjudication 
Committee Minutes. 
 
Would you suggest... would you agree with him that it is 
good audit procedure to look at those minutes amongst 
others? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I do not think it would be necessarily 
appropriated to comment on the work performed by Mr 
Sokombela.  I am comfortable to comment on audit letters as 
20 
far as it relates to work, I have performed.  Unless... I will be 
speculating Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let me ask you Mr Mothibe then.  Do you 
regard it as a good audit procedure to consider the minutes 
of 
the 
Bid 
Adjudication 
Committee 
at 
a 
state-owned 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 31 of 232 
 
enterprise? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, in as far as it is relevant to the area 
being tested, it would be a good procedure. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And if you are testing supply chain 
management and its compliance, should you be looking at 
Bid Adjudication Committee Minutes? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, it would make sense to me the Bid 
Adjudication Committee Minutes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, would you also as your audit 
procedures be reviewing media reporting about the entity 
10 
that you are reviewing and auditing? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, it is no requirements of the standards, 
audit standards to look at media reports when one is 
performing an audit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you say it is not a requirement? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, yes.  It is not a requirement, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you look at media reports in your own 
audit procedures? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, we did look at media reports to the 
extent that we could find or what we could fine. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, Mr Mothibe.  You have actually looked 
at them quite extensively as I understand it.  And for that 
purpose, I would like us to go to a document that...  
 
Chair, you will currently find, and Mr Mothibe, you will 
currently find in the file that, on the spine, is numbered 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 32 of 232 
 
DD19B. 
 
Chair, I am just using that reference so that you can find 
it.  I am mindful of your request that we now enter them as 
separate exhibits but if you go into DD19B at page 443? 
MR MOTHIBE:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you have that Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I do have the... 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now, we are going to enter this as the next 
exhibit but I would like you to just explain to us what this 
10 
document is. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  One second. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do not forget the question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just wondering if we are going to 
enter it as the next exhibit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normally, one would prefer to have that 
20 
sequence where...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Under A we... it is sequential...[intervenes]  
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 33 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...in order to be... to the next Lever arch 
file.  I am just thinking... oh, but of course, what you can do 
is that we could go to the various exhibits in both files. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though we end up with, for example, 
D being in the first Lever arch file. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And E being the next. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But later on, you could put them in one 
Lever arch file.  I mean, the one set. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be sequential and then create another 
one that is sequential.  That could be done.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  We could certainly.  Chair, the only 
challenge ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but there may be another way of doing 
it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  For today’s purposes, my difficulty is that 
the only way that I can direct all of us to the pages I am 
interested in, is by its current pagination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 34 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So and that was devised assuming that we 
would 
use 
the 
method 
that 
we 
have 
been 
using 
previously...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  ...which was the DD19A ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  ...for the first file.  DD19B for the second 
file 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And sequential pagination throughout. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am wondering whether we... you 
should not be... we should not be creative and call... give 
these two Lever arch files bundle numbers. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if the bundle numbers are not 
necessarily sequential. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whatever bundle has been given. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we can say exhibit so and so is a 
20 
bundle. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That a bundle so runs from page whatever, 
on page whatever.  Do you think that might...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I do think so. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 35 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I mean, the simplest way for today’s 
purposes might be to... all that you have entered so far is 
DD19A and DD19B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Those are the two statements, right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  My suggestion is that we then say that 
DD19C will be the documents running from, and then I will 
give you the pagination now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It will be... I think I can remember, page 31 
to page 250. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then DD19D will be from page 251 to 
page six - I just have to get it here - 624. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because then we are going to be set for 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Then I will not have difficulty.  Then I can 
take you to the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Will that be convenient Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that will be fine.  Let us do it that way. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 36 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Super. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I will just repeat it if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we have entered DD19A and DD19B 
into the record.  We will then be entering DD19C into the 
record and that will run from paginated page numbers 31, 
that is three, one.  To paginated page 250. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you say 19C or D? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  C. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  C, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  C.  That is at page 31. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, until page 250. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until page two... is that up to the end? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, and of the second Lever arch file? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The first Lever arch file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, end of the first Lever arch file? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So that will be... all of those 
documents...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...will be admitted as EXHIBIT DD19C and 
then they will be differentiated by reference to the page 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 37 of 232 
 
numbers? 
LEVER ARCH FILE FROM PAGE 31 TO PAGE 250 IS 
HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT DD19C 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is going to be very convenient for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then just to be clear for the record.  
What will then be entered as EXHIBIT DD19D for dog 
[laughs] will be pages... you will find that in the second file 
10 
Chair.  And that runs from page 251 to page 624. 
LEVER ARCH FILE FROM PAGE 251 TO PAGE 6240 IS 
HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT DD19D 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is 251 to...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  To page 624. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what we will do is... this could be 
done later on.  We might have to identify each document and 
maybe use A, B, C or AA, BB. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever.  But for today’s purposes, we 
20 
will say that EXHIBIT DD19D starts from page 251 to 624. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Subject 
to 
later 
qualification 
and 
amendment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 38 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  With a separate identification of the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair.  We have made a note of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So then just to take us back to where we 
were Mr Mothibe.  We are in, what has now been entered as 
EXHIBIT DD19D and we were at page 443 and I was asking 
10 
you to help us identify this document.  What is this 
document? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
Chair, 
as 
part 
of 
maintaining 
the 
understanding of the client, we use information that comes to 
our attention whilst...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I will ask you to raise your voice again. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Oh, apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Whilst it is not a requirement of the 
standards to go through the media to obtain such.  Chair, to 
20 
the extent that there are articles whichever been and 
provides 
us 
information 
that 
helps 
us 
to 
obtain 
an 
understanding of our business and what is going there which 
helps us in confirming our approach. 
 
And we certainly do take account of those articles to go 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 39 of 232 
 
out and... it is only possible to go out and says, because 
there is quite a universe of articles out there Chair. 
 
And you will not be able to identify every single one of 
them.  So to the extent that we desire an event, we do look 
at those. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, was it part of your audit 
procedure to look at media articles related to the SAA 
Group? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as part of our own procedures, we 
looked at those media articles that came to our attention. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  You say at page 442 under the 
heading: Purpose of EGA: 
“In accordance with the risk-based audit approach, 
we stay up to date with media...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I am sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My 442 is a table. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry, 443 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  443? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  443.  Apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I was reading from the words that appear 
under the heading, just after the table at the top, the 
Purpose of the EGA, but let us look at the table first.  This 
relates to the engagement for the SAA Group Audit for 2015.  
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 40 of 232 
 
Is that correct Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And so the period end date of that audit is 
the 31s t of March 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it says, Audit Unit in the next line.  
SAA Group Audit 2015 HQ.  What does HQ stand for? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is head office. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Headquarters maybe?  I do not know 
exactly.  [laughs] 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, headquarters, head office.  Yes, that is 
correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it says EGA title.  What does EGA 
stand for? 
MR MOTHIBE:  It is Engagement Gathering Evidence. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.   
MR MOTHIBE:  That is... Chair, that is a PwC acronym that 
we use. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  So this is how you acquire audit 
evidence.  Is that right? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  Amongst others Chair.  This is one of the 
ways that we would identify evidence. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Yes, the audit evidence that is going 
to inform the audit that you conduct.  Correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That sounds correct Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 41 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then under the purpose, there is the 
following.  I will read it into the record. 
“In accordance with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry, Ms Hofmeyr.  Did 
you say EGA represents one of the ways in which you 
acquire evidence? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, EGA, it is an acronym we use at PwC 
which relates to... if I can recall ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you can start by telling me what it 
stands for, EGA?  Then that might help me.  Or it is just... or 
10 
there is no particular full name for it or full...? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, if my memory serves me right.  Chair, 
it should 
be Evidence Gathering Activity, 
Chair.  So 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that helps.  [laughs]  That helps.  Ja, 
ja.  Okay.  Okay.  So... no, then I understand. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, Chair.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And when you describe then later, below 
the table on the page the purpose of your Evidence 
20 
Gathering Activity, you describe it as follows: 
“In accordance with the risk-based audit approach, 
we stay up to date on media reports pertaining to 
SAA and to evaluate the effect thereof in the financial 
statements, identify risks and therefore update our 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 42 of 232 
 
audit 
approach 
on 
a 
continual 
basis 
when 
necessary...” 
 
Do you accept the accuracy of that statement about the 
purpose of your Evidence Gathering Activities? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is how the piece reads Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  Mr Mothibe, you were present for the 
evidence of Mr Sokombela.  Is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I was present for part of the evidence.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Have you considered the whole of his 
evidence before giving evidence today? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I have had a look at Mr Sokombela’s 
evidence.  I have briefly had a look at that but not in that 
kind of detail Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But were you aware then that he 
emphasised that looking at media reports would be an 
important part of and did form part of the approach that his 
team took to the audit in 2017. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as I have indicated earlier.  It is not a 
requirement of the standards for one to look at media 
reports.  However, and as we have done during our... under 
20 
review, we did look at media reports that came to our 
attention and those had an impact or provided information 
that could prove useful onto the client. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that it is part of IRBA’s 
guide on reportable irregularities that you should keep 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 43 of 232 
 
abreast of press reporting about the entity that you are 
auditing? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, could I ask Ms Hofmeyr to repeat that 
question.  I am not too sure that I understand what...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sure.  Are you aware of IRBA’s guide 
regarding reportable irregularities? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I am aware of that guide relating to 
reportable irregularities. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you seek to act in accordance with it 
when you audit companies? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, we act according to the guide at all 
times when we audit our clients. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that the guide indicates that 
auditors should be considering press articles about an entity 
when they are auditing it as one of the means by which you 
are assisted in identifying reportable irregularities? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I would have to remind myself of that 
but certainly Chair, we did consider media reports relating to 
the SAA Group of Companies when we carried out our 
engagement. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Mothibe, in my introduction 
today, I indicated that when an auditor audits a state owned 
enterprise, there are additional obligations on that auditor as 
compared with when the auditor simply audits a private 
company.  Do you agree with that statement? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 44 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, the... as I have indicated in my 
statement Chair.  If... can I refer Ms Hofmeyr to one 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may refer to your statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh, certainly.   
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You will find that in DD19A and it 
commences at page 1. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you, Ms Hofmeyr.  Chair, on page 1 of 
my statement on DD19 PGM01 at the bottom of the page 
10 
Chair, the last paragraph.  We confirm there: 
“The auditor’s duty ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can read that paragraph if you want to. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you, Chair. 
“The auditor’s duty in an audit is to provide an 
opinion 
considering 
whether 
or 
not 
the 
annual 
financial 
statements 
fairly 
presents 
the 
entity’s 
financial position and results of its operations and 
cash-flow information in conforming with general 
accepted accounting practices...” 
20 
 
So Chair, that is our primary role as auditors.  And we 
are also required to comment as to whether the... ordinarily, 
the report would confirm that the financial statements are 
prepared 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Companies Act. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 45 of 232 
 
 
When we audit state owned enterprises, we do so on 
behalf of the office of the general and he has issued 
guidance which requires us to also consider matters of 
compliance with law regulations which is, by the way Chair, 
is a requirement of the auditor standards. 
 
So Chair, much there are initial guidelines from the EGA 
they are, in fact, covered by ISA when it comes to... because 
we required to consider compliance with law regulations in 
terms of...  
 
I think it is either 230 Chair.  I will have to confirm the 
10 
exact numbering if...   But 
Chair, 
the 
audit 
standards 
sufficiently cover that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Mr Mothibe.  I am grateful for 
your clarification on that point.  If I can direct you to 
paragraph 9 on page 2 of your statement which, for 
reference purposes, is in EXHIBIT DD19A.   
 
You will see a paragraph 9 there.  You sum up, I think in 
essence, what you have described now to the Chair.  You 
say: 
“For all audits, the auditor is required to comply with 
20 
International Standards of Auditing known as the 
ISA...” 
 
That is what you were referring to a moment ago.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is correct. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 46 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then you go on, you say: 
“The ISA require the auditor to consider relevant and 
applicable law and regulations that may have a 
material impact on the financial statements as a 
whole...” 
 
I take it to... the point you made earlier is that applies 
whatever company you are auditing.  Is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is correct.  If I may give an 
example, Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m. 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  When you are auditing a bank Chair, there 
are initial requirements in terms of the Banking Act.  So you 
will have to bring that into consideration.  When, Chair you 
are auditing an insurance company, there is legislation 
specifically to insurance companies that you will have to 
consider. 
 
So when you audit state owned enterprises, it is then the 
PFMA that is then brought into the picture.  So in essence 
Chair, an audit is an audit. 
 
There are no peculiarities Chair.  Or there are no 
20 
additionally 
requirements 
in 
terms 
of 
state-owned 
enterprises because all the standards that requires you to 
look at applicable law and regulations cover that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you will accept, as you just have, that 
one of the key pieces of legislation for state owned 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 47 of 232 
 
enterprises is the Public Finance Management Act.  Correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that will be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let me go back to the point you made 
just before you answered this question because it seems to 
me that it was suggested that it might not be accurate to say 
when you audit a public enterprise, there are additional 
requirements that are not there when you audit a private 
company.   
 
That is the impression I got from your answer.  Is it a 
correct 
impression 
from 
the 
comment 
you 
made 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...when you said an audit is an audit? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you Chair for the question.  Chair, I 
think or what I want to illustrate Chair is that, we carry out 
our audit in terms of International Standards of Auditing.   
 
And even when we audit in the public section, you still 
comply with the International Standards of Auditing to the 
extent that there are additional requirements in the PFMA. 
 
It is not necessarily initially required.  It does not mean 
20 
that the audit itself is suddenly different from what is in the 
private sector. 
 
It is more, and if I can use the term Chair, it is more an 
industry issue.  Different industries have got different 
requirements and one would then look at the public sector as 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 48 of 232 
 
a different... as an industry. 
 
And you say the PFMA is then the kind of regulation that 
you would look at when you audit a public entity or a state 
owned enterprise as in this Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  It might be... it may be that it is... 
what is... a difference without distinction.  [laughs] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  Indeed, Chair. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because certainly the PFMA will not apply 
to a private company, is it not? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But it will apply to a lot of these SOE’s that 
certainly this Commission has been looking at, you know.  
And government departments.   
 
But you seem to choose to look at not as an additional 
requirement but you simply... you prefer to approach the 
matter on the basis that each industry or sector has got its 
own features. 
 
And when you are auditing an entity, whether private or 
public, in a certain sector, in a certain industry, you have an 
20 
obligation to comply to look at everything that applies to that 
sector. 
 
If it is a public sector, you would include the PFMA.  If it 
is in the private sector, you will not include the PFMA but 
depending on which sector it is, like insurance or whatever, 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 49 of 232 
 
there may be specific legislation applicable to that category 
of entities or that industry. 
 
And you as the auditor will have an obligation to apply 
your mind to all of the relevant legislation.  That is how you 
approach it. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, Chair.  That is how... that is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair.  We are indebted for that 
clarification.  I would then like to take you Mr Mothibe to the 
10 
PFMA because there are a few provisions there that are 
going to form the backdrop to some of the questions today. 
 
Mr Mothibe, you will find it in the file that has been made 
available to you in this box of files entitled Aviation 
Legislation. 
 
Chair, we have dealt with that file previously.  If I can 
just ask your registrar to assist you with the Aviation 
Legislation file? 
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair and Mr Mothibe, you will find the 
20 
Public Finance Management Act in that file commencing from 
page 46.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Shall we identify this?  I think this is the 
file written EXHIBIT DD, Aviation Legislation reference 
bundle on this pile. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 50 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the file we have here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, and it has been entered into the 
record previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is helpful.  Thank you.  Then we 
commence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure whoever reads the 
transcript ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...knows which file we are ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Years after.  We assume...  [laughs]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  [laughs]  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And we start with the PFMA which 
commences at page 46. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, you are familiar with the 
provisions of this act? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I have read the act previously and I 
am familiar some of the provisions in the act Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The first provisions within the act I would 
like us to look at appears at page 50 and it is the definition 
of Irregular Expenditure.  Could you read into the record 
what Irregular Expenditure is defined at, as on that page? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 51 of 232 
 
“Irregular Expenditure means expenditure other than 
authorised expenditure incurred in contravention of or 
that is not in accordance with the requirement of any 
applicable legislation including this act or the state 
Act 86 of 1968 or any regulations made in terms of 
that act or any provisional legislation providing for 
procure 
and 
procedures 
in 
that 
provisional 
government...” 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, do you understand from that 
definition that if a state owned enterprise incurs expenditure 
10 
which is not in accordance with the requirements of the 
PFMA, it will constitute irregular expenditure? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is what I understood Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if we go to Section 
51 which you will find at page 68.  This is where we start to 
get to the substantive provisions of the PFMA that regulates 
state owned enterprises such as SAA and its group of 
companies. 
 
And what Section 51 does Mr Mothibe and I would like to 
confirm that this is also your understanding, is that it sets 
20 
the responsibilities of accounting officers of state owned 
enterprises such as SAA.  Do you agree with that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Amongst those responsibilities, could you 
tell us what the responsibility at Section 51.1.A.1 is? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 52 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  If I read out, it says: 
“Effective, 
efficient 
and 
transparent 
systems 
of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Your voice has gone down again. 
MR MOTHIBE:  I will come closer to the mic, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Okay.  Alright. 
MR MOTHIBE:   
“Effective, 
efficient 
and 
transparent 
system 
of 
financial and risk management and internal control...” 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So it is a requirement.  Is it your 
10 
understanding that it is a requirement of the PFMA that an 
entity like SAA must ensure that it has and maintains internal 
controls? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that it has and maintains an effective 
efficient 
transparent 
system 
for 
financial 
and 
risk 
management? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is how the act reads.  That is 
correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And is it also your understanding that it is 
20 
another obligation of the accounting authority for an entity 
like SAA to have and maintain...?  I am now at Roman three.   
“An appropriate procurement and provisioning system 
which is fair, equitable, transparent, competent and 
cost-effective...” 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 53 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is how the act reads.  That is 
correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And that is your understanding of it, is it 
Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is my understanding. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And who is the accounting 
authority for SAA? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that will be the board and obviously, 
the board may delegate it to the CFO and other relevant 
officials. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Would that happen by way of delegations 
of authority? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That will be correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then if we go over the page to page 
69.  The other obligation or responsibility of accounting 
authority is...  
 
I would just like to be clear that we are on the same 
page about, is the responsibility for the accounting authority 
to have and maintain... apologies. 
 
Now we are onto B.  I am interested in these.  So, 
20 
“The accounting authority of a public entity b) must 
take 
affect 
appropriate 
steps 
to 
ii) 
to 
prevent 
irregular expenditure...” 
 
Is it your understanding that the Board of SAA was 
required to do that as well? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 54 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to 
Section 55 because that is actually the section, I suggest 
slightly closer to home for you because that is the section... 
 
You will find it at page 70 Chair and Mr Mothibe.  And it 
is Section 55 which deals with the annual report and 
financial statements of public entities.   
 
And the one I am interested in there Mr Mothibe is 
Section 55(2)(b).  Section 55(2)(b) reads as follows: 
“The annual report and financial statements referred 
10 
to in one of the sub-sections above must and be, 
include particulars of i) any material losses to 
criminal conduct and ii) any irregular expenditure and 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure that occurred 
during the financial year...” 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I see the section Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Mr Mothibe, is it your understanding 
then that when you are as an auditor reviewing the financial 
statements of a public entity such as SAA, one of the things 
20 
you are going to be looking for is whether those financial 
statements comply with this requirement at B that they 
include particulars of any irregular expenditure? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, will be correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Any fruitless and wasteful expenditure 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 55 of 232 
 
must also be disclosed in those financial statements, just it 
not? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That will be correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And there will be non-compliance with the 
PFMA if the financial statements did not reflect that, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, the interpretation is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And would you also accept there would be 
none-compliance with the PFMA if the accounting authority, 
the Board of SAA permitted procurement to take place in a 
manner that was not fair, equitable, transparent, competitive 
10 
and cost-effective? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that interpretation is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now Mr Mothibe, we received 
some evidence from Mr Sokombela about the approach that 
the auditor general took to its auditing of SAA and its group 
of companies in 2017. 
 
And he gave the Chair and the rest of us some detailed 
insight into how they went about determining whether 
irregular expenditure had been incurred and its extent in the 
2017 financial year. 
20 
 
I would like to ask you before I go to what he said, to tell 
the Chair and us how you approached that aspect of your 
audit responsibilities for the year 2014 to 2016. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you.  Chair, I would like to also to 
refer the Chair to my initial statement.  Chair, where we 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 56 of 232 
 
indicate that the works plate between the joint auditors and 
to 
confirm 
that 
in 
the 
years... 
for 
the 
years 
ending 
March 2014 and February 2015, that part of the... was 
performed by the joint auditors. 
 
However, Chair, I can talk to, certainly to some of the 
principles that guided their approach and for the 2016, the 
financial 2016 year Chair, the work was performed by my 
team at PwC. 
 
So obviously Chair, I will talk to that.  And also, to 
confirm Chair that the approach was fairly consistent with 
10 
the three years under review. 
 
Chair, South African Airways has got a compliance office 
and it understanding, it appearing and confirming the 
understanding of the business processes and the different 
matters that they have got to consider. 
 
We do sit with the compliance office and one of those 
areas that we engage them on is how the sittings are going 
to take place to identify and report irregular expenditure and 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure. 
 
Chair, we have reviewed that process and in addition 
20 
Chair, the work performed in the area of procurement and 
contract management which would help us to confirm the 
review that we had done from the compliance side. 
 
So part of it Chair of the approach is the understanding 
the controls that exist of the entity.  How they report.  It 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 57 of 232 
 
really be comfortable with have put it in place. 
 
And then the substantive work that we will do in the 
procurement and contract management area will help us to 
confirm that everything was done as expected Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You and your joint audit partner, Nkonki for 
the years 2014 to 2016 were satisfied that the internal 
controls were adequate, were you not? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I think I should refer Chair to the 
supplementary statement that were submitted Chair where 
we do confirm that the work performed, we did identity 
10 
diversions and we did notify management and those charge 
with governance of the deviations. 
 
And so Chair, to the extent that we did not elevate that 
part to the audit report as required Chair.  We do... what is 
the correct word Chair? 
 
Chair, we accept that we should have done that.  So 
Chair, it was come close where it admitted they did not 
identify all the issues. 
 
We picked up deviations when we performed our work.  
We informed management.  We informed the audit committee 
20 
the issue with governance but we did not complete the final 
step and hence the concession that we have made Chair in 
that supplementary statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, you have come to that 
concession between February and July this year.  Is that 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 58 of 232 
 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because your first statement before this 
Commission before the evidence of Mr Sokombela, you did 
not make that concession, did you? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, at that time Chair I have reviewed the 
work that was performed.  I had considered what were also 
required of us and it was my view then Chair that we had 
done sufficient. 
 
Chair, subsequent to the initial statement Chair I did go 
10 
back.  We did go back to the PFMA.  We did go back to our 
records and we considered what was required of us in terms 
of the IRBA guide from the office of the general auditor. 
 
And Chair, it became clear that we had erred and we 
should 
have 
elevated 
some 
of 
those 
items 
of 
none-
compliance Chair to the... of the report. 
 
But Chair, I think it is important to know that those items 
were duly identified, were elevated to management.  We 
sought their responses in that regard. 
 
And those matters were elevated to the audit committee, 
20 
those who were charged with governance. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, I will be returning to this topic.  
At the moment I am still setting the sort of background of 
your understanding of the audit.   
 
You see, Mr Sokombela indicated that what his team did 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 59 of 232 
 
when they moved in for the 2017 audit in order to satisfy 
themselves as to the disclosure of irregular expenditure in 
the financial statements. 
 
It is quite a detailed exercise.  He said they would go.  
They would review tender files.  Let me add, when they could 
find them because a substantial part of his evidence was 
also that they simply could not find whole reams of the 
contracts which they were required to audit. 
 
He had to sent teams in to try and locate documents 
because, on his version, the state of internal control was in 
10 
disarray. 
 
But when he was able to find complete tender files, I 
was very interest in the language he said.  He said they 
would re-perform the awarding of those tenders. 
 
That is how seriously he took the obligation to satisfy 
himself that the figure he is seeing in the financial 
statements 
for 
irregular 
expenditure 
is 
accurate, 
is 
verifiable.  Did you do anything of that sort? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as part of the audit and in order to 
comply with the PFMA, we have to perform procurement and 
20 
contact management.  Chair, that work was performed. 
 
As I indicate Chair.  Not only was worked performed.  
We found deviations which we reported to management and 
to the audit committee. 
 
And Chair, after... I cannot comment on the amount of 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 60 of 232 
 
work or the changes that Mr Sokombela experienced when 
he performed his audit because, as you will appreciate 
Chair, it was months after we had been there. 
 
So Chair, a lot can happen in that in that interim period.  
However, as I indicate Chair, from the work that we 
performed on procurement and contract management, we did 
find deviations which we elevated to the audit committee and 
raise our concerns with management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  I think the... I think Ms Hofmeyr’s 
question is aimed at establishing whether your approach to 
10 
the performance of these duties may have been the same as 
that of mister... was it Mr Sokombela? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because Ms Hofmeyr is saying Mr 
Sokombela said the way they approach it was that they 
looked at the files and effectively, as I understand the 
position, said, “Would we have done this?  Is this the right 
way to do it in terms of tenders and bids?” 
 
So she seeks to establish whether you also adopted the 
same approach or did you adopt a different approach?  That 
20 
is what she seeks to establish. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I can confirm that the approach was 
guided by the regulations or have regard... regarded with the 
...[indistinct] from the office of the audit general on how to 
perform work on procurement and contact management.   
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 61 of 232 
 
 
So our approach would have been the same.  Chair, 
what certainly be different.  It would have been, for example, 
the size of samples that were selected. 
 
And Chair, the challenge with audit samples is that, the 
audit, it had limitations.  Is that you can come in, see what 
your sample and find a few deviations.   
 
A different auditor can... or person come in, see a 
different sample with the outcome would be fairly different.  
Especially considering the size or the number of contracts 
that exist in a place like South African Airways Chair.  Fairly 
10 
big numbers.   
 
So Chair, I cannot comment on these sample size but 
certainly I can confirm that we did receive the guidance from 
the AGM for guidance Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, the question had nothing to do 
with sample holding.  I am going to come to that because I 
know it is a big part of your evidence today to distinguish 
different samples. 
 
What I was interested in what the Chair confirmed was, 
did you adopt the method that Mr Sokombela adopted?  Did 
20 
you go and find tenders that had been awarded and re-
performed the award of those tenders? 
 
And by that he meant, go and get the files.  See how the 
bid started.  See how it was responded to.  See how it was 
awarded.  See whether the person who eventually awarded it 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 62 of 232 
 
had the delegation of authority. 
 
Did you re-perform the awarding of the contracts that 
you determined necessary to audit? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, insofar as it was in line with the 
guidance that we received from the office of the AG on how 
to audit procurement and contract information.  That is 
correct Chair.  That is the approach that we took. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
I 
am 
concerned 
about 
the 
qualification.  [laughs]  You said, insofar as it was in line 
with... so I think what Ms Hofmeyr is looking at is.  Let me 
10 
assume that whether it is sampling or whatever, leads you to 
a certain contract that SAA awarded to Mr Mothibe, okay? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you want to look at how that contract 
was awarded. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, Chair.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you... once you have identified that 
contract as one of the matters that you must look at, would 
you then go through the various stages or requirements to 
say, SAA was required to do A, B, C, D for this contract to 
20 
have been awarded properly. 
 
Did they do A, B, C, D properly?  And if you then 
concluded that that was done properly, then you say, “Okay, I 
have taken care of this”. 
 
Or would you, for example, despite knowing that SAA 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 63 of 232 
 
was supposed to do A, B, C, D, would you just look at A and 
B and if you are happy with that you do not look at C and D? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, what you have described and you 
must understand... now I understand what Ms Hofmeyr is 
looking for.  We would have done that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did that.  So you would look at A, B, 
C and D. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to speak.  Okay, alright, I hope that 
is helpful, ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, it does.  Mr Mothibe, how did 
you do that if you could not find the tender files? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I indicated, Chair, for the simple 
stuff we had selected we followed that through and where 
there were challenges and there were deviations, we found 
them and we raised them with management and with the 
audit committee, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that suggest that you found files in 
regard to all the contracts you looked at because I think 
Ms Hofmeyr ’s question is, how would you have looked at A, 
20 
B, C, D, in my kind of an example, if you did not find the 
files? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, if one looks at 
the report that we sent through to management and to 
audit committee.  We did mention areas where we could 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 64 of 232 
 
not 
be 
provided 
with 
files 
and 
therefore, 
we 
would 
obviously not have been able to complete that process.  
Hence, Chair, I do indicate we followed the guidance on 
how to perform the audit of procurement and contract 
management.  Where we found the files, we obviously able 
to perform every single test but there were areas where we 
could not be provided with the files and so the test failed 
and we reported that matter to management.  We asked a 
follow-up 
and 
we 
reported 
the 
matter 
to 
the 
audit 
committee. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say without the 
files you cannot perform – you could not perform that job, 
your job as an auditor? 
MR MOTHIBE:    Yes, Chair, without the file then you are 
not able to complete the necessary steps, that is correct, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  You comment about the 
absence of the file or not being provided with the file but 
you cannot actually do what you are supposed to do, 
without the file.  You cannot perform the actual job that you 
20 
wanted to do. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   And it is for that reason that we elevated – 
we raised an issue with management. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 65 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOTHIBE:   And we elevated the matter to the audit 
committee and, chair, I think as I allude to in our summary 
statement, we acknowledge that we should have – there 
was that next step of  - in the audit opinion mentioning 
those noncompliance issues with the PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is that is quite an important one, 
is it not, Mr Mothibe, because it is one thing for you to 
need to do the work that is required of you to find that you 
10 
are inhibited in doing that because you cannot find tender 
files to report that to management and the audit and risk 
committee but then not take it any further, that would be a 
dereliction of your duty, would it not? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I would not go as far as to say it is 
a dereliction of duty because we – certainly there are 
reporting steps that we were able to carry out, Chair.  And 
as I do indicate, Chair, we did concern to the fact that that 
last step should have been carried out.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is identifying the matter in the audit 
opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but if you – if it was your duty to do 
that last step and you did not do it, why is that not a 
dereliction of duty because I think you do not concede to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 66 of 232 
 
Ms Hofmeyr ’s question that when she asked was it not a 
dereliction of duty?  So my question is, since you do 
accept that that last step should have been done and it 
was not done, so my question is, which is basically Ms 
Hofmeyr ’s question, why was that not a – why do not 
regard that as a dereliction of duty? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, can I think about that because, I 
guess, Chair, I am trying to wrap my mind around 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   That it is a dereliction of duty because it 
could mean something else, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, when …[intervenes] 
MR MOTHIBE:   I would like to wrap my mind around that, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  Ms Hofmeyr can 
come back to it later on, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, the problem with that last step, 
Mr Mothibe, I would like to put to you and have your 
comment on, is if you do not focus on and perform your 
20 
duty in the last step, then your audit opinion is going to be 
incorrect, is it not? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the audit opinion, in so far as it 
talks about compliance with laws and regulations, Chair, 
would be incorrect. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 67 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because you cannot satisfy yourself that 
there has been compliance because you have not got the 
tender 
file 
and 
although 
you 
have 
reported 
it 
to 
management and ARC, the audit and risk committee, you 
did not receive any meaningful response to that, did you? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, in performing the work and in 
identifying the issues and elevating them to the audit 
committee we had already identified that it is in fact 
noncompliance with the PFMA.  As I do indicate, Chair, 
that last step is what was missing, that is where we erred 
10 
in not informing the shareholders in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, please do not forget your 
next question, I just want to go back to the dereliction of 
duty aspect. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we do not call it dereliction of duty but 
call it omission of duty are you comfortable to concede 
that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, it was omission, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was an omission of duty. 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   It was an omission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr, 
that does not preclude you from coming back to the 
question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 68 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought I would – yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I note that we 
are close to the tea break but I would like to just conclude 
on one point, if I may.  Mr Mothibe, I understood your last 
answer before the Chair ’s question to be that you had 
identified 
noncompliance, 
you 
had 
raised 
it 
with 
management and the audit and risk committee but then I 
want to put to you, if that is so and you are not satisfied 
that there has then been compliance because of the 
response you get, it is then misleading to the public, is it 
10 
not, to sign an audit report which says that there has been 
compliance, there has not – we do not identify any 
instances of material noncompliance with applicable laws 
and regulations.  Do you accept that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, after we have completed our work, 
when we put our audit opportunity together, we considered 
all the evidence that had been provided for audit purposes 
and 
applied 
judgment 
on 
some 
of 
these 
issues 
of 
noncompliance and other matters, in fact, Chair, as a 
whole.  And at that stage, Chair, our view was that there 
20 
was no material noncompliance and I think, Chair, it is 
important to note that we had – we are not saying that 
there was no compliance, I guess, Chair, we were saying 
that there was no material noncompliance.  Chair, again, I 
would refer one to the supplementary statement because 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 69 of 232 
 
we do concede that there was an error in judgment, we 
should have identified those matters as material areas of 
noncompliance. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and so then when you stated in your 
audit report, we did not identify any instances of material 
noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations that 
was misleading. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, that portion, Chair, was not correct, 
Chair, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, I see were are just at 
10 
quarter past, if it is a convenient time to take the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will take the short adjournment, 
we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we may continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mothibe, I would 
like to now move to the issue of PwC and Nkonki’s 
appointment to audit SAA and I have looked at your 
statement and what it says on this topic and it may be that 
20 
we can move fairly swiftly.  That will depend on whether 
you and I are on the same page about certain aspects 
upfront.  So let me ask first of all, do you accept that the 
tender process that was run by SAA for the appointment of 
auditors for 2012 financial year applied only to that year? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 70 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I think I will say that my 
understanding was that it was for a period of five years, if 
my memory served me right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you have now been shown the 
documents that show that it was a tender for only one year, 
is that correct?. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I have seen the award letter which 
talks of they were only being awarded for 2011/2012 
financial year. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So as you sit here today do you accept 
10 
that they were only awarded – they, being PwC and Nkonki 
were appointed for only one year pursuant to a tender 
process. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, there were – my understanding was 
that we awarded the tender for five years.  However, it is 
subject to annual concurrence by the audit committee – 
sorry, 
apologies, 
by 
the 
Auditor-General 
and 
that 
appointment also has got to be confirmed annually by the 
company at the Annual General Meeting as required by the 
Companies Act. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, how could you form that 
view based on the tender – the award letter? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I did indicate in my statement, 
the appointment of PwC and Nkonki predates my joining 
the South African Airways – or rather PwC audit team.  
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 71 of 232 
 
When I had to go the assignment I understood that the 
award was for five years but also understood very well that 
it is subject to annual concurrence by the office of the AG 
and confirmation at every Annual General Meeting by the 
client because the client reserves the right to review the 
appointment, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think Ms Hofmeyr ’s question is 
whether as you sit there today you accept or you do not 
accept 
that 
the 
appointment 
was 
for 
one 
year 
so 
distinguishing it from what you may have understood when 
10 
you joined the team. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the award letter said one year and, 
Chair, from my understanding it is one year because it had 
to be renewed on an annual basis but the term would have 
been for five years.  So that appointment has to be 
confirmed by the client at the AGM and had to seek 
concurrence also with the AG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your evidence that you do not 
accept that the appointment for one year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I am not too sure that one can read 
20 
that letter as plainly as that because my understanding, 
Chair, is that they have to – you cannot appoint for more 
than one year, you have to seek concurrence and approval 
at every AGM, so the appointment would, as I understand 
it, Chair, would list that one year that we appointed and 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 72 of 232 
 
then once there is concurrence and approval then another 
one confirms the next year, as it is, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think Ms Hofmeyr will take us to 
the actual letter and then – yes, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mothibe, I had 
hoped that we would be able to move through this quickly 
but it appears that we are not going to be.  Do you know 
that the request for proposal to which PwC responded 
related only to an audit for the 2012 financial year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, maybe if Ms Hofmeyr could refer to 
10 
the file. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us find it in – it is in DD19C as we 
have now numbered it from page 59. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I have got it, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now that is a document that appears at 
page 59: 
“Bid 
document, 
request 
for 
proposal 
for 
the 
provision of external audit services to SAA Group.” 
20 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then if you turn to page 77, you will 
see there the scope of work is identified. Do you have 
that?   
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 73 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in the second - it tells you that: 
“The 
objective 
of 
the 
audit 
as 
a 
statutory 
requirement is the expression of an opinion on 
fairness in all material respects of SAA’s financial 
statements 
in 
conformity 
with 
International 
Financial Reporting Standards.” 
And then the second sentence says: 
“The audit for the financial year ending 31 March 
2012 have to be conducted in accordance with the 
10 
Internal Standards on Auditing.” 
And then it gives you the focus areas for the audit for the 
financial year ending 31 March 2012.  Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you now accept that the request for 
proposal related to the audit for the financial year ending 
31 Mach 2012? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, that is how it reads, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You accept that.  And then that was 
followed up by the award letter to PwC, that was clear on 
20 
this point.  You will find it at the same bundle page 115. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I have got it, Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
This 
is 
a 
letter 
of 
award 
to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
from 
the 
Chief 
Procurement 
Officer of South African Airways; it is dated 21 December 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 74 of 232 
 
2011.  Please can you read the first paragraph of the letter 
into the record? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The one that starts: 
“With reference to the above…” 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, indeed, thank you. 
MR MOTHIBE:    
“With reference to the above request for proposal 
South African Airways Limited, SAA would like to 
congratulate 
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
above 
services 
as 
joint 
external 
10 
auditors with Nkonki Incorporated for our 2011/2012 
financial year.” 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is an award for one year, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, that is how it reads. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so do you now accept that PwC and 
Nkonki were only appointed for a single year after the 
tender process that preceded this letter? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, that is how the letter reads but I do 
believe it is important to note that companies do not 
change just annually and from my understanding, as PwC, 
20 
certainly was that the audit engagement would be for a 
period of five years.   
Chair, it is not economically viable, certainly from 
our side, to respond to a tender or a tender of this size, of 
this complexity, if it was only going to be performed for a 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 75 of 232 
 
period of one year.  In the first year of engagement, Chair, 
there is a lot of investment that takes place with regards to 
understanding the client, the complexities that come with it 
and, Chair, as I do indicate, from a commercial perspective 
you certainly would not be responding to an RFP of this 
magnitude if it was only for one year. 
Also importantly, Chair, running a tender process 
for audit services on an annual basis takes a lot of time 
not only for respondents but also for the client and, Chair, 
it would be very disruptive for a client to be engaging with 
10 
new auditors every single year.  As you appreciate, Chair 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Mothibe, I think both Ms 
Hofmeyr and I understand what you are saying. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think another witness has said 
something similar. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the question is, irrespective of 
whether you consider it viable or not viable to – for an 
20 
entity such as SAA to appoint auditors for one year, the 
question is whether you accept that in this case the 
appointment was for one year.  Right or wrong, but that is 
what happened. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, Chair, that I have agreed to, Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 76 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I thought it was important just to bring 
some perspective, Chair, to the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no, that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, then I would like to just pick 
up on something you were saying in that context setting, 
you – as I have it, you said something like it would not 
make sense for PwC to respond to an RFP of this 
magnitude if it was not for something like a duration of five 
years.  Did I have your evidence correct? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, what I mean is, any audit firm – I 
spoke PwC because obviously, Chair, I do work for PwC, 
but I would say it would not be commercially viable for any 
audit firm to respond especially for a company this size, 
this magnitude, at this complexity.  It would just be not 
viable if it was only for a period of one year. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then why did PwC bid for one year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, it goes back that our understanding 
was that it would have been for a period of five years, 
which is line also with the rotation period of a partner as 
20 
lay out in the Companies Act, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, how did somebody in PwC 
read a request for bid confined to one year, receive an 
award letter for one year and form the view that it was 
getting to do audit work for years?  How does that happen? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 77 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words, what is the basis for 
you or PwC to have thought that this was for five years 
when the request for proposals was talking about one year 
and the letter for appointment was talking about one year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I do indicate – I did indicate 
earlier this predated my involvement.  However, Chair, it is 
standard practice, always practice that when you get an 
audit only – or an audit, it is for a period of longer than 
one year.  We have not seen, Chair, anywhere where an 
10 
audit was awarded for one year only, Chair, that does not 
happen in practice, Char. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you think PwC bid for one year and 
hoped it might be able to get extensions of that one year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I do indicate, we were also alive 
to the fact that to the extent that the subsequent years’ 
audits 
are 
with 
PwC 
they 
will 
still 
be 
subject 
to 
concurrence by the office of the AG and confirmation at the 
AGM.  So there is still a process that is followed in that 
20 
regard. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what about the process of lawful 
procurement?  Would PwC not have to subject itself to 
another procurement process if all it was appointed to 
initially was on year? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 78 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the procurement process is run by 
South African Airways and not by PwC, Chair, so I am not 
too sure I can speculate in that regard, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you said that – I am putting it in 
my own words, I am paraphrasing what you are saying, that 
there was going to be – or there were going to be annual 
renewals.  So the question then is, should those renewals 
not have been subject to a public – open public tender and 
I think your answer is SAA would run that but I think Ms 
Hofmeyr probably wants to follow up on that. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I agree it is for SAA to run the process, 
what I am trying to understand is, PwC’s thinking – 
because your evidence before this Commission is it is not 
commercially viable for audit firms to bid for only one 
year ’s audit, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, I said only on this magnitude and it is 
something that we do not see in practice. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And then I said well, how then did 
PwC go about its approach here because it bids for one 
year, it gets awarded for only one year and I have asked 
20 
you, did it think it would simply be able to extend each 
year or get appointed for further years?   
And I understood your answer to be yes because 
there is a process where the Auditor-General has to yearly 
confirm his agreement with that appointment.  Do I have 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 79 of 232 
 
your evidence correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I indicated, there are areas here 
which 
predate 
my 
involvement 
but 
certainly 
the 
understanding was that the audit for a period of longer 
than one year subject to approvals. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Yes 
but 
do 
you 
accept 
that 
if 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am sorry, I am not sure that I 
understood that.  Just repeat that last point? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
 
I 
was 
saying, 
Chair, 
that 
my 
10 
understanding, as I indicated, was that the award of the 
audit was for a period of longer than – not one year but 
five years and however, it will still be subject to approvals 
and we do take comfort in the fact that the office of the AG 
gave concurrence after the company appointed PwC and 
Nkonki at its Annual General Meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, do you accept that when a 
state owned enterprise like SAA appoints an external 
auditor it is procuring services? 
MR MOTHIBE:   It is a recurring service, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And do you accept that the procurement 
of services by a state owned enterprise like SAA must be 
preceded by a tender process? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, Chair, which tender process was 
entered into in 2011, it was responded [inaudible – 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 80 of 232 
 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, for a single year, Mr Mothibe, is 
that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I shared with Ms Hofmeyr my 
understanding of what it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us – please do not forget your 
line of thinking, Ms Hofmeyr.  Let us put this to bed if we 
have not done so, by which I mean let us see whether 
there is agreement exactly on what the position was.  
We now know that the request for proposals was for 
10 
one financial year, 2011/2012, okay?  And you accept that 
but you say, if I understand you correctly, you had an 
understanding 
– 
you 
had 
an 
understanding 
that 
the 
appointment was for five years. 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Subject to annual approvals or renewals, 
is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Now 
where 
did 
you 
get 
this 
understanding from that the appointment was for five years 
20 
when the request for proposal said one year, the letter of 
appointment said one year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, if you recall, I did indicate I was not 
part of the process, I became part of an audit team for the 
2014 financial year.  So we had already signed off jointly 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 81 of 232 
 
with Nkonki the 2012 and the 2013.   
So as part of the handover process we discussed – 
we talk about what our duty and our mandate was and, 
Chair, it was confirmed that our understanding was that we 
would be – we are appointed for a period of five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your understanding is based on what, 
the team, the PwC team responsible for auditing SAA 
conveyed to you at the time. 
MR MOTHIBE:   And Chair, also what we have experienced 
in what happens in the industry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well one, certainly the team, the 
PwC team that was assigned to SAA conveyed that to you, 
and that is number one.  Number two, you say there is a 
practice 
in 
the 
industry 
that 
also 
informed 
your 
understanding, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is that practice? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, that typically when you appoint 
auditors it would be for a – it would not be – certainly not 
for a period of one year only, Chair, and importantly, there 
20 
is that annual reappointment approval at the AGM, Annual 
General Meeting of the company which is a requirement of 
the Companies Act, Chair, that that happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your evidence that the practice in the 
industry is that an auditing firm would be awarded a job 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 82 of 232 
 
such as this and on paper it would be written one year but 
everybody else knows that it is not going to be for one 
year, it was going to be for five years or three years.  Is 
that what you are saying? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is my understanding, Chair, that is 
what I am saying, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So even if the entity makes it clear that 
this is for one year, you would take that you have been 
awarded a contract for five years. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I would think there would also be 
10 
discussions with the entity.  Once you were appointed you 
obviously would give the entity to understand your – the 
exact mandate, how long it is, but as I indicate, Chair, as 
the letter stands, I do agree it says 2012, because I do 
believe it should be because there is a requirement to have 
an annual reconfirmation by the AGM and by the – of the 
AG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, I want to move you to a new 
document in a moment but I just want to understand this 
20 
practice in the industry.  Is that a practice related to 
private companies or to state owned enterprises? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, even with private companies we 
would – an audit firm would not respond to a request or 
proposals if the appointment would only be for one year.  
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 83 of 232 
 
That would not happen, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let me be clearer with my question, I 
can completely understand in a private company context 
why it would be the case that even though you are 
appointed for one year you have some reliance on an 
industry practice that at the next Annual General Meeting 
you will be appointed again, that is private companies. 
 
State 
owned 
enterprises 
are 
regulated 
by 
the 
PFMA, they have to go out on tender before they procure 
services and I am trying to understand whether the industry 
10 
practice to which you speak is also an industry practice for 
the state owned enterprise who need to be audited.   
Do they generally roll over their audits when they 
go out on tender only for one year?  Is it your experience 
that they continue to extend those? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I have not seen – even the state 
owned enterprises that keep auditors only for one year.  I 
have not seen that, certainly, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   My question is different but go ahead, 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you go back to your question 
before I ask. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I want to understand this practice 
because it is quite important in a state owned enterprise 
context.  Are you aware of a practice whereby state owned 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 84 of 232 
 
enterprises run tender processes only for a year but it is 
understood by the industry that that is for a longer period 
of three, four, five years? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I am not sure if I can answer that 
question because I can talk to requests or proposals that I 
had responded to, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me put it this way. You talked about 
a practice that you understand to be there in the industry. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So Ms Hofmeyr ’s question is 
10 
whether that practice that informed your understanding, 
does it include – does it apply to state owned enterprises 
or is this a question of you may have been aware of a 
practice that applies to the private sector but you invoked 
it in the context of a public enterprise without knowing that 
in the public sector – without knowing whether there is 
such a practice in the public sector? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Apologies for the delay, I am just to reflect 
on what one has observed, Chair.  Chair, I do believe even 
in the public sector an appointment of one year is – as I 
20 
indicated, it is not one that I had seen, Chair, I have not 
seen that and the expectation …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the question is about the 
practice.  So, in other words, as you sit there, are you able 
to say this practice that I am talking about exists in the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 85 of 232 
 
public sector as well or is your position that you are not 
sure whether it exists in the public sector but you know 
that it exists in the private sector?  Is it the latter? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Maybe I have to say the latter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, you made the point earlier 
procurement is the responsibility of SAA and I readily 
accept that but what I would like to just draw your attention 
to is that it is customary for SOEs to devise tender 
processes for the appointment of their auditors for five 
10 
years.   
I suspect for the very reasons you have given, 
right?  And the reason I saw that with confidence is 
because we in our investigations have been able to find 
one of the tenders that Eskom put out, for example, in 
2015 for its audit services and you will find that in DD19C 
at page 149.  Let me just be clear, it begins at page 143, it 
is the Eskom RFP for audit services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 149? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It starts at 143, Chair, just so that we 
20 
can identify the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is the November 2015 Eskom RFP 
for professional services including audit services and if 
you go in it at page 149.   
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 86 of 232 
 
I will not bore you with all the details of this RFP, 
Mr Mothibe, but it is an RFP for professional services 
including audit services and at paragraph 4.3 on that page 
there are stipulated additional conditions of tender and 
what Eskom does here – I suspect you might say is 
sensible – because Eskom says: 
“The appointment will be made for period of five 
years relating to the audit of five financial years 
from 2014 to 2015 financial year onwards subject to 
the following conditions.” 
10 
And if you go to the last of the bullets there, this is the 
point that you have emphasised about the Auditor-General.  
What Eskom does is it says: 
“The 
final 
condition 
is 
there 
must 
be 
annual 
consultation with the Auditor-General before the 
appointment for a specific year is finalised.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what I put to you is, there is a way 
for state owned enterprises to procure the services of 
20 
auditors for more than one year and I am suggesting this is 
an example of that.  Do you accept that that is so? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, this is a good example, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it should be contrasted, I put to you, 
with the request for proposal that went out from SAA in 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 87 of 232 
 
2011 because SAA’s 2011 request for proposal looked 
nothing like this, did it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The SAA RFP did not contain this clause, 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And, Mr Mothibe, you said that when you 
came in in 2014 – and I am mindful to the fact that you 
were not there from the beginning, but when you came in in 
2014 you were led to understand that this was an 
appointment for five years, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is the understanding that I had, 
10 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and you got it from your team, is 
that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And as part of the audit procedures that 
your team were following, were they reviewing BAC 
minutes and board minutes in the course of their audit 
procedures? 
MR MOTHIBE:   They would have done so, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So do you know why they did not pick up 
20 
a Bid Adjudication Committee minute in 2012 that raised 
concerns about the fact that the appointment of the 
auditors for the 2013 year had not gone through a 
procurement process? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I was not part of the team in 2012 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 88 of 232 
 
so I cannot comment on that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In preparing for your evidence today 
have you raised any questions with your colleagues about 
why they might not have picked that up? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I did indicate, remember, Chair, 
you said that our understanding was that it was for a 
period of five years, so if one thinks about it, Chair, there 
would not be any bid adjudication because the audit would 
have been for five years, as we understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you might have I misunderstood 
10 
the question.   
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether in preparing for 
giving evidence today you did pick up that the PwC team 
did not pick up the issue of there having been no open 
tender.   
Or, unless I misunderstood, then your answer, 
maybe you are saying your answer is you could not have 
picked that up because your understanding was that it was 
for five years and if it was for five years …[intervenes] 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   It would not be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …the tender that had been done at the 
beginning would be applicable for all the years. 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 89 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what I am trying to probe at the 
moment is how your team formed this understanding that it 
was for five years because part of the audit procedures is 
to look at minutes, right?  And I want to now take you to 
the Bid Adjudication Committee minute that appears in 
DDC at page 117.  This is - Mr Mothibe, do you have it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I have it, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is a decision record of a meeting of 
the Bid Adjudication Committee of SAA dated the 7 
December 2012.  Do you see that at the top of the page? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in the second block on that page 
there is a heading:. 
“Project description or purpose” 
And what it records there, I will just read it into the 
record:” 
“Is 
to 
notify 
the 
BAC 
of 
the 
support 
and 
recommendation by the audit committee to the SAA 
board 
of 
directors 
of 
the 
extension 
and 
reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Nkonki 
20 
Incorporated as the joint external auditors for the 
SAA 
Group 
excluding 
Mango 
Airlines 
for 
the 
2012/2013 financial year at an estimated cost of 
R16 838 850.” 
Do you see that? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 90 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now that is the year after the year for 
which the tender process was run, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And your team, as I understand the 
procedures, would have been looking at this minutes 
amongst others and what I want to understand from you is 
how they could have missed what is reflected at the bottom 
of that page under the heading: 
“Conditions or follow-up actions.” 
10 
That is written in hand and I will read it into the record: 
“BAC noted that the normal defined and approved 
procedures in line with SCM policy and DOA was 
not followed.  The head of GSM should escalate to 
the internal audit as the process was not correctly 
followed.  BAC aware that this has been approved 
by the AGM and supported by the audit committee.  
Business should clarify the original contract period 
and provide additional information on the process 
followed.” 
20 
How did the PwC team miss when it was going through 
these minutes this recordal, do you think? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
 
Chair, 
this 
minute 
predates 
my 
involvement so it is a – I am not sure that I am able to do 
that.  If I respond, Chair, I will be speculating. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 91 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   And if I am allowed to speculate, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOTHIBE:   It might be because it did not form part of 
their sample because whilst you do review minutes and 
review minutes and you pick up – you do pick up items 
from minutes that you would want to audit.  There is 
different criteria that you use to pick them up and it could 
be that this letter, as related to the work that happened, it 
was not part of the sample that they would have looked at. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   But, Chair, as I have indicated, let us say 
that is speculating, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine. 
MR MOTHIBE:   It is not fair to do so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  Let me ask this question, 
bearing 
in 
mind 
that 
you 
were 
not 
there 
at 
the 
commencement of PwC’s involvement at SAA, I take it that 
the team would not have started the work without PwC 
team, would not have started the work without having seen 
20 
the letters of appointment or at least the leader of the 
team, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And now that we know that the 
letter of appointment made it clear it was for one financial 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 92 of 232 
 
year, sitting there, are you able to understand how 
somebody would have seen that letter saying one year 
would say to you we have been appointed for five years?  
Now I am not suggesting that the person who told you is 
the leader of the team but I am just assuming that at least 
the leader of the team would have seen the letter of 
appointment.  If he had seen the letter, would you have any 
understanding how he would say – or anybody who had 
seen it would say to you we have been appointed for five 
years?  You might be able to say I do not understand why 
10 
anybody who would have seen the letter would tell me it is 
for five years or you might say because of A, B, C, D that I 
am aware of, I can understand why somebody who had 
seen the letter would tell me that the appointment is for 
five years.  That is what I am interested in. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, Chair, I understand your question.  
Chair, the appointment was for 2011/2012, that initial 
letter.  Subsequent to that there was another appointment 
for the year 2012/2013, so when I became involved, we 
had also already been appointed for 2013/2014 because as 
20 
I indicated, Chair, I only joined the team halfway during the 
2014 financial year.  So as you can appreciate, Chair, with 
the passage of time and with the subsequent appointments 
post the first one, I can understand why the view was that 
it was a period of five years because that appointment, the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 93 of 232 
 
initial appointment had been reconfirmed for another two 
years, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if one is basing the statement that 
PwC was appointed for five years, on what you are saying, 
it would not be on the basis of the letter of appointment, is 
it not?  Saying that PwC was appointed for five years could 
not be on the basis of the letter of appointment, it has to 
be on the – it had to be on the basis of something else 
because the letter of appointment was quite clear. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the letter of appointment is issued 
10 
on an annual basis, Chair, so for the subsequent year 
there would have been another letter issued confirming 
appointment, same as all subsequent years, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but let us take it step by step.  Do 
you agree with me that the letter of appointment to which 
we have made reference earlier which said one year… 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …could not form the basis for anybody 
to say PwC was appointed for five years.  If there was a 
basis for saying that, it must be something else, not the 
20 
letter.  You agree with that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I heard you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And I seem to understand you to 
say there were annual letters of appointment – or I do not 
know whether that is what you would call them, every year.  
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 94 of 232 
 
Now would those annual letters be the basis for anybody to 
say PwC was appointed for five years? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I indicated, that was my 
understanding and, Chair, those further appointments, if 
anything, they would confirm the understanding that we 
were certainly appointed for a period of longer than one 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because, you see, if reliance is placed 
on those annual letters, I would imagine that what would 
happened is that somebody would say well, we have been 
10 
appointed one year at a time, every year we get appointed.  
So the duration of appointment is no longer than one year 
at any time.  In other words, this year our obligation is for 
this year.  Whether we will have any obligations, any job in 
regard to SAA next year, we do not know, we will know 
when we have been given another letter.  Would you go 
along with that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do understand you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then just to return to the BAC 
20 
Committee record, I understand you to say it might have 
been missed because it wasn’t in the sample.   You do not 
know that as a fact do you? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair hence I indicated it is – because this 
predates my involvement, it is difficult for me to respond to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 95 of 232 
 
a question like that Chair.   Whatever I say would amount 
to speculation Chair which I do not believe it is fair on the 
person who is doing the work. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you had seen a minute like this would 
you have been concerned that the appointment of PwC and 
Nkonki since the 2012 financial year was irregular? 
MR MOTHIBE:   If I saw this I would raise, I would be 
concerned, that is correct Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 And 
would 
you 
accept 
that 
the 
appointments for the 2013 to 2016 financial year then 
10 
would have constituted irregular expenditure under the 
PFMA. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair based on the understanding that Ms 
Hofmeyr has that would be the case, or certainly Chair 
based on the understanding that I had, because my 
understanding was that it was for a period of five years, I 
would not have thought so Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But with your knowledge now you accept 
that it did constitute irregular expenditure? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair without seeing how this matter was 
20 
finalised, because there is an issue raised here, I am not 
too sure one is able to respond to that.  Secondly Chair 
also 
appreciating 
that 
where 
there 
is 
an 
irregular 
expenditure there is an opportunity for the entity to 
regularise it and have we not seen what they would have 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 96 of 232 
 
done to correct the matter I am not too sure I can be able 
to respond to that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let me in fairness break it down.   We 
have accepted in your evidence that the procuring of audit 
services is procurement that must comply with the PFMA 
for an entity like SAA, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We know that they tendered to provide – 
to obtain audit services for the 2012 financial year, 
correct?   
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We know that they did not tender to 
receive audit services for the years 2013 to 2016, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair there was no official tender process 
run by SAA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and we know that procurement not 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
PFMA 
constitutes 
irregular 
expenditure correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So then I put it to you again the 
20 
appointment of PwC and Nkonki for the 2013 to 2016 
financial years therefore constituted irregular expenditure, 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair that would be correct to the extent 
that there was no process put in place to regularise it/ 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 97 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And do you know what PwC and Nkonki 
were 
paid 
for 
those 
four 
years 
of 
audit 
work 
that 
constituted irregular expenditure? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I do not have the amount off my 
head but it is included in the pack Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will assist you if you are willing to trust 
my calculation abilities Mr Mothibe because I have taken 
each of the payments that we received from SAA for 2013 
to 2016 years for each of Nkonki and PwC and I have 
added them up and the total I got to was R69 760 888, 
10 
does that sound right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mothibe I would just warn you not to 
be very trusting of a lawyer ’s calculation. [laughing] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe let’s do it this way, over the 
lunch break I will direct you to Ms Olipski’s affidavit.  As I 
tally them up it is R69 760 888. 
MR MOTHIBE:   If you say so ma’am. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and if over the break, let me 
just give you the reference so you can go there, her 
affidavit is in DD19C at page 49, if over the break you 
20 
establish that I have made a calculation error you can let 
us know after two o’clock, are you comfortable with that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I am comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She probably got it right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well I am not always sure with 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 98 of 232 
 
calculations but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you must check. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is in the order of R69million I suggest. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I will trust that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
So 
that 
R69million 
of 
irregular 
expenditure 
did 
not 
get 
disclosed 
in 
the 
financial 
statements for the years 2013 to 2016 did it 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
 
Chair 
at 
this 
stage 
there 
is 
an 
understanding because we did not believe it to even be – it 
10 
had not been disclosed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, mmm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Mothibe I would like to 
move ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, if PwC believed that it had 
been awarded a contract for five years, it had been 
appointed for five  years, at [break in audio] that the 
request for proposals told competitors and others in the 
public that whoever was going to be appointed would be 
appointed for one year and if PwC [break in audio] as they 
20 
continued every year to do this work that they were doing, 
they were performing work in circumstances where there 
was irregularity because the request for proposals and the 
letter of appointment said one year, it did not say five 
years and yet they were continuing every year. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 99 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair as I indicate much as the letter said 
one year, the understanding would have been that it was 
all of our opinion, we have never seen, there has never 
been an environment where we saw an appointment of 
auditors being done for one year only. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I understand that, I am sorry to 
interrupt you, I understand that, but my question is you 
ought as PwC, I would imagine, you ought to have paid 
some attention to whether you were performing these 
duties 
under 
a 
regular 
arrangement, 
under 
a 
lawful 
10 
appointment and a lawful appointment you would have 
known must have been that if the invitation, the request for 
proposals said it is for a certain period and you competed 
with your competitors with other people and you competed 
for one period or a period of one year when you get to 
continue and do the work beyond that period it must be 
irregular, because your competitors, call them X, Y, Z, who 
all – let us say and I do not know how many bidders there 
were, but let us say there were two bidders and you 
succeeded X, Y, Z was another bidder, they did not 
20 
succeed, so as far as they are concerned you got a tender 
for one year, now they hear that two years later you are 
still there, three years later you are still there, four years 
later you are still there, but they have been watching for 
any new tenders issued by or requests for proposals issued 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 100 of 232 
 
by SAA.  They must feel aggrieved to say but these people 
were appointed for one year, why are they continuing, why 
are we not given an opportunity, what is happening, and I 
am suggesting that as PwC that ought to have been a 
concern to you as PwC because you knew that the letter of 
appointment said one year, you know that the request for 
proposal said one year. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I would think that Chair as I 
explained my understanding and what we see in practice 
would have covered part of that thing that we have never 
10 
seen a company the size, this complexity, put out an audit 
tender for only one year.  If anything Chair I would think 
that we should be able, which we did, Chair we took 
comfort in the fact that the Auditor General or the AG gave 
concurrence and I do know that as part of the concurrence 
process they do ask about – enquire of the procurement 
process that was followed. 
 
Our appointment was also confirmed at the AGM, 
and at the AGM Chair all those which we governance are 
there and able to raise objections or issues as appropriate, 
20 
but Chair the fact that our appointment was also approved 
or the concurrence did come from the office of the AG, I do 
think we’re able to take comfort on that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me ask this question, if PwC is -
genuine 
understanding 
was 
that 
when 
this 
letter 
of 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 101 of 232 
 
appointment said you are appointed for one year, one 
financial year, it actually didn’t mean that, it meant five 
years because of all the reasons that you have given.  Why 
would PwC not have said to SAA, why do you write one 
year, why don’t you write five years even if it’s subject to 
renewals every year, every year based on whether you 
have done the job properly the previous financial year, why 
would PwC not say, why are you giving us a letter of 
appointment that says one year because, maybe, we all 
know this is for five years, because if PwC has accepted a 
10 
letter that says one year, one financial year, but it’s 
understanding is that this is for five years, SAA would be 
entitled, would they not be, after one year we are 
requesting proposals for the following year and you can’t 
complain because you know you are appointed for one 
year?  So I just have this concern as to, how do you accept 
an appointment on the basis of a letter that says one year 
but you say your understanding as PwC is that this is for 
five years but you don’t point out to say, change this letter 
because you and I know that it’s for five years or we only 
20 
put in a bid on the understanding that it’s for five years?  
So, your letter is – we are not prepared to do this job if 
you are restricting us to one year, we will pull out if you 
are insisting on one year, why didn’t PwC say that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair it will be a bit difficult for me to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 102 of 232 
 
respond to – as I was not part of that initial – I didn’t have 
a responsibility for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry your voice went down again. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Oh, sorry Chair, apologies.  I say Chair, I 
was not part of the process back then Chair so I will not be 
able to – I don’t have a response to that Chair, I don’t have 
a response to that question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I might have to go back and just 
understand why that did not happen Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would you accept it as an expected 
– a natural response that one would have expected from 
PwC to the letter of appointment if their understanding 
was, this is for five years?  Would you accept that, what 
I’m suggesting would be the response that one would 
expect from PwC to say, well you have got it wrong on your 
appointment letter because we – our understanding is that 
we are here for five years and quite frankly if you say one 
year, we think it’s financially – commercially not viable, we 
will pull out? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do understand where the Chair is coming 
from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you/ 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe you made reference to the 
Auditor General’s oversights, are you aware that the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 103 of 232 
 
Auditor General took the view, during the term of your 
appointment, that the appointment of auditors did have to 
follow a procurement process? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, I’m aware that it does follow 
procurement process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And do you recall what the Board of 
SAA’s reaction to that was, when they received that advice 
from the Auditor General? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I don’t recall Chair but I think you are 
talking about – maybe just remind me which year you are 
10 
talking about Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course, in 2015 the Board of SAA 
wanted to move all the auditing services to Nkonki and 
they received advice from the Auditor General that they 
could not do that without following a tender process, do 
you know what the Board’s response to that advice from 
the Auditor General was? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Not off the top of my head Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We’ll go to the minute later because it 
was one of the minutes that I assumed you would have 
20 
been looking at in your audit procedures but just to jump 
ahead, the Board of SAA recorded that it was “strange” 
that the Auditor General required it to go out to tender for 
its audit services, so you share that view of the SAA 
Board, that it was strange that it should be required to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 104 of 232 
 
procure these services in accordance with the PFMA? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do not agree with the view of the Board, 
no. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I don’t know if it’s me alone, 
I’m freezing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have never been so cold in my whole 
life Chair, so it is not just you, it is terribly cold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How far away are we from lunch, thirty 
minutes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I don’t have a difficulty, if it would 
be convenient with us taking an early break now and we try 
and do something in the next hour and return at one thirty 
if that would improve things, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think maybe we should, if we can, 
just persevere for the next thirty minutes and then during 
lunchtime, hopefully, somebody can do something.  I think 
some time back they said they could do something to make 
the room warm so hopefully after lunch – but I think it does 
take quite some time, but I think, let’s persevere if we can. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   With fortitude we’ll do it Chair and we’ll 
make enquiries over the break if there’s something that can 
be done. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes, yes and – ja I think if you have an 
overcoat or something, feel free to…[intervenes].   
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 105 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You may see me return with an overcoat, 
indeed, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe, I want to move from the 
topic of your appointment to the association that PwC had 
with Kwinana and Associates - I suspect somebody might 
have been listening, Chair, it seems we might have been 
spared the freezing air that is circulating in the room, but 
let’s see how it goes.  Right, Mr Mothibe, for this purpose, 
if we can go in your first statement which is in DD19A and 
10 
if you can pick it up at page 12 please. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I have the page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 12 or…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   12 yes, 12, thank you Chair.  Now there 
on that page you have a heading,  payments made by 
Nkonki – oh apologies sorry – oh well I think your heading 
is just slightly inaccurate, you say there, payments made 
by Nkonki to Kwinana and Associates, I’ve only just picked 
that up now because what you deal with here is actually 
payments made by PwC to Kwinana and Associates, is that 
20 
right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is right. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so that’s an error that neither you 
nor I picked up before. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 106 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But what you’re dealing with in this 
section of your statement, as I understand it is the – well 
let’s give the background, the Commission picked up a 
series 
of 
payments 
to 
Kwinana 
and Associates, 
the 
auditing firm of Ms Yakhe Kwinana who was a non-
Executive member of the Board of SAA and the Chair of the 
Audit and Risk Committee and we required of you, in 
producing the statement that you address those payments 
and can I take it that, that’s what you do from paragraph 46 
on that page? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then just to speed things up a bit, I 
just want to be sure that we’re on the same page about the 
facts. As I understand it, there were three potential tenders 
that you bid together with Kwinana and Associates for, is 
that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And, as I have it, the first of those 
occurred in late 2014 early 2015 and you submitted a bid 
with her firm to Eastern Cape Department of Education to 
20 
provide internal audit services, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that bid was unsuccessful, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then, there was a second one, you 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 107 of 232 
 
describe it as being in late 2014 and that related to audit 
work done at PRASA, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair that is correct but Chair, just a 
correction, it was not audit work Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MR MOTHIBE:   No, it was not audit work. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That I did not have correct so it was 
other work, professional services? 
MR MOTHIBE:   It was – just to inform the Commission it 
was work performed by one of our former companies that 
10 
we have since disposed of, Combined Systems, and it was 
in the area of asset verification. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, just give me a moment on that, if 
you don’t mind.  Sorry, so I’m just trying to understand, it 
was a – it was services that Kwinana and Associates 
rendered together with PricewaterhouseCoopers is that 
right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you but not audit work? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair it was not audit work. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, thank you and then the third 
bid was submitted in October of 2015 to provide consulting 
services to the Department of Military Veterans, is that 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That’s correct Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 108 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was also unsuccessful? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, just to summarise, three bids you 
put in jointly, two of them unsuccessful, one of them 
successful, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the total amount paid to Kwinana 
and Associates on the successful bid, can you tell us what 
that was? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The figure, Chair, is R6 187 799.90. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now as I understand your statement Mr 
Mothibe, PwC has a whole internal policy that is in place in 
order to guard against these joint business relationships 
with 
people 
associated 
with 
their 
audit 
clients, 
compromising their independence, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you take us through in your 
statement, what those policies are, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, I do indicate that in my statement 
Chair, that’s correct. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And can you also confirm whether my 
understanding is correct, that PwC permits these joint 
business relationships when there – their materiality and 
significance 
is 
not 
of 
an 
order 
to 
compromise 
independence? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 109 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is the correct statement Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And because of that policy and because 
of 
the 
impact 
for 
independence 
that 
these 
sorts 
of 
associations can have, as I understand your statement, 
PwC took steps to establish from Kwinana and Associates 
whether this work for that audit firm was material or 
significant, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes Chair, we have a – as part of our risk 
management we have an office that looks after joint 
business relationships and before we enter into such 
10 
relationships, Chair, we confirm whether or not – first of all 
Chair, we do integrity checks on the persons involved, 
once we are comfortable Chair, we then confirm that the 
amounts involved – whether or not they are material to 
either PwC or to that entity because if they’re material 
Chair, they may have the effect of impairing one of the 
party’s independence Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what threshold does that internal 
policy set for materiality? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, in terms of the IESB code which is 
20 
an international code, Chair, that we follow and PwC, 
Chair, the threshold that has been set is at 5% of total 
revenues.  So the revenues from this contracts could never 
exceed 5% of PwC’s own revenue in terms of our policy 
and we made similar enquiries of Ms Kwinana in that 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 110 of 232 
 
regard, as to whether or not the said revenues would 
exceed those thresholds. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Yes, 
and 
as 
I 
understand 
your 
statement, 
PwC 
then 
did 
engage 
with 
Kwinana 
and 
Associates in order to establish whether the thresholds 
were met, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it did so at the end of 2014, let’s 
just go there, you’ll find the particular email containing that 
query in DD19C at page 132. 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   I’ve got that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, these are copies of emails 
that you provided to the Commission, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it was after we followed up, having 
read your statement, they weren’t originally attached to the 
statement is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair it was after – on the original 
statement the Commission had not included enquiries as to 
the payments that were made to Ms Kwinana, I think that 
20 
came after our first interaction, so in response to that we 
then provided…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so your statement referred to you 
checking and then we called for the emails disclosing that 
checking, is that correct? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 111 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I want to start at the first email in time, 
which appears at page 132 as we had it.  It’s the bottom 
email in the second half of the page from a person named 
Nicky Wayne, who is that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Nicky Wayne was a manager in our 
Marketing and Business Development Department Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if we pick up the last paragraph in 
that email, you’ll see that Ms Wayne says, 
 
“Please determine if the JBR, I understand that to 
10 
stand for Joint Business Relationship, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   “With PwC will be material for Kwinana,  
if 
he 
fees 
for 
Kwinana 
for 
the 
current 
JBR 
relationship with PwC exceeds 10% of their annual 
turnover, the relationship will be deemed material 
for them”, 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that paragraph Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why is this referring to 10% rather than 
20 
the 5% required under the PwC policy? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The 10%, if my – Chair if my memory 
serves me right, was a threshold that was shared to us by 
Ms Kwinana in terms of how she …[indistinct] on her side. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you apply a 5% risk but she 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 112 of 232 
 
communicated to you, she applies a 10% risk, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, from my reading of this, that is the 
case Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But just hand on, were there interactions 
with Ms Kwinana before this email went out? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the interactions with Ms Kwinana 
would have been by the propose engaging leader on the 
assignment of – who then would have made enquires to me 
as to whether or not I’m aware of – first of all there’s a 
relationship between Ms Kwinana, PwC and whether or not 
10 
there are any issues or not regarding independence. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, let’s just unpack that a bit, are you 
aware of, or did you, yourself have interactions with Ms 
Kwinana before this email was sent, in which she disclosed 
to you 10% is her risk threshold? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the communication in terms of 
determining independence, anything in that space is run by 
a separate Risk Managing Department, I did not have any – 
I did not communicate with Ms Kwinana in that regard. 
There’s an independent, separate office that runs that 
20 
process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how did you come to know the point 
you made a moment ago, that Ms Kwinana’s risk threshold 
was 10%? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, in preparing for this there were 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 113 of 232 
 
daily 
enquiries 
with 
persons 
that 
were 
involved 
to 
understand where we were. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So somebody at PwC, who was part of 
that team, has told you before today that the reason why 
they asked for 10% was because that was Ms Kwinana’s 
threshold, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  From the [Indistinct] yes, that is correct 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is correct, why does PwC apply 
Kwinana’s threshold and not its own threshold? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair the thresholds, there’s different 
thresholds that apply – that we apply.  For Ms Kwinana she 
has got her own code, the PwC goes further than what the 
standards required Chair.  So, we made enquires, we made 
an understanding of what they apply and whether or not 
the 
proposed 
fees 
would 
have 
been 
breaching 
the 
threshold. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But why would PwC whose concerned to 
ensure its own independence accept the threshold of the 
partner, why doesn’t it apply its own threshold? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, this work is carried out by the Risk 
Management Department, I’m not privy to the details of 
what goes into that process.  I have to take comfort on the 
work that is performed by the back office. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is it permissible under the PwC policy to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 114 of 232 
 
simply apply the threshold of the partner? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, it is permissible, if it is not 
permissible we would not have proceeded with the joint 
business relationship. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you direct me to where in the policy 
it says that’s permissible? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I’ll have to go and -  maybe during 
the break Chair, we’ll have to look at where we can deal 
with that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because let me tell you, I have not found 
10 
it in the portions of the policy that you’ve provided to the 
Commission.  What if the audit – the potential business 
partners threshold was 50%, would you apply it?    
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I would have to take guidance, we 
would obviously – the Risk Management Department has 
got guidelines that they follow and based on the guidelines 
they would then have made their recommendation and we 
would have followed that recommendation Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Are you aware of what Kwinana and 
Associates response was to that enquiry made by Ms 
20 
Wayne in December of 2014? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, if my memory serves me right, they 
confirmed that the revenue should be below that 10% 
threshold. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well let’s go to it, in particular, you’ll 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 115 of 232 
 
find it in DD19C at page 131.  It’s at the bottom of that 
page, the relevant email, it’s from somebody named Lumka 
Goniwe, do you know Ms Goniwe?   
MR MOTHIBE:   No, I do not know Ms Goniwe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you do not know that she’s related 
to Ms Kwinana? 
MR MOTHIBE:   No, I’m not aware of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you’ll see the subject there is, 
Department of Education Internal Audit, Kwinana JBR 
query, do you see that? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, this related to that first tender that 
you bid, together with Kwinana and Associates for, is that 
right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, that is right yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that was the one that was 
unsuccessful, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   This one was unsuccessful, yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what Ms Goniwe records there, I’ll 
just read it into the record for convenience is, 
20 
“Good morning, Nishan, we’ve calculated our fees 
to be in the region of – oh sorry R4.1million 
excluding 
VAT, 
I 
confirm 
that 
Kwinana 
and 
Associates turnover is more than R50million, the 
BEE certificate reflects Kwinana and Associates 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 116 of 232 
 
before the demerger with Kwinana Equifin, I also 
confirm that Yakhe is a non-Executive Director of 
SAA, I hope you find this in order”, 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I see that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And can we take it that PwC did find this 
in order because it proceeded to bid with Kwinana and 
Associates? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes I do indicate, Chair, the work would 
have been performed by the Risk Management Department 
10 
that looks after Joint Business Relationships, Chair, and 
one would have taken comfort on the work that was 
performed by that area. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you always just take the say-so of 
the prospective joint business partner when you embark on 
these relationships? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I’m not too sure that I understand the 
question Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, let me be clearer.  I 
understand the process you followed, simply to involve this 
20 
email exchange, there was the request, tell us if it’s over 
10% there was a response, it’s not over 10% because our 
annual turnover is R50million, do you not probe any further 
than that, do you just take what they say in the email as 
sufficient? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 117 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I said, the process is run by a 
back office and looked after – Risk Management, it’s 
probably also important also to add, Chair, Ms Kwinana is 
a Chartered Accountant, she is a registered Auditor, there 
is a code of ethics that guides how we deal with – how we 
behave Chair, and with her being a recent member of IRBA 
belonging to the same profession, I take it that she’s 
attached the code and that there’s no reason to doubt her 
integrity when we’re provided with thus. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was the independence of your audit 
10 
though that was, potentially to be compromised by this 
association, did you make enquiries about this process at 
all, at the time? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I did not make enquiries about the 
process, as I indicate, there is a back office that runs this 
process Chair, and one takes comfort in enquiries that they 
make…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wasn’t sure, Ms Hofmeyr, whether you, 
in your question related to him or to PwC?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh right, well I should be clear, it was 
20 
PwC but by this point in time, as I understand it, you were 
the Audit partner you’d taken over from your predecessor, 
we’re now in late 2014, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, so both, I guess then Chair, 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 118 of 232 
 
you and the PwC broader sense but you in particular, Mr 
Mothibe but you’ve indicated you did not make enquiries. 
Can I ask – and I take your point about the code of ethics, 
is it not customary just to ask the joint business partners 
for their previous years’ financials, so that you can just 
have an extra check on whether what they’re telling you 
about the percentage of turnover is accurate? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I’m not part of that process, the JBR 
process so I cannot comment on that question. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you think it will be a good step to 
10 
take? 
MR MOTHIBE:   It does make sense Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What I want to put to you, Mr Mothibe, 
and it’s not facts that you would have had at the time but if 
you were to learn that Kwinana and Associates’ annual 
turnover for the relevant year, that’s the year ending 
February 2015 was only R10 567 581 would you then be 
concerned about entering into a joint business relationship 
with the firm who was going to earn R4.1million out of that 
relationship? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I would be concerned. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It would constitute about 38% on my 
calculation of Kwinana and Associates’ actual annual 
revenue for that – turnover for that year.  Again, you can 
do the maths over lunch if you want to check me but Mr 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 119 of 232 
 
Mothibe let’s move on.  So, you take what Ms Lumka 
Goniwe is saying in response, she says R4.1million is less 
than 10% because their annual turnover is R50million and 
you proceed, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair PwC ran the process through its JBR 
office, we were provided with information that we had 
requested and we had no reason to doubt the integrity of 
the information as it was provided to us. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I understand that Mr Mothibe.  That was 
enquiries made in relation to the Department of Education 
10 
bid 
which 
we’ve 
confirmed 
in 
your 
evidence, 
was 
unsuccessful.  Then, you bid with Kwinana and Associates 
on the PRASA bid, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, the – on the PRASA bid, as I 
indicated earlier it was not PwC it was a subsidiary of ours 
that did the proposal, in the instance Chair, Combined 
Systems, the company involved did not follow due process, 
they did not put – make enquiries as required and put the 
joint business relationship through the necessary process.  
This information only came to my attentions, in fact, once I 
20 
was preparing for the Commission. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why didn’t you say that in your 
statement then? That these processes were not followed in 
relation to the PRASA bid? 
CHAIRPERSON: Maybe let’s start with whether he accepts 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 120 of 232 
 
that he didn’t say it.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe do you accept that when you 
dealt with this, from page 12 of your statement in DD19C, 
you did not identify here that the processes had not been 
followed in relation to the PRASA bid? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is the case Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is the case? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But today you concede that the 
processes were not followed for the PRASA bid, is that 
10 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, PwC – sorry and I just want to get 
clear because I was – I had to hesitate earlier, you drew 
this distinction between PwC and some other company but 
then I clarified with you that this was PwC who entered into 
the 
joint 
business 
relationship 
with 
Kwinana 
and 
Associates for the PRASA bid, I thought you said yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I think, Chair, Combined Systems was a 
wholly owned subsidiary of PwC and Chair they were 
20 
required to follow due process.  We – after we made a 
submission we, obviously, Chair, proceeded to get an 
understanding but also the details and we have confirmed 
that they did not follow due process, they entered into joint 
business arrangement but they are wholly owned by PwC 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 121 of 232 
 
and they were providing asset verification work at PRASA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And PwC paid Kwinana and Associates 
invoices didn’t it, for this work? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The arrangement Chair, as it works is that, 
even with our subsidiaries PRASA required the invoices to 
come from one entity only, even though we are a joint 
business relationship so – because we own Combined 
Systems, the invoices would have come from PwC to 
PRASA and immediately when we got remunerated for the 
work performed we obviously, Chair, had to remit to 
10 
Kwinana and Associates their proportion Chair of the fees 
based on the amount of work they would have performed 
on the assignment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, if we go to page 12, paragraph 50.3 
you state there, 
“In late 2014 and in the period up to 30 January 
2015, PwC with Kwinana as JBR partner rendered 
professional services to the Passenger Rail Agency 
of South Africa”, 
 
Do you see that? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and that is a correct 
statement is it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The – as I indicated Chair, it was 
Combined Systems who entered into the joint business 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 122 of 232 
 
relationship, 
Combined 
Systems 
…[indistinct 
– 
audio 
faulty] PwC at the time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who submitted the bid PwC or Combined 
Systems? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I don’t have access to the 
documentation so it will be difficult for me to respond to 
that question Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can I assist you, because your evidence 
earlier was the – PRASA wanted to be dealing with one 
entity as I understood it, is that correct? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That entity was PwC, correct? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
 
My 
understanding 
was 
that 
the 
…[indistinct] bid I’m looking at the original – the actual 
documentation Chair hence my response, I don’t know what 
was on the documentation therefore I cannot respond 
because I was not part of that process Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Does PwC take responsibility for its 
wholly owned subsidiary not complying with its requisite 
procedures?  
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   That should be the case Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and the consequence of that 
is that PwC entered into a joint business relationship with 
Kwinana 
and 
Associates 
for 
the 
PRASA 
bid 
in 
circumstances where it did not confirm whether that joint 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 123 of 232 
 
business relationship breached its own policy, is that 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, Combined Systems entered in the 
joint venture or the JBR without following due process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if Kwinana and Associates earned 
R6.1million from that and you were to learn that its annual 
turnover for the 2016 financial year was in the order of 
R21million, do you accept my maths if I say that, that was 
constituting more than a quarter of the annual turnover of 
Kwinana and Associates? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   Your maths is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and had PwC known that it 
would not have entered into the relationship because it 
might have compromised its independence, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That would be correct, subject to the work 
that would have been performed by the JBR Office Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair 
it 
seems 
an 
appropriate time to end, we’ve hit 1 o’clock, maybe warmth 
can be generated for the room in the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I hope so, I hear some news I hope 
20 
that it’s for warming the place up not taking us back to 
where we were.  So, I’m sure somebody will take care of 
that. We are going to take the lunch adjournment and we’ll 
resume at 2, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 124 of 232 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you did well to put on your 
overcoat. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I had to DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that it is going to be warmer. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No we will see maybe we will be fortunate 
that the sun has somehow managed to warm the room over 
the period but there is not been anything else as I 
10 
understand that could be done in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We may just have to brace ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the room is just – the room is quite big 
so… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is so warming it seems impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  But we will press on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If we may.  Mr Mothibe, I concluded before 
20 
the break with the joint business relationships that PwC had 
embarked upon with Kwinana and Associates.  I would now 
like to move the joint business relationships between your 
joint audit partner Nkonki and Kwinana and Associates. 
MR MOTHIBE:  If it pleases the Chair prior to the break I 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 125 of 232 
 
think Ms Hofmeyr was enquiring about the 10% and I 
indicated I will go back and just see on the quotes where 
that comes through. Chair as I indicated the 5% [indistinct] 
benchmark is an internal PwC benchmark which is fairly 
more aggressive if you compare to the quotes.  In terms of 
the IRBA quotes, and the ISBA quotes when there is mention 
of materiality the figure of 10% it is used in that space Chair.  
So the figure of 10% devolves from the IRBA and ISBA quote 
when it comes to the product of materiality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was also some homework you were 
10 
going to do about figures to – to check whether a lawyer got 
it right this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chair I have – I trust Ms Hofmeyr’s 
calculations. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Mr Mothibe.  I 
would then like to move to the joint business relationship 
between your joint audit partner Nkonki and Kwinana and 
Associates but I do want to be clear before I embark on 
these questions with you.  I absolutely accept Mr Mothibe 
that these were arrangements between Nkonki and Kwinana 
20 
and Associates and PwC did not have any involvement in 
them.  Am I correct in making that assumption? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is the truth Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So all I am going to do is tell 
you certain facts which the commission has managed to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 126 of 232 
 
uncover in its investigation and all that I want to know from 
you is what view you take of those facts as the joint audit 
partner of Nkonki.  So if I may just proceed with those facts.  
You have seen the affidavit have you of Ms Masasa your 
colleague from Nkonki Inc, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I had sight of her affidavit that is true. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And she was conducting the audit as 
Nkonki’s representative when you were conducting it as the 
audit partner for PwC, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you will have seen that we traversed 
similar matters with Ms Masasa.  Chair Ms Masasa’s affidavit 
is the one that we encountered just after Mr Mothibe’s 
second supplementary statement.  Chair it is an affidavit in 
which Ms Masasa was asked very similar things to the 
questions that Mr Mothibe was asked.  In the interest of time 
it was not possible for us to present the evidence of both Mr 
Mothibe and Ms Masasa but you will see from the affidavit 
they generally agree with the position taken by each other 
and in that respect it is not contentious in any way and so 
20 
we would seek to admit it simply provisionally if it becomes 
contentious at any point as we have done previously 
decisions may be taken about then need to call Ms Masasa.  
But it is very similar to the position taken by Mr Mothibe 
today. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 127 of 232 
 
 
Chair I will not need to go there unless it becomes 
necessary.  I will simply summarise. What you would have 
seen Mr Mothibe if you considered it is that the commission 
also probed certain payments that it could determine had 
been made by Nkonki Inc to Kwinana and Associates and 
those payments span the period September 2015 – actually 
sorry August 2015 to July 2017.  And within that period there 
was 
R850 068,00 
that 
Nkonki 
paid 
to 
Kwinana 
and 
Associates.  And just for the record Chair and Mr Mothibe Ms 
Masasa explains that related to work at Transnet and Eskom 
10 
that Nkonki had done with Kwinana and Associates.   
 
I want to put those payments to one side because the 
one that I want your comment on is a curious payment.  It is 
a payment that Nkonki made to Kwinana and Associates on 
the 28 August 2015 and Ms Masasa explains that payment in 
her affidavit and if we can just go to it?  You will find it in 
DD19C the file we have been in at page 42, 42. 
MR MOTHIBE:  I have got the – the paragraph Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You have got it?  Excellent.  Now at 42 
paragraph 63.3 you will see that Ms Masasa deals with – I 
20 
said it was a payment of R300 000,00 that I was particularly 
interested in but there were two that she addressing in this 
paragraph, 63.3 because she says there: 
“There are two payments totalling R312 500,00 were made in 
relation to supplier development.” 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 128 of 232 
 
 
Right and she goes on and she says: 
“She has been advised by Ms Zilwa” 
 
Now let me just explain.  Earlier in her affidavit Ms 
Masasa indicates that Ms Zilwa was the CEO of Nkonki at 
the time.  Ms Masasa had no knowledge of these payments 
and so in an effort to assist the commission she went and 
established the facts from Ms Zilwa. 
 
Chair just to close that gap we did then go and get an 
affidavit from Ms Zilwa.  She confirms what Ms Masasa 
records here.  So there is no issue there.  But let us see 
10 
what the account of these payments is that is given. 
 
Ms Masasa says: 
“She was advised by Ms Zilwa that these payments were 
made by Nkonki for the benefit of the Abasa Practitioners 
Fund.  According to its website the APF as she abbreviates it 
was 
established 
in 
1985 
to 
promote 
the 
professional 
interests of black persons engaged in the accounting 
profession.  The APF promotes the interests of various small 
black owned audit firms.  Ms Zilwa has advised me that the 
payment for R12 500,00 on the 26 March 2015 was a 
20 
subscription fee Nkonki paid for the benefit of APF.  And the 
payment of R300 000,00 on the 28 August 2015 was in 
relation to a sponsorship fee paid by Nkonki for the benefit 
of the APF.  I am further advised by Ms Zilwa that the APF 
bank account was – and she puts in quotations “not 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 129 of 232 
 
functional” at the time and that the APF member firms 
therefore – again in quotes “felt it was convenient at the time 
to deposit funds meant for the APF into the bank account of 
Kwinana and Associates.” 
 
So that is the explanation that Ms Masasa was able 
to obtain from Ms Zilwa the former CEO of Nkonki.  Now Mr 
Mothibe can you help me?  Are you – do you know of the 
Abasa Practitioners Fund at all? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I am aware of the existence of the 
Abasa Practitioners – I think it was a forum which was 
10 
formed years ago where a number of black audit firms came 
together to create capacity so that they can propose for – for 
big assignments – audit assignments.  In fact I think years 
ago there were – they became a beneficiary of the – I think it 
was a Transnet Audit Proposal.  So that – certainly the name 
Abasa Practitioners Fund Forum does – does ring a bell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying what you know of is 
Abasa Practitioners Forum you are not sure of Abasa 
Practitioners Fund? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes Chair I am not too sure how they relate 
20 
to each other.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOTHIBE:  But hearing that principle I am aware of that 
Chair – of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so you know about the Forum but 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 130 of 232 
 
whether there is also a Fund you do not know or you do 
know? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I am aware of the Forum – about the 
Fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:  I was not aware of that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 As 
you 
appreciate 
Chair 
it 
was 
an 
organisation for black audit firms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  And because I was then an employee of the 
PwC I would not have privy to that so whatever comes below 
the Forum Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well pursuant to receiving this affidavit 
from Ms Masasa the commission did further investigations 
and it in fact engaged a Mr Ashley Walter Dicken who when 
he deposed his affidavit Chair this is another affidavit that 
20 
has been obtained again simply to give facts about Abasa 
and APF.  Again, I propose that we admit it provisionally.  
There is nothing contentious in it and I do understand Mr 
Mothibe’s previously been provided with a copy.  This is an 
affidavit that… 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 131 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry we – we have – oh we said 
by the way that those documents that form presently under 
C. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will leave them as they are. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And we are going to really… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Absolutely so you will in due course Chair 
receive a list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Properly itemised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What the documents are and so amongst 
them will be Mr Dicken’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We will properly identify it but for present 
purposes just to tell you where you would find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is in DD19B – sorry D which is the 
second file.  The one we have not been working in yet and it 
20 
commences at page 489.  It is headed with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  489? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  489. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair you will see it is headed Replying 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 132 of 232 
 
Affidavit but that is because I think Mr Dicken understood 
himself to be replying to the questions from the commission 
so you must not be confused that it is proceeded by other 
affidavits relevant.  It is simply that he offers his reply to the 
commission’s enquiries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well on 489 I do not have Replying 
Affidavit I have got – and I do not have the name.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got I, blank space, full name 
solemnly declare – it is not signed. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go to the next page. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is a different page to the 489 I am 
looking at.  So maybe there has been a numbering error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking at the… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The second file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Registration Reference Bundle. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh no sorry then you are in the wrong one.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You – I think your Registrar might have put 
20 
the file you need just on the side here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is the DD – what – you should be looking 
for is DD19B on the spine but we have numbered this and 
entered it into the record as DD19D.  And if you open up 489 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 133 of 232 
 
there Chair you should have an affidavit.  Mr Mothibe do you 
have it? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it looks like there are challenges. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where I am supposed to have page 489 I 
have got page 531.  There is a jump from 488 to 531 and 
there is nothing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair it may be that we have got an 
10 
additional copy that my learned friend can just assist me 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair that ought to have been placed in 
your file this morning.  I do apologise.  The other new files 
that brought up had it so that is 489 now to be inserted in 
your file.  It seems Mr Mothibe’s updates were done but… 
MR MOTHIBE:  I think Chair maybe some of this would have 
come – should be in your file because I see duplications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got duplications? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  Duplicated in my file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Oh maybe you have the Chair’s copy.  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe somebody thought the witness 
must have two. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 134 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  We want to be doubly focussed on it.  
Sorry.  Thank you.  If you will just put it to the side Mr 
Mothibe we will collect it later.  Thank you very much.  At 
least we have identified where the rogue extra copy went. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so as present – as things presently 
stand you have now given me pages 489 to 430 so that 
seems to complete the pages that were missing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes exactly.  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Alright thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So as I was describing it is entitled 
10 
between the tramlines as a replying affidavit but that should 
not confuse the lawyers in the room.  It is simply I take it to 
be Mr Dicken’s way of indicating he is responding to the 
questions that he received from the commission.  And I 
propose simply to summarise what Mr Dicken says here.  Mr 
Dicken is a member and interim President of the Association 
for the Advancement of Black Accountants of South Africa.  
That is Abasa the entity that we have been talking about. 
 
And 
what 
the 
commission 
was 
interested 
in 
establishing from Mr Dicken was can he help us with this 
20 
relationship that Ms Zilwa describes was in place?  That 
there was this APF – the fund – the Abasa Practitioners Fund 
that at some point in 2015 it did not have a bank account 
and so members of the auditing profession were paying to 
Kwinana and Associates what was really intended for the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 135 of 232 
 
Abasa Practitioners Fund. 
 
We just wanted to get to the bottom of what he could 
tell us about those facts.  And Mr Mothibe what he tells us 
and I am going to summarise now is that those facts are 
false. 
 
That 
there 
was 
no Abasa 
Practitioners 
Fund 
operational in August of 2015 when Nkonki allegedly paid 
R300 000,00 to Kwinana and Associates bank account for its 
benefit.  He attaches to his affidavit reams of SIPC 
documents that he gets to support this the upshot of which is 
that the Abasa Practitioners Fund was deregistered in 2011.  
10 
Four years before the payment was made. 
 
Right.  The next thing that is mysterious about the 
payment and Mr Mothibe I will have a question I promise 
after I have just given you this background. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is that five days after it was paid to 
Kwinana and Associates bank account allegedly for the 
benefit of a fund that did not exist it was paid out of Kwinana 
and Associates bank account into the personal bank account 
of Ms Yakhe Kwinana. 
20 
 
Mr Mothibe before today did you know those facts? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair this is the first time I hear about these 
– these matters.  This is news to me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well let us just for completeness sake take 
you to those bank statements because we do not want to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 136 of 232 
 
leave any stone unturned and we want to be looking at the 
documents 
when 
I 
give 
you 
the 
background 
to 
the 
commission’s investigations. 
 
You will find the bank statements that reflect this in 
the same bundle you have been working in DD19D and if you 
go right to the back and pick up page 622, 622 you will find 
them.   
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I do have sight of them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I would like to take you to the relevant 
entries.  Page 622 you will see at the top the account name 
10 
is Kwinana and Associates Gauteng – GAU is short for 
Gauteng Inc.  And you will see there are three dates there 
reflected on the left hand side.  The first is 2015.08.28 that 
is an ABSA Cashbook – I do not know what that is standing 
for CT Adhoc TRA. I think that is transaction and that is an 
amount of R100 000,00 in the top line you can see going into 
the account.  And then the one that we are interested in the 
payment from Nkonki Inc to Kwinana and Associates is the 
next entry.  2015.08.28 it says internet payment credit and 
then you see R300 000,00 there.  Do you see that Mr 
20 
Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I do see that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that is how the commission was able to 
identify R300 000,00 being paid by Nkonki to Kwinana and 
Associates on the 28 August 2015.  And then you see at 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 137 of 232 
 
page 6 – sorry let me just get this right.  Right.  Then you 
have to go over to the next page 623 which is the next page 
of the Kwinana and Associates account.  And what you will 
see there in the last line is an entry on 2015.09.02.  Do you 
see that?  The last line is 2015.09.02 entry and you will see 
there what gets paid out of the account is R630 000,00.  Can 
you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I see that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is important Chair just to go back and 
say what you are looking at on these statements are 
10 
transactions in the Kwinana and Associates bank account 
from the 28 August to the 2 September.  It is a period of five 
days.  Right.  And what we have seen is R300 000,00 comes 
in on the 28 August.  There are a – there is R100 000,00 
before that.  There are a few subsequent payments after that 
and then in a sense the whole account gets debited out 
because on the 2 September 2015 you will see that 
R630 000,00 goes out which leaves a balance in the account 
of R2 795,00.  Do you see that?   
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we remain confident in our conclusion 
that the R300 000,00 that came in on the 28t h goes out with 
the R630 000,00 on the 2 nd.   And then the question is to 
whom does the R630 000,00 payment which includes the 
R300 000,00 go and for that purpose you go to the last page 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 138 of 232 
 
which is page 624 and you will see there this is the account 
of Ms Yakhe Kwinana and you will see on the 2 nd September 
2015.  Let me tell you how many lines down, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7 it is the 7t h date entry on the left.  You will see next to it it 
says I bank transfer settlement and you will see R630 000,00 
confirming that that amount came into that account.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one written settlement? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I bank transfer. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then is it the account number? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  R630 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is given immediately under transfer? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that is how we track the movement of 
the money Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Just to explain the facts as I was detailing 
them for Mr Mothibe.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what that tells us is 28 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if Ms Zilwa and is it Ms Masasa? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 139 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If their version is true that this was – that 
they – this was money that they paid to – that was paid to 
Kwinana Associates – and Associates Inc for the benefit of 
Abasa Practitioners and if it is – if you are right indeed that 
in the conclusion that that is the money that goes out into Ms 
Kwinana’s personal account then on the face of it it appears 
that 
money 
that 
may 
have 
been 
intended 
for Abasa 
Practitioners ends up in her personal account. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If of course their version is not true it was 
never money for Abasa Practitioners then that is also 
something else. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That Chair we cannot probe further without 
Ms Zilwa attending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And again, I must emphasise Ms Masasa 
says she has no personal knowledge of this.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She relies on Ms Zilwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Ms Zilwa tells her this and then we go 
to Ms Zilwa to get confirmation of these facts. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 140 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And she provides it to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Ms Zilwa’s version is it went to Kwinana 
and Associates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But for the benefit of the fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think you are right to – to emphasise 
that Ms Masasa it is not her version. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is what she says she was told. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she accepted what she was told. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And she can take it only that far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Which is why we deemed it appropriate to 
20 
go to Ms Zilwa to get the confirmation from Ms Zilwa.  I will 
take you there in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So that is Ms Zilwa’s version to this 
commission on affidavit.  I accept only on affidavit.  She – 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 141 of 232 
 
this has not been probed with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But what our further investigations tell us 
are really two things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The Abasa Practitioners Fund did not exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In August of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  The second fact we uncover is that 
10 
when we track the money in the account from the 28 August 
to the 2 September we can see it is paid out on the 2 
September with other funds to Ms Kwinana’s personal 
account.  But Chair I absolutely accept the point.  What we 
still do not know is whether Nkonki pays with the intention 
that it be paid albeit to a fund that does not exist against 
their intention it then gets paid to Ms Kwinana that we do not 
know and that I certainly cannot take further today.  But the 
facts nonetheless are it ended up in Ms Kwinana’s bank 
account and the version before the commission today from 
20 
Ms Zilwa albeit on affidavit is that it was paid for the 
purposes of payment to a fund that did not exist.  So Mr 
Mothibe that takes me to the point at which I – I would like 
your assistance as the Joint Auditor of Nkonki.  If you learnt 
as you have today that Nkonki made… 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 142 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of SAA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did I say of SAA?  Sorry Joint Audit 
Partner of Nkonki for the audit of SAA indeed Chair I 
apologise.  If you learnt that Nkonki made a payment to the 
audit firm of the Director of the Board of SAA at a time that it 
was doing joint audit work with you and it were to be 
established that that payment was gratuitous and I say 
gratuitous in the sense that it is not for services rendered it 
is just paid and unrelated to any work performed would you 
regard that as a compromise to Nkonki’s independence in its 
10 
audit work? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair that would have certainly raised 
concerns from my side and I would have had to – I certainly 
would have raised it with our Risk Management Department 
for advice on how to deal with the matter. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
Would 
you 
have 
been 
increasingly 
concerned if you learnt that the month before this payment 
was made Ms Kwinana motivated for Nkonki to receive the 
audit work from SAA for the next five years? 
MR MOTHIBE:  It would have certainly formed a part of an 
20 
input I would give to this management Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think your voice has gone 
down again. 
MR MOTHIBE:  I am saying Chair. My shoulder Chair.  My 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 143 of 232 
 
elbow was on the – Chair I would have – that would have 
definitely raised concern and I would have certainly included 
that 
in 
the 
communication 
to 
my 
Risk 
Management 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:  To seek advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Let us go to what Mr Mothibe you did 
say in your statement about this topic of independence right.  
Because you address it at page 14 of your statement which 
10 
you will find in DD19A.  Page 14 contains the last paragraph 
of your statement.  You say there in paragraph 55: 
“I am of the view that notwithstanding that the payments 
were made” 
These are the payments PwC made to Kwinana and 
Associates that you are referring to.  You say: 
“Notwithstanding that the payments were made in relations 
to services unrelated to SAA it was in my view incumbent 
upon Ms Kwinana to declare the fees earned from PwC and 
Nkonki 
and 
recuse 
herself 
from 
any 
decision 
making 
20 
concerning their appointment as auditors of SAA and 
procurement of services from them.” 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I see that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Does that remain your view? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 144 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair that remains my view. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you then would accept that if Ms 
Kwinana did not make those disclosures or recuse herself 
from the decision making about whether to appoint PwC and 
Nkonki that would give rise to a conflict of interest for her? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair that would be the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your voice went down even further. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair that is correct.  That would be the 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Were you aware that Ms Kwinana never 
recused herself from the board meetings at which these 
decisions were taken? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I was not aware Chair and it – it is not 
something that we would have really checked Chair when we 
performed our audit.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you did consider the minutes of board 
meetings did you not? 
MR MOTHIBE:  We did consider the minutes of board 
meetings. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Would it not be an item you would be 
looking at amongst those minutes when it deals with 
appointment of auditors? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair the review of board minutes would be 
an item that would have been delegated to one of the team 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 145 of 232 
 
members and we would typically be looking for areas like 
minutes being all out of controls, tea contracts or the new 
contracts that are entered into and Chair this item I would 
ordinarily would probably not have been something that you 
– they would have – they would have focussed on. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But should they not have?  PwC was 
entering into joint business relationships with Ms Kwinana’s 
audit firm that was enough to make PwC concerned about 
the impact of that relationship for independence.  Should it 
not also have been checking that Ms Kwinana the director of 
10 
that firm was not having anything to do with the decision 
making to appoint PwC? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair when we entered into the joint 
business relationships, we had already gone through a 
thorough process through our JBR process to ensure that the 
– the revenues earned from such contracts would not be 
material and there is no risk that they would have impaired 
the independence of both parties.  So already at that level 
Chair we were comfortable that the contracts – whatever we 
had entered into was below the thresholds.  So – and that 
20 
Chair gives one a great level of comfort.  Secondly Chair the 
– typically when one – or the requirement to disclose interest 
in contracts it typically relates to contracts relating to work 
done within the entity.  So we had not entered into any 
contract with Ms Kwinana relating to work relating to South 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 146 of 232 
 
African Airways or any of its subsidiaries for that matter 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe I have to pick up on one aspect 
of your answer.  You said PwC had gone through a thorough 
process 
to 
confirm 
that 
its 
independence 
was 
not 
compromised, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is – yes the JBR process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but your evidence before the break 
was that you readily accepted that in respect of the PRASA 
bid no process whatever was followed. 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Not – correction Chair.  I think what I am 
saying Chair and I stand by it is that Chair we have got a 
thorough process that we recommend within PwC and that – 
the expectation is that for every partner and for every person 
wishing to enter into relationship with – in fact with any of 
our existing clients there is an independence process that 
they have to follow.  If we are to enter into a business 
relationship the PwC has a process designed to ensure that 
we identify every – we identify and we confirm that there is 
no threat to our independence should that joint business 
20 
relationship proceed.  Chair there was one contract that was 
entered into by combined systems which did not go for a due 
process Chair and Chair at this stage I mean the persons 
involved in that were – were Chair dealt with and in fact 
Chair we saw it feed, to sell the business of combined 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 147 of 232 
 
systems because of the potential threats to independents 
that you have presented.  So Chair we have got a thorough 
process it is an expectation that every single employee or 
director of PricewaterhouseCoopers complies with that and I 
am comfortable that Chair everything that goes through that 
process should the JBR office say, yes you can continue 
then Chair yes we can take comfort in that process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Mothibe in fairness to you I must put it 
to you.  If you do not follow the process that is prescribed it 
cannot be described as having been thorough. Do you accept 
10 
that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair we acknowledge that there was a 
failure by one of our subsidiaries to follow process and that 
was appropriately dealt with.  It does not mean Chair that 
the process that we have put in place does not work. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe I put it to you that that is 
precisely what it means. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair what we had identified is that one of 
our companies did not follow due process and that has been 
addressed.  That matter was fully addressed Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe you came onto this point and I 
had to ask you about it because in your answer to my 
question about the conflict of interest on the part of Ms 
Kwinana you went back to describe a thorough process 
which I understood your previous evidence had conceded 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 148 of 232 
 
had not been thorough.  But let us put that to one side for 
now.  We focussing on the conflict of interest that Ms 
Kwinana has if she does not recuse herself and I had put to 
you would it not have been a requirement of your team – you 
team the PwC team who knows it is entering into a joint 
business relationship with Kwinana and Associates to satisfy 
herself that she is not making decisions to employ you each 
year for audit work and I understood your answer to be they 
do not need to do that because we have got a thorough 
process.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I said that – in the review of – of 
minutes they are certain items that we focus on and this area 
was not one of the areas that we had focussed on.  Because 
we were com – from my side Chair I was comfortable that 
there was process followed when it came to ascertain 
whether or not the joint business relationships that we 
entered into with Ms Kwinana did not in any way impair our 
independence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the prior process that you talk about 
that is meant as I understand your evidence to discover if 
20 
there are – there is conflict of interest.  Is that what you 
called – is that the JBR the process followed before you 
enter into a joint business relationship? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes Chair it is the – it is done through what 
we call a [indistinct] system where the Risk Management 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 149 of 232 
 
Team runs with the process to vet information that we have 
received from a [indistinct] partner and ourselves to ensure 
that we have not breached the thresholds and that also the 
other factors that we consider to ensure that we maintain our 
independence at all times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would – would the people who would 
have been in charge of that process would they have – would 
they have seen minutes of meetings at SAA at which Ms 
Kwinana may have sat where she probably should not have 
sat? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair those persons are not part of the audit 
team. They would not have access to those minutes because 
as you appreciate Chair there is confidentiality around client 
information and only those persons who are working with the 
client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Will have access to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now – so the only people who could 
have a chance within PwC to pick up a point such as Ms 
Kwinana’s sat in a meeting which made this decision where 
20 
she should not have sat – the only people who could have 
picked that up would have been your team.  Is it not?  In 
other words, the team – the PwC – PwC team that was 
auditing SAA whether when you were – when you had joined 
the team or not but that is the team that should have picked 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 150 of 232 
 
that up that had a chance to pick that up. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair in the review of minutes and when you 
review – typically review a conflict of interest matters it is – 
as I indicated it is typically its own contracts relating or to 
the company itself.  So certainly, to the extent that we had 
contracts with Ms Kwinana or Ms Kwinana – apologies 
relating to work at SAA those attempts would have obviously 
been required to have – they would have picked up.  These 
contracts were outside the scope of the – of that Chair and 
this [indistinct] it is – it is – I think it is important that this is 
10 
more a fiduciary what you have thought it should have been 
a fiduciary requirement or duty on her to disclose but there 
is no – there is no requirement within the Companies Act for 
her to make such disclosure.  It is something that we – that 
in our view we thought it would be good – be the best 
practice – I think that is the word I would use – we were in 
best practice for her to make the disclosure and I still do 
believe it should have been Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mothibe I am not 
20 
going to take those points further other than to say do you 
accept that an auditor must have not only independence of 
mind but also independence in appearance? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is certainly the case Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And would you accept that independence 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 151 of 232 
 
of appearance of an auditor may be compromised if the Chair 
of the Audit and Risk Committee of the entity that they are 
auditing both votes to continue to employ the auditor, 
determine their fees each year and is somebody who either 
herself personally is receiving payment from one of the 
auditors or her firm is receiving payment from one of the 
auditors? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I think it is also important to – to note 
that these joint business relationships are common in the 
South African environment where provisional service will 
10 
work with each other in different areas and there would be a 
requirement also due to transformation and trans [indistinct] 
requirement that we have heard in our country.  So us 
entering 
into 
joint 
business 
relationships 
with 
other 
provisional services firm Chair it is not an anomaly.  To the 
extent that Chair Ms Hofmeyr’s question as to whether or not 
the independence would have been impaired Chair I took – 
we took comfort in the process that we had followed and 
Chair the appointment of auditors is not only done by one 
person but it is done by a committee.  No one individual 
20 
would have excessive influence over the work that is 
performed by a committee.  So Chair I do not believe that in 
this instance Chair – I mean our independence would have 
been 
impaired. 
 
I 
do 
take 
Ms 
Hofmeyr’s 
point 
that 
independence 
it 
is 
not 
only 
independence 
it 
is 
also 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 152 of 232 
 
importance in mind Chair and I do understand the issue that 
she is mentioning Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe I would like to move to the 
topic of reportable irregularities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that.  Maybe they 
should switch off this – I do not – air conditioner because it 
does not seem to make much difference. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is difficult to call it that because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instead it interferes sometimes I cannot 
hear Mr Mothibe properly.  I think just switch it off and let us 
10 
see if we are going to get colder.  Mr Mothibe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure if I understood your evidence 
correctly where you were saying that making the point that 
the decision to appoint auditors would have been made by a 
committee and no one person or one member of the 
committee would have excessive influence or something like 
that.  You are not suggesting are you that somebody who is 
supposed to recuse himself or herself from the committee 
when it considers a certain matter does not have to recuse 
20 
themselves because he or she does not make the decision 
alone. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I am not suggesting that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so what is the importance of the point 
you were making about that? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 153 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair I think it was more to say the audit 
committee is made up of a number of persons and it is a 
joint if I can say a joint decision Chair.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would not know whether – whether 
for example for argument sake whether the decision was 
made in your favour because of one vote and that vote 
happens to be Ms Kwinana’s vote? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I hear what you are saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so the – if you are not supposed 
to sit you should not sit.  Is it not?  You should not be part of 
10 
the decision making in regard to a certain matter if you are 
conflicted and you should not be sitting there? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair that is correct.  If you are conflicted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Then you should be recusing yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Or at least declare it so 
that it is known. There may be circumstances where you 
declare it and if you declare it nobody has an objection you 
can continue but this might not have been one of those 
situations.  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr you may proceed. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mothibe could you 
help us with the following question?  When is an auditor 
required to report a reportable irregularity? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Thank you Chair I will take you to pages 
DD19, 08. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 154 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That just for the record Chair is DD19A so 
it is in the first file and it is page 8, is that right Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct.  Page 8.  And Chair that is 
where we confirm that the Audit Process Act does place an 
obligation 
on 
an 
auditor 
to 
report 
to 
the 
Regulator 
irregularities where he is satisfied or has reason to believe 
that there have been – they have occurred. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair we then also at 35 what we understand 
to be a reportable irregularity which is an unlawful act or 
10 
omission permitted by somebody in a senior management 
position which has caused or is likely to cause material 
financial loss to the entity which is fraudulent amounting to 
theft or which it presents a breach of – material breach of 
fiduciary duty.  So Chair it is in that respect that there would 
be a requirement for one to report material irregularity or 
rather a reportable irregularity.  And in fact Chair we – we 
had done so at South African Airways for the year ended 31 
March 2014.  The business of South African Airways was 
struggling and we did not believe that they were a going 
20 
concern and management had not put into place a business 
rescue plan or of taking measures to give us comfort that the 
business will in fact be a going concern.  At that stage also 
government had turned down their request for a financial 
guarantee and Chair we then dispatched a letter to – to our 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 155 of 232 
 
Regulator informing them of the challenges.  Also that it 
could be seen that the business – the directors are trading 
recklessly.  And subsequent to us sending letter through to 
the Regulator the Department then of Finance provided the 
required guarantees which then allowed us 30 days after we 
have dispatched the letter as required by the Act to inform 
the Regulator that the said reportable irregularity is no more 
continuing Chair.  So we do consider such and where 
appropriate we do report these irregularities to the Regulator 
as required Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I was not aware of that before your 
testimony.  Did that relate to the 2014 financial year? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct Chair it was – relates to the 
2014 financial year. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And just remind me when did you take over 
the auditing function? 
MR MOTHIBE:  It was for the 2014 financial year.  So it was 
in my first year of engagement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And let us look at those requirements 
because you have summarised them helpfully for me at page 
20 
8 of your statement.  I just want to be sure for the rest of our 
discussion this afternoon that we are on the same page 
about your understanding of reportable irregularities.  Is it 
correct that a reportable irregularity on your understanding 
requires there to be an unlawful act or omission committed 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 156 of 232 
 
by a person responsible for the management of the entity? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then that unlawful act or omission 
must do one of three things, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It must either cause or be likely to cause a 
material financial loss to the entity, is that correct or 
associated entities? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The second is that it is fraudulent or 
10 
amounts to theft, is that your understanding? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Or it represents a material breach of 
fiduciary duty, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you also accept that you do not as the 
auditor have to be satisfied that these requirements are met 
you simply have to have reason to believe that these 
requirements may be met. 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct Chair.  So there is an element 
20 
of judgment that needs to be applied. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes but it is a lower bar than being 
satisfied, do you accept that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now the commission over what 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 157 of 232 
 
is now about two years has received evidence related to a 
number of transactions taking place within SAA and its group 
of companies which we have drawn to your attention before 
today and which you address in your statement, is that 
correct Mr Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like to focus on two of those 
transactions.  The first is in relation to Air Chefs and you will 
recall that you were asked about that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And just to find it in your statement it is at 
page 9 of your statement which is in Exhibit DD19A at page 
9. 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair in the last third of that page you will 
see a heading against what is effectively paragraph 40A 
which says: 
“28 September 2015 decision by SAA Board.” 
That is the decision relating to Air Chefs is it not Mr 
Mothibe? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is the paragraph Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now the first thing I just want 
to understand because I was not able to discern this 
perfectly from your statement.  I want to know when you 
were doing the audit work at SAA did you as a fact consider 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 158 of 232 
 
this award when you were conducting the audit? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair this award did come across – what you 
call – our audit areas yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MR MOTHIBE:  We did have sight of these board minutes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you concluded that there was no 
reportable irregularity then? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair when we looked at the facts that were 
– that were presented to us it did not trigger a reportable 
irregularity sensor if I can put it like that Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now the evidence that the commission has 
received and again Mr Mothibe in fairness to you I am going 
to tell you about that evidence because I assume you are not 
somebody who watches the proceedings of the commission 
every day.  But I am mindful of the fact that that not be 
evidence of which you were aware at the time.  Once I have 
done that I am going to take you to the documents that you 
would have been aware of at the time but I want to give that 
background 
because 
that 
is 
the 
evidence 
before 
this 
commission and it is the reason why the commission was 
20 
interested in understanding from you why this was not 
reported as a reportable irregularity.  Chair that evidence 
came principally from Ms Mpshe who gave evidence in the 
middle of last year – June/July of last year.  Just for record 
purposes her evidence is contained in Exhibit DD15.  Now 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 159 of 232 
 
you 
will 
recall 
Chair 
that 
what 
Ms 
Mpshe 
told 
this 
commission was that SAA had gone out to tender for 
domestic lounge catering services.  It had gone to tender 
because at that stage before the tender it subsidiary Air 
Chefs had been providing that service but there were 
concerns about the standards of the service.  There were 
lots of customer complaints and so SAA took a decision to go 
out and tender and see if it could improve things.  Her 
evidence was that they ran a full tender process.  That it was 
lawful and regular.  That amongst the bidders for that 
10 
process was Air Chefs and at the conclusion of the process 
Air Chefs was not selected but LSG Sky Chefs were selected 
and awarded a contract for R85.8 million for three years.  
Now that is the background to the Air Chefs tender that we 
received at the commission.  What Ms Mpshe also went on to 
tell the commission was that there was an unfortunate 
presentation that the SAA board had to make to Parliament 
on the 2 September 2015 shortly after this process had been 
run.  And Ms Mpshe’s evidence was that during the 
presentation to Parliament the Chair of the Board of SAA Ms 
20 
Myeni had received some tough questioning about the fact 
that SAA had chosen to award this tender to LSG Sky Chefs 
when it had Air Chefs its subsidiary who provided the 
services and Ms Mpshe’s evidence was that Ms Myeni was 
not in a position easily to answer the questions and that 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 160 of 232 
 
after that session she became very angry and demanded 
from Mr Mpshe that the award be withdrawn from LSG Sky 
Chefs and awarded to Air Chefs.  And she was supported in 
all of this by Ms Kwinana.  Mr Mothibe were you aware of 
those facts when you were auditing SAA at the time? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Certainly not the detail that you are 
providing Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What did you know? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I was aware that there was a tender which 
was previously awarded to LSG which Air Chefs had lost but 
10 
then a business decision had been made was then taken to 
rather in source the provision of that catering to SAA around 
just by Air Chefs.  So Chair what is – is that there was a 
decision to rather in source the [indistinct] service instead of 
giving it to a party outside the group. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why would a state owned enterprise 
having run an entire tender process and awarded that tender 
to a third party be able then to take a decision simply to in 
source those services? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
Chair 
as 
I 
indicated 
it 
was 
– 
my 
20 
understanding was that this was a business decision that 
was taken by the Board of South African Airways. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But is it compliant with the PFMA? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair typically the – the decision to in 
source a service within the group one would not see that to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 161 of 232 
 
which require a tender process. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  I accept that. 
MR MOTHIBE:  It was – because Chair you set up a 
business to be able to provide a particular service inside and 
it makes sense for you to get the service inside instead – if 
you can within the group Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. But when the very same entity has 
determined it should go out on tender it has run an entire 
tender process in which it subsidiary was a bidder and was 
determined not to be awarded the tender would it not then be 
10 
a breach of the PFMA if it was subsequently to be awarded 
the tender after it had been taken away from the party who 
had emerged in that process as the most competitive cost 
effective bidder? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, what we saw was a review of a 
business decision and that in itself Chair, it is something that 
we... that you see on the regular basis.. 
 
As a board of directors, they do have a duty to make 
decisions and review decisions Chair, as mostly following 
protocols. 
20 
 
So Chair, the decision to review the tender in itself Chair 
would not have constituted an or reportable irregularity. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what did the Board of SAA had been 
told that if it withdrew the tender from LSG Sky Chefs, it 
would breach its contract and it would be liable to exposure 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 162 of 232 
 
of the R 85,8 million that LSG Sky Chefs was entitled to? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That Chair, is then something that... yes, the 
board would have to consider in making that decision. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And it would be unlawful in those 
circumstances if that was the advice the board had received 
because there are rules of law governing procurement and 
there is a statute, you may or may not be aware, called the 
Public Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, which vests 
in those successful bidders certain rights.  Are you aware of 
those legal provisions Mr Mothibe? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that is not truly one of the... that act 
is not really one of those that we have looked at Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that the Board of SAA at the 
time was advised by its own internal legal department that if 
it went ahead and did this it would be acting unlawfully under 
the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I became aware of it Chair when I saw 
the information here in the pack but we were conducting the 
audit Chair, from the extract of the minutes.  That one I was 
not aware. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you did confirm for us earlier that this 
was a particular award that you did consider, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  As in... yes, it was brought to our attention 
and we were aware that... but the details as you... as that 
would packed out. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 163 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So ...[intervenes]  
MR MOTHIBE:  Not that kind of detail, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you did not call for the documents that 
served before the board when it took this decision? 
MR MOTHIBE:  No, I did not call for the documents.  No, 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Should you not have done that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, on the basis of the information that 
was provided to me, I took a... because ...[indistinct] was 
delegated and we had requested a summary, an extract, all 
10 
the salient features.  I took that, all the information that I 
needed to make a decision, was included and was provided 
to me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So I take it you did not see the 
memorandum that Ms Mpshe prepared for the board of 
directors on the 20t h of August 2015? 
MR MOTHIBE:  No, Chair I did not see that memorandum. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You will find that in EXHIBIT DD19C.  So 
that is the first file, Chair.  At page 132.3.1.  So a hundred-
and-thirty-two point 3 point 1. 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:  I have the document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I see it here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, which is in fact in file 1, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes, at what 
page? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 164 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We will start at page 132.  A hundred-and-
thirty-two point 3 point 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Mothibe, this is the 
memorandum that Ms Mpshe as the acting Chief Executive 
prepared for the board in advance on that fateful day before 
parliament, admittedly. 
 
And what I just want to... I do not want to read it in 
detail.  We do not have time for that.  But she provides the 
background to why they went out to tender. 
10 
 
She catalogues the process that was followed.  She 
indicates how the evaluation took places.  And then on the 
last page, you will see final recommendation.   
 
You will see there under final recommendation, she 
records: 
“It is hereby requested that the SAA Board of 
Directors note the final award to LSG Sky Chefs for a 
period of three years, from 1 September 2015 to 
31 August 2018, 
at 
an 
estimated 
amount 
of 
R 85 818 793,00...” 
20 
 
And some cents, inclusive of VAT.  And she says: 
“In this regard and further to the lawful tender 
process, a third party will be performing services 
previously rendered by SAA subsidiary company, Air 
Chefs...” 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 165 of 232 
 
 
Mr Mothibe, at the time, do you know what the limit on 
the Delegation of Authority for the Chief Executive Officer of 
SAA was? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Shu, I would not remember off the top of my 
head Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  I can tell you it was R 100 million.  
Okay and that was the evidence of Ms Mpshe.  I am just not 
dreaming that up.  So this was a decision that was within her 
delegation of authority to take.  Do you accept that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I accept that Chair. 
10 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
If 
it 
was 
R 100 million, 
she 
could 
determine that this should be awarded.  Is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That sounds correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  But then what happens is.  We have 
the interaction at parliament.  You have on Ms Mpshe’s 
evidence Ms Myeni becoming very angry afterwards and 
demanding that it be taken from Sky Chefs and awarded to 
Air Chefs. 
 
And what Ms Mpshe then does in response is, she sends 
an email to the board the next day, setting out the whole 
20 
process.  And you will find that in the same bundle, page 
132.15.   
MR MOTHIBE:  What page?  Is it 15 or five zero? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  One five.  Apologies.  Fifteen.  I have 
started on the second page of this email train because it 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 166 of 232 
 
stats, in fact, with an email Ms Myeni to her co-board 
members and Ms Mpshe, to which Ms Mpshe offers the 
response two days later. 
 
Let us just look at what Ms Myeni says to the board and 
Ms Mpshe at page 132.15.  She says: 
“Colleagues, 
I 
am 
sending 
to 
you... 
first 
and 
foremost, this is not in line with what we are doing at 
Air Chefs as a shareholder.   
We have to review the submission which was not 
submitted to the board for noting.   
10 
Air Chefs is struggling and I announce my concerns 
as the shareholder.   
Acting CEO kindly holds this process until the 
shareholder of Air Chefs applies its mind...” 
 
Now, Ms Mpshe responds to that over the page, which is 
back the page at 132.14.  And I do not suggest we read it but 
the essence of her response is to dispute that the board was 
not notified because 
we 
have actually just 
seen the 
notification that they received and she attaches it again. 
 
And then at... in her answer to point two which you see 
20 
bold just below the middle of the page.  There is a paragraph 
she inserts. 
 
And what she says there in the last sentence is: 
“Any holding and/or cancellation of the awarded 
could result in litigation and financial exposure 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 167 of 232 
 
against SAA...” 
 
Can I take it that you were not aware of this email 
correspondence at the time. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Certainly, Chair.  I was not aware of this 
email correspondence. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
And 
there 
is 
a 
response 
to 
that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last reading that you did was from 
10 
what page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair, it is on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that to Ms Mpshe’s email? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, it is one 132.14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, 14? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  One, four.  Apologies, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you will see she is now responding to 
the chairperson.  And what is bold is the text from the 
chairperson’s email that we saw previously and then the 
20 
indented paragraph is Ms Mpshe’s response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We have traversed this with her.  And then 
under 2.2 there, that paragraph from Ms Mpshe, I was just 
emphasising the last sentence. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 168 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Which is that her indication to the board 
was holding or cancellation of the award could result in 
litigation and financial exposure against SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I was saying to Mr Mothibe for his 
confirmation, he was not aware of this email correspondence 
at the time. 
 
It has a sad developing history Mr Mothibe because Ms 
Kwinana responded to Ms Mpshe’s email later on that day 
10 
and you will find that back a page at page 132.13. 
 
She says the following.  I am going to highlight some 
parts of it.  Chair, you will find it in the second half of the 
page on page 132.13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She says: 
“I note that Air Chefs also responded to this bid.  
Meaning that if it is not what they do, which I doubt, 
is something they would be able to do.  Why was the 
board not notified of this decision as per the 
20 
submission?” 
 
I pause there Chair because the evidence was that they 
had received it but for some reason Mr Kwinana and Ms 
Myeni seem not to be aware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 169 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She says: 
“I recommend that the award be cancelled and if they 
claim for damages, the letter was written on the 20t h 
And what is that they would have prepared between 
the 20t h and today the 3rd?  Unless they knew that the 
tender is theirs.   
I must take this opportunity to say I am very 
disturbed by this decision which is killing SAA 
subsidiary.   
As the chairperson of SAA, it is making me very 
10 
nervous where one day I will wake up and find that 
SAA’s fleet is serviced and maintained by a foreign 
company that is completed with SAA.   
My simple rhetorical question is, if SAA and its 
subsidiaries were owned by you, would you give 
business to your competitor even if you do exactly 
the same business?   
Chairperson, this looks like treason and I request this 
to be investigated by the SIU’s...” 
 
So, Ms Mpshe then thought she ought to get a legal 
20 
opinion to back up her position and so she did procure a 
legal opinion from the internal legal department at SAA. 
 
You will find that at page 132.4.  The numbering on my 
file seems to have gone on the side.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, 132.4 with me. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 170 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair, I think what happens is it moves to 
the portrait... the landscape, not portrait allocation in the 
file.  So if you go to 132.11 and then you go back a page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You will see the numbering moves to a 
different part of the page unfortunately because it has been 
printed oddly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Which is unfortunate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think they should do a second circulation 
10 
in the right place. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And also, this is unfortunate because this 
is on half of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we will just turn it around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Put it portrait. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then put it at the right point at the 
page but just for now, if I can just then direct you to a few 
20 
pages because then you will see the start of this legal 
department’s memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I do not want to read a large part of it but 
just to give you the background.  What is said out in this 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 171 of 232 
 
memorandum is the background that Ms Mpshe already gave 
in her evidence. 
 
That it was a business decision to go out to tender 
because Air Chefs had been providing the service.  There 
were numerous complaints. 
 
It was determined to see if there was a better service 
provided.  They gone to tender.  Air Chefs had been one of 
the bidders.   
 
It had not won the bid.  And then the conclusion is really 
as follows Mr Mothibe.  It is first that the tender itself, that 
10 
process, was run fairly and lawfully. 
 
It is second that if the award was cancelled, it would 
expose SAA to legal action and financial exposure which 
would mean financial losses for SAA. 
 
It would be unlawful to withdraw the award because it 
would 
breach 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Promotion 
of 
Administrative Justice Act. 
 
And finally, the legal department recommended that 
cancelling the tender would also undermine good corporate 
governance. 
20 
 
And all of those issues were then presented to the board 
on the 28 t h of September by Ms Mpshe.  I will not take you to 
the document now but it is in the bundle at DD19C, page 
132.11. 
 
So Mr Mothibe, that is the background to this decision 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 172 of 232 
 
that the board takes on the 28t h of September 2015 
nonetheless to withdraw and award to LSG Sky Chefs. 
 
And is it your evidence before this Commission that 
none of that background came to your knowledge when you 
looked at this? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as I indicated.  We had delegated the 
review of the minutes to one of the members of the team.  
And the extracts that were provided to myself did not include 
the detail that Ms Hofmeyr is sharing and in the absence of 
that we did not believe that the matter would have been then 
10 
...[indistinct] irregularity Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But should you not have ensured that your 
team got relevant documents before it? 
MR MOTHIBE:  As I do indicate.  The requirement is for the 
team to give an extract of the salient features.  So when the 
matter was brought to my attention, my expectation was that 
what was provided were the salient features Chair. 
 
And therefore, based on that is not... the trigger or did 
not... or was not triggered Chair ... 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept today that these are the 
20 
salient features? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, looking at this today Chair, I think one 
would have had to consider these letters and as a matter of 
process Chair because of the... of what needs to be report or 
to raise ...[indistinct] irregularity, this would have gone 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 173 of 232 
 
through the necessary processes within the firm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In your response on this Mr Mothibe which 
you will find at the beginning at the file and which we have 
entered into the record as DD19A at page 9, you say at 
paragraph 40A on that page that at the meeting, and you are 
referring to you hearing of the 28 t h of September 2015: 
“The board decided to retract the domestic lounge 
catering tender and award it to Air Chefs...” 
 
And then you say in the sentence: 
“It is suggested that this was done without following 
10 
the bidding process...” 
 
Who suggested that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, I would have to go back and look at 
my... at the extracts of my notes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  H’m.  And why do you describe it as a 
suggestion that it was done without following a bidding 
process? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as I indicated, I have to look at the 
extract that was provided to myself and I would have to have 
a look at that before I can respond Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well, let us go because the board actually 
uses that language itself when it resolved to take this 
decision. 
 
That 
it 
took 
at 
a 
meeting 
on 
the 
28t h of September 2015.   
 
You will find that board minute in the same volume, 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 174 of 232 
 
DD19 but now it is the C part of it and you will find it at page 
132.16.3.1.   
 
That is the minutes of the special meeting of the SAA 
Stock Limited Board of Directors held on Monday, the 
28t h of September 2015. 
 
Is this a set of minutes you would have considered when 
you were conducting the audit. 
MR MOTHIBE:  Apologies, I seem to be on the wrong page. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
MR MOTHIBE:  132...[intervenes]

ADV HOFMEYR:  132.16.3.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I am also in the wrong... 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I missed the three before the one. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
MR MOTHIBE:  The same here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So 132 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think Mr Mothibe, we both got it that 
way. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  [laughs] 
MR MOTHIBE:  Ms Hofmeyr must have misled us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I must have misled you.  I do apologise.  
[laughs] 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 175 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Sixteen... 132.16.3.1? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mothibe, do 
you have it? 
MR MOTHIBE:  I have got it now, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And my question to you was.  Were these 
amongst the minutes that you would have considered when 
you were doing your audit work for the year? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as I have mentioned earlier.  We had 
delegated this role to review members to other team 
members.  So I would not have seen the full minutes.  I 
10 
would have seen extracts of the key feature.  What were the 
important issues pulled out of the minutes.  So I would not 
have had full sight of the minutes myself.  No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Mothibe, do you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOTHIBE:  A team member of mine would have had 
access to minutes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept responsibility for the work 
of your team? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So ultimately whatever processes 
20 
you put in place, they must be good enough that your team is 
doing what they should do, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Do you recall that you were actually 
yourself sent a copy of these minutes? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 176 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as I already indicated.  I did not see 
the minutes.  I saw extracts of the minutes and the minutes 
itself, no.  I only saw extracts of the minutes, all of that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you were sent these minutes.  So why 
do you persist in saying you only saw extracts of them? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Because I do not... the review of minutes is 
delegated Chair.  I do not read the minutes myself.  That 
work is ...[indistinct] and the team is required to provide me 
with extracts of minutes.  I have indicated, all salient 
features, all critical issues that I needed to be aware of.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So you do not dispute that you 
were sent them?  As I understand your answer, you might 
have been sent them but it was not your responsibility to 
review them.  Is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  The responsibility to review minutes was 
delegated Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you accept responsibility for the 
adequacy of that review? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So the person in your team who reviewed 
20 
these minutes would have come across the item dealing with 
Air Chefs and would have found that at page 132 point 16 
point 3 point 15.   
MR MOTHIBE:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Ms Hofmeyr.  There are two minute 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 177 of 232 
 
points and points now.  So start again. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I know.  If you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell us again.  132...? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Point 16.  One six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Point 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And point 15.  One five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair, this... when I see these numerous 
10 
numbers I shudder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ai, ai. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I apologise.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do not seem to have... you said 
132.16.3.15. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, it is actually... if you take the internal 
numbering of the minute which you will see at the top middle 
of the page, it is page 15 of 17.  If that helps Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ai, at long last.  [laughs] 
MR MOTHIBE:  [laughs] 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is late in the day.  I think we are all...  
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whoever did this numbering, please talk to 
them. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  [laughs] 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 178 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:  We have to have a better method. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of us are not accountants and 
auditors. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No, no.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you have got so many... such long 
numbers, it is difficult.  So they can read... they can find a 
shorter way of doing it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes, certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you have internal page 15 of 17? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I found it.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Mothibe found it before I found 
it. 
MR MOTHIBE:  [laughs]  I have got it Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I want to start with what the board 
resolved but there is a lengthy discussion in these minutes 
about the background, what had happened, that parliament 
20 
had raised concerns, et cetera. 
 
But then you will see just before the first “it was 
resolved” on that page, there is an entry that Mr Dickson 
who was one of the board members declared that he 
reserved his vote until he fully understood the risks of 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 179 of 232 
 
cancelling the award to the airline. 
 
And then he... there is a resolved.   
“It was resolved that a) the SAA Domestic Lounges 
tender award be retracted and b) the catering 
contract be awarded to Air Chefs without going 
through the bidding process...” 
 
Now Mr Mothibe, if one of the obligations of auditors of 
SOE’s is to determine compliance with the PFMA, and I take 
that you have accepted it in your evidence, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And a member of your team reads this 
resolution 
in 
the 
board 
minutes 
on 
the 
28t h of September 2015, that: 
“The 
SAA 
Domestic 
Lounge 
Tender 
Award 
be 
retracted and that the catering contract be awarded 
to Air Chefs without going through the bidding 
process...”   
 
Do you accept that that should have sounded an alarm? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, that would have sounded an alarm.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  And more should then have been done and 
20 
required of management to explain why it was that a tender 
that had been awarded was now being retracted without 
going through a bidding process.  Do you accept that? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, as I indicated.  Yes, there should have 
been an alarm but also other factors need to be considered.  
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 180 of 232 
 
Obviously, enquiring and understanding of as to why that 
...[indistinct] and arrived at that reasonable conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure that we are all on 
the same page.  Would a member of your team by reading 
this minutes have immediately known that Air Chefs was a 
subsidiary of SAA? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Yes, Chair.  They would have known. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now, if they would have known that, 
would they have been concerned about this part even if they 
took the view, which I think you expressed in your statement, 
10 
that awarding the contract to Air Chefs would be in sourcing 
and therefore in terms of the view you expressed, there 
would no obligation on SAA to go out to tender? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
Chair, 
that 
would 
be 
a 
reasonable 
...[indistinct]  Then the result also ...[indistinct] to take that 
view Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But the point... what I am asking.  I 
am trying, if I evaluate your answers to Ms Hofmeyr’s 
questions, whether if that is the view they held, that this 
would be in sourcing and that it would not be necessary or 
20 
there would be no obligation on SAA to go out to tender, 
would this have raised a red flag or not? 
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair, if the view... it was... is it to be viewed 
that this amounts to in sourcing and it is a business decision 
that was taken Chair, it would not have necessarily raised a 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 181 of 232 
 
red flag Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I just wanted to check if... we might 
not be on the same page but I wanted everybody to know 
what my query was. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, whether or not there would have 
been an obligation to go out to tender or not, might be 
another issue that must be looked at. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed, Chair.  Thank you.  If your team 
member had read the preceding discussion in this minute Mr 
10 
Mothibe, he would have noted or she would have noted on 
the previous page, that is 132.16.3.14, that the CFO has 
made a remark against the letter G on that page. 
 
You see what the CFO said there is that: 
“He was not in disagreement with the sentiment that 
the business should be given to Air Chefs but in his 
capacity as CFO it would be remiss of him not to 
mention that the bottom-line impact for the group, 
should the tender be awarded to Air Chefs with 
approximately R 4,5 million, which was far less than 
20 
the exposure of R 85 million should SAA be sued by 
the preferred bidder for the contract price...”   
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I read that paragraph, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So again, just probing what you would 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 182 of 232 
 
have expected of your team member, taking the Chair ’s 
point as our stating point and in deference to your team 
member, maybe when just the resolution is read, there is 
some 
understanding 
that 
this 
is 
just 
an 
in-sourcing 
decision.  But, Mr Mothibe, if your colleague had also read 
G, would not a red flag have gone up?  Even if this is in-
sourcing there is a risk of R85 million exposure for SAA if 
they take this step. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, obviously be wary of not using 
hindsight because some of this information was certainly 
10 
not available to myself when the assessment was made. 
I think in reading this, you definitely would have to 
consider the implications of this financial loss to the entity 
and consider whether there is other obligations that we 
have had. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And – apologies, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from this and maybe even if he or 
she did not see this part of the minutes, what about if he or 
she knew because I think he or she would have known that 
a previous decision had been made already to award the 
20 
tender to an outside company.  On hearing that a decision 
was taken to revoke that, would that not – and give it to a 
subsidiary, would the fact that a decision had already been 
made to award the tender to an outside company not also 
have been something to be concerned about, to say well, if 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 183 of 232 
 
you have already decided to take – go out on open tender 
and you have decided to award the tender, can you just 
take it back like that, retract it and give it to an internal 
entity?  Is that the kind of thing that would not have raised 
a red flag or not really, as you understand the position. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, it is fairly difficult because now I 
am responding having read what I have read and having 
listened to the what Ms Hofmeyr has presented and I am 
worried that one is using hindsight and that.  However, 
Chair …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me maybe put you at ease.  
When one is dealing with this kind of situation where you 
are thinking of what reaction could be expected from 
somebody in a certain situation, there may be situations 
where you are able to say outright of course this would 
have been a red flat, you know?  There would be situations 
where you say no.  And then there would be situation 
where you say I am not sure.  So that might be a measure 
that is helpful, a tool that is helpful for you not to use 
hindsight.  So what are you able to say because the 
20 
questions that are put to you by Ms Hofmeyr are aimed at 
establishing whether somebody should have picked up that 
this was a potential problem and therefore taken certain 
steps. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I understand you, Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 184 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So going back to, I think my question 
because I think it was my question that you were trying to 
deal with.  Simply knowing that the company had gone out 
on tender, bidders had put in their bids, and a decision had 
been made to award the tender to an outsider.  If they are 
now suddenly were retracting it, would that be something 
that on your understanding should raise a red flat with a 
member of your team? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I would think there would have been 
reason to ask more questions on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes.  I think there would have been reason 
to ask more questions, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And, Mr Mothibe, if we read further in 
the background to this decision taken by the board on that 
day – I do not suggest we read all of it but I can tell you 
that in paragraph D on page 132, point 16.3.14, the point 
20 
is made that the business decision was taken to go out to 
tender because Air Chefs had in recent years been 
damaging the SAA brand due to poor offerings.  So the 
person reading these minutes knows that fact, right?  
Knows a business decision was then taken to tender.  The 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 185 of 232 
 
reader of the minutes knows that the CFO is saying if we 
move this to Air Chefs there could be exposure of R85 
million to SAA and furthermore, the reader actually also 
knows that the genesis of this difficulty is the questions 
that the Chairperson faced in parliament and you find that 
at I on the page.  There it is recorded that – the 
Chairperson highlighted that some members of parliament 
had a recent meeting of the standing committee on finance, 
it raised a serious objection to SAA awarding a catering 
contractor 
foreign-owned 
company 
whilst 
it 
had 
a 
10 
subsidiary which offered the same services.   
 
It might have been useful for parliament to be told 
but we understand from Ms Mpshe it was not, that the 
reason why that happened was because a valid tender 
process had been run and LSG Sky Chefs had come out on 
top.   
Unfortunately, parliament was not given that insight 
but all of that background is then before the reader of 
these minutes and I take your evidence before the 
Commission today, Mr Mothibe, to be this should have 
20 
raised a red flag and more questions should have been 
asked, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Now 
in 
your 
statement 
to 
the 
Commission 
dealing 
with 
this, 
you 
said 
it 
was 
not 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 186 of 232 
 
necessary to follow a bidding process.  Why did you say 
that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, it was based on the extracts of the 
minutes that I had read. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   As you sit here today does that remain 
your view? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I did indicate earlier, with this 
information there was a need to ask more questions, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The board certainly knew it was required 
to go through a bidding process, did it not? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   From reading of this, it does look like that, 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And we know as a fact management had 
warned it against withdrawing the LSG Sky Chefs award, 
had it not? 
MR MOTHIBE:   From the minutes presented it is the case, 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it had been told in the legal opinion 
that it would be unlawful for it to cancel that award, 
correct? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now, Mr Mothibe, in your statement 
dealing with this issue, as I read it, you first of all say no 
bidding process was required but you have now fairly 
conceded in your defence, Mr Mothibe, that the person 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 187 of 232 
 
reading these minutes should not have come to that 
conclusion. 
But you say in the alternative – let us go to page 9 
of your statement, just so that you have it in front of you at 
DD19A page 9.  You say – you cater for a different 
situation where the bidding process was required and that 
is at the bottom of page 9, the last paragraph, the second 
sentence in.  You say: 
“Assuming that a bidding process was required, 
which I am advised it was not…” 
10 
But we are working on your assumption now. 
“…I would have required evidence that the SAA 
board took this decision with the intention of 
breaching a law or regulation or that it acted 
negligently, which evidence I did not have at the 
time.  Consequently, I had no reason to believe that 
a reportable irregularity took place.” 
I just want to pause there for a moment because this is a 
point you repeat a few times in your statement.   
As you have captured the reportable irregularity 
20 
obligation there, you seem to be indicating that you 
thought that as the auditors of the SAA you did not only 
have to find unlawful conduct on the part of a person 
responsible for management that had those consequences 
we looked at, you seem to be saying you also had to find 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 188 of 232 
 
that that decision was taken with the intention of breaching 
the law or that it was done negligently.  
Mr Mothibe, I do not see that requirement in the 
Auditing Professions Act, do you? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, in the extract that I have put in 
here, that requirement is not included there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please raise your voice? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I was saying, Chair, in the extract or in the 
definition or understanding of the requirements to report 
reportable irregularity, that matter of intention is not 
10 
mentioned, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So then I want to put it to you that it was 
not required of you that you were to establish whether this 
was done with negligence or intention, was it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I would like to have a look at the 
full Act because, Chair, certainly the question of intention, 
Chair, 
if 
my 
memory 
serves 
me 
right, 
there 
is 
a 
requirement but I would like to confirm that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may need to have a look at the Act 
if you wish to but let us see if we cannot deal with this in a 
20 
different way.  When you say in that paragraph that you 
would require there to be – you would require there to have 
been evidence that the board took this decision with the 
intention of breaching a law or regulation, what did you 
mean? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 189 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, earlier in the statement I do 
mention that the understand was that it was a business 
decision that has been made to have the catering to be in-
sourced to Air Chefs.  So, Chair, to say that if there is a 
genuine resolution that has been taken, much as the board 
may have erred, Chair, the – let me rephrase that, Chair.   
 
The three requirements here, Chair, talk of a 
material financial loss, it talks of fraud, amounts to theft.  
Or it talks of material breach of fiduciary duty.  Chair, 
where these elements occur, Chair, you do sometimes find 
10 
that the intention – the action taken is that genuinely to 
defraud or to cause financial loss or to breach laws or 
regulations and breaching fiduciary duty.   
 
I think, Chair, when I responded to Ms Hofmeyr ’s 
question I did indicate that there is also an element of 
judgment that is involved albeit it, as Ms Hofmeyr said, is 
the bar might be low.  But it is important to understand why 
decisions are made, what was the intention.   
And Chair, if there is an intention to break the law, 
that makes it an obvious – that makes it easy for one to 
20 
make the call, Chair, but where there were genuine basis 
decisions that were being followed and it resulted in a 
breach of law or an omission, Chair, I think that is where 
one then begins to apply judgment in determining whether 
or not this was in fact a reportable irregularity or there 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 190 of 232 
 
were some other issues to be involved. 
And also importantly, Chair, I would obviously would 
have had to consult within the firm to ensure that I have 
probably applied my mind to the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us say that – let me tell you 
what I think you – what my understanding of what you were 
saying there, is it is that you are saying that you would not 
consider if – if, for example, the board said do not take 
this to open tender.  But in saying that, they were in good 
faith, you would say the failure to go out to tender is not 
10 
an reportable irregularity even if it is an irregularity just 
because they were in good faith, they were acting in good 
faith, they did not believe that what they were doing was 
unlawful.  But if that is what you are saying, I am 
concerned.  Is that not what you are saying? 
MR MOTHIBE:   No, no, Chair, that is not what I am 
saying, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what are you saying? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I am saying, Chair, that when these 
incidents do happen, you need to get the full facts behind 
20 
this and get an understanding of what transpired.  As soon 
as 
it 
hits 
all 
the 
necessary 
triggers 
for 
reportable 
irregularity, I would also then follow a process to consult 
within the firm to make sure that my understanding is 
correct, Chair.   
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 191 of 232 
 
 
One of the things that we need to consider, Chair, is 
obviously intention.  As I indicate, as soon as there is 
intention to breach law, it makes it easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that is what we are 
concerned about because if the law is – if you are going to 
obtain these services you must go out to tender and the 
entity decides not to go out to tender and that decision 
exposes the entity to financial loss, serious financial loss, 
why is that not reportable, a reportable irregularity? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, maybe if I can give an example.  
10 
When one looks at noncompliance matters – and if you do 
not comply with the law one may argue technically that you 
have broken the law and therefore – it then basically 
becomes a reportable irregularity.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   So then there would be many items that 
needs to be reported.  So, Chair, I think all I am saying is 
that there are areas where one has to think and apply 
judgment but I am certainly not saying that, Chair, it is only 
about intention, that is certainly not what I am putting 
20 
forward, Chair.  I do not know if …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Hofmeyr may take it further but 
maybe where you want to – where you are required to be 
satisfied, whether you are dealing with a situation of fraud, 
maybe in that situation might your concern about intention 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 192 of 232 
 
might be understandable even though, as Ms Hofmeyr said 
earlier on and you agreed with her, that the bar for 
purposes of reportable irregularity is lower, you know?  But 
maybe there might be something there, I do not know, but 
other than that, if the law said you must go out on tender 
and you do not go out on tender, it does not seem to me 
that your intention is of any relevance.  Do you agree? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I hear where the Chair is coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you hear but you agree? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do agree, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOTHIBE:   That I do agree, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, and just to follow that 
up because, Chair, you have highlighted in your questions 
the first of the three criteria for the reportable irregularity, 
it is the unlawful act plus material financial loss.  As you 
put it to Mr Mothibe, there is no intention relevant to that 
and Mr Mothibe has fairly conceded that. 
 
I want to submit that also in relation to the third, a 
20 
material 
breach 
of 
fiduciary 
duty, 
intention 
is 
not 
referenced and not relevant.  Do you accept that, Mr 
Mothibe? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do hear where you are coming from, 
Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 193 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you accept it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept that as correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I accept as correct, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Mr Mothibe.  Just helps and 
also for the record purposes that we know the common 
ground between us. 
 
Right, so my question then is to re-evaluate what 
your team did because as the Chair has put it to you, if 
there was a requirement to go out to tender – indeed they 
did go out to tender, a third party was awarded the tender 
10 
but then it was withdrawn.   
 
Then you have the requisite first unlawful act 
requirement, do you not, for a reportable irregularity? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes, if there is a requirement to go on 
tender which I was advised there was – it was not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were advised how?  You spoke 
about being given a sort of synopsis from the team that 
said this was in-sourcing.  Did they actually positively 
state there was no need to go out to tender for this award? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Well, Chair, an in-sourcing arrangement, it 
20 
is something that you do in the – you have gone out and 
set up a business process and you are now taking it 
forward and delivering within your business, Chair, so 
something like – if you are in-sourcing, Chair, it does not 
require a tender and in the discussions that we had, in-
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 194 of 232 
 
sourcing does not require a tender, Chair, it is not a 
requirement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if it was required, we have got the 
unlawful act.  Was it committed by a person responsible for 
management of the entity? 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Ms Hofmeyr, I see the 
noise is back but I do not know whether we are warmer 
with the noise back or whether we are worse off.  I feel 
quite some cold. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I do not know whether the air con 
was switched temporarily and then later on was brought 
back or whether it is controlled centrally and therefore 
once it is on it is on, but I think I do see that I am not the 
only one feeling cold. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, can I make this suggestion?  We 
are just at four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Maybe we should just talk about 
arrangements and how much longer because if we are to 
20 
go on maybe we can have a short adjournment, comfort 
break, we can establish what the position is in the room 
and try and get the best warming conditions and then 
return. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 195 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you are in a position to do so.  I did 
check with Mr Mothibe and his legal team, they are in a 
position to remain beyond four today, if that is suitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then see how we go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your estimate of how much more 
time you need? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I always reluctantly give these 
estimations.   Whenever I think something is going to be 
quick it always takes much longer but I can tell you that I 
10 
am about two thirds of the way through my questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So there will only be a third more but 
reportable irregularities we have covered and there is only 
a second example of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then there are one or two more 
things.  I think if we took another hour, I would make a 
good advance in completing but we may well need to still 
reconvene tomorrow for a bit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Well, the question that – if 
we are going to need to convene tomorrow, it may be that 
we should not try to go much further. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it may well also be that we could go 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 196 of 232 
 
up to five.  I have more flexibility tomorrow than I may 
have made you believe some time back.  So tomorrow I am 
able to sit for quite some time but I do not mind us going 
up to five today.  It is just that of course if you go up to 
five and Mr Mothibe and his legal team have to come back 
tomorrow for one hour it might not be such a good idea to 
go for another hour rather than take two hours tomorrow 
but I am not sure.  Maybe, Mr Mothibe, are you flexible 
either way or what is your position? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I am looking at my team but I am 
10 
happy to – if it means five o’clock, we can wrap it up but I 
am happy with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you are happy with tomorrow as 
well? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I am happy with tomorrow but, Chair, 
obviously if we can get it done today, it is preferable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr, shall we go up to five and 
see how it goes or what is your own sense? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, my own sense is it would be 
advantageous to take the extra hour. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It just means we are going to safely 
finish tomorrow with our second witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We also do have to do some logistical 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 197 of 232 
 
things tomorrow and if there is any delay there I do not 
want that compromising us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So maybe we take the extra hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe then let us take a short 
comfort break and then we will come back do an hour. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which might take us to just after five 
o’clock and then we adjourn. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly.  Thank you, we are indebted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will adjourn for ten minutes.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  For my own purposes 
I must say it feels like it is slightly warmer, I don’t know if 
everyone shares that view.   No, okay I am being told not 
so maybe it is just my optimism. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you have an overcoat, some of us 
20 
don’t. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies Chair.  There were efforts 
being made but they have done as much as can be done as 
I understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 198 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe just before the adjournment 
momentarily we were going through the elements of the 
report of irregularity, and I was checking the second 
requirement with you that the decision or the act, the 
unlawful act was taken by a person responsible for the 
management of the company, do you accept that that, that 
was met in this case? 
MR MOTHIBE:   It was met in this case Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then those three results, the 
material financial loss, the fraud or theft and then the third 
10 
one, the breach of the fiduciary duties, I’d like to put it to 
you, Mr Mothibe that this did constitute this decision, a 
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board and I say that 
because it would not have been in the best interests of 
SAA for the Board to overturn a valid and lawful tender 
process against advice of its lawyers and management 
simply because the Chair received some tough questions in 
Parliament, a decision which exposed SAA to R85million – 
potentially to R85million in claims, do you accept that, that 
would not be in accordance with the fiduciary duties of the 
20 
Board? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair it would not have been in line with 
the fiduciary duties of the Board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And, might it have been a decision that 
caused it material financial loss? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 199 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair there were risks of damages 
highlighted 
by 
the 
lawyers, 
the 
contract 
was 
worth 
R85million though material financial loss Chair, what we 
have to determine, Chair, what the potential loss would be 
and then as I indicated was the information available, we 
then consult with our internal risk department which advise 
– which would advise us when one reports …[indistinct] or 
even it did indeed reported an irregularity.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   I’m not sure I just have your answer on 
whether the risk of exposure for the R85million claim 
10 
would, in your view, also render it a reportable irregularity 
because of a material – a potential material financial loss. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I indicated  Chair, certainly a 
material loss is not questionable, but a financial loss to the 
entity, there definitely would be financial loss to the entity, 
the quantum thereof Chair, it’s what we do not know, that is 
why, Chair, I do agree that one would then – the process 
that would be followed within PwC is to gather all the facts 
and then take it through a process where there is 
consultation to assist one in determining whether or not it 
20 
is a material irregularity. So, Chair, even when all these 
facts have been – or we have determined what we believe 
is, according to these requirements, I am still required to 
take it through a process, through a consultation – 
internally with a - before the final call is made Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 200 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us say you are auditing SAA 
now, you come across this and the facts are or include that 
this decision by the Board could result in SAA being sued 
or damages to the amount of R85million by the successful 
company, would that – would you regard that as – do you 
regard the decision by the Board to withdraw that tender as 
– and give it to a subsidiary as a reportable irregularity, on 
those facts? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair as I indicated, I would definitely 
gather all those facts and consult as required by our 
10 
processes at PwC.  So, Chair, the decision to determine 
whether or not it’s a material – it’s a reportable irregularity 
would not only be mine as the division leader I would have 
to – I am required to consult internally to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What more would you look for in order to 
make up your mind, whether, in your own view, the test for 
reportability is met with, Ms Hofmeyr said is – you know it 
puts a low bar. 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
 
Chair, 
as 
I 
indicated 
all 
these 
requirements would probably have been met and therefore, 
20 
Chair I would have put together the documentation that’s 
necessary and say, these are my views, I do believe 
there’s a potential reportable irregularity and I would have 
to submit that through our consultation process so that we 
can confirm my thought process before I would report to 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 201 of 232 
 
the regulator if they agree with me.  So there is a process 
that needs to be followed Chair, I do not make the decision 
on my own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it correct, that as you sit there, 
when you hear these facts, your own view, leave out 
whether somebody else might persuade you differently, 
your 
own 
view, 
this 
would 
have 
been 
a 
reportable 
irregularity, in light of the potential litigation and the 
amount involve and …[intervenes]? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Well Chair, the – or material key level 
10 
South African Revenue was is set at R250million so the 
potential damage of R85million would have been below that 
threshold of R250million, so Chair, one would – that is why 
it’s important that – because of the other elements that 
have been breached it is imperative for one to consult and 
make sure that you make the right call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry these three requirement – 
these requirements are not – isn’t the position that each 
one of them is enough…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   To make the irregularity – an irregularity 
reportable, isn’t it, you don’t need to have all three, yes? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t need to have all three, yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   That’s correct Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 202 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    So – but I think you already conceded, 
and you must tell me if you didn’t, when Ms Hofmeyr was 
asking you, that the one appeared and yet three on page 9 
of your statement you said, that one is met, is that right, 
was met …[intervenes]? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair you’re talking about the material 
breach of fiduciary duty? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ah ha. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agreed with that one, I don’t know 
10 
number two might not, I don’t know.  So, the one relating to 
an act that is likely to cause material financial loss to the 
entity or to any partner or member or shareholder or 
creditor, that one, you seem to have some doubt whether 
that one was met?  
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, yes because the amount is below 
material level of R250million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do consider that the breach was by 
somebody in Management and also Chair, my assessment 
20 
has got to be tested by somebody else to ensure that I’ve 
correctly assesses what has been because as I say Chair, I 
would have put all the facts together including the 
amounts, the fact that there was a breach of fiduciary duty 
Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 203 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hmm, okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mothibe, I just want 
to pick up on this point that you’ve emphasised in your 
recent answers to the Chair about, you would need to go to 
others at PwC to run your thinking past them.  Do I 
understand your evidence correctly, when I say that’s what 
you’ve emphasised?  
MR MOTHIBE:  Chair that is correct, once such has been 
identified there’s a process that we follow within PwC to 
ensure that we have correctly assessed the supposed 
10 
reported irregularity Chair, so there is a process we need 
to follow.  I wouldn’t do it on my own directly, Chair, no.  
ADV HOFMEYR: But Mr Mothibe, apologies, do you accept 
that the obligation under the Act, the Auditing Professions 
Act is an obligation that falls on you?   
MR MOTHIBE:   The obligation does fall on me, Chair but I 
do take guidance. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But it is therefore, I would put to you, 
fair for us to ask you what your determination was because 
the obligation under Section 45, you’ve accepted, is an 
20 
obligation on you, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that should be read, I suggest, with 
Section 52 which indicates that a registered Auditor who 
fails to report a reportable irregularity in accordance with 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 204 of 232 
 
Section 45 shall be guilty of an offence, are you aware of 
that Section? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I am aware of that Section. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, if you, as the individual registered 
Auditor of SAA had failed to report a reportable irregularity, 
then it is you who would have committed that offence, 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That would be correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The process that you talk about, of 
10 
consulting others within the firm, would its purpose have 
been to enable you to form a view whether this was a 
reportable irregularity or would its purpose not have been 
to help you form a view because you would have formed a 
view but maybe it is a process that you are required to 
follow in terms of the policies of the firm irrespective of 
what view you have taken? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I would have taken a view and 
Chair as I indicate some of these matters might require 
judgment and it helps me to ensure that I have conceded 
20 
all of the tasks that I would have conceded Chair in order 
to determine whether it is or it is not a reportable 
irregularity…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’ll tell you why I’m a little concerned 
about your evidence, if I understand it correctly or at least 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 205 of 232 
 
why I seek clarification because it seems to me that you 
are quite senior within the firm, you know, I think you said 
you became a partner in 2003 or 2002, is that right?  
MR MOTHIBE:   2003 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and you are close to 20 years as a 
partner now, you know, and it doesn’t appear to me that 
this particular requirement is a complex requirement, so 
I’m wondering why you would need that consultation 
process whether you would need it in order to form a view 
or 
whether, 
within 
the 
firm, 
there 
is 
an 
internal 
10 
arrangement to say, if you think a particular decision is 
reportable you must have a consultation, consultation 
process.  In other words, whether you would be doing that 
process to comply with the internal policies or whether you 
would be doing it as part - or as a process towards you 
reaching a decision or reaching a view? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair there certainly – there is a 
compliance requirement, we do have that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but you would have taken a view on 
your own? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes Chair, the fact that triggered that 
means that you’ve already seen something and something 
has triggered that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOTHIBE:   So, you need to go through a certain 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 206 of 232 
 
compliance Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe I’d like to move to the 
second contract of which I am interested in the topic of 
reportable irregularities and that is going to be the Swiss 
Port Ground Handling contract and you start to deal with 
that in your statement at page 10 that’s in DD19A at page 
10 towards the bottom. 
MR MOTHIBE:   I’ve got it Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, now, Chair, you’ll be aware, 
10 
Mr Mothibe I’m not sure whether you’ll be as aware as 
those of us who live the Commission every day but the 
Commission has received extensive evidence about this 
contract, this contract that Swiss Port concluded with SAA 
in March of 2016 to provide ground handling services for a 
period of five years and it was to the value of R1.8billion 
and we’ve also heard evidence in this Commission that it 
was 
awarded 
that 
contract 
without 
a 
preceding 
procurement process having been followed. So to give you 
the background that puts it, for us, on the radar of a 
20 
substantial contract of significant value in respect of which 
there was no procurement process and so we ask you to 
address why that was not reported as a reportable 
irregularity.  So let’s go, if we may, to page 10 and what 
you say about it and really your answer begins over the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 207 of 232 
 
page, the one I want to focus on at page 11, it’s the second 
paragraph from the top of the page, you say, 
“During the performance of our audit procedures in 
respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2016 
the agreement with Swiss Port did not form part of 
our testing sample.  I was not aware of the Board 
resolution nor the circumstances surrounding the 
award 
and 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Swiss 
Port 
agreement.  In the circumstances, in the absence of 
such knowledge I did not consider whether this 
10 
matter 
is 
or 
may 
have 
been 
a 
reportable 
irregularity”, 
 
Mr Mothibe, the first thing I notice about this, that 
one is different to the Air Chefs contract as I understand it, 
on the Air Chefs contract you were aware of it but at the 
time you had concluded it wasn’t a reportable irregularity, 
correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in this occasion you actually didn’t 
consider it, is that correct? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I was not aware of the – of this 
contract therefore I would not have been able to consider 
it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And how could it be that you weren’t 
aware of the contract? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 208 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair according to my knowledge the 
contract was concluded on the 14 t h of March 2016.  When 
we initially requested Board minutes from SAA the minutes 
of this meeting were – we were not told it is not available 
to us so Chair, we wouldn’t have been aware of that 
approval.  Chair I think it is also important to note Swiss 
Port is a long-standing service provider to the South 
African Airways.  I stand to be corrected, Chair, I think 
there are three or four ground handling companies that 
provide services to the – to South African Airways which 
10 
Swiss Port being one of them.  So, Chair – and the 
amounts are fairly similar in that regard.  So Chair, a 
contract entered into with SAA to provide ground handling 
services by Swiss Port, on its own would not necessarily 
have understanding the business and who are the service 
providers would not necessarily have been odd if that was 
seen, even if one looks at the amounts involved.  Chair, if 
the contract is awarded on the 14 t h of March you’d think – 
had you seen the contract, the services provided would 
have run from what is read now in the documentation, from 
20 
April going forward.  So, for the period of 31 March 2016 
there wouldn’t have been any expenses flowing from that 
contract.  So Chair, as indicated at year end, when you 
consider minutes of the Board meetings, those minutes 
were not available to us so we wouldn’t have identified that 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 209 of 232 
 
and as I do indicate, Chair, on its own, the Board awarding 
the contract and also because of the amounts involved we 
would expect that such approval shall go through the Board 
of Directors because the amounts were – in terms of 
delegation of authority the amount was fairly high and 
obviously the expectation is that it would have gone to the 
Board after it had gone through the necessary approval 
processes within South African Airways. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Mr Mothibe it went through no 
process at all, this contract. 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, as I do indicate, at year end when 
you went in, the minutes giving the approval were not 
available but secondly Chair as I indicated, a decision by 
the Board or an approval of the Swiss Port contract at the 
Board, 
because 
of 
the 
contract 
involved 
it 
wouldn’t 
necessarily raise any concern because the amount would 
be so high they’re above the authority of all other levels 
and it did in fact require to come to the Board for approval. 
So on its own it would not have necessarily given – or 
given cause for concern if one can put it like that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But Mr Mothibe you’ve already confirmed 
in your evidence that one of the things that you do as 
Auditors of State-owned enterprises, is determine whether 
any expenditure is irregular under the PFMA, don’t you? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That’s correct. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 210 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   And the mere fact that it falls within the 
Board’s 
delegation 
authority 
does 
not 
answer 
that 
question, does it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When you do the determination, yes you 
will see that there’s some – that gets tested determine 
that, this contract, at year end, those minutes were not 
available it was not selected for testing purposes, we did 
select contracts for testing purposes but the Swiss Port 
contract was not one of them. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Mr Mothibe I’m aware of your position on 
10 
sampling but that was not the question I asked.  The 
question I asked was, the mere fact that the amount of a 
contract falls within the authority of the Board to approve 
is not enough to answer whether that contract constitutes 
irregular expenditure, is it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair that is correct but for one to 
determine whether or not the contract falls in the definition 
of a irregular contract one would have had to look at the 
procurement 
process, 
you 
would 
have 
to 
follow 
the 
procurement 
process 
to 
determine 
that 
because 
the 
20 
contract was not in our sample we did not follow the 
procurement 
process 
for 
this 
particular 
contract…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, I think let’s go step by step 
Mr Mothibe.  I think your answer to Ms Hofmeyr ’s question 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 211 of 232 
 
is yes.  You have provided quite some explanation but it 
seems to me that your answer is yes.  She asked you, do 
you not agree that the mere fact that the amount of the 
contract falls within the authority of the Board is not 
enough to say, this contract doesn’t constitute irregular 
expenditure and it seems to me, you are saying, we have 
to look at the procurement process as well which it seems 
to suggest to me that you agree with her, so I think you 
say, yes I agree, it’s not the only issue. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes the she might ask you further 
questions but to that question, and answer that says yes, 
is enough. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in fairness to you, we will now look 
at the sampling question – well in a moment because the 
one thing I just want to pick up on is, you’ve indicated that 
those Board minutes were not made available to you and 
that is why you didn’t pick up the contract, is that right? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   At the stage when we performed our work 
and let me give you a sample those minutes were not made 
available to us. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Should you not have been intent to 
ensure that you had all the Board minutes for the relevant 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 212 of 232 
 
year that you were auditing? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Those minutes were made available to us 
at a much later stage so yes we did have sight of those 
minutes but it was at a much later stage. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry say that again you were given 
them at a later stage, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   But not – yes but now when we were doing 
our sampling and we were doing our work. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay but then irrespective of time if, 
pursuant to your audit work, even if after the sampling you 
10 
are given the Board minutes and the Board minutes raise 
concerns about reportable irregularities, do you accept that 
you would have obligations to follow the procedures 
required? 
MR MOTHIBE:   May I ask you to repeat the question? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I understand you to say you weren’t 
given them – these Board minutes reflecting the decision in 
April or shortly after the year end, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you were given them, correct me if 
20 
I’m wrong, at some point before you signed your audit 
report on the 30 t h of September 2016, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then I put to you but it doesn’t 
matter, as I understand it when you come to learn of the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 213 of 232 
 
subject matter of a reportable irregularity if it is a 
reportable irregularity you must report it, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, so then let’s go to why it 
wasn’t in your sample…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I think implied in Ms Hofmeyr ’s 
last question to which you have agreed is that, as long as 
you have not signed your report, if something comes to 
your attention that may indicate that there is some 
irregularity you are supposed to look at that before you 
10 
sign, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Mr Mothibe.  Then let’s go to 
the question of why this R1.8billion contract did not find its 
way into your sample, because I understand that, from your 
statement to be part of your explanation for why it wasn’t 
on 
your 
radar 
for 
reportable 
irregularity 
and 
you’ve 
repeated that today.  So, with that background, I’d like to 
remind you of what Mr Sokombela’s evidence was before 
20 
this Commission.  Mr Sokombela assisted the Commission 
in understanding how Audit Risk Assessments are done 
and I want to just understand whether you have a similar 
understanding to Mr Sokombela, okay.  Mr Sokombela’s 
evidence – and Chair, just for the record this appears in 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 214 of 232 
 
the transcript of the 20 t h of February of this year 2020 at 
page 88 and then also at transcript of 21 February 2020 at 
pages 
8 
to 
83. 
 
So 
what 
Mr 
Sokombela 
told 
this 
Commission is that, an Audit Risk Assessment is designed 
to identify contracts that raise red flags, do you accept 
that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And he also went on to say, the flags 
could be raised by things like controversy in the media, or 
because 
when 
the 
auditors 
conduct 
their 
research 
10 
processes something about the contract concerns them, do 
you accept that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And he enlightened us as to why the 
Auditor General had identified the Swiss Port contract as 
an Audit risk.  He said that there was litigation around it of 
which he became aware, there was a discovery that Swiss 
Port had not – did not have the requisite license and he 
also highlighted the fact that he had taken a number of 
years for the contract to be concluded.  If those items had 
20 
come to your attention, would it have constituted a red flag 
for you?  
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair, I think it is important to note that I 
concede the matters that come to my attention that I get 
from the audit.  As I did indicate Swiss Port was a long-
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 215 of 232 
 
standing service provider to South African Airways.  The 
value of the contract, correctly so, because of the amount 
had to go through to the Board because of the delegation 
of authority.  So when we reviewed the minutes, seeing 
Swiss Port there and the number, the contract involved, on 
its own did not trigger any concerns there because, Chair, 
if you look at the amount involved and what they had been 
paid over the years and we do know that they are 
continuing services for the South African Airways, so on its 
own that did not trigger any concerns, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry Mr Mothibe, I see you were 
continuing. 
MR MOTHIBE:   The only thing Chair, the – Ms Hofmeyr 
makes 
reference 
to, 
if 
I 
am 
correct 
did 
you 
say 
investigations which were – we were not aware of when we 
performed our audit so that would have been item that 
would could have caused one thing to open your eyes much 
wider, to raise red flags but at that stage we don’t have 
that available so it did not trigger that there is more to it 
than what we had been provided. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe I’ll come back to the 
question of investigations but  you’ve emphasised a few 
times 
the 
fact 
that 
Swiss 
Port 
was 
in 
an 
ongoing 
relationship with SAA and as I understand your evidence, 
that’s why, when you saw later in the year before you 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 216 of 232 
 
signed your audit report that this big agreement had been 
concluded with it, that didn’t, on its own, raise an alarm, is 
that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe were you aware, when you 
were auditing SAA from 2014 right up until this point that 
Swiss Port was being paid every month without there being 
any contract in place? 
MR MOTHIBE:   No Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Would it have concerned you to learn 
10 
that it was being paid all throughout that period with no 
contract? 
MR MOTHIBE:   It would have been concerning yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It would have been something you’d 
wanted to have interrogated further, would it not? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That would be correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because what actually happened was, a 
tender process was run in 2011, Swiss Port was awarded a 
contract for five years in 2012 and then at no point, from 
2012 was a contract ever concluded with it, did you pick 
20 
that up in your three years of auditing at SAA? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair on the items that were shared for 
sampling Swiss Port was not part of those. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Never in all three years? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I can go and confirm on my files, but 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 217 of 232 
 
I do not recall seeing that Chair remember that Chair the 
universe of contracts in SAA they’ve got quite a number of 
contracts Chair, it is a fairly big universe Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But it’s a requirement of an auditor of a 
state-owned 
enterprise 
that 
they 
check 
whether 
the 
disclosed amount of irregular expenditure in the financials 
each year is verified, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How do you do that if you don’t check 
what is being expended against the existence of underlying 
10 
contracts for that expenditure? 
MR MOTHIBE:   You check that but the contracts are on a 
sample basis. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so we’re back at samples and what 
I was taking you through was Mr Sokombela’s indication 
about the Audit Risk Assessment which you accepted and 
particularly red flag contracts.  You see, Mr Mothibe, my 
understanding of Mr Sokombela’s evidence is that, before 
you even get to sampling and this was a point, Chair, you 
might recall, you sought greater clarity on, with Mr 
20 
Sokombela, before you get to sampling there are certain 
high risk contracts, red flag contracts, that, because of 
your risk assessment you are going to be considering 
before you even get into sampling, do you accept that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I don’t think I would necessarily 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 218 of 232 
 
comment on the approach taken by Mr Sokombela when he 
performed his work but save to say, Chair, yes you do 
identify material contracts to the extent that there are 
concerns or issues, you would include them in your 
samples yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR: But as I have your evidence you did not 
identify the Swiss Port contract as a high-risk contract, 
correct?   
MR MOTHIBE:   This particular contract was identified as 
high risk in 2016 Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It had  been picked up – well Swiss 
Port’s contracting with SAA had been picked up by Ernst & 
Young who did a review in the second half of 2015, were 
you aware of that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I’m aware that Ernst & Young were 
contracted to do some work on long carrying contracts and 
some that had rolled over, so I am aware that Ernst & 
Young was appointed to perform work at SAA, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was actually appointed to consider 
Procurement and Contract Management within SAA, were 
20 
you aware of that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and they were doing it for the 
second half of 2015, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 219 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, would it not have been something 
you wanted to consider as the auditors of SAA, what the 
outcomes of that process had been conducted by Ernst & 
Young? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair we certainly had interest in that 
assignment, however, at the time that we signed our audit 
opinion, that work had yet to be finalised. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you ask for any reports that Ernst & 
Young had prepared in the course of the year? 
MR MOTHIBE:   We had engaged with Management, firstly 
10 
to understand the scope of the contract or of the work that 
they had to perform, we understood guidance that tap - I 
think there were three items each under four different 
headings Chair and as I indicated, Chair, when we 
enquired of Management that work was still ongoing and 
the contracts had been finalised, due to the fact that it was 
also – there’s an element of forensic work that was going 
on Chair, there was something that took some time to 
complete and when we signed our audit opinion, their final 
report had not been completed, Chair. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I just wanted to get clear on the facts, 
did you ask to see – albeit not a final report, any version of 
the report that Ernst & Young had prepared? 
MR MOTHIBE:   We had requested to see reports from 
Management and I, for one, was not provided with one at 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 220 of 232 
 
that stage, the word we got was that the work is still 
continuing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, so just so that I have it clear, 
sorry Mr Mothibe, I am struggling a little bit to hear you.  
You requested it and Management said the work is not 
completed yet, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when I take you to the draft report 
that was sent to the SAA Board in December of 2015, I’ll 
take you there now, I’d like you to confirm for me whether 
10 
you’ve ever seen this before – well maybe yesterday when 
you received it, let’s go in page DD19D which is the 
second file Chair to page 551. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Maybe Chair, whilst we are there just 
maybe a reminder to the Chair and the Commission in that 
the 
work 
performed 
on 
Procurement 
and 
Contract 
Management, if you recall Chair, Ms Hofmeyr wanted to 
know if, for the three years I’ve been there we had not 
identified the Swiss Port contract, I think it’s important to 
remind the Chair and the Commission that for the first two 
20 
years that work was, in fact, not even performed in the 
PwC but it was performed by …[indistinct] auditors so we 
would have had performed cross reviews on the work that 
they had performed and getting comfort that the work was 
in terms of our auditor …[indistinct] strategy and that the 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 221 of 232 
 
result thereof were appropriate Chair.  So, if one has to be 
technically correct it was only in 2016 that one from PwC 
actually did the full scope review of the Procurement and 
Contract Management. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe I understand that distinction, 
the Ernst & Young review, though, was done in the year 
that PwC was conducting the work, correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and notwithstanding what you said 
in emphasising that it was Nkonki responsible for this in 
10 
2014 and 2015, I read your supplementary statement you 
say, you don’t use that to suggest you aren’t, as the joint 
audit partner responsible? 
MR 
MOTHIBE: 
 
That’s 
important 
to 
note, 
that 
is…[intervenes].  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry there was a negative in my 
question, so I know it was a bit difficult to answer, let me 
ask it with a positive.  Do you accept as the joint audit 
partner of Nkonki responsibility for the outcome of the 
audited opinion notwithstanding the fact that Nkonki did 
20 
some of the work and you did other? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I do understand that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, okay let’s look at the report that 
Ernst & Young did provide to SAA.  I said you’d find it at 
DD19D at page 551, do you have that? 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 222 of 232 
 
MR MOTHIBE:   I’ve got it now Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There’s a covering letter which is 
addressed to Mr N Linell, do you know who that is? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I don’t recall that name, I’m sorry Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair that is Mr Nick Linell and the 
Commission 
will, 
in 
due 
course, 
be 
receiving 
more 
evidence in relation to Mr Linell there’s nothing currently 
before it but…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I have come across the name. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have actually and from other 
10 
evidence, indeed.  Although so far I don’t think SAA 
related, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja no I think it was related to another 
entity. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Mr Mothibe this is the draft 
admittedly report that went to the SAA on the 10 t h of 
December 2015, and I asked you to confirm for us whether 
you saw this at the time? 
20 
MR MOTHIBE:   I did not see any written ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And your evidence was you asked 
management for the outcome of Ernst & Young report, 
review, but you weren’t given anything, is that right? 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct ma’am. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 223 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is unfortunate that management saw 
fit not to give it to you because they did actually consider 
the Swiss Port contract, and you will find that at page 597. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number again? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   597 Chair, 597. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see the facts I detailed to you 
earlier about the situation with the Swiss Port contract 
Ernst & Young managed to uncover.  They came in for five 
months, they vetted procurement and contract management 
10 
and what they were able to establish in that five month 
period is reflected on this page.   
 
You will see this is a table and on the left hand side 
it is indicated the section of the report that deals with this 
contract, the contract is identified as Swiss Port and then 
you will see key issues identified.  Swiss Port’s contract is 
a month to month basis.  SAA is failing to realise the cost 
savings as a result of delays in entering into a contract 
with Swiss Port.  The delays will result in SAA overpaying 
for the ground handling services. 
20 
 
Then on quantification of loss they say SAA has 
failed to realise cost savings of R92 936 578 over the 
period of the five years as a result of delays in entering 
into 
the 
contract, 
and 
then 
they 
have 
a 
key, 
they 
recommend that there needs to be a contract entered into 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 224 of 232 
 
with Swiss Port and then in the key they identify control 
weaknesses as the concern planned. 
 
These are the sorts of things that the auditors 
auditing SAA would be looking at, wouldn’t it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair it have seemed that the contract 
would have been identified for follow up, these are the 
items that would have been picked up. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This is exactly, you’re looking at what’s 
the cause, control weaknesses, what’s the potential loss, 
correct? 
10 
MR MOTHIBE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then in the second section of that 
table you will see under key issues identified they say 
delays entering into a contract, there is no contract in 
place between SAA and Swiss Port and Swiss Port 
currently operates on a month to month basis.  They say 
here delays in entering into a contract, this is below: 
“Procurement was concluded in 2013 ...” 
Chair, just to make a note, the evidence before the 
Commission is it is 2012, that might just be a typo, 
20 
reflecting 2013, however the award has not been made to 
Swiss Port, therefore SAA is unable to realise the cost 
savings negotiated with Swiss Port and in the key over at 
the last column it says this is a matter of concern, which is 
actually a higher standard as I read this review than just a 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 225 of 232 
 
control weakness.    
 
Have you had any time to read the review, or do you 
accept when I say that matters of concern are more 
concerning items than control weaknesses? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I saw this report, the previous 
auditors referred to us, it was yesterday, and in terms of 
the key that is here that is how they identified it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, thank you, thank you.  So I 
understand you didn’t see this at the time, but you accept 
that Ernst & Young was able to identify this contract when 
10 
it came into their procurement and contract management 
processes and it had identified these weaknesses in this 
contract, do you accept that. 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair if I recall in the scope Chair we are 
required to select three quarters of outstanding, three by 
management and I think there were other criteria set so 
obviously I cannot comment on how they selected the 
contract but the outcomes of the review is here in the 
report Chair. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Did 
you 
just 
accept 
it 
when 
20 
management, when you asked for a document like this 
report from Ernst & Young did you generally just accept it 
when management said it was not available to show you? 
MR MOTHIBE:   No, no, Chair they did not say it was not 
available, they said the work is still continuing Chair.   It is 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 226 of 232 
 
that comment that came from management and we were 
aware that Ernst & Young were still on site performing the 
work.   They had not finalised Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Would it not have been relevant to follow 
that up with well have they made any preliminary reports to 
you? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair from the inquiries that we made at 
that stage it did not appear that there was anything 
available for us to look at initially Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see the media had already been 
10 
reporting about this Ernst & Young review towards the end 
of 2015.   Chair I see we are close to five, it may be that I 
can just complete this point about the media and then we 
can adjourn, is that convenient? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, yes that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, so despite management of SAA 
not giving you the report it seems the press got hold of the 
report, were you aware of that at the time? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair on the video reports that we had 
seen on SAA that report was not identified. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well let us see what did make its way to 
the media, you will find that in DD19D, that is the second 
file at page 423, 423. 
CHAIRPERSON:   423? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes sir. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 227 of 232 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So your audit procedure that required 
you to pick up media articles related to SAA did not pick up 
this article, is that correct? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair you know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to confirm this is a Business Day 
article dated ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR   It is 9 December 2015 Chair, it is sort of 
10 
the fourth line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.   
MS HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.   My question Mr 
Mothibe was your audit procedures that required you to 
pick up media articles about SAA did not identify this 
article at the time, the day. 
MR MOTHIBE:   This article is not included in the ones that 
we had looked at Chair, or that were identified. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I want to suggest to you that it was quite 
a key article for your processes to have picked up, 
20 
because what it records here is, and I am reading from the 
first sentence: 
“The Board of South African Airways says it is 
getting closer to unravelling the reasons for large 
losses at the airline with an Ernst & Young forensic 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 228 of 232 
 
report showing that as much as 60% of procurement 
could be subject to weak business controls.” 
Chair there is those ampersands in this rendition of the 
report, I don’t understand them to be there in the actual 
text, it is when it gets printed some years after, so for the 
purposes of reading I am just going to leave those out. 
 
So the media seems to have known in December of 
2015 that the forensic report was showing as much as 60% 
of procurement could be subject to weak business controls, 
do you see that?  ---  I can see it on the page Chair. 
10 
 
And it also is quite specific, if you read this article 
it certainly appears to me and you will correct me if you 
take a different view, that the writer, Ms Carol Payton, has 
seen the report, because she talks about what it contains.  
Did you also form that impression about this article when 
you read it yesterday, I assume, or previously, no this was 
actually many months ago. 
MR MOTHIBE:   It does appear that the writer has got 
access to information that we did not have access to. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, yes, because the writer is able to 
20 
say in the third paragraph, the report shows that 28 of the 
48 contracts, which are the contracts that Ernst & Young 
audited, that is 60%, are improperly negotiated, poorly 
contracted or weakly managed, do you see that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   I read that Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 229 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It would have been useful, would it not 
Mr Mothibe if this had come to our attention at the time 
that you were asking the SAA Board for copies of any 
reports by Ernst & Young, wouldn’t it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair if it had come to my attention yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What do you think you would have done 
when the SAA Board said it is still in process, would you 
have called for it if a member of the media had already 
seen it? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair if this information was in the public 
10 
domain it would have suggested that there is something 
available to be shared by SAA Management. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did other articles of this importance to 
what you were doing at SAA get missed in your processes? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair that is a difficult question to answer, 
we identified a number of media articles relating to SAA 
which have been included I think Ms Hofmeyr referred to it 
earlier in the meeting or in the session Chair, so Chair 
there is a big leverage of articles out there, we identified 
those that we identified and considered what impact they 
20 
would have had on our audit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Mothibe I should be very clear about 
the document I took you to earlier.  When we went through 
the working papers that have been made available to the 
Commission we were particularly looking for the media 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 230 of 232 
 
articles that the processes had identified over the years 
and that set of pages I took you to earlier were the media 
articles that we could find in the working papers but they 
were related to the prior year.  When we looked for the 
media articles that your team conducting the 2016 audit 
had put together, we didn’t find that anywhere in the 
working papers.  Can you enlighten us on that? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair I would have to go look at my file 
again and bring a response on that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it is actually not evidence before this 
10 
Commission whether this article did or did not form part of 
those that had been identified by your team because we 
actually could not find any articles identified by your team 
for the 2016 audit.  Can you help us today as a matter of 
fact did they review media articles? 
MR MOTHIBE:   Chair as I said earlier in my evidence that 
it is not a requirement of standards but we do ask and look 
at the media articles that would assist us in doing this 
assessment Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do ask or you have a procedure that 
20 
is designed to pull them from the media each month? 
MR MOTHIBE:   The procedure is we ask of our team to 
pull that out Chair but it is not, there is not a clear process 
there that they are just trolling and pulling every single 
article Chair. 
16 JULY 2020 – DAY 233 
 
Page 231 of 232 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well maybe by tomorrow Mr Mothibe if 
you have an opportunity you can just clarify this point for 
us whether there were any media articles sourced by your 
team for the 2016 audit. 
 
Chair I have completed this aspect of the media 
reporting on the Ernst & Young contract so I suggest it 
might be a convenient time to adjourn, and then just to 
have an indication from you of when you would like us to 
start tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did tell me that with tomorrow’s 
10 
witness you thought  you might need one a half hours to 
two hours. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With Mr Mothibe how much time do you 
think you are still going to be busy with him? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We actually have moved progressively 
swifter over the course of the day and so I think probably 
no more than two hours with Mr Mothibe, if not less than 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay well in that event maybe 
20 
we should – let us start at normal time, let us start at ten 
o’clock. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow we will resume at ten o’clock.
