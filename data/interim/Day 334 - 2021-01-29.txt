PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 29 JANUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius.  Good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  They like giving me your opening 
address. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [microphone muted] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] I do not need it.  These are for 
Monday.  Okay.  Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I am Chair.  Ms K, can you 
10 
hear us.  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning, Ms K. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good morning, Ms K. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The oath that you took the other day 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The took that you took the other day 
continues to apply, okay. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.

MS K:   (s.u.o.) 
EXAMINATION BY ADV PRETORIUS SC (CONTINUES):   Ms 
K, when we adjourned yesterday, we were dealing with the 
Project Wave and we were at paragraph 6.5.7 of your 
statement.   
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 4 of 155 
 
MS K:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You confirmed your knowledge of 
the second – the contents of the second sentence in 
paragraph 6.5.7 to the effect that Frank had explained in 
his interview with the Investigation Team that the initial 
plan, Project Wave, holds not resembles to the activities 
later carried out under Project Wave which related to the 
media.  Do you confirm that? 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, I do.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then the next sentence reads: 
10 
“While the spending of funds started soon after 
the establishment of the project, it was only a 
year later that a group of co-workers were 
recruited and trained. 
Frank contents that this recruitment was ad-hoc 
and admitted that he included his daughter in 
response to Ambassador Mahlobo’s invitation to 
“bring people”.” 
 
Are you able to confirm that information as having 
been given to the investigation? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I am able to confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It appears ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Just so that 
people who are listening will understand.  Would it be 
accurate if we say whenever in relation to Ms K’s evidence 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 5 of 155 
 
and Mr Y’s affidavit, reference is made to a name without 
surname.  Everyone must understand that is a secret 
name. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  It has been our practise thus 
far Chair to state explicitly when a name is given and I will 
continue this practise.  I did not in this case but we did 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  When it comes up for the 
first time, you mean that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but I will do it anytime.  No 
10 
problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine.  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms K in relation to the second 
sentence in that paragraph.  Does that mean – and I am 
just asking you to clarify what is said there – that the 
documents which would have established the project and 
the 
motivation 
for 
the 
release 
of 
funds 
would 
not 
accurately would have reflected what was ultimately done 
under the rubric of Project Wave? 
MS K:   Could you please repeat the question sir? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The initial plan referred to in the 
second sentence. 
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You said here to have borne no 
resembles to the activities later carried out under Project 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 6 of 155 
 
Wave which related to the media.  In other words, the 
original 
plan 
which 
would 
have 
been 
included 
in 
documentation motivating the establishment of the project 
and motivating the release of funds for the project bore no 
resembles to what was actually conducted under the rubric 
of the project.  Is that what that sentence means? 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, that is what it means. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Paragraph 6.5.8 reads: 
“A progress report dated 26 November 2016 
provides further insight into other operational 
10 
activities of Project Wave.” 
 
That progress report is any documentation but 
there is a quote here from that document: 
“Under achievements:  It is reported that Project 
Wave has been able to confirm many of the 
allegations 
levelled 
against 
the 
involved 
of 
foreign intelligence agencies in the planned 
destabilization of the democratic rule in South 
Africa.” 
 
We have heard that evidence from another source 
20 
but that will be dealt with later Chair in evidence before 
you from the former President.  But it has also been 
confirmed and I am continuing the quote: 
“Through the said investigation, the involvement 
of senior cabinet members and various senior 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 7 of 155 
 
leaders in the ruling African National Congress 
who are colluding in a conspiracy to effect 
regime change in South Africa.” 
 
Now it is very clear what that says.  Is that 
contained in the report received by the Investigation Team? 
MS K:   This is not a report that was received by the 
Investigation Team.  The report was among documents that 
was found by the Investigation Team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is a ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   So I just need to...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, perhaps received – a report in 
the possession of the Investigation Team. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   That sounds better. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was that found in the safe that you 
spoke of earlier? 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Now the implication, of 
course, of that statement, and correct me if I am wrong, is 
20 
the intelligence agencies of the SASS, was dealing with 
senior cabinet members and various senior leaders in the 
ruling African National Congress on the basis that they 
were colluding and in a conspiracy to effect regime change 
in South Africa.   
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 8 of 155 
 
 
Does that imply that the object of the project, at 
least there, would have been to protect the existing regime 
against change? 
MS K:   I confirm that.  Yes, I could – one could actually 
draw that conclusion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I think it is fairly obvious but 
thank you for that.  Under challenges it is reported inter-
alia that – and again I quote: 
“One area of interests (media house) has proved 
to be one of the most difficult to penetrate for 
10 
two reasons. 
Either the renumeration demands were higher 
than what the operatives could offer or the 
targeted media house was equal on a security 
alert. 
Hence immune to approach or to be recruited.” 
 
Again to clarify.  Is that in the report that was 
discovered by the Investigation Team? 
MS K:   I cannot really recall but it is referred to here.  So is 
it okay if I just take some time to open that annexure? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, of course.   
MS K:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is Annexure W9 and it is at page 
656. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 9 of 155 
 
MS K:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of annexure - of Bundle SSA-1. 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if you would go to page 658 
after looking at the cover page, you will see in paragraph 
4.2. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sub-paragraph A. 
MS K:   Yes, I found it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Have you found it? 
10 
MS K:   Yes, I have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in sub-paragraph B what is 
quoted in the statement of Mr Y appears in the report, the 
written report at paragraph 4.2(a) and (b).  Do you see 
that? 
MS K:   Yes, I see that.  I can confirm that that is what is 
reflected in the report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  One of the observations one 
can make from that extract from the report is that possible 
sources within the media were in some cases at least too 
20 
expensive for the operatives that were recruited.  And the 
other is that media houses or certain media houses refused 
to 
cooperative. 
 
Is 
that 
how 
you 
understand 
those 
allegations or those statements? 
MS K:   Yes, that is what I – my interpretation is as well. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 10 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Paragraph 6.5.9 reads: 
“R24 million was allocated to Project Wave in the 
2015/2016 Financial Year and the same amount 
again in the 2016/2017 Financial Year. 
One of the largest payments under Project Wave 
was for the amount of R24 million in respect of 
an invoice raised by Apricot purportedly for 
services rendered.” 
 
That has been rendered unnecessary by the earlier 
evidence.  Consider the evidence of the acting Director-
10 
General 
who 
determined 
that 
that 
name 
could 
be 
declassified.   
 
And we know that it is the African News Agency 
and they have already issued a public statement in regard 
to that which is an interesting public statement which will 
be referred to later in evidence Chair.   
 
So that evidence has been responded by the 
African News Agency.  Are you aware of that Ms K. 
MS K:   Yes, I am aware Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And those records are also 
20 
contained in the SSA bundle.  They include two invoices for 
R 10 million, each raised by Apricot or African News 
Agencies 
and 
proof 
of 
payment 
via 
EFT 
on 
25 January 2017. 
MS K:   Yes. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 11 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Are you able to confirm the 
invoices 
and 
the 
payment 
as 
having 
coming 
to 
the 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes, I can – I can confirm.  I do not know if I am 
allowed to point out some aspects of the invoice or I should 
just reserve that for my own ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...look at the invoice because they 
referred to here and annexed.  So if you have any comment 
to make on the invoice which is part of Mr Y’s statement as 
10 
an annexure, you are free to comment on that. 
MS K:   Okay.  My comment would be that there are two 
separate invoices of R10 million each.  And they are dated 
March 2016 and during 2016, respectively but the invoices 
were actually for the attention of Mr Thulani Dlomo but the 
invoices are actually only paid in January 2017.  So what I 
know Chair is the signature.  I am not know if I am 
supposed to mention whose signature it is? 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
If 
it 
is 
the 
signature 
of 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS K:   It says authorised payment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, if it is a signature of an 
operative, please do not mention it.  If it is a signature of 
an official, you may mention it because it is before the 
Chair. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 12 of 155 
 
MS K:   No, it is not an operative.  It is a signature of Mr 
Arthur Fraser. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MS K:   So on the invoices.  It says give authorised payment 
dated 19/01/2017 and that was then accompanied by a TA 
that is taken off in parcels AMA which is also approved by Mr 
Fraser.  It is on page 624.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   624.  Yes.  The documentation you 
are referring to is at page 621 and following. 
MS K:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  That evidence has largely 
been given but thank you for confirming those details. 
MS K:   Pleasure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph...  I am sorry if there is 
anything you wish to add? 
MS K:   Nothing Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  Paragraph 6.6.0 reads: 
“Based on the temporary advances, TA has 
located during our investigations, the total of 
R48 million was paid under Project Wave which 
20 
includes this R20 million payment to Africa or 
African News Agency. 
It should be noted that numerous payments and 
documents are missing from the financial records 
available.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 13 of 155 
 
 
Are you aware of that last statement that you were 
not able to obtain full documentation and the full financial 
records of Project Wave? 
MS K:   I would partially agree with that statement but there 
is further information that was attached to some of these 
TA’s which actually gave a list of the individuals employed by 
AMA that were paid by us.  So that is has been submitted I 
think to the Commission. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  That, I am not sure 
whether 
in 
respect 
of 
that 
information 
it 
has 
been 
10 
declassified for our purposes. 
MS K:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we would not have issued 
notices, at least to my knowledge.  So we cannot go there 
for the moment but we may put that information in your 
supplementary statement if we may. 
MS K:   We do not necessarily have to but I think it is a point 
that needed to be made that it does show where the money 
ended up, you know, paid rendered renumeration because 
when you were reading the extract on page – on paragraph 
20 
6.5.8 where we said operatives could offer – that last part 
where you said: 
“...the renumeration demands were higher than 
what the operatives could offer or the targeted 
media house was equal on a security alert.  
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 14 of 155 
 
Hence 
the 
media 
approach 
ought 
to 
be 
recruited.” 
 
For me, if we ended up having a list of people that 
are there in terms of their salaries and their names, it 
would mean then that I would infer that means we were 
trying to make sure it is affordable or we can match 
whatever the demands were.   
 
That is just my conclusion.  It is not necessarily 
facts. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  I understand what you are 
10 
saying to be that even though the demands made by 
personnel and the media might have been high, you know 
that attempts were made, successfully in some cases to 
meet those demands.  Is that what you are saying? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is fair to point to one document 
that 
does 
not 
mention 
any 
names 
or 
implicate 
any 
individual either generically or individually but there is 
20 
evidence in the bundle that individuals within the media 
received money as part of Project Wave. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That evidence in its detail I would 
prefer to consider and place before the Chair at a later 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 15 of 155 
 
stage once we considered its import and what we need to 
do to follow the rules.  If that is in order Chair?  We have a 
number of positions that received monies in the media but 
we just have to consider whether giving that money would 
identify the person.  And if it identifies the person, we need 
to issue notices.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you for that input Ms K.  It 
seems that despite the volume of evidence given by you 
and other witnesses, the Commission at least and it 
10 
appears that the Investigation Team at least has not yet 
established the full scope and detail of the CDSO Project 
in the period under review.  Would that be a fair comment? 
MS K:   Yes, I agree that would be a fair comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So for example.  The investigators 
have information of at least nine other projects.  And I say 
at least nine other projects, Project Speed, Project Beetle, 
Project 
Amex, 
Project 
Armani, 
Project 
Fruit, 
Project 
Denaido(?), Project Iso Toxil(?), Project Worcester(?), 
Project 
Skyline. 
[00:21:15] 
 
Of 
which 
we 
have 
no 
20 
information at present.  Do you know of the existence of 
other projects in respect of which we do not have 
information? 
MS K:   That is a list of projects that we ourselves had been 
trying to actually confirm whether their existence and many 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 16 of 155 
 
documentation that proves that those projects existed and 
what the project establishment documents would be, saying 
outlining, you know, the objectives of those projects.   
 
We have not through the information management 
systems of SSA and could not trace those.  The only place 
where these projects appear is in one of the implicated 
individuals TA’s and even in the cash journal, that is all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So there appears to be 
monies paid out, including monies in the form of cash, in 
respect 
of 
these 
projects 
but 
you 
have 
no 
further 
10 
information?  Is that what I understand the position to be? 
MS K:   Yes, but I have to point out that those projects seem 
or can only be linked to the year from 2017 onwards.  So it is 
not projects where – we did not see any – find any TA’s, yes.  
In as far as I remember that pertaining to these projects 
predating the period of CDSO’s existence.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Well, we now get to 
another category of projects and that is operations within 
the office of the Director-General.  If we can move to that 
section, please? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 7.1 reads: 
“In August 2013, Ambassador Sonto Kudjoe was 
appointed as the new DG for SSA following the 
National Election in May 2014. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 17 of 155 
 
Mr David Mahlobo was appointed as the Minister 
of State Security.” 
 
There can be no dispute about those facts.  I will 
follow on.   
“In the period that followed, the office of the DG 
became involved in covert operations purported 
to be the President’s Project allegedly pursuant 
to a directive from Minister Mahlobo.” 
 
Can you confirm that? 
MS K:   Yes, that information we have. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The paragraph continues.  
This is reflected in the notable increase in operational 
expenditure in the office of the DG which was mainly 
attributed to these covert projects.  Are you able to confirm 
that? 
MS K:   Yes, I can.  It is based on official budget information, 
budget and expenditure information from the SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and we will come back to that 
topic in a moment.  Paragraph 7.2 reads: 
“During his ten years as the Minister of State 
20 
Security, Mr Mahlobo became directly involved in 
operational matters. 
He instructed and approved the utilisation of 
retained earnings to fund the CDSO Projects 
including project he was personally involved in. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 18 of 155 
 
His involvement even extended to the handling 
of cash used in these operations with deliveries 
of 
large 
cash 
amounts 
in 
the 
region 
of 
R 4.5 million per month being made by various 
CDSO officials to the minister ’s office and/or 
residence.” 
 
Did you receive evidence in that regard in the 
investigation? 
MS K:   Yes, I think that has already been covered earlier 
on, in Mr Y’s statement. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   But I think what I need to comment on here is to 
make things clear is that it means that as we had gone 
through the over, I do not know, expenditure in overspending 
of CDSO in that period that was overlayed, it happened at 
the same time as expenditure on covert ops in the DG’s 
office.  So that is why the impact in terms of the financing 
should be seen in that vein.  You know, in terms of that 
context. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  Paragraph 7.3 reads: 
20 
“pseudonym Helen who was appointed as the 
Office Manager in the DG’s office..” 
 
And I am going to exclude the date: 
“...withdrew temporary advances for operational 
expenses related to these President’s projects.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 19 of 155 
 
 
And I am not going to talk anymore about the 
position later held by Helen or what her office was but 
there is evidence that was received by you and was that 
evidence received from Helen, pseudonym Helen?  
MS K:   With the information and the evidence was received 
from our Internal Security Division because these are 
documents that were seized.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us continue in 
paragraph 7.4: 
“Mr Fraser formally closed down the CDSO 
10 
shortly after assuming office. 
However, SSA financial systems, documents and 
witness accounts indicate that the office of the 
DG continued to run many of the operations and 
projects which had been found to be irregular.” 
 
Is that a correct reflection of the position and what 
information became available to the investigation? 
MS K:   It is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph, that is paragraph 
7.4 continues ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS K:   [sneezing]  Excuse me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bless you.   
“...by way of example a temporary advance for 
R2 million was requested by Helen under Project 
Mayibuye and approved by Mr Fraser as latest 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 20 of 155 
 
September 2017.” 
 
That document is also contained in the records.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the record, it appears at page 
549 of SSA-1.  If you need to go there, we can.  But do you 
know of that fact or alleged fact? 
MS K:   I can. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You know that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do know that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.   
10 
“Helen 
pseudonym 
TA’s 
record 
reflect 
that 
approximately R 242 million was taken or paid by 
her in the period from February 2014 to March 
2018 allegedly for operations that were run from 
the office of the DG.  The electronic TA records 
reflecting the aforementioned withdrawals are 
contained in a schedule and filed in two of the 
SSA bundle and is marked Annexure RH-1.” 
 
That is at page 859 of the SSA Bundle. 
MS K:   Okay. 
20 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 If 
you 
need 
to 
go 
there.  
Otherwise, do you confirm that those records and that 
session there set out? 
MS K:   Yes, I do confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would these withdrawals have 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 21 of 155 
 
been cash withdrawals? 
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would these withdrawals or 
payments have been cash withdrawals? 
MS K:    Yes, they were cash withdrawals. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   R242 million cash? 
MS K:   Not at the same time, over a period. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes alright, but – I will not 
comment.  Paragraph 7.5 reads: 
“It is also significant that no attempt was made to 
10 
investigate and charge Ambassador Dlomo for the 
irregular and unlawful operations undertaken by the 
CDSO under his leadership.” 
Do you confirm that? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that.  There is no record, if 
there was, there is no record that we could get our hands 
on. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The paragraph continues: 
““Moreover, our preliminary investigations indicate 
that the operations run from the office of the DG 
20 
extended well beyond merely the continuation of 
some CDSO projects.  As DG Mr Fraser brought 
back 
into 
the 
SSA 
individuals 
who 
had 
been 
implicated in the PAN investigation...” 
That is the investigation of the earlier period that we have 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 22 of 155 
 
referred to. 
“...including...” 
Pseudonyms 
“Pelane and Garth.  Some of these individuals 
proceeded to play key roles in the new operational 
activities run out of the DG’s office under Mr 
Fraser ’s management.”   
Do you have any comment in regard to those allegations in 
paragraph 7.5? 
MS K:   I just want to confirm that paragraph as correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, thank you.  Then we go to 
paragraph 7.6 which reads: 
“The expansion of operational activities run from 
the office of the DG is reflected in the budgetary 
allocations.  During Mr Fraser ’s tenure the budget 
for 
the 
office 
of 
the 
DG 
increased 
from 
approximately 
R42 
million 
in 
the 
2016/2017 
financial year to approximately R303 million in the 
2017/2018 financial year.” 
Are you able to confirm that from documentation received? 
20 
MS K:   I would like to confirm with the proviso that there 
is an amendment because it is not the budget that 
increased from 42 million, it is the expenditure, it is the 
operational expenditure that increased from 42 million to 
303 million. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 23 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Subject to that 
clarification and correction the information I take it you 
confirm is correct? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you will just bear with me a 
moment please?  Chair, if you would just bear with me for 
a moment, I need to follow something up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ms K, you say that it is 
the 
expenditure 
that 
grew 
from 
R42 
million 
in 
the 
2016/2017 financial year to approximately R303 million in 
10 
the 2017/2018 financial year.  So your only correction is 
that it is not the budget, it is the expenditure but in terms 
of figures and the years, everything that is there, you 
agree with it. 
MS K:   Yes, I do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues, it reads: 
“It is striking that roughly 74% amounting to R225 
million 
of 
the 
total 
expenditure 
in 
the 
2017 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MS K:   Excuse me, Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I am, sorry. 
MS K:   Excuse me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes?  Yes, Ms K? 
MS K:   For a moment there was a technical glitch so I 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 24 of 155 
 
think …[intervenes]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not hear the whole question? 
MS K:   I am not sure what happened in between, so I 
could not – yes, I could not hear anything but now we are 
back. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we were silent for a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, not that is fine.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
““It is striking that roughly 74% amounting to R225 
million of the total expenditure in the 2017/2018 
10 
financial year was used for covert operational 
expenditure 
while 
15% 
was 
spent 
on 
contract 
expenditure and the remaining 5% on travel and 
subsistence.” 
Are you able to confirm that? 
MS K:   Yes.  There is also a typo.  The contract there, it is 
supposed to say contract, contact expenditure.  But 
otherwise I agree with the sentence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that is a typographical error, 
contract expenditure, it is contacts expenditure, is that 
20 
correct?. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, thank you for that, yes. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I am sorry, I thought she was 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 25 of 155 
 
saying the opposite.  Let me have a look.  Is that 7.6?  
What paragraph? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 7.6. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Third sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Third sentence? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Third sentence, yes.  The word – 
am I correct in understanding – well, perhaps you should 
say what correction should be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just state, Ms K, what that word 
10 
should read. 
MS K:   It should say contact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS K:   Contact expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is that something you can explain 
without 
any 
harm 
to 
State 
Security Agency, 
contact 
expenditure or explaining it might not be appropriate? 
MS K:   Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are not sure, you must just 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MS K:   Chair, it is just – okay, may I continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am saying if you are not sure 
explaining it would be appropriate or not then do not 
explain it but if you are sure that there is no problem then 
you 
could 
explain 
to 
me 
what 
it 
means, 
contact 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 26 of 155 
 
expenditure. 
MS K:   Let me not explain it because it is not actually 
anything that is complicated or top secret but because it 
comes from the ODs which we said yesterday have not 
been declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS K:   Maybe it would be best that I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but it is meant to be contact 
expenditure and not contract expenditure. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
“This concentration of SSA funds in the office of the 
DG during the 2017/2018 financial year came at the 
expense of legitimate operational structures and 
SSA provincial offices in particular.” 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   Yes, it is, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 7.7 reads: 
“The documents relating to these projects run out of 
20 
the office of the DG were not put onto the SSA 
document management system, EMS.  Similarly, the 
purported intelligence products were not channelled 
into 
intelligence 
management 
which 
is 
the 
repository of all information of the SSA.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 27 of 155 
 
Are those correct statements? 
MS K:   Yes, they are correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, was that information referred 
to there accessible to the investigation team, the Veza 
investigation team? 
MS K:   I did not quite understand the question? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The documents relating to the 
projects run out of the office of the DG, were those 
available to your investigation or were they otherwise 
accessible to your investigation? 
10 
MS K:   These are the same products we were talking – 
when you listed the number of projects that we have 
limited information on, so this is referring to that.  So I 
already explained that we could not trace those, so we do 
not 
have 
any 
information 
on 
whether 
– 
either 
the 
establishment of those projects or an operational plan or 
maybe some kind of a report or product that came from 
those nine to ten projects. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  
MS K:   So I think it should be seen together, them 
20 
together, in these statements. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The last sentence …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Pretorius. Ms K, I do not know 
if I missed this when you gave evidence earlier but 
because of your correction of the second sentence of Mr 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 28 of 155 
 
Y’s paragraph 7.6 it looks like there ought to be – you 
should be wanting a correction also in regard to the first 
sentence.  It says: 
“The expansion of operational activities run from 
the office of the DG is reflected in the budgetary 
allocations.” 
You have made the point that it is not the budget that grew 
from R42 million to 303 million, it is the expenses 
…[intervenes] 
MS K:   Sorry, Chair, you are …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot hear me? 
MS K:   Chair is – ja, inaudible, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I think I am looking down.  
So I am saying you said that Mr Y’s second sentence of 
paragraph 7.6 is incorrect insofar as it says it was the 
budget for the office of the DG that increased from 
approximately R42 million in the 2016/2017 financial year 
to approximately R303 million in the 2017/2018 financial 
year.  Do you remember saying that?   
MS K:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said it was the expenditure that 
grew. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the budget. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 29 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the sentence that precedes that 
sentence says: 
“The expansion of operational activities run from 
the office of the DG is reflected in the budgetary 
allocation.” 
I am saying I wonder whether you would not want to correct 
that as well because it seems that it might not be – it might 
be inconsistent with your evidence, that is the expenditure 
that grew from that amount to that amount, but I may be 
misunderstanding something in your evidence. 
10 
MS K:   Thank you for bringing that to my attention, Chair.  
I 
would 
not 
replace 
the 
word 
budget 
there 
with 
expenditure, I would rather say budget and expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the second sentence? 
MS K:   Yes, where the Chair was reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, the first sentence does not 
have the word budget but it has budgetary allocations. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
second 
sentence 
which 
you 
corrected earlier on has got budget. 
20 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand it, what Mr Y was saying 
is when you look at the operational activities run from the 
office of the DG, you could see an expansion and that 
expansion was reflected in the budgetary allocations.  That 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 30 of 155 
 
suggests that he is saying if you went to the budget you 
would find that larger amounts were allocated for various 
operations.  In the next sentence he then says: 
“The budget for the office of the DG increased from 
approximately 
R42 
million 
in 
the 
2016/2017 
financial year to approximately R303 million in the 
2017/2018 financial year.” 
The two sentences seem to me to be connected, so I was 
wondering whether you were alive to that or not. 
MS K:   I understand what the Chair is saying.  So the 
10 
amendment that I would make in the first – I agree with the 
first sentence but would need to expand, after budgetary 
allocations, would need to say “and expenditure.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think then just to …[intervenes] 
MS K:   So the budget – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just hang on, I think just to 
absolutely sure that you know what you mean, I think you 
need to say what – how the first sentence should read, as 
far as you are concerned, and the how the second 
sentence should read and then we are done with that point. 
20 
MS K:   Okay, Chair. 
 
“The expansion of operational activities run 
from the office of the DG is reflected in the 
budgetary allocations and expenditure.  During Mr 
Fraser ’s tenure the budget for the office of the DG 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 31 of 155 
 
increased from approximately R42…” 
I mean… 
“…the 
expenditure 
for 
the 
office 
of 
the 
DG 
increased from approximately R42 million in the 
2016/2017 financial year to approximately R303 
million in the 2017/2018 financial year.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Thank you, Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph 
continues, Ms K, in the last sentence to read: 
10 
“This concentration of SSA funds in the office of the 
DG during 2017/2018 financial year came at the 
expense of legitimate operational structures and 
SSA provincial offices in particular.” 
Are you able to confirm that observation? 
MS K:   Yes, the information that we have is that during 
that time the budgets for the provinces were cut by 50% 
and that is where we have to have the boots on the ground 
and that is where we are actually most operational.  So – 
but that was cut and that is why we made this statement.  
20 
Mr Y and the team, made this statement, drew this 
conclusion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Paragraph 7.7 reads: 
“The documents relating to these projects run out of 
the office of the DG were not put onto the SSA 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 32 of 155 
 
document management system.” 
We have dealt with that, is there anything in that sentence 
that you need to deal with further? 
MS K:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
“It is a gross dereliction of duty…” 
The paragraph continues. 
“…for the DG to completely disregard the very 
policies, 
prescripts 
and 
directives 
that 
he 
is 
responsible for enforcing as the accounting officer 
10 
and head of department.” 
Do you confirm that and there is one question I have in 
relation to that statement before you confirm it and that is, 
the lodging of documents and the channelling of purported 
intelligence products as you have described or as Mr Y 
described in the first sentence and as confirmed by you, 
are those contained in the regulatory prescripts governing 
the SSA? 
MS K:   There are regulatory prescripts within the SSA but 
we are also, especially when it comes to the finances, all 
20 
of those devolve from Treasury regulations.  So it is not 
different per se so we do not necessarily have to deviate 
from what Treasury has prescribed.  
 
So I think I agree with this conclusion.  However, I 
would probably use a softer kind of wording and say – I do 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 33 of 155 
 
not want to announce – like confirm it as it is a gross and 
no authoritatively say it is gross what, what what, I would 
rather say it would appear, something like that.  I do not 
know 
whether 
it 
makes 
any 
difference 
because 
the 
challenge is, this is based on our assessment, not 
necessarily that we have got to engage with that office to 
get the explanation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So I understand you to qualify it by 
saying according to the information at your disposal, that 
is at least a preliminary conclusion that you draw. 
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then paragraph 7.8 reads: 
“In the absence of details on the operational 
activities undertaken in respect of these projects, 
the deliberate circumventing of SSA systems by the 
office of the DG suggests these projects were either 
in 
breach 
of 
the 
SSA’s 
mandate 
and/or 
the 
Constitution 
or 
were 
special 
purpose 
vehicles 
created to facilitate the looting of state coffers.” 
Do you have any comment in relation to that statement? 
20 
MS K:   Yes.  I agree with the statement based on the 
information that we have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.   
MS K:   And also – and also – ja, I think it will become 
clearer as we go along, as we progress this affidavit. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 34 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, particularly with the next 
paragraph, we will get there soon.  The last sentence 
reads: 
“There can be no justifiable reason for the office of 
the DG to run operations and especially operations 
of the deep cover type.” 
That 
statement 
pertains 
particularly 
to 
whether 
such 
operations should be run from the office of the DG or 
whether they should be run in the normal course by people 
reporting to the DG.   
10 
 
There has been evidence in respect of that from 
Acting Director General Jafta but do you 
have any 
comment on that? 
MS K:   I agree with this statement that there cannot be 
any justifiable reason for that, there are structures set up 
to do exactly that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Paragraph 7.9, which 
follows, reads – and we will deal with that now and after 
the short adjournment. 
“Notwithstanding the general lack of documentary 
20 
records during this period, some of these ongoing 
operational activities are reflected in a performance 
review dated 24 February 2017 which was submitted 
to Mr Fraser by one of the CDSO co-worker 
deployment team.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 35 of 155 
 
That is the [indistinct] 23.32 report which is dealt with both 
in the high level review panel report presented and in the 
evidence of Mr Jafta and we can go to it in a moment or 
after the short adjournment, but did the investigation team 
receive that or have access to that report? 
MS K:   No, Chair, I – we have never seen this report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You cannot obviously speak for Mr 
Y, can you?  Do you know whether her received it? 
MS K:   Yes, I cannot speak on his behalf on that one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
10 
MS K:   Maybe he does have a copy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   But…. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Because that report is 
already a matter of record, I would like to place it before 
the Chair but can we do that after the short adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  We will take the tea adjournment 
until half past.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us proceed.   If you may proceed Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Ms K the Annexure Q referred 
to in page A10.9.  
MS K:   Excuse me, sorry sir. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 36 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know what that is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is a sneeze as I understand. 
MS K:   A cough. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A cough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Annexure Q referred to in 
paragraph 7.9 is in the bundle of documents provided to 
the Commission, it has been referred to in the evidence by 
Dr Mufamadi, the contents have been referred to and it has 
been referred to in the evidence of Mr Jafta.  I understand 
10 
it did not come directly before the investigation team but 
for the sake of completeness because we wrapping up the 
evidence this week at least for the moment, I would like to 
place it on record and see if you have any comment in 
relation there to.  There are also a number of parties who 
although not implicated may be affected who would be 
concerned by the contents of the whole report there.   
MS K:   I request that I do not comment on this at all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I am just placing it on the 
record, you do not have to comment. 
20 
MS K:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At page 241 their Bundle SSA01 
there is an operational and performance review section of 
the whole performance review dated 24 February 2017.  
Now I am going to read from the right hand column, there 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 37 of 155 
 
of that. 
The first…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   …item reads: 
“Initiated three countering operations to impede the 
distribution of CR17 regalia and key transportation 
system of dissident groups from GP - that is 
Gauteng Province, and ensure the cancellation of 
the President's visit to Americana after an incorrect 
assessment threat was provided by local and SAPS 
10 
collection agents. The assessment done by the 
CDSO/CW team provided, “alternative facts”, in 
terms of the threat on the ground.  This information 
resulted in the Minister of State Security visiting the 
site and endorsing the threat assessment - done by 
CDSO - and thereby cancelling the President's visit, 
due to the risks involved.” 
The next item reads under State of Nation Address Western 
Cape February 2016: 
“The 
co-workers 
were 
able 
to 
infiltrate 
and 
20 
penetrate the leadership of the structure of the ZMF 
movement.” 
I interject Chair this evidence has been given. 
“The initial ZMF – that is the Zuma Must Fall, 
indicated that more than 5000 people would embark 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 38 of 155 
 
upon parliament, but with efficient and effective 
countering 
actions, 
and 
the 
dissemination 
of, 
“disinformation”, to supporters of ZMF that Zuma 
Must Fall, only approximately 50 ZMF supporters 
attended the March. This success was directly 
attributed to the efforts of the co-workers of CDSO.  
The collection efforts of the CDSO also provided, 
“alternative information”, regarding the Sesikhona 
movement.  The CDSO team was directly tasked by 
the Minister of State Security to activate the 
10 
Sesikhona Agents to ensure a presence within the 
City of Cape Town during the State of Nation 
Address, this was done to great success.”   
The third item relates to the ANC manifesto launched in 
Port Elizabeth, March 2016 to April 2016.  It reads: 
“Members were responsible to identify specific 
names and venues of dissident groups planning to 
disrupt 
the 
manifesto 
launch. 
 
The 
scattered 
deployment of co-workers to high risk areas and the 
internal negotiations with people of interest resulted 
20 
in dissident groups not being transported to the 
event, thereby ensuring no disruptions.  The co-
workers also initiated a media campaign to provide 
positive media feedback to the placement of views 
of various ethnic groups in photographic vision of 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 39 of 155 
 
media 
personnel, 
thereby 
promoting 
social 
cohesion.  These images became a massive social 
trend and resulted in positive reporting.” 
Then the next item is the AIDS conference in Durban, June 
to July 2016. 
“Provided information to SAPS in Durban Metro 
relating to transport issues that ensure possible 
direct 
disruptions 
were 
negated. 
 
Information 
collected by co-workers were also used to ensure 
the indication of safe parameters surrounding venue 
10 
and identification of criminal and modus operandi in 
the area.” 
Then the next issue is the occupy Luthuli House, Gauteng 
September 2016.  
“The initial reports submitted by co-workers indicate 
the exact strength and modus operandi of the 
occupy Luthuli House grouping.  The reports also 
provided the key role players of the movement and 
although these initial reports were discarded as 
incorrect on the day of the event, every report 
20 
submitted by the co-workers including the numbers 
and leaders were prepared, proven to be correct.” 
Then again, under State of Nation Address, February 2017.  
“Student movements infiltrated all Western Cape 
Universities and student activist groups on social 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 40 of 155 
 
networks.” 
Under the head, political environment little way down: 
“The 
group 
infiltrated 
and 
penetrated 
various 
political groups affiliated to active and passive 
opposition groups that threaten to disrupt the key 
events through disruptive actions.  The assessment 
of information gathered on the ground indicated that 
the populist rhetoric used by politicians were not 
evident on the ground and anticipated very limited 
disruptions on the ground.” 
10 
I am not going to go further with that. 
“Trade unions through penetration and infiltration 
operations.  The reports provided clearly indicated 
that the anticipated “Section 77”, notice to march on 
parliament during the budget speech, the “New 
Federation”, 
NUMSA 
power 
and 
other 
smaller 
affiliates will not materialise due to minimal support 
via the identification of trade unions using the 
promise of jobs if they attended the march was 
neutralised by disseminating countering information 
20 
to the affected youth.  This resulted in minimal 
support to these marches.” 
NGOs, active monitoring of the South Africa first right to 
know SaveSa, Save SA.   
“Casac and Greenpeace was done due to the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 41 of 155 
 
penetration ability of the group.  The team was 
penetrated and became activist for these NGO’s 
through these actions reporting plays on supporter 
strength, 
main 
actions, 
ideologies, 
support 
structures, and agendas.” 
That is the post report which we just needed to place on 
record, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Counsel. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
If 
we 
may 
proceed 
then 
to…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Looks like Counsel has got 
something to say.  
UNKNOWN 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
Thanks, 
Chair. 
 
Can 
we 
comfortably sit down and avoided interrupting Mr Pretorius 
because we do not want to be accused of being rude and 
being told to sit.  But there it is that this whole portion of 
the report that has been read into evidence now or interact 
with, the witness before this Commission has indicated on 
at least two occasions that she is not willing to comment 
on the report.  
20 
And well, perhaps she also indicated that she does 
not know this.  So it serves no purpose for the purpose of 
this witness, for this to be read into the record.  Now, the 
reality is that this witness is here to confirm the affidavit or 
the statement of Mr Y.  So to the extent that she is not 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 42 of 155 
 
confirming that statement, it is improper for it, then for this 
reports to be read into record, at least now. 
Perhaps there are people that will talk to this, we 
have no objection to it and if there are people that ought to 
have spoken to it, if they have not spoken to it, then they 
can be recalled there is nothing that stops them from being 
recorded.  But it is for the purpose of this witness, it is 
improper for what she is not going to confirm, to be read 
into the record, nevertheless. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius?  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, this is a Commission of 
inquiry it may receive evidence at all levels of proof.  
Perhaps my learned friend did not understand, I am not 
asking this witness to comment on the report at all.  She 
has made her position clear, I asked for leave to place it 
on the record.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The reason for placing it on record 
this week is so that interested parties can examine the 
evidence and deal with it.  The evidence has been placed 
20 
before you Chair by at least two witnesses. Dr Mufamadi, 
high level review panel and Mr Jafta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
So 
my 
learned 
friend 
perhaps…[intervene] 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 43 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I certainly remember that Mufamadi 
dealt with some of the matters that are being dealt with. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, as did Mr Jafta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the affidavit has been placed on 
the record.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not leading it through the 
witness, I am interrupting the witness's evidence to place it 
on record from the bar and from the documentation given 
10 
which is perfectly legitimate.  This Commission, as you 
gave leave to do is entitled to receive evidence of this 
nature in this form and I asked leave of you to do it before.  
So that deals with that issue Chair if we may continue.   
Paragraph 7.9.1…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius I am just confirming that he 
understands. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair, we are not taking this 
matter any further, we do not necessarily agree but we will 
not be taking it further. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you.  Yes, you may 
proceed, Mr Pretorius.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 7.9.1, then through to 
paragraph 7.9.4, deal with extracts from that report, which 
we need not deal with and we can go then to paragraph 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 44 of 155 
 
7.11, Ms K. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Before I ask you any questions, 
can you have a look at paragraph 7.11 and tell me whether 
you can comment in relation to those allegations? 
MS K:   Yes, but I want to maybe comment on is that it 
would not be peculiar or irregular for SSA, I mean the 
legitimate structures to have a presence at an ANC 
elective conference.  However, in this regard as I have 
indicated…[intervene] 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, sorry to interrupt you, Ms K.  
If you are going to comment on 7.11 then let us put it on 
record and then you can comment, if we may.  
MS K:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   7.11 reads: 
“There are indications that operational activities run 
from the office of the DG may have related to the 
ANC National Elective Conference held at Nasrec in 
December 
2017. 
Witness 
reports 
placed 
SSA 
members in the vicinity of the Nasrec Conference 
20 
including former CDSO co-workers and members of 
the newly configured Cover Support Unit and other 
operational structures.  During this period, the 
office manager in the office of the DG pseudonym 
Helen withdrew R19million from the SSA on 15 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 45 of 155 
 
December 2017, as reflected in the Annexure RH3 
in file two. This matter is the subject of ongoing 
investigation by the Project Veza team.” 
So your comment, please? 
MS K:   My comment is that I accept the paragraph and 
confirm the paragraph.  Say for, I just still want to place it 
on record that it would not be peculiar, in general to have 
SSA members at you know, because we do have special 
events and this should be an event that would be managed 
to a certain extent, by SSA in a supporting role. But what 
10 
stands out for me when we looked at this is that CDSO had 
been closed purportedly closed in 2016 or early 2017 and 
most of the members of CDSO especially the co-workers, 
and even SSA members who were working at CDSO 
actually had to go home and they remained unplaced. I 
think they are still unplaced even today.  
Yet when it was time for Nasrec, according to 
witness accounts of people that were part of this, they 
were 
called 
from 
home 
to 
partake 
in 
whatever 
this 
operation was, for them to be present at Nasrec.  That is 
20 
all I want to just add there.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Ms K.  What follows 
from…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Did you say 
Ms K, that SSA operative or maybe I should not say 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 46 of 155 
 
operative, SSA…[intervene] 
MS K:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you cannot hear me, again. 
MS K:   Yes, I cannot hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear me? 
MS K:   Yes, now it is better Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I do not know why it seems to give 
problems.  Did you say that as far as you know it would be 
legitimate for SSA people, I am saying people you might be 
able to categorise them, to be…[intervene] 
10 
MS K:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot hear me. 
MS K:   I lost you again there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the technicians must attend to 
this because we have had video links, witnesses giving 
evidence via video links and it would not happen that the 
Chairperson is the only one that the witness struggles to 
hear.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair it may be important 
because what follows are the conclusions of the general 
20 
nature in relation to which you may wish to ask questions 
to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. Let me try again, Ms K and there 
you must tell me if you cannot hear.  
MS K:   Will do Chair. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 47 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say it would be legitimate or 
there would be nothing wrong with let us say, SSA 
operatives maybe you can put another category of SSA 
people in the place of operatives, or in addition to 
operatives, to be for example at the conference of a 
political party, or to be in the vicinity of the conference of a 
political party where there are presence there is connected 
with the political conference of that political party? 
MS K:   Yes, Chair.  I am drawing that and I stand to be 
corrected, but I am drawing that from my experience where 
10 
if maybe the ANC or political party would have an event 
and they would ask the assistance of the Net Joints.  So 
not just SSA, and SSA is the co-chair of the Net Joints.  
So it is co-chaired between the Police and the SSA. 
So that event is SSA in there who in that instance would be 
represented 
by 
special 
events 
and 
they 
would 
work 
together with the other stakeholders in the JCPS cluster, to 
secure an event, each of them playing their roles.  That is 
what I am trying to say that it would not be illegitimate for 
SSA in general to be there.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there could be a legitimate role to 
play. But whether or not on a particular occasion, they 
played a legitimate role, obviously would depend on what 
they were doing and so on.  But you say, you are saying 
there could be a legitimate role for them to play. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 48 of 155 
 
MS K:   Yes, that is what I am saying, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know, from your experience 
whether something like that happens with the conferences 
of other political parties, the DA, the UDM, the EFF? 
MS K:   I do not know Chair if it happens, because I am not 
in the special events environment.  I am not placed in a 
well-placed, you know to answer that, but I am guessing 
that the Net Joint should be in support of ANC security, but 
they would not be necessarily to taking a lead and also 
because there would be dignitaries there, the cabinet 
10 
Ministers so it does justify that.  So I am not sure if, within 
DA there is a member of the executive, I do not know.  So I 
am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well within the DA there could be a 
Premier. 
MS K:   Yes, but all I am saying is I do not have any 
experience in that and I do not think I am well placed to 
respond to that question because I do not know, I do not 
have a point of reference for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine.  If you do not know, 
20 
part of the reason why I am asking is, as you know is that I 
am hearing evidence and I heard evidence to the effect 
that the CDSO all or SSA, or certain units of it were 
interfering or seemed to have had interest in factions 
within the ANC. So when you hear that when the ANC 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 49 of 155 
 
conference at Nasrec Base SSA people were in the vicinity, 
you wonder whether they were there for a legitimate reason 
and if they went there, not because it was an ANC 
conference, but simply because it was an event.   
Then the question arises, do they show the same 
interest when it is a DA conference, a UDM conference and 
EFF conference.  So you have heard about them doing this 
in relation to an ANC conference, but you have not heard 
about them doing this in regard to another political, other 
political parties, but you do not say that it did not happen 
10 
with other political parties.  You simply say, you have no 
knowledge.  Is that correct?  
MS K:   Yes, Chair that is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  In paragraph 7.11, Ms 
K the statement is made that during this period that is 
December 2017 and I presume it refers to the time the 
conference was being held.   
“The office manager in the office of the DG, Helen 
withdrew R19million from the SSA on 15 December 
20 
2017.” 
And the document is referred to there: 
“This matter is the subject of investigation by the 
Project Veza team.” 
There is documentation showing that R19million was 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 50 of 155 
 
withdrawn and I presume that was withdrawn in cash. 
MS K:   Yes, that was, it was taken in cash.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and that R19million is 
referred to again in a handwritten document contained in 
SSA01 at page 887, it is the last page in the document.  
Do go there, please. 
MS K:   Okay I will go there, yes, I am there Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On it - the handwriting on that 
document was this doc – well firstly, was this document 
placed before the investigation? 
10 
MS K:   This is one of the documents that were confiscated 
from Helen.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, by the investigation or, and 
placed before the investigation? 
MS K:   Yes, it was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The heading of the notes there is 
15/12/2017.  Underneath that, it reads: 
“Collected R19million.” 
And you say that that was collected in cash, and then 
underneath that, there is a dash it says: 
20 
“R5million Rand [Kingmaker].” 
Next line dash, what appears to be: 
 “7.9 or R1.9million [BRAJ].” 
Next line” 
“- 900 K, presumably 900,000, [BELE].” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 51 of 155 
 
And the next line: 
“R360,00 - I read [fly sofa].” 
Or words to that effect in brackets.  Do those notes relate 
to that R19million? 
MS K:   I would assume so because I just have to point out 
that this handwritten list of how the monies expended is 
not, it does not, it is not sufficient to justify and confirm 
how the money was expended.  So me just making a 
handwritten note of how I disseminated the money cannot 
in any environment, in my view, fly as sufficient. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, you say you are investigating 
the matter, I presume also on the basis of that document. 
MS K:   Chair I – we are investigating the info but it is not 
just this one received.  As we indicated earlier, we are 
investigating all of the TA’s from 2014 to 2018, which 
amounted to R224million, approximately taken by the same 
person for covert operations, while their main function 
responsibility is basically admin and admin.  So this is just 
one of the reasons. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and obviously you would 
20 
know more about the import of that document.  You have 
qualified it; it says in the bundle it was given to the 
Commission.  You have explained as much as you can but 
as said in the last sentence of paragraph 7.11 the matter is 
the subject of ongoing investigation by the Project Veza 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 52 of 155 
 
team.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Well, are we saying the matter of the ANC elective 
conference issue or the matter of the TA? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, I am saying the matters 
referred to in relation to the R19million at the time of the 
elective conference in December 2017.  Is that matter the 
subject of ongoing investigation? 
MS K:   Yes, it is Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Alright.  Let us then 
move on to more general topics.  Paragraphs 8.1 to 8.3 are 
10 
general conclusions drawn in Mr Y’s affidavit from the 
evidence related to him by earlier and appears to be 
certain 
conclusions 
drawn 
by 
the 
Project 
Veza 
Investigation.  I am going to read those three paragraphs 
to you and you could follow those paragraphs and I am 
going to ask you in general terms if you have any comment 
if I may. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 8.1 reads: 
“An 
important 
focus 
of 
the 
Project 
Veza 
20 
Investigation has been a non-compliance of SSA 
members with legislation policy prescripts and 
operational and financial directives that govern 
the agency. 
In the creation and operation of a parallel 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 53 of 155 
 
intelligence structure the secrecy surrounding 
deep cover operations was used as a pretext for 
accessing funds.  
However, 
the 
SSA 
like 
other 
government 
departments 
find 
financial 
prescripts 
that 
governs its expenditure.” 
 
Do you have any comment on 8.1?  
MS K:   No chair I agree with the paragraph.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   8.2 reads:  
“Preliminary analysis indicates that there 
10 
has 
been 
gross 
noncompliance 
with 
operational and financial directors especially 
in the establishment and management of 
covert projects and the creation special 
purpose vehicles to siphon funds.  
These 
financial 
irregularities 
resulted 
in 
approximately R 1.5 billion been taken from 
state 
coffers 
and 
expended 
both 
domestically and abroad during the period 
2012 to 2018 under the disguise of covert 
20 
operations. 
the funds taken under disguise of covert 
operations 
emanated 
from 
the 
Treasury 
allocated budget as well as retained funds 
as regulated in terms of the secret services 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 54 of 155 
 
act 56 of 1978.” 
 
Do you have any comment?  
MS K:   I have read the paragraph but I want to on the 
amount but otherwise generally I do agree.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Do you want to say 
anything about the amount?  
MS K:   I do not know. We had not really quantify it, 
whatever was expended and whatever was stipend, what 
was legal and what was illegal?  So because it is an 
ongoing investigation we have not done that as yet.  We 
10 
have not been able to. Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So that approximation we 
can leave in the hands of Mr Y?  
MS K:   Yes, please.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  8.3 reads:  
“These 
sustained 
patterns 
of 
financial 
irregularities 
and 
corrupt 
practises 
were 
exacerbated by inadequate and ineffective 
consequence management. 
The financial directorate in particular failed 
20 
to 
cheque 
abuses 
of 
power 
and 
state 
resources both political heads and executive 
managers. 
the failure of internal controls contributed to 
the erosion off the organisational culture of 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 55 of 155 
 
the SSA and the weakening of governing 
structures during the period 2012 two 2018.” 
 
Do you have any comment in regard to that?  
There has been some evidence but your comment if any.  
MS K:   No comment except that I agree with this 
paragraph.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then paragraphs 8.4 to 8.9 deals 
with 
the 
principle 
outsourcing 
off 
the 
SSA’s 
counterintelligence mandate and give some examples.   
 
The examples are a matter record and because we 
10 
are pressed for time I am not going to go into detail in 
respect 
of 
the 
particular 
examples 
because 
without 
knowledge of what is behind these allegations they are not 
really informative.  
 
But the examples do show or do you contain 
statements relating to what appears to be the outsourcing 
of counterintelligence mandate.  
 
In other words, records of payments to various 
entities within and out South Africa in substantial amounts.  
But let us deal with the principle.  
20 
 
Paragraph 8.4 reads:  
“The SSA prescripts do not permit the use of 
external entities to perform functions of the 
SSA in covert operations. 
In any event, all expenditure to operatives 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 56 of 155 
 
should be fully accounted for in terms of 
prescript.  
In both cases and in relation what is set out 
below the prescripts were not followed.” 
 
What comment do you have in relation to those 
general principles That governs that governs the SSA? 
MS K:   The first one - the first sentence there I am not 
sure of because I am not an expert in covert operations 
and prescripts but the rest I can attest to, yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if there is expenditure in 
10 
relation to an entity, you say that the prescript requires 
that should be fully accounted for?  
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Are you able to say that those 
prescripts at least were not followed?  
MS K:   Yes, I am able to confirm that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  8.5 reads:  
“In 
December 
2014 
Ambassador 
Dlomo 
illegally signed contracts on behalf of the 
SSA with SSA with Several companies.  
20 
These companies were integral to facilitating 
the illicit financial closing of CDSO Projects 
and operations.” 
 
Are you able to comment on that statement?  
MS K:   Yes, this is a hundred percent correct.  
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 57 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  and what appears in Page 
– well, in paragraph 8.6 to 8.9 are examples of such 
payments.  The entities to which payments well mate had 
all been redacted and very little information therefore 
emerges from these paragraphs but if you would have a 
brief look at these paragraphs and if you agree with me - 
we need not go into that detail but you are free to comment 
In relation to the details contained here.  
MS K:   These paragraphs we're actually compiled by Mr Y 
in conjunction with the team.  So and there is a separate 
10 
document that deals with this.  so I do agree and confirm 
those paragraphs.  Paragraph 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9.  Yes, I 
confirm.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So to inform the Chair it is 
therefore his record and for him to read but in general 
terms these paragraphs referred to investigations and 
documentation which record a number of payments to a 
number of identities both locally and abroad whose names 
have been redacted.  Is that a fair summary?  
MS K:   Yes.  May I just add something?  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of course.  
MS K:   Just for purposes of timeline because we did a 
timeline analysis of all of these events.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And if you ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   In December 2014, these contracts with these four 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 58 of 155 
 
- these are the ones that we could trace - with these four 
entities 
was 
signed 
by 
Ambassador 
Dlomo 
as 
a 
representative of SSA.   
 
However, those contracts are not valid and they 
are not legal.  There is many – there is an assessment on 
legal opinion on those – the state of those contracts.   
 
I must also indicate that in certain instances the - 
what we have picked up is that – okay in respect to every 
contract 
that 
is 
referred 
to 
herein 
the 
section, 
the 
domicilium address for SSA is reflected - it reflects the 
10 
other party’s address.   
 
Secondly, 
the 
function 
or 
duties 
of 
those 
companies that are supposed to provide the services 
outlined 
actually 
fully 
or 
partially 
the 
entire 
counterintelligence mandate of SSA.   
 
So I think for the record because we are not going 
to go into detail.  I would maybe appreciate it if one of 
these contracts would be read in terms of just the duties. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us do that.  
MS K:   ...[Indistinct – audio break] so that - because we are 
20 
talking 
about 
outsourcing 
of 
the 
counterintelligence 
mandate.  So to put it into context, it is - I think it ought to 
be important to read that duty.   
 
And another additional thing that I can say here is 
that, when these contracts expired a junior member within 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 59 of 155 
 
the CDSO decided to explain his contract illegally without 
authorization.   
 
And secondly, two of these service providers 
happened to be owned by friends of the project manager 
for some of the Project Construção and all of these other 
projects.   
 
So these contracts in terms of timelines were 
signed in December 2014 and Projects Construção, Wave 
and I think Mayibuye were approved in January 2015. 
 
And by February 2015, there was already – there 
10 
were already those withdrawals of 10 million, 15 million from 
those projects but and they were based on invoices issued 
by these service providers. 
 
So I just thought I should put that in the context so 
that you understand the flow of how things happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well let us just attempt to 
summarise the main points in your evidence and you can 
assist me here Ms K.  Firstly, as a matter of principle in 
terms of the governing prescripts, the activities of the SSA 
are at least alleged by Mr Y not to be lawfully capable of 
20 
outsourcing.  You have commented on that, right? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second point is that a number 
of contracts were entered into by the SSA represented by 
Ambassador 
Dlomo 
around 
or 
during 
and 
around 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 60 of 155 
 
December 2014 before the projects relevant to those 
contracts were approved and established.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, a month before. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A month before.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thirdly, the proper procedures 
were not followed and in some cases there were not proper 
authorisation for the conclusion of these contracts or their 
later extension. 
MS K:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The total of the amounts involved, 
at least I paragraphs 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9.  I have just done a 
quick calculation.  Approximate to R 125 million.  Is that 
fair?  If you look at the totals in 8.7, 8.8.  It is a rough 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You do not have to rely on my math 
but... 
MS K:   Ja, I am too old now to calculate.  My brain is not as 
20 
sharp as it used to be. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, then you have pity on me 
Ms K. 
MS K:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is well over R 100 million. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 61 of 155 
 
MS K:   Ja, safe to say that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And the – you say the form 
of the contracts and the contracts themselves do not, in 
your view, comply with the regulatory prescripts.  Is that 
correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could look at paragraphs 
8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 and suggest to me what we can put before 
10 
the Chair by way of an example unless you think it is 
useful to go through all of them. 
MS K:   No, only one.  Maybe Napa? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is Christian name or 
pseudonym Napa.   
MS K:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...para 8.8.  Is that the paragraph 
you are referring to? 
MS K:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us look at that. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you to go page SSA-01, page 56. 
MS K:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 56? 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 62 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The contract starts at 
page 57.  The cover page is at page 56, black numbers, 
SSA-01.   
MS K:   It is page 56? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   56.  Five, six. 
MS K:   Sorry.  Ja, okay thanks. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [No audible reply]  
MS K:   Yes, I am there now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see there the contract exists? 
MS K:   Yes, there is the contract.  It does not say who is 
10 
representing Napa.  It does not say who is representing SSA.  
That is on the first page.  And then if we go to the scope of 
work in paragraph 2, on page 059.  2.1 reads: 
“The SSA hereby appoints ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do not mention ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   ...this company.  Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Please do not mention the name of 
the company.  That should have been redacted. 
MS K:   I will not.  I will not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
20 
MS K:   So the company is appointed to manage for this 
project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second Ms K.  Mr Pretorius, 
just tell her if there are other names that she should not 
mention in the document. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 63 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Chair, I am comforted by the 
fact that this bundle as it is with its redaction has been 
cleared by the legal representatives of the SSA and 
therefore by the SSA itself.  So we cannot get into any 
difficulty with the SSA but I am conscience ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you have been [laughs] overriding 
them, is it not? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I have been going further 
than they have gone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In that sense, I have override 
them.  And just as a matter of precaution.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It may be that this redaction is not 
complete because only some of the names have been 
redacted if you look at the document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
...for 
example 
the 
new 
commissioner of contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to say she must not mention 
20 
any names of a person or name of entity or company. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously, she can mention CDSO, I 
guess. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, sure. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 64 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I will then take further 
instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not certain at the moment but 
it just appears that there may be a problem with the extent 
of the redaction.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So I guess what that means 
Ms K is that you do not mention the name of the company 
appearing on the first line of Clause 2.1 as well as the 
10 
name of the company that appears on the second part of 
Clause 2.1.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I must stress Chair.  Perhaps 
not in relation to this company but certainly in relation to 
some companies.  They – the Investigation Team attempted 
to trace them and have been unable to confirm their 
existence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that raises a whole range of 
other possibilities. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That these were simply methods 
used to siphon funds and that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...the evidence has already been 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 65 of 155 
 
given.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By the acting DDG.  But for the 
moment, I think it is just safer to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, until you know what the position is.  
As I understand it, you say that she should not mention – 
well, in that page there seems to be – those two seems to 
be the only names of companies. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If she moves to another page of the 
10 
same document, I guess what you have just said would 
apply as well, namely she should avoid mentioning the 
names of companies that are there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms K, you were saying something 
about Clause 2.1 when we interrupted you. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair.  On paragraph 2, it is saying: 
“The company and – the company has appointed 
a manager of covert projects with the following 
scope of work which would cover the following 
20 
main areas. 
1. The project management function would be 
part(?) of senior so as delegated by SSA 
executives. 
2. ...[intervenes]  
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 66 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You are reading from where?  
I thought you were at 2.1? 
MS K:   2.1.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
MS K:   It is a subject - I think it is sub...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I can see it now where you are. 
MS K:   Section, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MS K:   So 2.1.1.1. it reads: 
“Project management includes this: 
10 
- Development 
of 
the 
project 
management 
charter. 
- Investigate the security risks and threats in 
the implementation of the project, both domestic 
and foreign in the form of research. 
- Conduct political, economic, social security 
risks and threats, research so as to position 
the 
project 
implementation 
within 
the 
intelligence domain, objectives and ultimate 
outcomes. 
20 
- Develop a surveillance spread work for the 
security risk assessment in support to the work 
visits by the Presidency into foreign domain. 
- Identify, spot, recruit, train and manage 
assets which are to be positioned provide 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 67 of 155 
 
intelligence relating to security threats to our 
state, government and the independence of the 
Republic of South Africa or Africa.  (Okay it 
says the Republic of Africa) posed by a hostile 
person, 
governments 
or 
even 
foreign 
intelligence ...[indistinct] [00:22:43] 
- An education recruitment and handling of 
potential forces would be at the discretion and 
agreement of both parties.” 
2.1.5.6 
10 
Monitoring and evaluation of security risks and 
threats against the State both domestic and 
foreign. 
2.1.7: 
“Development 
of 
counterintelligence 
programmes and action plans that are to assist 
in dealing with identified security risks and 
threats by the state and the state security 
agency timeously on appropriate interventions. 
The scope of work shall endure for a period of 
20 
12-months, commencing on the 1 s t of January 
2015.” 
 
So that is what I wanted to highlight – to be 
highlighted and to be placed on record in terms of the 
scope because according to our legal practitioner who 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 68 of 155 
 
looked at these contracts, and when we looked at the 
legislation, that is the mandate of the SSA which was being 
outsourced to this company.  
 
The other contracts reads almost copy and paste 
of these tasks.  And what is astounding is that these 
contracts are assigned in the same months, most of them 
to do the same work and later on start drawing funds. 
 
Invoices coming from these companies are then 
utilised to access the funds for the various projects that we 
have covered yesterday.  Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is an interesting clause that 
appears 
on 
page 
62 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
entirely 
contradictory to what you just read and then we will 
comment on all of them in due course.  Under the head:  
Independence, paragraph 10: 
“The company acts as independent contractor 
(which is rather alarming) and not as an agent 
of State Security Agency and has no authority 
to act on behalf or bind the State Security 
Agency unless expressly agreed so in writing.” 
20 
 
It is difficult to understand how that clause sits 
with what you have just read as the authority given under 
the scope of work but ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...I will invite you to comment in a 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 69 of 155 
 
moment.  It seems that the matters listed in the clause 
spoke of work on page 59, are precisely what the SSA is 
obliged by legislation to do and carefully constructed 
legislation, regulations and internal provisions.  Is that a 
fair observation? 
MS K:   Yes, I agree.  That is exactly what the issue is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say several contracts were 
signed in these terms paying entities substantial amounts 
of money, well over R 100 million to do the work of the 
SSA. 
10 
MS K:   Yes, Chair.  Hence we came to the conclusion of, 
there was parallel intelligence machinery that was set up 
during that period. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the result is, as you point out, 
that private entities paid for by taxpayers’ money are 
operating outside the strict controls of the legislation and 
regulations to conduct intelligence operations.  Is that a 
fair summary of the position? 
MS K:   Can you please repeat that summary? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The result of this outsourcing was 
20 
to pay outside private entities to do intelligence work 
uncontrolled by the legislative prescripts governing the 
SSA.   
MS K:   Yes, that is the issue.  Which means that the 
legitimate SSA structure almost became absolute or even if 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 70 of 155 
 
they were working they would not have the benefit of getting 
whatever information namely monies redirected and rerouted 
to these entities. 
 
And it would mean then that there would not be – 
they would actually be paralysed.  SSA in its true nature 
would be brought to a state of paralyses because then they 
would get this maybe criticism that oh you are focusing on 
open source or you want – but you will find that people did 
not actually have the resources or they were not fully 
engaged.  That is just my view.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess Ms K, there are a number of 
points that arise from this evidence.  It is one of them that 
private companies were paid money from SSA to do SSA 
work that SSA had personnel who were supposed to do that 
work?  Is that one of the points that you are making? 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, Chair.  It is exactly it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you – SSA has got personnel who are 
supposed to do this work.  They are paid so that they can do 
this work but money is taken out to pay private companies to 
20 
do that work.  So there is duplication quite apart from the 
question whether or not it was legal to do that. 
MS K:   Yes and furthermore, Chair, we should also look at 
this in the context of the many co-workers that were also 
“appointed” to work within and with CODS.  So how do they 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 71 of 155 
 
fit in if the company – there are various companies that are 
required to do that, pay for that, and then there is also co-
workers that are capacitating Sigeso(?), so it is not reality 
for now in my mind or there could also be possibility that 
those companies never did anything, it was just for 
invoicing purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You mean to steal money? 
MS K:   Yes, that is our assessment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, thank you.  Mr Pretorius? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    If you would bear with me a 
moment, Chair?  Paragraph 7.2 on page 61 deals with 
communications and says that the company must report or 
furnish information to the SSA.  Are you aware of the 
person 
to 
whom, 
if 
this 
was 
a 
legitimate 
and 
real 
arrangement, to whom reports would be made? 
MS K:   I am not aware. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us go on then to 
paragraph 8.10.  
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which now deals with financial 
controls.  Paragraph 8.10 reads: 
“These covert companies were registered in the 
names of individuals who had full control of these 
entities with no oversight.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 72 of 155 
 
Is that, please assist, a reference to the companies that we 
have been talking about now in the previous paragraphs 
8.6 to 8.9. 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say yes, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It goes on to say: 
“There 
was 
accordingly 
a 
high 
risk 
of 
mismanagement 
of 
these 
facilities 
and 
the 
subsequent loss of inability to account for state 
10 
assets.  If proper reconciliations or audits are not 
undertaken by the Chief Financial Officer, potential 
for corruption, fraud and theft is high.  In addition 
there 
is 
no 
standard 
operating 
procedure 
for 
procurement in the covert space and there is no 
oversight for procurement above R500 000.  As a 
result, the risk of fraud and/or theft of state funds 
has increased.” 
Do you have any comment on those observations?  Do you 
agree with them? 
20 
MS K:   I do not have the facts and the knowledge to be 
able to agree, I do not know whether there indeed are no 
SOPs or procurement in the covert space.  I am not the 
expert on covert operations.  So I would prefer not to 
comment on this one. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 73 of 155 
 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Right, 
in 
relation 
to 
that 
…[intervenes] 
MS K:   I cannot confirm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In relation to the risk of theft and 
fraud, what do you say to that?   
MS K:   Definitely the weak financial controls and that 
culture of complicity in those activities and lack of 
consequence management did heighten the risk of fraud, 
theft and, you know, money laundering actually. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  Paragraph 8.11 reads: 
10 
“It therefore cannot be oversized that the covert 
operational space within the SSA relies on the 
integrity of people and systems to ensure that the 
area of greater secrecy is managed 
with the 
greatest care.” 
Do you have any comment on that observation?  Self-
evident? 
MS K:   I agree with that a hundred percent. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that of course would be one of 
the problems of outsourcing to people who are not vetted 
20 
and controlled in the same way as internal operatives 
within SSA.  Do you agree with that observation? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The statement goes on to say in 
paragraph 8.11: 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 74 of 155 
 
“The Constitution provides for the refusal to obey a 
manifestly illegal order.” 
We have established that. 
“Which includes an unlawful order to act in breach 
of financial prescripts.  There are also practical 
mechanisms within the Intelligence architecture to 
address these circumstances.” 
Do you have any comment? 
MS K:   I mean, the Constitution provides for it.  However, 
people do not stand up and report and irregularities or 
10 
having – I do not know, maybe people are scared to lose 
their jobs or whatever, so they just obey but – and maybe 
people are not informed of what PRECCA requires of all of 
us as people that are in positions of responsibility.  If you 
see anything that is illegal or somebody gives you an 
illegal order, it is not everybody that is bold enough to 
refuse, respectfully refuse an illegal order. 
 
However, there are people who are aware that they 
are doing illegal things, they are part of that network.  
Sometimes people do not refuse but they – also their non-
20 
action also contributes to this thing proliferating. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Director General, the Acting 
Deputy Director General, Mr Jafta, did emphasise the need 
– and the Chair will obviously consider it, to put in place 
mechanisms to facilitate the reporting of illegal orders and 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 75 of 155 
 
you have just referred to the Prevention of Corrupt 
Activities Act which enjoins the same conduct to report 
unlawful conduct.  That is just by way of clarification. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us go to paragraph 8.12, if we 
may?  The statement of Mr Y continues in general terms, 
reads: 
“Rather 
than 
mitigating 
the 
risks 
of 
financial 
irregularities in the covert space, however, the DG, 
CFOs and other senior managers in the agency 
10 
facilitated 
the 
funding 
of 
unlawful 
intelligence 
operations 
as 
aforementioned. 
 
The 
CFOs, 
in 
particular, have emerged in our investigation as key 
role 
players 
who 
facilitated 
gross 
financial 
mismanagement 
and 
abandoned 
their 
fiduciary 
duties under the Public Finance Management Act by 
failing to implement internal control measures, they 
facilitated the escalation of unauthorised irregular 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure as well as fraud 
in contravention of Section 38 and 50 of the PFMA.” 
20 
Do you have any comment on those conclusions? 
MS K:   I agree with this paragraph in its entirety.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 8.13 reads: 
“There 
are 
numerous 
examples 
where 
senior 
management tried to cover themselves by including 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 76 of 155 
 
disparaging remarks on requests for the approval of 
funds 
but 
nonetheless 
recommending 
the 
submissions.  On several occasions, Raymond…” 
Pseudonym. 
“…recommended that a submission be approved but 
attempted to abdicate responsibility by writing next 
to the signature “recommended on strength of 
compliance with OD.”  In other instance, a senior 
member of management recommended a submission 
with multi-million implications but wrote “as per the 
10 
instruction 
of the 
Minister.”  These 
comments 
indicate 
that 
the 
persons 
involved 
knowingly 
approved financial irregularities and attempted to 
conceal their complicity in a culture of impunity.” 
Do you have any comments on that or those statements? 
MS K:   My only comment is that I had seen the 
documents, there is numerous of them and I do not know at 
senior level what would make a person – if you say it is an 
instruction, it is still an illegal instruction, so it does not 
necessarily have to be implemented and then you feel like 
20 
you abdicate your responsibility by writing as per the 
instruction of the Minister. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, so …[intervenes] 
MS K:   Because there should be mechanisms – ja, there 
should be mechanisms for senior managers at least to 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 77 of 155 
 
know where to go to raise those objections. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understand.  Is it fair to 
summarise what your comments entailed by saying that it 
is no excuse for someone approving a recommendation or 
recommending a submission by referring to the instruction 
of the Minister because, as we have learnt, cannot do that, 
is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Point 14, the first sentence needs 
some explanation but if you could do so without referring 
to any operational directive, those remain classified. 
“Financial 
controls 
were 
also 
weakened 
by 
restricting 
the 
access 
of 
financial 
officers 
to 
operational 
directives 
regulating 
the 
financial 
management of operational work.” 
Now the operational directives are restricted, they have not 
been declassified, so we cannot refer to their content but 
operational directives we know from evidence already 
20 
given that they would control the operations of the SSA 
and its operatives and management in some detail.  Did the 
financial 
officers 
have 
access 
to 
these 
operational 
directives? 
MS K:   They should have.  I assume they did have 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 78 of 155 
 
because it is required even for a covert project to be 
established.  That operational plan should be approved by 
the CFO.  So CFOs should have copies of the ODs and I 
think they do have, especially if you refer to the paragraph 
above, 8.13, where if the CFO is going to write maybe 
recommended on the strength of compliance with ODs, that 
already indicates that they know the ODs. 
ADV PRETORIUS 
SC:   Well, that is a matter of 
interpretation.  Of course the person who makes the 
recommendation may say look, I do not know what the OD 
10 
says but must be complied with.  But I do not want to 
debate that with you.  Then 8.14, I understand you would 
not entirely agree with the first sentence.  You say they did 
have access to operational directive.  So one cannot say 
that financial controls were also weakened by restricting 
the access of financial offices to the operational directives, 
do I understand you …[intervenes] 
MS K:   We can.  We can say that because it is maybe 
junior level financial officers did not have access to those 
directives but at the level of a CFO you would have – they 
20 
would have access to the ODs. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understand.  Thank you.  The 
paragraph continues to read: 
“This resulted in an inability to monitor compliance 
with 
operational 
directives 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 79 of 155 
 
remuneration of agents or contacts resulting in a 
higher risk of fraud and/or theft.  It is also of 
concern that financial officers were required to sign 
nondisclosure forms despite holding top secrete 
security clearances and taking the oath of secrecy 
required for all intelligence offices.  This was a 
purported control measure taken by Raymond…” 
Pseudonym. 
“…who prevent information leakages.” 
Do you have any comment on that? 
10 
MS K:   Yes, I agree with that paragraph.  We actually do 
have a sworn statement in this regard explaining what 
happened in this space particularly in the 2017/2018 
financial year. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then paragraph 8.15 reads: 
“An insufficient segregation of duties within certain 
control processes allowed for users with dual roles 
and transaction codes not in line with their job 
description to facilitate irregular transactions.  This 
was attributed to a lack of capacity in Chief 
20 
Directorate Finance which was said to necessitate 
the unfettered access.  Furthermore, the system 
roles 
were 
not 
linked 
to 
standard 
operating 
procedures and staff appeared to have inadequate 
knowledge 
and 
compliance 
with 
SSA 
policies.  
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 80 of 155 
 
Despite attempts by some managers within this area 
to up skill and capacitate the existing staff with the 
requisite skills, the CFOs did not support these 
endeavours.” 
Is that fair comment?  Do you agree?  Do you want to 
qualify? 
MS K:   I just want to say that last line for me it is –I am 
only certain of one CFO.  So when you say CFOs, I cannot 
– I do not know, it is a small issue but it is not plural, in my 
view. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, that is noted. 
MS K:   And – yes.  And …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So a particular CFO …[intervenes] 
MS K:   Everything else – ja, everything that has been 
explained there we actually had – because we have an 
expert in the team that deals with these things, it was 
actually tested and there is historical information on this.  
So I do support and agree with this paragraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let us move on to the next 
section which deals with financial irregularities and the use 
20 
of cash.  Paragraph 8.16 reads: 
“The investigation found that weaknesses in the 
internal control environment allowed for state funds 
to be accessed with impunity.  Funds supposedly 
used for projects were withdrawn irregularly.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 81 of 155 
 
8.16.1: 
“In most instances funds were withdrawn without 
the necessary authorisations or authorisation at the 
correct level as required by the MPD.” 
Do you have any comment on the introductory part of the 
paragraph and that subparagraph? 
MS K:   I agree with both, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 8.16.2 reads: 
“Built-in 
financial 
controls 
were 
deliberately 
deactivated to enable access to funds.” 
10 
Do you have a comment? 
MS K:   Yes, as I explained yesterday, Chair, that CDSO 
did not have an APP so they could not note the budget so 
that we can manage, exercise control.  So on the system, 
the finance system, there is a built-in feature which is 
called a funds availability check.  That funds availability 
check is a tool for the budget controller to be able to see if 
– when they try to take a TA to see if there is a budget, 
there are funds available for that.   
 
Now in this period of CDSO, the funds availability 
20 
check function was switched off by the then CFO and that 
is what enabled CDSO to be able to expend like a 30 
million that is meant for a year to use all of that, to 
exhaust those funds within three months and then allowed 
them to still keep on taking TAs because the funds 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 82 of 155 
 
availability check function was deactivated. 
And I also agree with this on the basis that there is 
documentation that proves that when that CFO went on a 
work trip for four days, other financial staff, staff within 
that unit, took that gap and applied to whoever was acting 
those four days, requested that the funds availability check 
function be reactivated and the person did exactly that. 
But when the CFO came back from a work trip he 
came and deactivated that funds availability check again 
and that, for me, showed that it was deliberate.  So that is 
10 
what we found as the team, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   8.16.3 reads: 
“No specificity was provided as to the nature of 
expenses in breach of financial prescript.” 
That is a general statement but can you comment? 
MS K:   I think I comment in detail yesterday, Chair, on 
that one, on line functions issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   And so I think… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, fake documents and so on.  That is 
what you said, hey? 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   8.16.4, you have dealt with the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 83 of 155 
 
systematic controls over the expenditure of funds and 
access to funds being biased.   8.16.4 reads: 
“Budget controllers were deliberately excluded in 
the approval of the disbursement of funds.” 
Do you have a comment in that regard? 
MS K:   It is true.  Even in submissions you can see that it 
did not go via them and if the funds availability check is 
disabled, obviously this will not – the budget controllers 
will not be able to exercise their functions.  
 
So I suspect that that is why – I do not if it came 
10 
out anywhere in the affidavit, that is why it is alleged but it 
is also proven in documents that the CFO then had 
instructed and directed that CDSO only uses and they 
channel all of their TAs to one specific financial officer who 
would process all of these transactions and this went on 
for years.  So this is one individual that was specialising in 
CDSO whatever, the TAs and settlements and all of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Let us go then to paragraph 
8.17, the use of cash in operations is said sometimes to be 
necessary by previous witnesses but it is a matter that 
20 
requires strict control, also said by previous witnesses, but 
8.17 reads: 
“A particular concern arising out of our investigation 
is the cash-based approach adopted by the SSA 
coupled with a negligible audit trail which has left 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 84 of 155 
 
the Agency susceptible to illicit financial flows and 
possible money laundering.” 
We will come to the example in a moment but that general 
statement, do you have any comment?  It would be useful 
to have the views of the investigation team in that regard. 
MS K:   These are the views of the investigation team, this 
is exactly what we found.  It is one of the findings so I 
agree with that sentence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
“By way of example a receipt dated 12 June 2017 
10 
indicates that 2 082 682 600 (sic) Euro was signed 
for without any details of the recipient reflected in 
the records relating to this cash disbursement.  The 
records pertaining to this withdrawal reflect that the 
funds were withdrawn by codename Helen which 
was approved by Mr Arthur Fraser.  These “records” 
are contained in file 2 of the SSA bundle marked as 
annexure 
RH2. 
 
This 
matter 
is 
still 
under 
investigation.” 
I must stress that putting word records in inverted commas 
20 
was my gloss, does not appear in the statement. 
 
That document is to be found at page 864 of the 
bundle, it is another declassified document. 
MS K:   It is towards the end of the file. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it is right at the end, page 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 85 of 155 
 
864. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Perhaps repeat the page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   864. 
CHAIRPERSON:   864.   
MS K:   Yes, Chair, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let us just attempt to place 
on record some idea of this document.  The document is 
declassified, it is headed: 
“Acknowledgement of receipt.” 
It reads in typed format: 
10 
“I hereby acknowledge that:” 
And then there is a complete blank on the dotted line. 
“Received…” 
Amount in figures, Euros 2 082 600.  Then amount in 
words, as if deference was given to detail here and the 
amount in words is set out there. 
“…on this date 12 June 2017 from…” 
And there is a complete blank and then there is a signature 
of recipient, no name, and then there is signature of 
provider and there is no signature at all.  Perhaps it is 
20 
stating the obvious but I should put it to – is that a 
sufficient accounting, for any amount, let alone 2 million 
Euros?  Do you have a comment? 
MS K:   What is the question? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that a sufficient accounting in 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 86 of 155 
 
your view to enable control of cash? 
MS K:   It can never be, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, but perhaps stating the 
obvious. 
MS K:   Because it does not have a say who is giving the 
money, what the money is for, who is receiving the money 
and will never be able to trace and I note that in page 
872… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please comment? 
MS K:   In page 872 that is a certificate confirming that it 
10 
means that the person did not have records and receipts to 
account for this money and there is an incomplete voucher 
form where Helen signed for this 2 million Euros and it was 
approved by Mr Arthur Fraser.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to say Helen being a pseudo name. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Helen is pseudonym, yes. 
MS K:   The pseudonym Helen had signed there as project 
administrator who was submitting this incomplete voucher 
for 2 million Euros and it was approved by Mr Arthur Fraser 
and when you look at the authorisation thereof, the – I  just 
20 
want to check the green form, the temporary advance form.   
Okay, where the money is taken, there is always a 
comment in most of pseudonym Helen’s TA, there is always 
a comment by Raymond that a second TA should be 
allowed or member can take second TA as allowed by the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 87 of 155 
 
DG. 
 
So 
there 
is 
that 
consistency 
and 
also 
these 
incomplete vouchers. 
 
And what we also need to note about that receipt 
that you referred us to, 864, Chair, is that there is 
numerous of these receipts that we found and filed and 
some of them just have the signature of the recipient and 
the rest is blank and our conclusion from that is that it is a 
blank cheque.  You can write any amount, the recipient has 
already signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS K:   So there were a lot of those as well which shows 
that there was no accountability because it then raises the 
question that how did the people clear these temporary 
advances on the system?  If you can see that the receipts 
are not even there and the disbursement of his funds 
actually even just a piece of paper where he just write 
people’s names or codenames and just write R1 million. 
 
So those are the things that we are raising in this – 
Mr Y and the team are raising in this affidavit, in this 
section. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know what the exchange 
rate was, the Euro and rand or the currency in June 2017 
but that particular acknowledge of receipt at page 864 
reflects that over 2 million Euros were given to the person 
who signed there and there is no name on the receipt but 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 88 of 155 
 
my rough estimate is that of – last time I knew, and that 
might be a long time, R8 would amount to 1 Euro, so that 
might be over 16 million. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In the region of R30 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you see, it is a long time I last 
checked. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, then, yes, at that time.  Now it 
would be R40 million, at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But R30 million in June 2017. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am told, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now it would be R40 million, about, 
more or less. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not guaranteeing it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I think it is a fair estimate, R30 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fair estimate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But R40 million in today’s terms, 
approximately.  Lots of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is a lot of money.  Okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and just one further question 
quickly.  Do I understand you to say that the example that 
we have given now is not an exception but is a common – 
or was a common occurrence at the time? 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 89 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, would this be a convenient 
time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment.  
It is five past one, we will resume at five past two.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms K are you 
present? 
10 
MS K:   Yes I am present Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Paragraph 8.18 page 
398 of SSA02 do you have it in front of you? 
MS K:   Page what, sorry? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 398 of SSA02, paragraph 
8.18. 
MS K:   I have just got to look for that.  What is the page 
number again, I am so sorry? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   398, paragraph 8.18 of Mr Y’s 
statement. 
20 
MS K:   Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It reads: 
“The CDSO was reportedly permitted by the CFO to 
process submissions for withdrawals of cash is not 
only enabled complicit CDSO members to run a 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 90 of 155 
 
parallel 
finance 
system, 
but 
also 
created 
opportunities for duplicate payments.” 
You have a comment on that statement? 
MS K:   Yes, based on the information we have, yes, I 
agree with that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph continues: 
“Furthermore, Lily who was responsible for CDSO 
finance and assets was provided with an alias - Lily 
is already another pseudonym, and granted powers 
to order cash from SBV, where a CDSO member 
10 
came and withdrew large cash amounts from SSA 
headquarters.” 
What is SBV stand for? 
MS K:   It is a management, cash management company.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
MS K:   So I do not know what it stands for.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so that was a company that 
held cash and that cash was provided to the SSA.  Do I 
understand it correctly? 
MS K:   The company, as far as I understand, the company 
20 
does not hold the cash, the cash is in the bank but the 
company assists in transporting. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 Alright, 
but 
you 
say 
that 
Lilly…[intervene] 
MS K:   Because at that at the time, that is what I 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 91 of 155 
 
understood. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but Lilly could order that that 
cash be delivered, is that what that statement is saying? 
MS K:   Yes, this conclusion is based on several 
documents that we saw where she was placing orders for 
cash and also, this was corroborated by one of the 
implicated individuals who said they were responsible for 
faxing these instructions to the company, to you know, 
when each time they wanted to order cash. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so that statement is correct 
10 
is it, as I understand what you are saying? 
MS K:   Yes, yes, it is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 8.19 reads: 
“There was a lack of implementation of standard 
operating procedures, and in some instances a 
deliberate 
breaching 
of 
standard 
operating 
procedures by the CFO’s in order to achieve ends 
that were irregular.” 
Similarly, should that be a singular in your view or plural 
CFO’s? 
20 
MS K:   In relation to the sentence that follows immediately 
after that, it actually relates, it is in plural, the plural will 
stand.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, good.  It read…[intervene] 
MS K:   I do not know if I am making it clear but if you read 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 92 of 155 
 
the next sentence, what is described in the next sentence, 
actually applied to more than one CFO.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, let us read the set.  
So the first sentence is correct, it applies to more than 
one, CFO.  And the second sentence reads: 
“In the banking and cash management area, the 
CFO would give verbal instructions to order cash 
and allow for members of the CDSO in the office of 
the DG who withdraw secondary EA’s despite the 
members having failed to settle the first, as well as 
10 
extending 
standing 
advances 
without 
proper 
reconciliation.” 
We have heard that evidence from the acting director 
general, is that statement correct? 
MS K:   Yes, it is Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In other words, money could be 
drawn in accordance with the temporary advanced system, 
even though the prior withdrawal had not been settled. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And advances could be made 
20 
without proper prior reconciliation.  Do I understand it 
correctly? 
MS K:   Yes, but on the verbal instructions, what we mean 
there is, it is for cash, for withdrawals of cash in terms of 
the TA system.  The CFO, is the, as far as I understand is 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 93 of 155 
 
the only person that can approve the disbursement of cash 
to a member above R50 000,00.  So there is an area for 
the CFO to sign for any amount above R50 000. 
So almost all the withdrawals by CDSO members, 
because they were cash as I said whether it is R19million, 
whether it is whatever amount, the CFO’s as we have it on 
record from witnesses would call, allegedly called the 
cashiers to give instructions to say, do you have R19million 
there because somebody is coming to withdraw it and if 
they do not they would instruct them to order money from 
10 
the same cash management company and the money would 
be delivered and given to the various CDSO members or 
the office of the DG.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 8.2, I read: 
“This 
conduct 
resulted 
in 
monthly 
cash 
flow 
shortages and the redirection of SSA retained funds 
for infrastructure development to covert operational 
work for which no proper accounting was done.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph continues to read: 
“In relation to the CDSO, budgets were approved 
[and 
revised 
to 
increase] 
without 
annual 
performance plans being present. This was enabled 
by the deactivation of the funds availability check 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 94 of 155 
 
that is inbuilt within the system to ensure controls.  
This axiomatically meant less funds were available 
for legitimate SSA project.”   
The funds availability check was a system check on the 
computer systems and budget management system or 
funds management systems within the SSA.  You have 
given that evidence; am I correct?  
MS K:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And are those statements that I 
have just read, are they correct? 
10 
MS K:   Yes, they are Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   8.21 reads: 
“In 
addition, 
budget 
management 
committee 
meetings were not regularly convened and the 
decisions of the budget management committees 
that did take place were not implemented.  There 
was 
gross 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
planning, 
budgeting and reporting cycle.  In one instance, 
permission and approval of additional funding of a 
R100million for the SSA was given by National 
20 
Treasury to Raymond and the former DG Mr Fraser 
without the knowledge of the budget management 
committee and outside medium term expenditure 
framework processes. These funds in addition to 
budgets for the SSA provincial offices were directed 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 95 of 155 
 
to the office of the DG.” 
Are those statements correct? 
MS K:   The first and second sentences, I am not sure 
because I am not a finance person and as much as we got 
that information, I cannot confirm the assertions in the first 
sentence 
and 
the 
second 
sentence 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
reporting cycles and all that.  However, the latter part I can 
confirm. In fact, the permission was granted to give 
R100million, 
but 
SSA 
had 
apparently 
requested 
R200million extra over and above what we had.  So there 
10 
are documents to that effect. So I agree with the last part, 
the latter part of that paragraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You did give evidence previously 
and I just like to confirm that in the last sentence of 
paragraph 8.21.  You talk of funds being directed to the 
office of the DG from the SSA provincial offices.  Do I 
understand that correctly, funds that should have been 
allocated to the provincial offices were in fact redirected to 
the office of the director general, do I understand it 
correctly? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I think it links to what I said earlier, that the 
budgets of the provincial offices were allegedly cut by 50% 
in that period, so it ended up being the money was more 
concentrated in the office of the DG. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that the Principal Agent 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 96 of 155 
 
Network Program that existed prior to 2011 was apparently 
terminated and fully investigated.  That evidence has been 
given, I think by Dr. Mufamadi you recall that?  
MS K:   Yes, I do recall that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So in paragraph 8.22, and this is a 
new topic. The statement is made: 
“As part of the 2011 restructuring approved by 
Minister Thwele the Cover Support Unit had been 
relocated from the domestic operations to counter 
intelligence under Ambassador Dlomo’s control.” 
10 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, we covered that it is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“In terms of a further restructuring, effective from 1 
April 2017 as part of the strategic development plan 
vision 
2035. 
 
The 
Cover 
Support 
Unit 
was 
established in the office of the DG.” 
We have also dealt with that. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   8.23 reads: 
20 
“During Mr Fraser's tenure as DG there were 
irregularities in the management of the Cover 
Support 
Unit 
that 
suggests 
an 
intention 
to 
resuscitate the operating model that was used in 
the implementation of the Pan Program between 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 97 of 155 
 
2007 and 2010, which had been found irregular and 
unlawful.  In particular, similar irregularities relating 
to the renting of safe houses that occurred during 
Pan were uncovered during our recent Project Veza 
Investigation.” 
Are those statements correct? 
MS K:   I mean it says suggests an intention to resuscitate 
the operation model and I do not really know the full extent 
and the detail of that operating model but in as far as it 
related, it relates to issues of rentals and leases.  I did see 
10 
similarities in that regard.  So I can say that where that 
sentence that starts with in particular similar irregularities 
relating to the renting of safe houses and that occurred 
Pan we uncovered during our raid, that sentence I agree 
with fully.  The other part I am not saying it is incorrect all 
I can say - what I am saying is, I am not 100% certain. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, 8.24 reads: 
“In one instance, approximately seven safe houses 
were purportedly leased by the Cover Support Unit. 
However, these properties were leased, without the 
20 
necessary approvals and leased in a manner that 
was detrimental to the SSA.” 
Do you agree with those contentions? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am going to be cautious in the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 98 of 155 
 
next part of that paragraph.  So if you would be careful not 
to reveal any names or relationships other than those in 
red, which are pseudonyms, and I will read it to you as the 
redacted version will read Chair.  This is something that I 
have prepared on last night to do in addition to the official 
redactions.  It reads now or should read: 
“Members 
of 
the 
SSA 
entered 
into 
facilitation 
agreements with a person who was related to 
another member of the SSA, pseudonym Mary, 
where that person received a monthly facilitation 
10 
fee for contracts relating to the lease.  Pseudonym 
Mary was working under the authority of pseudonym 
Jack and Pseudonym Philani, who entered into the 
said lease contracts with knowledge of the above 
mentioned conflict of interest.” 
Well, without reference to the names and positions, it is 
difficult to see where the conflict of interest arises.  But 
can you confirm that there was a conflict of interests and 
agreements for the lease of safe houses were entered into 
notwithstanding a conflict of interest within the SSA? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that the paragraph is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, thank you.  8.25 reads: 
“This practice had been prevalent during the Pan 
Program and the same persons who were implicated 
at that time are again implicated in its revival under 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 99 of 155 
 
Mr Fraser ’s leadership namely, Phalani pseudonym, 
and Mary pseudonym.  A further example of the 
irregularities relating to the Cover Support Unit 
during 
this 
period 
concerns 
the 
alleged 
authorisation by Mr Fraser on 6 September 2017, 
for the purchase of a minimum 80% shares in seven 
companies and or the purchase of these companies 
in their entirety. However, it is alleged that there 
was no CFO approval for these purchases, and 
similarly no indication of how much would be 
10 
budgeted for this venture.  This matter is still under 
investigation.” 
Can you confirm the correctness of the contents of that 
paragraph? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that we do have a copy of this 
authorisation and as much as it has serious financial 
implications, the CFO was not included in that but it does 
however, say the CFO will be later consulted on it, but it 
was approved.  So the matter is still under investigation, 
because we are not sure if this was ever executed. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next section of the – but you 
have 
said 
the 
matter 
is 
still 
under 
investigation, 
I 
understand. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next section deals with 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 100 of 155 
 
parallel and irregular vetting processes. Now there has 
been 
substantial 
evidence 
given 
earlier 
in 
the 
Commission's existence to vetting, Mr Jafta gave that 
evidence.  But the manner in which it is set out here gives 
some detail and understanding of vetting, why it is 
necessary to be done properly and how it can be abused.  
But I would like you to comment on the next section.  Are 
you able to comment on the section? 
MS K:   Yes, I am able to comment on this section because 
the Project Veza team had received the documents, 
10 
retrieved all of those vetting files and we were able to 
analyse all of those files, including who the individuals 
vetted were, who the vetting officers involved were and the 
completeness of the files themselves.  So I can confirm 
paragraph 9.1 in its entirety, 9.2 and 9.3. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just stop there in summarise, if we 
may, I am sorry to interrupt you, you say oh perhaps I 
should take a step back, 9.3? 
MS K:   Yes, I agree with that paragraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us just stop there because nine 
20 
one, two and three are background matters, and I will try 
and summarise them for the purposes of the record.  
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.1 talks of: 
“The 
importance 
of 
vetting 
and 
why 
proper 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 101 of 155 
 
systematic vetting and regular vetting is important 
to the operations of the SSA because it determines 
the level of access a member or contract employee 
of the agency may receive with regard to classified 
information and or restricted premises.  It minimises 
the risk of compromising the integrity of classified 
information and material protects.  It protects the 
Agency against foreign and hostile intelligence 
operations, the Bursars Act and the intrusion by 
criminal 
elements 
and 
determines 
there 
that 
10 
operatives and employees integrity, reliability and 
loyalty to the Agency and safeguarding its assets, 
the interests of the Republic of South Africa and its 
constitution.” 
Would you agree with those observations? 
MS K:   Yes, I do agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.2 reads: 
“Vetting is a deliberate coordinated effort within the 
SSA environment governed by a number of statutes 
highlighted there.” 
20 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.3: 
“In terms of legislation and regulations, the decision 
to issue clearance certificates, resides with the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 102 of 155 
 
director general of the SSA, who may delegate this 
authority.  In the SSA the delegation of authority, or 
the delegated authority it should be, lies with 
provincial 
managers 
and 
notably 
the 
general 
manager, internal security and general manager 
vetting, and security advising.  These two general 
managers are responsible for internal vetting, and 
external vetting respectively. While the general 
managers 
responsible 
for 
vetting 
and 
security 
advising are required to report to the deputy 
10 
director responsible counter intelligence, the onus 
of delegation lies with the general managers and 
provincial managers.” 
Do you agree with those organisational prescript? 
MS K:   Yes, that is how we understand them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next section deals with the 
risks posed by irregular vetting and the statement deals 
with the abusive vetting structures, which enabled co-
workers to be deployed by the CDSO without having been 
subject to the formal vetting processes of the SSA.  
20 
And in order to understand the implications of that  
the author of this affidavit deemed it necessary to highlight 
the risks posed by a regular vetting.  But do you confirm 
that co-workers were deployed by the CDSO without having 
been subject to the formal vetting processes of the SSA? 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 103 of 155 
 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that, that was the files that I 
was referring to that we analysed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and it is important to 
understand the next section in the light of the purposes of 
the proper vetting regime that we spoke about a minute 
ago. 9.5 reads: 
“The issuing of clearance certificates, which is the 
end product of the vetting function provides an 
assurance to the recipients, organs of State, that 
the concerned individual is security competent. The 
10 
issuing of certificates and in effect, the vetting 
process is sacrosanct and falls squarely within the 
mandate of the SSA as a first line measure in 
delivering on its counter intelligence mandate.” 
You agree with that issue? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry? 
MS K:   I agree Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, 9.6 reads: 
“As a result of the establishment of a parallel 
20 
vetting structure, as detailed below the checks and 
balances built into the SSA system were overridden, 
allowing 
for 
persons 
who 
were 
not 
security 
competent to gain access to organs of State 
sensitive information and positions of power or 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 104 of 155 
 
influence.” 
You agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do agree Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.7 reads: 
“To appreciate the impact of such conduct on the 
Agency, it is necessary to reflect on some of the 
conduct that these “cleared”.” 
Now I suppose that means persons not properly vetted, 
individuals were subsequently involved. 
9.7.1: 
10 
“The 
running 
of 
illegal 
counter 
intelligence 
operations 
that 
were 
in 
contravention 
of 
the 
Constitution, the Intelligence Services Act, and the 
Agency's operational directives.” 
9.7.2: 
“Receiving millions of rand in cash from members of 
the CDSO for a number of years thus perpetuating 
fraud, theft at SSA funds and resulted in illicit 
financial flows.” 
9.7.3: 
20 
“Receiving caches of SSA firearms and ammunition, 
including 
automatic 
rifles, 
which 
remain 
unaccounted for, these firearms were signed out of 
the SSA armoury by CDSO members and handed 
over 
to 
individuals 
considered 
cleared 
by 
the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 105 of 155 
 
parallel vetting outfit.” 
And 9.7.4: 
“Parallel military training of SSA/CDSO and so 
called co-workers using SAS firearms.  The SSA 
armoury was provided with neither with proof of 
these individuals, trainers, nor the trainees firearm 
competence certificates.” 
Do you have any comment on the contents of those four 
sub- paragraphs? 
MS K:   I agree with all of them and with regards to the 
10 
firearms, we do have several statements that support that. 
But I have to indicate that we have to maybe in on 9.7,3 on 
the firearms issue where we say including automatic rifles, 
and 
maybe 
we 
could 
add 
some 
of 
which 
remain 
unaccounted for.  As DG had indicated that some were 
recovered and we submitted a list of these four ballistics a 
several of them, I think they were like 34 or so that have 
been submitted for ballistics testing to the SAPS.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we will take account of what 
the acting director general said in that regard and we do 
20 
deal with weapons and firearms in particular, later in the 
statement and we can deal with it in more detail there, 
thank you Ms K.  9.8 reads: 
“While this weekend, the SSA’s first line of defence. 
It also potentially enables the infiltration of other 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 106 of 155 
 
departments in the security cluster, including the 
SAPS Presidential Protection Unit by individuals 
that were trained and, “vetted” - and I assume that 
is a reference to not being properly vetted, in this 
manner and thus in possession of invalid security 
clearance certificates.  In addition, the process 
undertaken by the parallel vetting structure was in 
itself flawed and constituted a very weak check on 
security competence.” 
Are you able to comment on that statement or those 
10 
statements? 
MS K:   Yes, this is correct.  It is what the investigation 
has found out and with regards to the Protection Unit, we 
were able to actually get names from some of the 
implicated individuals on who has been deployed within 
that space. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  In paragraph 9.9 reads: 
“Apart from the risk posed to counter intelligence 
measures, this parallel vetting structure poses a 
risk to the reputation and integrity of the legitimate 
20 
SSA vetting process. By way of example, the SAA 
executives who allegedly refused to be vetted may 
opportunistically point to the lack of integrity of the 
SSA system as a defence to their refusal and the 
public activities of the activities of the parallel 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 107 of 155 
 
vetting structure will be difficult to distinguish from 
the legitimate SSA process.” 
Do you have any comment?  Can you confirm the contents 
of that paragraph? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm.  It is just a view but I think the 
view is accurate.  It is important for members of the public 
and government to understand that we have loyal and 
patriotic officials within the SSA who are responsible for this 
process and they do their job as it is supposed to be done. 
 
But unfortunately around the time, the period under 
10 
review, this happened and I hope it has been remedied right 
now but we – it should not discourage anybody from 
cooperating with vetting processes that are undertaken by 
the SSA.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The danger that is highlighted in 
paragraph 9.9, as I understand it, is that the existence of 
an 
illegitimate 
and 
flawed 
vetting 
process 
really 
undermines the proper process.  That is an obvious 
comment to make. 
MS K:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And by undermining in the public 
eye means there may be an unjustified resistance to the 
proper vetting process.  Is that the point you are making? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 108 of 155 
 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  We move now to the 
statement insofar as it deals with a parallel vetting 
structure.  9.10 reads: 
“The 
Project 
Veza 
Investigations 
has 
uncovered 
evidence 
of 
a 
parallel 
vetting 
structure that operated within the office of the 
Deputy Director-General, Counterintelligence 
during the period 2013 to 2018. 
Based on our interviews with witnesses and 
10 
implicated persons as well as our review of the 
relevant vetting files, it appears that this 
parallel structure vetted selected individuals 
and issued them with purported SSA clearance 
certificate. 
Not only did this practise bypass official SSA 
vetting channels, but the vetting process that 
is followed by this parallel structure were 
irregular and weak.” 
 
Can you confirm those findings? 
20 
MS K:   I can confirm this with the advice that we revised the 
date there, I do not think the period is accurate, this 
process, according to my understanding, and that quite early 
on it did not go up to 2018.  Although our – the focus of the 
team 
– 
the 
scope 
you 
know 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
clear 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 109 of 155 
 
dispensation it was in 2018.  But it does not necessarily 
mean that this process, the vetting structure existed in 2018.  
I – is that clear Mr Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it is clear.  Well, he can 
answer that as it is addressed to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Well, I think it is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did date would you suggest 
became more accurate in your view? 
MS K:   I do not know the date offhand but what I can say is 
that the personal who was responsible for this project had 
10 
handed over these files to another unit within SSA.  So that 
date – I do not have that information at hand.  So I think that 
date and that year would be the safest to utilise in this 
regard. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we can check that. 
MS K:   But we do have records of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Paragraph 9.11 reads that: 
“The structure (that is the parallel vetting 
structure) was set up in October 2013 when 
vetting officers including polygraph personnel 
20 
and the valuators were seconded into the 
office 
of 
the 
DDG 
Counterintelligence 
by 
Ambassador Dlomo. 
The correspondence informing these members 
that 
they 
were 
being 
seconded 
into 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 110 of 155 
 
Ambassador Dlomo’s office did not indicate 
any particular purpose for the formation of this 
new structure beyond providing assistance to 
his office and the offices of the Director, 
Domestic Branch and the Minister of State 
Security.” 
 
Is 
that 
a 
fair 
summary 
of 
the 
facts 
within 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   That is what – yes, that is what we were told by the 
project manager. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  9.12 reads: 
“The team leader at the centre of this parallel 
vetting structure was pseudonym Mandy who 
worked 
as 
a 
Vetting 
Officer 
for 
another 
company (the name of the company has been 
deleted) before joining the agency as an 
Internal Vetting Officer. 
Her team consisted of five vetting officers or 
evaluators and two polygraph examiners. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
that 
pseudonym 
20 
Mandy is a seasoned Vetting Officer, the 
processes of her team failed to follow even the 
basic tenets of vetting.” 
 
Can you comment on those statements? 
MS K:   I agree with the statements. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 111 of 155 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.13 and perhaps this will need 
some explanation, reads: 
“As the team leader, pseudonym Mandy was 
responsible for administering the vetting files 
generated by the structure operating out of 
this parallel structure. 
According to the declaration made by the Chief 
Directorate Vetting and Security Advising, they 
received these vetting files in about April 2019 
although pseudonym Mandy contents that she 
10 
had handed over these files and in late 2018. 
This discrepancy aside, it was clear that 
pseudonym Mandy had been in possession of 
these 
vetting 
files 
since 
2013 
operating 
outside official CDVA (that is Vetting and 
Security Advising) panels.” 
 
The import of that paragraph is not entirely true.  If 
you agree with it, perhaps you could clarify. 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, and it is also – it is also helping me to 
withdraw that state – you remember that period where we 
20 
said from 2013 to 2018 ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   ...the structure operated.  Because I thought she had 
handed in – instead of the discrepancy in terms of when she 
handed this hand but it does not necessarily mean that this 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 112 of 155 
 
was – the structure was operating when she handed in the 
files because initially they did this work and then the 
pseudonym Mandy later on became the project manager for 
some of the CDSO operations and projects that we had 
already covered yesterday including Tin Roof. 
 
So I think between – once the vetting was done on 
the individual that we identified, they then – she was then 
channelled to do other things, other work that are now 
pseudo related.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So when did pseudonym 
10 
Mandy conduct vetting for CDSO?  Can you establish that 
from this paragraph? 
MS K:   According to the report to her, she was not 
conducting vetting.  Okay.  She was conducting vetting under 
the 
umbrella, 
under 
the 
office 
of 
the 
DDG 
Counterintelligence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   But it so happened that most of the people that were 
vetted were co-workers who were then deployed in CDSO.  
However, there are some other people, senior members, 
20 
management that was vetted by her structure as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.   So ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It seems to become clear.  But are 
you saying that even before Mandy arrived to conduct the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 113 of 155 
 
vetting, there were other vetting processes that had taken 
place under the jurisdiction of the office of the DG prior to 
her arrival?  Am I correct? 
MS K:   No, you are not correct Chair.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well, please explain then 
why ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   That process started when that team was constituted 
in 2013. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, I see. 
MS K:   So that is when Mandy started working because she 
10 
was project leader from the beginning of the process.  I am 
guessing until the end. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But when happened in 2018 and 
2019?  I mean, all you say in 9.13 that she was 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   That ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...she was in possession of vetting 
files not that she actually conducted the vetting at that 
stage.  Is that what you now say? 
MS K:   Now we – she did conduct the vetting.  She was 
20 
leading the team and she admits to it because it was during 
an interview which is recorded and transcribed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So the statement that it is 
clear that Mandy had been in possession of vetting files 
since 2013 should be understood to mean that she had 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 114 of 155 
 
actually been conducting vettings since 2013 not only in 
possession of files since 2013?  Am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes, yes.  Yes, Chair.  Because you see later on, I 
think in this affidavit, we talk about how these files were not 
loaded onto our official SVIS System.   That is where the 
vetting files are loaded, you know, in terms of the process.  
So these files were kept in hard copy and not loaded on the 
system as is required.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The following paragraphs 
indicates that you examined the vetting files that existed in 
10 
this parallel vetting structure and you have given that 
evidence and certain observations were made.  Those are 
set out in paragraph 9.1.4.  If I can just read through the 
next six sub-paragraphs. 
“Approximately 162 files were submitted to the 
Chief Directorate and Vetting and Security 
Advising but this is unlikely to be the complete 
set 
as 
additional 
files 
had 
come 
to 
the 
Investigation Team’s attention through other 
sources.” 
20 
 
Is that statement correct? 
MS K:   Yes, it is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Second sub-paragraph reads: 
“53 
files 
were 
complete, 
while 
109 
files 
contained incomplete documentation.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 115 of 155 
 
 
Is that statement correct? 
MS K:   Yes, it is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The third sub-paragraph reads: 
“53 
cases 
indicated 
no 
deception 
on 
the 
polygraph while 103 files did not contain any 
polygraph results.” 
 
Is that statement correct? 
MS K:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Fourth sub-paragraph reads: 
“53 clearance certificates were found of which 
10 
three had no vetting investigation reports or 
supporting documents for the issuance of such 
certificates. 
While it should be noted that the absence of 
clearance certificates in other files does not 
indicate 
that 
these 
individuals 
were 
not 
cleared.” 
 
Is that ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes, I agree with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The fifth sub-paragraph reads: 
20 
“Six files had significant responses of which 
five appeared to have received clearances and 
86 files had no vetting evaluator.” 
 
Are those statements correct? 
MS K:   Six is correct.  Five I am not so certain because I – 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 116 of 155 
 
because I do not work in that space.  But I am not sure what 
is significant responses.  So I do not want to misinterpret but 
I trust the vetting experts in the team that their analyses is 
correct.  So based on that I would just confirm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  9.1.5 reads: 
“In 
addition, 
several 
flaws 
were 
noted 
regarding 
the 
process 
of 
file 
completion, 
demonstrating 
limited 
or 
no 
adherence 
to 
vetting standard operating procedures.” 
 
Again, there are examples given in sub-paragraphs 
10 
1 to 7.  I am not sure if it is necessary to go through all of 
them but all of those examples indicate what appears to be 
serious lapses in the process of vetting.  Would you agree 
with that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do agree Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could just have a brief look 
at 9.15.1 to 9.15.7 and see if you agree with those 
observations if there were any qualifications, perhaps we 
should place them on record? 
MS K:   I agree with all of those points from 9.15.1 to 
20 
9.15.7. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And for the purposes of 
the record.  Each of one of those indicates what appeared 
to be material procedural lapses in the process of vetting.  
That appears summary. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 117 of 155 
 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
9.16 
deals 
with 
certain 
discrepancies noted in respect of clearance certificates 
that were issues in terms of the parallel vetting process.  I 
will read three of these discrepancies as they appear in 
these sub-paragraphs to paragraph 9.16. 
 
9.16.1 reads: 
“According to official SSA vetting processes, 
the Chief Directorate Vetting and Security 
Advising is responsible for vetting external 
10 
individuals while the Chief Directorate Internal 
Security is responsible for internal vetting. 
However the vetting certificates issues by 
pseudonym Mandy’s team were neither that of 
the CDIS nor the CDVA but rather appeared to 
be a combination of both templates.” 
 
The import of that one could only really understand 
with further explanation and looking at the templates, but 
do you have any comment in relation to the statement in 
9.16.1? 
20 
MS K:   I want to confirm that based on inputs by the 
directorate sited there.  So I agree with that.  I confirm 
9.16.1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What does it matter if both 
templates were used?  We need to understand the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 118 of 155 
 
significance of that if possible. 
MS K:   The distinction is very important in that the – as far 
as I understand, the template I think in terms of the – 
whatever the emblem is used and the type of paper and what 
each – there should be that distinction between the two.   
 
I do not know the detail of it.  So I cannot really get 
technical about it and should be able to get evidence from 
the people involved maybe you will get more clarity.   
 
But what I can say is that in terms of our security 
clearance certificates, there is a number allocated because 
10 
you would find that when a vetting file is open there is a 
number and it is loaded on the system.   
 
There is a number that is allocated that is going to 
be the security clearance number.  But in this regard, the 
certificates would – did not bear such a number.  They only 
bore ID numbers of the individuals that they vetted. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  I understand. 
MS K:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps I should go back to 9.15.7 
where we said that those sub-paragraphs with which you 
20 
agreed highlighted the clause ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...in the parallel vetting system.  
9.15.7.  I think you have mentioned it in another context 
but perhaps we should mention it in this context.  The 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 119 of 155 
 
vetting files produced by the parallel vetting system, were 
they loaded onto the SSA official vetting record system as 
prescribed by standard operating procedures? 
MS K:   No.  No, they were not Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 9.16.2 reads: 
“While the general manager of the Chief 
Directorate Internal Security and the General 
Manager of the CDVA (that is the Chief 
Directorate Vetting and Security Advising) are 
duly delegated to sign clearance certificates 
10 
issued 
by 
their 
respective 
divisions, 
the 
clearance certificates issued by the parallel 
vetting structure was signed by the Deputy 
Director-General Counterintelligence for whom 
there is no delegation of authority authorising 
him to sign vetting certificates.” 
 
In other words, the DDG Counterintelligence who 
signed 
these 
parallel 
vetting 
certificates 
was 
not 
authorised to do so.  Do I understand the position 
correctly? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, that is what we understand as the team, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.16.3 reads: 
“ 
Official 
SSA 
clearance 
certificates 
are 
printed on security paper and with a SSA logo 
with a number issued being recorded on the 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 120 of 155 
 
SSA system but the clearance certificates 
issued by the parallel structure do not conform 
to this practise.” 
 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   Yes, I think that is what I was trying to explain a few 
minutes ago Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but the records of this system 
are deficient and do not comply with the system in place.  
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.17 reads: 
10 
“The vast majority of the individuals who were 
“vetted” by pseudonym Mandy’s team were the 
Chief Directorate Special Operations so-called 
co-workers.  
Thus the individuals who formed the basis of 
the human capacity of the overall parallel 
intelligence 
structure 
established 
by 
Ambassador 
Dlomo 
were 
improperly 
and 
inadequately 
vetted 
outside 
official 
SSA 
channels.   
20 
These co-workers were given funds, firearms 
and access to sensitive information and many 
were promised permanent employment in the 
SSA.” 
 
Is that statement correct or are those statements 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 121 of 155 
 
correct? 
MS K:   Yes, they are Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.18 reads and this is significant 
because it may illustrate a reason for why this was done in 
the manner it was done.  The statement reads: 
“It is of concern that the parallel vetting 
system fell under Ambassador Dlomo’s control 
when, according to witness reports, he was 
also responsible for identifying most of the 
individuals who were recruited into the co-
10 
worker system.” 
 
Am I correct in understanding that statement to 
mean that Ambassador Dlomo would recruit individuals as 
co-workers within his discretion and then he would control 
the vetting process?  Do I understand ...[intervenes]  
MS 
K: 
 
 
Yes 
and 
issue 
the 
clearance 
certificate 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
MS K:   ..in the end. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the next sentence reads: 
20 
“This signifies a potential conflict of interest 
as Ambassador Dlomo would have a vested 
interest 
in 
the 
security 
clearance 
of 
his 
recruits.” 
 
You have made those observations.   
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 122 of 155 
 
“A 
further 
abuse 
of 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
vetting structure, Ambassador Bheki Langa 
was granted security clearance through this 
illegal parallel process. 
Thus 
although 
Ambassador 
Langa 
was 
appointed as Director of the Domestic Branch, 
his security clearance was signed off by his 
subordinate, Ambassador Dlomo in a process 
that likely compromised his ability to exercise 
effective oversight over the CDSO.” 
10 
 
Do you have any comment in relation to that 
statement? 
MS K:   That is correct sir everything that is in that 
paragraph.  I can confirm.  I have seen the file and ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  9.19 reads: 
“Moreover, Ambassador Dlomo was himself 
never vetted by the SSA Chief Directorate 
Internal Security when he joined the SSA as 
General Manager of Special Operations. 
While 
his 
appointment 
without 
a 
security 
20 
clearance 
was 
in 
itself 
irregular, 
when 
attempts were made by the unit to vet him, he 
indicated that he was already being vetted 
leading to the Security Internal Processes. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
file 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 123 of 155 
 
amongst the parallel vetting documents, it is 
suspected 
that 
he 
utilised 
the 
unit 
he 
controlled 
to 
undertake 
his 
vetting 
thus 
effectively 
granting 
himself 
a 
top 
secret 
security clearance. 
It is highly likely that this clearance was 
accepted 
when 
he 
was 
posted 
as 
an 
ambassador in Japan.” 
 
Are those statements correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now there are other statements 
contained 
in 
the 
witnesses’ 
statements 
or 
affidavits, 
witnesses who have given evidence this week highlighting 
Ambassador 
Dlomo’s 
curriculum 
vitae 
and 
his 
past, 
particularly in KwaZulu-Natal.  Are you aware of those? 
MS K:   No, I am not aware. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those can be placed on record at a 
later stage.  It is in a statement Chair.  Do you know 
whether Ambassador Dlomo’s security clearance was ever 
subsequently withdrawn? 
20 
MS K:   No, I do not have any information on that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That again can be dealt with.  The 
next session deals with the vetting of Mr Arthur Fraser.  
9.20 reads: 
“During 
our

the 
Project

Team

preceded 
his 
appointment 
as 
DG 
in 
September 2016. 
A 
preliminary 
perusal 
revealed 
striking 
irregularities 
which 
warranted 
further 
investigation. 
While Mr Fraser was not vetted through the 
parallel vetting structure described above, his 
vetting also circumvented prescribed channels 
10 
and followed a flawed process.” 
 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   9.21 reads: 
“The

CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Internal prescripts half as a 
general rule not been declassified and until I am satisfied 
that this has been declassified but I am not going to quote 
from the directive Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So let us move on then two 9.22 if 
we may.  You do not know, I take it, Ms K whether that 
internal security directive has been declassified?  
MS K:   I am not aware of it being declassified.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So let us just go on then 
10 
to 9.22.  
“Mr 
Fraser's 
entire 
vetting 
process

conducted by the chief Directorate Vetting and 
Security

was 
primarily 
mandated to vet external individuals (that is 
non-SSA 
members) 
in 
other

this 
irregular

Page 126 of 155 
 
delegated 
authority 
to

certificates for external vetting. 
It 
appears 
that 
pseudonym 
Philani 
and 
pseudonym Wendy commanded Mr Fraser ’s 
vetting processes from initiation to completion 
with little or no regard to vetting prescripts. 
It should also be noted that both pseudonym 
Philani and Ambassador Langa who signed the 
clearance certificate had been vetted by the 
parallel structure described.” 
10 
Those statements, can you comment or tell us whether they 
are correct? 
MS K:   I just want to look at my list of pseudonyms.  I can 
confirm the paragraph.  However, in the last sentence: 
“It should be noted that both...” 
Pseudonym Philane, I think – I am not certain of that part 
but I think from my side I would confirm the sentence if it 
said: 
“It should also be noted that Ambassador Langa 
who signed the clearance certificate had been 
20 
vetted 
by 
the 
[indistinct] 
structure 
described 
earlier.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you for that clarification. 
MS K:   That is needed and – ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  923 reads: 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 127 of 155 
 
“The entire vetting process was completed in less 
than three days with noncompliance and poor 
vetting practices being condoned on the purported 
urgency 
of 
Mr 
Fraser ’s 
vetting. 
 
While 
the 
expedient…” 
Should perhaps read expedited. 
“…vetting of executives is not in itself irregular, the 
process and duration of Mr Fraser ’s vetting raises 
concerns.  All witness accounts confirm that the file 
was auctioned by the SSA on 3 September 2016 and 
10 
completed on 6 September 2016.  This is an 
inexplicably short period given that Mr Fraser was 
only appointed on 26 September 2016.  Indeed the 
fact that an additional two or three days would have 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
for 
proper 
interviews, 
investigations, 
polygraph 
examination 
and 
evaluations case doubt on the purported urgency of 
Mr Fraser ’s vetting.  In any event…” 
Yes, I do not want to go to the internal prescript there but 
in relation to the statements thus far made in para 9.23, do 
20 
you have any comment? 
MS K:   It is accurate, Chair, according to our analysis of 
the file. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  9.24 reads: 
“More 
importantly, 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
vetting 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 128 of 155 
 
process is called into question by the following 
irregularities any anomalies. 
The first subparagraph: 
“The vetting form on the legal basis of which 
vetting proceeds was incomplete and not properly 
signed under oath by Mr Fraser as it was only 
certified by a Commissioner of Oaths notably 
pseudonym Philane on 6 September 2016.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Second subparagraph: 
“The vetting fieldwork officer opened and closed the 
file on one day, 4 September 2016 without having 
sight of a particular form or time to conduct pre-
interview screening or record checks.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The third subparagraph reads: 
“While a minimum of three references are required 
for secrete and top secret clearances, only two 
20 
referees were interviewed for Mr Fraser ’s vetting 
one of whom, pseudonym Jonathan, was recruited 
by the vetting officer as he was aware of the close 
relationship between Mr Fraser and his first listed 
referee.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 129 of 155 
 
Is that statement correct?  
MS K:   Yes, it is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The fourth subparagraph reads: 
“The file does not contain the actual results of the 
polygraph test or the polygraph that is produced 
and 
the 
polygraph 
examiner 
indicated 
to 
the 
investigation team that she was instructed to leave 
all documentation with pseudonym Philane.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   It is correct, I am just not sure about the 
10 
pseudonym there.  I cannot currently recall whether it was 
given to Wendy or Philane but the essence of that is 
correct, of the paragraph is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It might be someone else other 
than Philane? 
MS K:   It is either Philane or Wendy.  It could be Wendy 
because most the stuff was done by Wendy in terms of 
loading. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and Wendy we know is also a 
pseudonym. 
20 
MS K:   A pseudonym, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The fifth subparagraph reads: 
“The vetting evaluator was confined to Philane’s 
office…” 
That is a pseudonym. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 130 of 155 
 
“…without being permitted access to his regular 
tools of trade and all documents required for the 
proper evaluation of the file.  He indicated in his 
interview with the investigation team that with 
benefit of hindsight he would recommend revetting 
of the subject.” 
Is that a correct statement of what occurred? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The sixth subparagraph reads: 
“There was a fraudulent criminal record check 
10 
presented on file with SAPS having subsequently 
confirmed that record checked on Mr Fraser were 
only conducted in 2010, 2012 and 2014 and that no 
check was conducted in 2016.” 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   That is what we understood in our engagements 
with the relevant people in SAPS. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  The next subparagraph 
reads: 
“There was no South African Revenue Service 
20 
clearance certificate.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next subparagraph reads: 
“There was no quality control of any vetting work 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 131 of 155 
 
undertaken.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And lastly: 
“The clearance certificate issues does not correlate 
with the electronic record on the SSA security 
vetting information system which has none of Mr 
Fraser ’s 
details 
recorded 
or 
supporting 
documentation uploaded.” 
Is that correct? 
10 
MS K:   That is correct, when we checked last year for his 
details we found that under his name it is just a series of 
zeros.  Under this ID number it is a series of zeros.  We 
only used the – we used the clearance certificate number 
to search on the system.  So that was irregular in itself. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  The conclusion is 
drawn in paragraph 9.25 – and I am going to read it with 
certain positions redacted.  Paragraph 9.25, subject to that 
qualification reads as follows: 
“In short, the resort to the external vetting capacity 
20 
under pseudonym Philane’s control, appears to 
have 
served 
the 
purpose 
of 
expediting 
and 
manipulating Mr Fraser ’s vetting process to secure 
a clearance certificate and thereby validate his 
appointment as DG irrespective of whether he was 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 132 of 155 
 
security competent or not.” 
Is that a fair statement?  
MS K:   Yes it is, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
“It is noteworthy that after Mr Fraser ’s appointment 
and his reconfiguration of the SSA under Strategic 
Development Plan Vision 2035, the individuals that 
were 
central 
to 
his 
vetting 
process 
received 
promotions.” 
Now I am not going to talk about the promotions, positions 
10 
or the promoted positions but I am simply going to refer to 
three pseudonyms, Philane, Wendy and Jonathan.  Do you 
know of those facts, alleged facts?  
MS K:   Yes, yes, I do know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Are they correct? 
MS K:   I can confirm that.  Yes, they are, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Let us go to the next 
section which before the conclusions is the last section.  It 
deals with the illegal use of SSA firearms.  Some of this 
evidence has been given in summary form by Acting 
20 
Director General Jafta.  This is a more complete record of 
these issues.  The first section deals with the regulatory 
regime governing the SSA’s armoury.  10.1 reads: 
“South Africa has a comprehensive firearms control 
regulatory regime located in the Firearms Control 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 133 of 155 
 
Act of 2000 and the Firearm Control Regulations.” 
These bind the SSA, do they?  
MS K:   Yes, they do, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.2 reads: 
“The 
Firearms 
Control Act 
and 
its 
associated 
regulations also impose stringent requirements on 
dealers 
to 
keep 
records 
on 
all 
firearms 
and 
ammunition in stock including firearms stored on 
behalf of competent licensees.  In terms of Section 
95 of the Firearms Control Act the SSA is declared 
10 
as one of the official institutions permitted to store 
and keep firearms.  The SSA thus derives its 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
relating 
to 
the 
management of firearms for the FCA.” 
That’s the Firearms Control Act, is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.3 reads: 
“This responsibility within the SSA resides with the 
Chief Directorate Internal Security whose mandate 
includes ensuring physical security, VIP Protection 
20 
as 
well 
as 
asset 
management. 
 
The 
latter 
encompasses the management of an armoury in 
compliance with the Firearms Control Act to ensure 
full implementation of sufficient control measures 
including registering with the SAPS.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 134 of 155 
 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The fourth subparagraph of 
subparagraph 10 reads: 
“The 
SSA 
through 
the 
CDIS 
in 
pursuance 
of 
ensuring sufficient security and control measures 
implemented various steps including but not limited 
to 
the 
draft 
approval 
of 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
and 
firearm 
training 
material, 
the 
development of face recognition, ID card, firearm 
10 
permits and other relevant documentation.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“This latter documentation includes official firearm 
requisition forms, annual firearm inspection and 
accountability forms for all SSA provincial officers 
and relevant units as well as firearm an ammunition 
transport document.” 
Is that correct? 
20 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The fifth subparagraph reads: 
“Furthermore, the standard operating procedures 
set out the guidelines for the application processes, 
issuing, possession, usage and storage of official 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 135 of 155 
 
firearms as well as for training in the use of these 
firearms. 
 
As 
such 
the 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
cover 
the 
complete 
spectrum 
of 
procedures, tasks and requisite workflow involved 
in the management of SSA firearms.  The SSA has 
appointed competent armoury officials who are very 
well-acquainted with the Firearms Control Act and 
were actively involved in improving the physical 
security around firearms and in developing the 
standard operating procedures.” 
10 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it seems by way of summary, 
Ms K, that the issuing, use and control of firearms is very 
strictly regulated in terms of legislation and regulations in 
considerable amount of detail.  Is that a fair summary?   
MS K:   That is a fair summary, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.6 then reads: 
“Despite 
the 
existence 
of 
these 
controls 
SSA 
firearms were abused by individuals and the Chief 
20 
Directorate Special Operations for illegal purposes.  
Our investigations indicate a glaring nexus…” 
I think that is an incorrect word of nexus but you can 
comment. 
“…between on the one hand the flouting...” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 136 of 155 
 
Well, maybe it is correct, perhaps I should …[intervenes]3 
MS K:   It is correct, it is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I would have preferred it to 
say glaring gap but let us say it is: 
“…a glaring connection between on the one hand 
the flouting of SSA recruitment processes, the 
circumvention of vetting processes and the parallel 
training initiatives and, on the other hand, the 
illegal access to SSA firearms that this parallel 
counter intelligence structure obtained.” 
10 
Alright, let us try and make sense of that.   There is a 
connection between the flouring of the processes of 
recruitment into  the SSA, the circumvention of the vetting 
processes, which you have dealt with, and the training 
initiatives that accompanied it.  There is a connection 
between those things on the one hand and, on the other, 
illegal access to SSA firearms that the parallel counter 
intelligence structural involved.  Do I have it right? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, I am glad you 
20 
approved. 
MS K:   Yes, you do have it right, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   My apologies, Ms K, for confusing 
you.  The next section deals with irregular access to SSA 
firearms.  10.7 reads: 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 137 of 155 
 
“In late 2014 and early 2015 the CDSO began 
requesting firearms from the SSA armoury.  In total 
39 
firearms 
were 
issued 
to 
the 
structure 
represented by specific individuals on the request 
of Ambassador Dlomo in his capacity as Deputy 
Director General counter intelligence.  The 39 
firearms comprised of 11 R4 rifles, 10 pistols, 4 
Glock 17 pistols, 18 Glock 19 pistols, one Mossberg 
12 gauge shotgun, three BXP submachines and two 
Uzi submachine guns.” 
10 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will refrain from comment once 
more.  Paragraph 10.8 reads: 
“The request for firearms by Ambassador Dlomo 
were made directly to the general manager of CDIS, 
pseudonym Johan, who facilitated the handing over 
of firearms to CDSO.  This was often done without 
the necessary forms being filled in or assurances 
been given that the persons receiving the firearms 
20 
were security competent to receive them.  Where 
submissions with the necessary authority were 
provided, the documents contained little information 
on the actual purpose for which the firearms would 
be used.” 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 138 of 155 
 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do the prescripts require when 
drawing firearms from the armoury to state what the 
purpose of the firearm use would be? 
MS K:   That is what we made to understand by the experts 
in that area. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.9 reads: 
“Official 
firearm 
training 
sessions 
arranged 
by 
members of the armoury were not attended by 
10 
members of the CDSO as scheduled.  This was 
attributed to Ambassador Dlomo indicating that 
CDSO members were being trained externally by 
former SAPS members were themselves co-workers.  
While this constituted a parallel firearm process, 
SSA firearms were still utilised.  Furthermore, the 
SSA armoury was not provided with proof of these 
trainers’ and trainees’ fire competence certificates 
before firearms were issued to be used in this 
training.” 
20 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   It is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.10 reads: 
“Pseudonym Johan breached legal prescripts by 
facilitating the handing over of firearms to CDSO 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 139 of 155 
 
members without the required safeguards and on 
numerous occasions even personally oversaw the 
issuing of firearms from the armoury.  Witness 
interviews 
indicate 
that 
this 
created 
an 
environmental within the CDIS armoury section 
where they could not refuse irregular requests from 
CDSO 
members 
within 
the 
SSA 
due 
to 
the 
involvement of Johan.” 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And again that would emphasise 
10 
the need for processes to allow the communication or 
reporting of the legal orders but that is a comment which 
has been made several times already.  10.11 reads: 
“Furthermore, Ambassador Dlomo is a member of 
the SSA executive and not a member of operations, 
did not have a justifiable reason to make these 
requests for firearms.  To exacerbate matters the 
CDSO is a covert operational arm of the SSA and as 
such, generally takes necessary steps to avoid links 
to the SSA.  It is therefore unclear why CDSO if 
20 
they 
were 
indeed 
conducting 
legitimate 
covert 
operations or training would be comfortable using 
firearms that were directly traceable to the SSA.  As 
pointed out above, when proper requests were 
made 
to 
the 
CDIS 
the 
motivations 
used 
for 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 140 of 155 
 
accessing of the firearms were often vague, if 
proffered at all.” 
Is that correct statement of the course of events? 
MS K:   That is correct.  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next section deals with the 
lack of controls over the use of SSA firearms, 10.12 reads: 
““Witness 
accounts 
further 
indicate 
that 
these 
firearms were distributed to non-SSA members 
termed co-workers who were regularly recruited as 
agents by the CDSO and deployed to sensitive 
10 
areas 
around 
the 
President 
and 
the 
Deputy 
President.  These individuals were not vetted and 
contributed 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
parallel 
intelligence 
structures 
reporting 
to 
Ambassador 
Thulani Dlomo.  One such incident related to the 
issuing of a firearm to the late Thula who posted a 
picture of the SSA permit on his Facebook page 
following 
an 
apparent 
fallout 
with 
Ambassador 
Dlomo.  Thula was never in the employee of the 
SSA.” 
20 
Is that a correct statement? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.13 reads: 
“Despite 
the 
existence 
of 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
for 
the 
movement 
and 
storage 
or 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 141 of 155 
 
firearms, no controls were implemented insofar as 
CDSO was involved.  In one particular case in 
January 2015 pseudonym Johan authorised a CDSO 
member who does not have a firearm competency 
certificate to collect a cache of 15 firearms without 
taking 
the 
necessary 
precautions 
for 
their 
transportation 
and 
safekeeping. 
 
In 
another 
instance 
firearms 
were 
kept 
in 
a 
hotel 
room 
unsecured with five firearms subsequently going 
missing.  While two of these were returned to the 
10 
SSA by Ambassador Dlomo in November 2019 three 
remained unaccounted for.  The CDSO member who 
accessed the firearms failed to report these missing 
firearms to the SAPS.” 
Is that a correct statement of fact? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair.  In fact we opened a case 
against this member last year because these firearms had 
been missing 2015.  So for four years the member did had 
a chance to report the SAPS what happened and the 
armoury people had advised the member to do so, but they 
20 
did not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.14 reads: 
“There are also indications that in September 2014 
armoury officials were instructed by Ambassador 
Dlomo through Johan, pseudonym, to transport 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 142 of 155 
 
firearms including four R4 rifles and six pistols to a 
foreign country…” 
The name of the country has been redacted. 
“…for unclear reasons.  These were reportedly 
flown in the President aircraft.  This coincided with 
a coup’etat in that country.  Though the firearms 
were reportedly not utilised in that country, CDSO 
members were seen there in the presence of 
Ambassador Dlomo.  It is concerning that SSA 
firearms were flown in the President aircraft to a 
10 
volatile area.” 
Is that an observation made by the investigation team? 
MS K:   Yes it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And is it based on …[intervenes] 
MS K:   And it is also confirmed by sworn statements of the 
– this event, an incident, unfortunate incident is actually 
concerned, did happen. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  10.15 reads: 
“The 
above 
incidence 
demonstrate 
Johan, 
pseudonym, gross dereliction of his duty as…” 
20 
And I am - he was involved with the CDIS. 
“…and a failure to adhere to the policies and 
directives that he himself hand-compiled.  The 
irregular access to and use of SSA firearms not only 
exposed

Prevention and Security cluster to infiltration by 
individuals 
unaccountable 
within 
official 
SSA 
structures but also exposed the President and the 
Deputy President to risks posed by their being 
protected by individuals who were not security 
competent.” 
Do you have any comment? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The last section on weapons deals 
with missing firearms.  10.16 reads: 
“The 
firearms 
issued 
to 
the 
CDSO 
remained 
unaccounted for during this period without the SSA 
armoury being able to conduct firearm inspections 
or ensure that permits were renew contrary to this 
being a requirement when firearms are issued.  
Numerous reports were submitted highlighting that 
CDSO was failing to comply with the firearms 
control requirement.” 
20 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.17: 
“In December 2016 the CDSO under a new general 
manager, 
pseudonym 
Darryl, 
was 
requested 
to 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 144 of 155 
 
return all firearms but only 21 firearms were 
returned.  The 17 outstanding firearms including 
assault 
rifles, 
submachine 
guns 
and 
pistols 
included.  In addition, 1 635 rounds of ammunition 
were issued to the CDSO and to date only 755 
rounds have been returned.  However, there are 
discrepancies with some of the ammunition returned 
as these had never belonged to the SSA.” 
Are the allegations or the statements in 10.17 correct? 
MS K:   Yes, they are correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So is it fair to say that of those co-
workers who were not vetted, who were armed and who 
have not returned to the SSA may still be out there armed?  
Is that a possibility? 
MS K:   May I not respond to that question, Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Okay, we have heard that 
before but I presume it is not because of reason other than 
security. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you did not mean to say you do not 
know, did you? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I do not mean, I do not know.  I am asking 
that I do not answer this particular question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ja, that is fine.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I understand.  10.18 reads: 
“In April 2018 eleven firearms were recovered 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 145 of 155 
 
sometimes placing members of the SSA armoury in 
danger.  In one case members were instructed to 
meet unknown individuals who were in possession 
of SSA firearms at the Durban Airport.  These 
individuals were armed and only released the 
firearms once they contacted Ambassador Dlomo, 
who was in Japan at the time, for permission.  In 
November 2019 two more firearms were retrieved 
from Ambassador Dlomo.  As at November 2020 
four 
firearms 
remained 
unaccounted 
for. 
 
All 
10 
recovered firearms have been submitted to the 
SAPS for ballistic testing to negate the possibility.  
We are still awaiting the results of these tests.” 
Are those allegations correct and is it correct in particular 
that some tests remain outstanding? 
MS K:   Yes it is correct.  The last time that I checked that 
was still the case, this was last year late. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.19 reads: 
“The proliferation of illegal firearms is a major 
contributor to the discernibly high levels of serious 
20 
violence indicated in organised crime which remain 
one of the key threats to the wellbeing and safety of 
South Africans, the authority of the State and 
national 
security. 
 
 
The 
development 
goals 
articulated in the National Development Plan, Vision 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 146 of 155 
 
2013, include ensuring that people living in South 
Africa feel safe at home, school, work and enjoy 
community life free of fear.  The high levels of 
serious and violent crime of which illegal firearms 
form a major part impede Government’s ability to 
ensure stability and security which are pivotal in 
creating 
conditions 
conducive 
to 
economic 
development, prosperity as well as the wellbeing of 
the people.” 
Those are conclusions drawn or opinions of a general 
10 
nature, do you share those views?  
MS K:   Yes I do, I do share those views. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A remark that could I think validly 
be made that these sentiments expressed here, and these 
goals expressed here are precisely the duty of a security 
agency aimed at the national as opposed to secular 
interests, is that correct? 
MS K:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it seems that these very goals 
were not only not followed but to a degree in this section 
20 
of the evidence at least undermined. 
MS K:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   10.20 reads: 
“Apart from the parallel vetting structure posing a 
risk to counterintelligence measures the issuing of 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 147 of 155 
 
SSA firearms to persons not competent to handle 
such poses a risk to the reputation of SSA.   It is of 
concern that non SSA members whose security and 
firearm competence would be not be ascertained 
were 
receiving 
caches 
of 
SSA 
firearms 
and 
ammunition including automatic rifles which remain 
unaccounted for with the assistance of senior 
management within the CDIS, CDSO and the office 
of the Deputy Director of Counterintelligence.  This 
is likely to contribute to a trust deficit between the 
10 
people of South Africa and its intelligence outfit 
entrusted with the security of the State.” 
In your view is that fair comment? 
MS K:   Yes it is Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Finally in paragraph 11 certain 
conclusions are drawn by the author of this affidavit, Mr Y, 
I think it is apposite, we have time to place them on 
record, there are four sub-paragraphs, with your leave 
Chair? 
 
11.1 reads: 
20 
“The channelling of SSA funds ...”...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Sorry Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, do you have any comment 
before I go there? 
MS K:   Excuse me Chair? 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 148 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS K:   Yes please I would appreciate that opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MS K:   Thank you Chair.  I just want to indicate that these 
practices and these – the conditions under which the 
armoury people had to work under are very concerning and 
I must indicate that those particular individual were 
affected and they are still affected today because they 
know the SOP’s, they know the regulations and having – 
one of them actually told me and the team that each time 
10 
there is a media report on whether it is an assassination, 
whether it is whatever they always get nervous because 
they are thinking we hope it is not one of our firearms.   
 
So I just want to underline the commitment, the 
integrity and the – of those officials, that is all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  The section on 
conclusions, if I may put each one to you for our comment 
and confirmation if you wish, or qualification if you wish, 
the first is in paragraph 11.1, it reads: 
20 
“The 
channelling 
of 
SSA 
funds 
out 
of 
have 
legitimately established and authentic intelligence 
structures has led to a weakening of the State 
Security Agency.  “Normal” work in most instances 
did not continue as morale has lessened owing to 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 149 of 155 
 
the inadequacy of the tools left, witnesses the 
blatant 
disregard 
for 
the 
civilian 
intelligence 
structure 
and 
more 
importantly 
fundamental 
breaches of the Constitution.   The parties and 
involvement of the security services in the political 
sphere goes against the values espoused in the 
intelligence 
community 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
Constitution.” 
Your comment Ms K?  
MS K:   The – let me just say I concern and align myself 
10 
with the entire conclusion, all the paragraphs. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   11.2 reads: 
“It is clear from our investigations thus far that this 
deliberate 
weakening 
of 
the 
State’s 
Protective 
Security and Risk Management arm was done in 
order to enable the looting of State funds and to 
prevent detection and accountability within the 
Agency.   Politically connected individual used their 
access to State mechanisms in order to advance 
their own agendas, both financial and political.   
20 
The deep cover resources of the SSA built up in the 
first 15 years of our democracy as an integral part 
of protection national security have been eroding.” 
Your comment Ms K? 
MS K:   I align myself with the paragraph. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 150 of 155 
 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
of 
course 
form 
the 
Commission’s point of view further conclusions can be 
drawn Chair which will be addressed in due course, to the 
extent that and on the basis that this evidence is accepted, 
if it is accepted in due course. 
 
11.3 reads: 
“The 
projects 
undertaken 
if 
they 
are 
indeed 
authentic raise serious concerns as to how and to 
what extent the Constitution was undermined.   Yet 
irrespective 
of 
whether 
these 
projects 
were 
10 
authentic and implemented their very existence and 
stated aims are incompatible with the Intelligence 
Mandate of the SSA.  The use of covert operational 
structures to conceal unlawful activity and bypass 
accountability enabled the greater structure with the 
least scrutiny.” 
Do you associate yourselves with those comments, or 
yourself with those comments? 
MS K:   Yes I do Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And of course we have dealt with 
20 
the issue of further investigations and what would be 
required 
to 
obtain 
a 
complete 
picture 
of 
what 
was 
authorised, what was financed and what was finally 
executed by way of project, and we don’t need to repeat 
that so if we could go to the final conclusion in 11.4, this is 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 151 of 155 
 
an observation that the investigation team makes that the 
Chair may or may not take into account, but it is offered I 
take it in the spirit of what you have come to learn in the 
course of your investigation.   It reads: 
“It is imperative that Law Enforcement Agencies 
pursue the case opened by the SSA in April 2019 
and that the recovery of cash and assets belonging 
the State be prioritised.” 
There has been evidence, and there will be further 
evidence Ms K about the compilation of information and its 
10 
transfer to law enforcement agencies in 2019 already.  Do 
you confirm that?   
MS K:   Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“...[Indistinct] 
oversight 
of 
the 
intelligence 
the 
community ...” 
the paragraph continues: 
“...is required through the combined assurance of 
the Ministry, the Joint Standing Committee on 
Intelligence, the Office of the Inspector General of 
20 
Intelligence and the Auditor General of South 
Africa.” 
I think that is self-explanatory, the Inspector General of 
Intelligence is also expected to give evidence Chair. 
 
And then finally: 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 152 of 155 
 
“the 
integrity 
of 
the 
SSA’s 
mandate 
must 
be 
protected from politicisation so that the pursuit of 
national security reflects the resolve of all South 
Africans as individuals and as a nation to live as 
equals to live and harmony to be free from free and 
want and to seek a better life.” 
All presumably the goals that the SSA should pursue, do 
you agree with those sentiments? 
MS K:   I do Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair that is the evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you very much Ms K for 
availing yourself to come and assist the Commission, 
particularly in the light of the unexpected unavailability of 
Mr Y, but I understand that you either will or maybe come 
back to the Commission in regard to other evidence that I 
will be told once if you will come back, but from what Mr 
Pretorius said it looks like at least there may be a 
possibility of you coming back to deal with other matters. 
 
Thank you very much for making yourself available. 
MS K:   Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   I could not hear you, I could not hear you yes, I 
heard that there is a possibility that I may have to come 
back and that is where it is up to – beyond that I did not 
hear anything. 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 153 of 155 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think somebody is sabotaging the Chair 
today.   No I was saying Ms K from what Mr Pretorius has 
said I understand that there is a possibility that you may 
come back to deal with other matters of which you have 
personal knowledge but whether that will  happen or that 
will not happen I will be told in due course, but thank you 
very much for making yourself available.  
 
I will now excuse you. 
MS K:   Thanks so much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   Mr Pretorius? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair we did have one witness 
lined up who recently and unexpectedly became available.  
We had a further witness lined up ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius, are you still 
there Ms K?  She has gone, okay. 
MS K:   I am here.  I am here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no I just want to emphasize the 
Commission’s 
appreciation 
of 
your 
making 
yourself 
available in the circumstances in which you made yourself 
available.  We appreciate it very much. 
20 
MS K:   I appreciate the opportunity Chair, although the 
circumstances are actually painful to me in relation to Mr 
Y, but I just want to say to the Commission and to make 
sure that it is recorded, that the majority of officials that 
are within the SSA are courteous, are qualified and are 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 154 of 155 
 
committed and all they want to do is work and serve the 
constitution, so in no way should I request this evidence 
should not in any way be used to paint everybody with the 
same brush, because I do think that – it is just that they 
have not had the opportunity to express themselves or they 
are not as – I don’t know, maybe stupid like me to just 
come up and say the things that I have revealed, but I do 
think that we have to acknowledge that they are committed 
and we hope that we can rebuild our organisation just for 
the sake of our country. 
10 
 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you very much Ms K, we really 
appreciate what you have said.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Noted, and thank you Ms K from 
the Legal Team and the Investigators.   
MS K:  Thank you Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were saying something and then I 
interrupted you Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think about another witness. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second witness available will 
give information of a nature that I need to consider 
carefully before calling him as a witness so I would ask 
that we adjourn now.  The further evidence to be given 
apart from that of the expected General of Intelligence 
29 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 334 
 
Page 155 of 155 
 
should be able to be condensed within reasonable limits.  
It is largely corroborative although there is some new 
evidence because it has become apparent that there are 
gaps that need to be filled from the statement of Mr Y and 
that will be dealt with in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.   So we will try and 
find space even if we use evening sessions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To try and complete or hear the evidence 
of those who we have not heard as yet.  Thank you very 
10 
much.  We are going to adjourn for the day, for the benefit 
of the public next week the Commission will hear evidence 
relating to Parliamentary oversights. 
 
We adjourn.
