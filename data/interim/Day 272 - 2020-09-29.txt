PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 28 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair you will recall that when 
we were dealing with the Free State Asbestos Project Mr 
Mokhesi did not complete his evidence and he agreed to 
come back and he is here today to complete his evidence.  
He is represented by Advocate Mpofu who wishes to 
10 
address you briefly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MPOFU:  Chair I am going to be a few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  I have a three page document with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  I beg your leave to hand up.  I have given a 
copy to Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  Chair this is really just to put a few matters 
20 
in perspective particularly because the – the coverage of 
what happened last time was a bit worrying so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 4 of 244 
 
ADV MPOFU:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember what it was. 
ADV MPOFU:  Yes, no and it is the usual – we do not 
blame the media we – some of these things maybe 
technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
MPOFU: 
 
But 
Chair 
what 
we 
want 
to 
put 
in 
perspective is simply this that – of what happened the last 
time we were here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV MPOFU:  Which is that the – we had moved as the 
Chair 
knows 
a 
postponement 
application 
premised 
principally on two grounds.  One was the right to silence 
and the other one was the right to – for the privilege 
against self-incrimination.   
 
Now we say that during the course of the legal 
argument the am - interactions with the Chair it became 
clear and was considered on behalf of Mr Mokhesi that the 
right to remain silent was not applicable in the present 
circumstances.   
20 
 
Do you remember the Chair pointed out for example 
that he had already done two – two statements? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  And Mr Pretorius did not press the right to 
silent issue.  And then it was also considered as we read it 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 5 of 244 
 
on behalf of the commission that his right to object to 
specific questions on the grounds of the protection against 
self-incrimination remained intact and was exercisable. 
 
Now we – in the circumstances – in fact we did not 
persist with the postponement application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  Because it was agreed that there would be 
those parameters and we say that and this is where maybe 
the 
misunderstanding 
came 
because 
the 
Chair 
nevertheless found it necessary to formally dismiss the 
10 
postponement application and to state the reasons for that 
ruling would be for – this is number 3.  And the reasons for 
that ruling would be formalised upon request and we say in 
our view that ruling was unnecessary although it was not 
inappropriate 
because 
obviously 
for 
formalities 
sake 
something had to happen there. 
 
And – but the order – the order – I do not know if it 
is – if the commission has the same transcript as we have 
but effectively…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not looked at… 
20 
ADV MPOFU:  You have not looked at it – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any transcripts ja. 
ADV MPOFU:  I will just read the – the relevant portion is 
page 49 Chair where – and this is where I wanted to 
address the Chair.  Because the Chair basically gave three 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 6 of 244 
 
orders; let me put it that way. And I am reading now it 
says: 
1. “Chairperson thank you Mr Mpofu” 
And then it says: 
“The application for postponement for the 
hearing 
of 
Mr 
Mokhesi’s 
evidence 
is 
dismissed which is not [00:05:13].” 
So that is number 1.   
a. “Reasons can be given in due course 
if they are requested.” 
10 
And I want to say on the record that there will – we will not 
request any reasons because the reasons would be just 
one sentence that there was no longer an application for a 
postponement.  But here the important part. 
b.  “This is what the Chair said.  Mr 
Mokhesi 
will 
need 
to 
take 
the 
witness stand but he will be able to 
exercise his right with regard to 
specific questions not to incriminate 
himself.  His right to refuse to 
20 
answer certain questions.  Okay 
thank you.” 
And that is really is – was then the outstanding matter.  
Now in our view – well as Mr Pretorius has just indicated 
he then went on and then he needed another two hours or 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 7 of 244 
 
so and the Chair gave an extra hour.  I am glad to commit 
Mr Pretorius that today he has promised me that he will not 
go beyond one hour otherwise he will – I will object on that 
basis alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if he – if he goes beyond one hour 
he will blame questions from the Chair. 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you Chair that is why I am selling him 
out here.  Then Chair on a more serious note we wanted to 
place on record that Mr Mokhesi’s – it has come to his 
attention 
that 
the 
Hawks 
have 
been 
asking 
certain 
10 
questions from people at his workplace and I want to go 
through them – they are in paragraph 7 of the – of the 
note.   
But our concern is simply that the – the – these 
questions seem to be largely based on the evidence that 
he gave here which is one of the things we feared and we 
are really placing that on record just to reinforce the – our 
fears about self-incrimination.   
But for the rest Chair we – we are really here for 
basically to police Mr Pretorius.  If he asks any questions 
20 
that goes beyond the – the agreed parameters but which 
we do not expect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  Then we will object otherwise it should go 
quite quickly Chair. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 8 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think Mr Mpofu last time I think I 
placed on record and if I did not I would do so now. 
ADV MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I – my impression was that there 
was a lot of cooperation from both your side, Mr Mokhesi’s 
side and… 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To try and answer as many questions as 
possible.  I think we made a lot progress. 
ADV MPOFU:  We did. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I recall correctly and I may be wrong 
there was only one question that he had difficulty with. 
ADV MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was a lot of cooperation. 
ADV MPOFU:  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and I think well that needs to be 
said. 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU:  I appreciate that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU:  Then Chair just again this is completely 
unnecessary but just for the record one of the issues I was 
going to address was we had received a Rule 3.3 Notice in 
respect of the evidence of a Mr Koloi who was supposedly 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 9 of 244 
 
going to implicate Mr Mokhesi.  Mr Pretorius has now 
assured me that that gentleman is no longer going to be 
called. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:  That issue I do not need to address that 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MPOFU:  Thank you very much Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Mpofu.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair there is not much 
that I should add save to say and to make it clear that 
whilst 
a 
witness 
has 
protection 
in 
relation 
to 
self-
incriminating questions there is nothing in the law or 
regulations either statutory or common law that prevents 
the Law Enforcement Agencies of investigating in relation 
to other persons the answers given.  And that evidence 
may be used against other persons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Alright thank you.  I think we must 
20 
do the oath again or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MOKHESI:  Nthimotse Mokhesi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 10 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR MOKHESI:  So help me God. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning again Mr Mokhesi.   
10 
MR MOKHESI:  Moring Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you please look at Bundle 
FS8.  And if you would go to page 180 please.  You will 
recall. 
MR MOKHESI:  180? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  180. 
MR MOKHESI:  180. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Remember the black numbers on 
the left hand side please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am still waiting for mine Mr Pretorius 
20 
they had put here another one.  Thank you.  I have got it. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We concluded your evidence on the 
last occasion in relation to the Asbestos Project Mr 
Mokhesi by referring to the letter on the previous page 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 11 of 244 
 
addressed by yourself dated 11 August 2014 to Mr Sodi the 
CEO of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if you look at the subject line 
your letter says to him that this letter concerns the 
appointment of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited for the 
Asbestos Eradication Program in the Free State Province. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You then referred to that letter in 
your reply and that reply appears – I am sorry that is your 
10 
letter to him.  The reply comes from Mr Sodi CEO 
Blackhead Consulting and that appears at page 180. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is a letter addressed by Mr 
Sodi to yourself Department of Human Settlements Free 
State.  It is dated the following day 12 August 2014. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is on the letterhead of Blackhead 
Consulting and Diamond Hill Trading 71. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the subject line is Appointment 
of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited JV for the Asbestos 
Eradication Program in the Free State Province.  And the 
first paragraph reads: 
“We acknowledge receipt of your fax dated 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 12 of 244 
 
11 August 2014 in which you request our 
written response regarding the appointment 
of 
Blackhead 
Consulting 
Pty 
for 
the 
Asbestos 
Eradication 
Program 
in 
your 
Province.” 
You will notice that Mr Sodi pertinently refers to your letter 
of 11 August 2014 which deals with the appointment of 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited we can read in.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He then says to you: 
10 
“We would like to confirm the following that 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited JV is 
willing 
and 
committed 
to 
perform 
the 
required work for the Department of Human 
Settlements in the Free State. 
2. 
That 
the 
participation 
of 
Blackhead 
Consulting 
Pty 
Limited 
JV 
shall 
not 
negatively 
impact 
on 
its 
performance 
towards 
the 
Gauteng 
Provincial 
Government.” 
20 
We know of course the JV had nothing to do with 
the Gauteng Provincial Government but I just wanted to 
point out that this appears to be the first mention in the 
string of correspondence that we have been dealing with of 
the Joint Venture.  Do you see that? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 13 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The identity of the Joint Venture 
inserts itself into the string of correspondence regarding 
the appointment ultimately of the JV at this stage for the 
first time.  Before this it has been Blackhead only after this 
it is the JV, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And as recently as the previous day 
the 11 August 2014 you were speaking of Blackhead 
Consulting Pty Limited. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you notice the change? 
MR MOKHESI:  Well I – I did not.  When I look at I also 
have indeed looked at the correspondence throughout and 
just to try and find out why it did not change – why all of a 
sudden you know particularly from this particular did – why 
it changed.  I then noticed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember to look this side. 
MR MOKHESI:  Oh sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokhesi. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:  Sorry Chair my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:  I do not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just start your answer afresh. 
MR MOKHESI:  Okay.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 14 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please. 
MR MOKHESI:  I am saying as Mr Pretorius has indicated 
all the letters and the correspondence to different people 
and so on has always been Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Limited.  Not at any stage has there been mention of AE.  
So I went back and try and find out how did it come about.  
Now up around about that particular time whether it was 
the ten – there is a document which has been signed 
between the parties which I was not part of which has been 
signed around that particular time between Mr Mpambani 
10 
and the fact that  and Mr Blackhead and Diamond Hill in 
their respective capacity around the issues of JV.   
But then it – and if you notice that subsequent to 
that then came this issue of JV – JV and so on.  But suffice 
to say on – on my side I had somehow assumed that 
Diamond Hill must have been part of the Gauteng Project 
which turns out that – that was not the case at a later 
stage. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it seems that the letter in its 
detail and even the letterhead was not properly had regard 
20 
to because I think you fairly conceded elsewhere in your 
statement that things might have been different had you 
noticed the intervention of the Joint Venture at this stage. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I do not want to go there right 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 15 of 244 
 
now.  Just to say that had those responsible and it is not 
necessary at the moment to point fingers at any particular 
person but to the Department of Human Settlements rather 
and its Procurement Process.   
Had the introduction of the partner 50% partner 
being noticed the question might have been asked well why 
are you introducing partner to get 50% of the payments 
that are going to be made by the Province and is this not 
inflating the price unnecessarily?  It seems to me that 
enquiry was not made. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:  No it was not.  No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And had it been made it would have 
been discovered that let alone Blackhead’s performance 
Diamond Hill Trading were doing nothing of note to warrant 
the payment of R125 million.  That enquiry was not made. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes I think also my earlier statement Mr 
Pretorius where I had indicated you know there was 
fundamental 
issues 
that 
was 
addressed 
of 
getting 
documents because it was only through that process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your voice Mr Mokhesi. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:  Sorry.  I am saying there is a fundamental 
issues that never happened.  I think earlier on I indicated 
that there were three issues that could have assisted here. 
 
The first and the most fundamental one despite the 
fact that the – you know Treasury Regulations does not 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 16 of 244 
 
require of that but there is a underlying particularly on the 
Risk Management to say if the procurement or the Supply 
Chain had taken the trouble of getting documents a lot of 
issues could have been picked up including what Mr 
Pretorius is raising right now.   
So – because that did not happen and those issues 
were not picked up so this is what I am trying to indicate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would you not accept that quite apart 
from any obligation that officials dealing with Supply Chain 
Management in the Department may have had to apply 
10 
their minds to that issue that you as the Head of the 
Department had an obligation to apply your mind to such 
an issue and to satisfy yourself that what was being done 
was in line with the law?  Would you not accept that as the 
HOD you had that obligation as well? 
MR MOKHESI:  Ja Chair how far – maybe I should have 
gone further.  You know because as I have indicated earlier 
you know the Supply Chain practitioners of government are 
trained.  They attend workshops on almost on a monthly 
basis.  The practice knows that come from Treasury goes 
20 
to them.  They advise in our management meeting about 
the new issues and what is happening.  Now- now and here 
I 
am 
indicating 
about 
an 
individual 
who 
also 
has 
experience who has worked in that environment over time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 17 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:  Now – and one tends to you know to trust 
because I know this individual.  I have known him for quite 
some time even when the – when he started.  So one tends 
sometimes to trust.  You know as I have indicated you 
sometimes pick up these particular issues when there is a 
problem already like we are facing right now.  So I accept 
perhaps maybe I should have done more but it was a level 
of trust that I had had on the individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Mokhesi arising out of that 
10 
question and answer it may be apposite to deal with the 
issue now rather than later as I intended to do and that is 
the question of accountability.   
We have heard evidence in this Asbestos matter 
and in the housing matter and in other matters too and the 
commission is restricted in its capacity to investigate 
matters such as this which are voluminous.  What has 
become clear however is that the question of accountability 
comes to the fore again and again and again?   
The senior officials lay blame on the junior officials.  
20 
The junior officials say we were following orders and 
ultimately nobody is on the evidence accountable for what 
happened.   
Surely there must be a point at which someone 
says, I am accountable and I am responsible and I must 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 18 of 244 
 
take the consequences.  What do you say to that? 
MR MOKHESI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is a general comment I express. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes.  You know the fact that I am here I am 
taking accountability and you know and indeed there are 
consequences for me as we speak right now.  I am not – I 
am not abdicating on my accountability.   
I might not have been responsible but I am still 
accountable because those officials who are below me 
report – report – ag sorry, sorry – report to me.  So in 
10 
terms of – of accountability I am not abdicating from that 
Chair if I may put that on record.   
I am taking accountability for what has happened 
and also looking at hindsight in terms of what I should 
have done you know and so on and what lessons can I – 
can I take from there.  You know this particular issue is 
happening right at the end of my career.  You know it is not 
good for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see that is quite important.  I 
hope that before the end of the work of this commission I 
20 
am going to see more and more leaders who whether it is 
in public service or political leaders who are going to say, I 
have been listening to the evidence – I have been watching 
and listening to the evidence being led in the commission 
on a number of things.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 19 of 244 
 
I have taken trouble to look at this and that and 
that.  I think that – and I have done introspection on myself 
because I was – I had a role to play.  I was in charge.  I 
was part of the collective that was in charge and I am here 
to say, I take responsibility; we fell short; I fell short.  
Others might not want to take responsibility but I am taking 
responsibility and I am saying we should have done this.  
We should have done this.   
We should have done that and we did not do it and 
we had no – we have no good reason why we did not do it.  
10 
We take full responsibility; we are taking the lessons going 
forward we want to make sure this thing does not happen 
again.  So I am hoping that I will – I will hear some people 
within our country who will be able to say, a lot of things 
went wrong and who will stop pushing blame to other 
people or at least if they do they will be able to say I am 
also to blame in regard to this; in regard to that; in regard 
to that and I am able to say that in front of the nation but 
because I am able to do that I am in a better position to 
contribute to a solution to say, what needs to be done in 
20 
order for this not to happen again?   
Because if people just deny and do not take 
responsibility you cannot trust them to make a positive 
contribution to what the solution should be because they 
deny that there is a problem. Or they deny that they have a 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 20 of 244 
 
role to play in the problem.   
MR MOKHESI:  Ja Chair I have certainly made an 
introspection as well myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:  You know there is a level of accountability 
in this whole thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOKHESI:  Where I said I could have done – there are 
certain things that I could have done and I did not do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:  That I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:  You know even in an accident you know – 
you know they say both of you – there is a level of 
responsibility for that particular accident.  You might – you 
might say that I was right but you probably if you have 
done something else you could have avoided.  So I am not 
completely saying and standing aside and saying no, no, 
no it is not me it is somebody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:  But I am stating the facts as they are in 
terms of what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:  And I have never at any point in time 
denied that that which was happening was irregular.  I 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 21 of 244 
 
have not done – I have not denied or tried to defend it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay no thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just a few more pieces of 
correspondence Mr Mokhesi.  Over the page at page 181 of 
FS8 is a letter from Mr Thabane Zulu.  We know that he 
was the Director General of the National Department of 
Human Settlements addressed to yourself.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This deals with the appointment of 
10 
a professional resource team to a departmental panel. 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So what Mr Zulu is thinking about 
we know that he has to deal with the funding issue in due 
course.  But what he is under the impression is happening is 
that there is an appointment to a panel for a database which 
is talked about later.  And he is also speaking about 
Blackhead, not the Joint Venture.   
 
So he is somehow being informed or drawn conclusions, 
at least two of which are quite incorrect.  We know his 
20 
participation later is quite important.  Do you have any 
comment? 
MR MOKHESI:   On the letter of Mr Zulu to myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  He writes to you and he says on the 
13t h of August.  That is a day after you told the Joint Venture 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 22 of 244 
 
is the party responsible.  And the fact that the Joint Venture 
is being appointed itself, not as a part of a panel but is being 
appointed to do the work.  Do you see that? 
MR MOKHESI:   Can you read me a specific paragraph, Mr 
Pretorius.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, just look at the heading. 
MR MOKHESI:   The heading?  Oh, okay.  Appointment of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Appointment 
of 
provincial 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...professional resource team to a 
departmental panel. 
MR MOKHESI:   Oh, okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   So that is what you want me to comment 
on? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Mr Zulu is under the 
impression that what he is dealing with here and what he will 
have to deal with later on when he transfers funds is the 
20 
appointment to a departmental panel.  You will recall earlier 
correspondence. 
MR MOKHESI:   Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not a single appointment of 
...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 23 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...a Joint Venture or even Blackhead. 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja.  I think what became clearer later is that 
you cannot appoint on a panel.  There must have been an 
existing contract which was not there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I think Mr Zulu himself 
conceded that. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But was it not important to correct 
Mr Zulu to say, firstly:  Look, we are appointing or... yes, we 
10 
are going to appoint a Joint Venture, firstly, as the sole 
appointee and we are not dealing with the panel.  Was it not 
important to clarify it for him? 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, Mr Pretorius again, I do not want to be 
seen as trying to... you know, I think the Chair has 
articulated this issue of taking accountability.  Yes, I agree.  
Okay, let me put it that way to say yes, it was important.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And then Mr Mokhesi, on the 
11t h of September 2014, you addressed a letter to the Free 
State Provincial Treasury which appears at FS8-185. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:   185? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Firstly, now suddenly you are talking 
of the JV.  Do you see that? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 24 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what you are also saying here is, 
you are talking about the removal of asbestos or the 
eradication of asbestos.  So what you are saying now to your 
Provincial Treasury who must sign the checks is that:   
“We are appointing a Joint Venture to identify and 
remove asbestos.”   
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that also is not correct.  They 
10 
were not being appointed to remove and they were being 
appointed to remove.  But we know the factors that they did 
not remove, nor were they asked to remove. 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, they would have been appointed to... I 
think there were two phases for that.  Phase 1 would have 
been the audit and the other phase would have been the 
removal.  The removal did not happen as we know.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the correspondence and the letter of 
appointment, I think, as well as the agreement may be clear 
that there were two, I think, tasks.  One of which was the 
20 
actual removal of asbestos. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, not only did they not 
remove asbestos, they were not qualified to remove it but 
that is separate from what they were appointed to do. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 25 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were appointed to do both. 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, this particular letter, why it went to 
Treasury, right?  Because in... normally, if you are uncertain 
about a particular thing, that is what we normally do.  I do 
not have to ask Treasury but sometimes you do so just to get 
certain assurance.   
 
Now I think perhaps this was a copy.  There might have 
10 
been a copy.  There might have been another letter which... 
where the head of Treasury.   
 
I think he wrote on... he wrote notes on the same letter 
and returned it to me.  I think the Commission has it that 
letter where that simply... where he simply said:  You are 
allowed but ensure that the processes are followed.   
 
And that basically is what it was.  And which letter then I 
gave to supply chain to indicate that.  You know, my idea of 
writing... the idea of writing to Treasury actually came from 
me.   
20 
 
To say:  Okay, let us source... let us hear what Treasury 
has to say about this particular thing.  And that was the only 
response.  Ensure that the processes are followed.  I did not 
have to do that but actually it was necessary for me to do 
that which is the letter that I gave with those notes to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 26 of 244 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Supply chain. 
MR MOKHESI:   ...supply Chain. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the letter that ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   It is the same letter, I think. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I think you may be referring to page 
184.  Just page back one page.  You will see, it is the same 
letter but it has a handwritten note apparently from Treasury. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Where it says: 
10 
“The accounting officer has the power to approve 
such an arrangement, provided the supply chain 
management processes has been duly followed and 
legislation has been complied with.” 
MR MOKHESI:   Oh, is the same letter? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So apart from examining the 
situation, Treasury just knocked the ball back into your 
quart.   
MR MOKHESI:   Well, once again.  And you know, Treasury 
has got a unit that is... I will call that unit, is a Consulting 
20 
Unit per se, to advise all the departments about various 
other issues.  And Supply Chain practitioners, throughout the 
province from all the departments, from time-to-time, they 
consult with... and that is what I expected.  That there will be 
a further consultation to do exactly that. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 27 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To be fair to you Mr Mokhesi.  You 
raise the issues, you ask for advice and you get a scribbled 
note in return.  That is not good enough, surely, for Treasury 
who is in a position to advice and should know not to, at 
least, enter the... or some advice at least.   
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   All they say to you is:  We can do it.  
Just make sure you follow the law.  I mean ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Documents were sent ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...you asked them...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Documents were sent ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...what is the law? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, and documents were sent to them as 
well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have thought that after you read 
that note from them which says in effect that you can do 
what you were proposing to do provided, that is what they 
say, provided that the accounting officer has satisfied 
himself or herself that the SEM processes were duly followed 
20 
and they comply with legislation.   
 
I would have thought that with that kind of warning, to 
say, just remember, you must be satisfied as the accounting 
officer.   
 
That 
you 
would have said to your Supply 
Chain 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 28 of 244 
 
Management team:  You see this note from Treasury.  You 
must give me a memo that specifies exactly what the law 
says we should do and you must tell me how we have 
complied.   
 
Do you think I am expecting too much from you 
MR MOKHESI:   Not really, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOKHESI:   When this response came, also taking into 
consideration that I had at all material times had a 
discussion with the head of Supply Chain. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOKHESI:   Also with this particular letter.  As you can 
see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   The letter was offered by him after I 
indicated...  Well, I know we are not supposed to consult 
Treasury.  You have to do it.  But let us, you know, just for 
completeness, let us hear what they say around this 
particular... same whatever documents.   
 
All the documents that are there and so on.  Let them... 
20 
and this is what we received as a response.  And they simply 
said:  Okay, this is their response.  Just ensure that we, you 
know, the process is above board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MOKHESI:   Basically. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 29 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOKHESI:   And that is basically what... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On page 188 of FS8 Mr Mokhesi is 
the so-called appointment letter dated 1 October 2014.  It is 
addressed from... or it is addressed by you to the Chief 
Executive Officer, Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd JV.  Do 
you see that? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second paragraph reads: 
10 
“The 
department 
wishes 
to 
advise 
that 
your 
company has been exclusively appointed for the 
audit and the assessment of asbestos handling of 
hazardous 
material, 
removal 
and 
disposal 
of 
asbestos contaminated rubble and...” 
 
I am not sure what those next two words are. 
“...with SABS approved materials in the Free State 
Province.” 
 
Two pointed arise at this stage.  You appoint the JV, the 
Joint Venture and not Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd.  And 
20 
the second is the appointment includes the removal and 
disposal of asbestos contaminated rubble. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, that is... yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I just suggest that the reason 
why the JV was only introduced late in the day, expressly 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 30 of 244 
 
your letters referred to Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited 
and expressly incorporate in later correspondence the JV is 
because have the JV been introduced upfront, there would 
be no question of a transfer of a contract from Gauteng to 
the Free State.    
MR MOKHESI:   I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you agree? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Service Level Agreement which 
we have dealt with briefly in your evidence but also in the 
10 
evidence of other witnesses, appears at page 189 which 
makes it clear that the agreement between the department 
and the Joint Venture as the service provider, that appears 
in paragraph 1.1, is to carry out a project.   
 
And the project is to find as the appointment of the 
service provider, that is the Joint Venture, to assess audit, 
houses 
roofed 
using 
asbestos 
material, 
handling 
and 
disposal of asbestos sheets to an approved designated 
disposal site.   
 
That concept is repeated in paragraph 2 under Working 
20 
Relationships.  That was the appointment to both identify 
asbestos and to remove it.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Now 
we 
have 
dealt 
with 
correspondence today but when you last appeared before the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 31 of 244 
 
Commission Mr Mokhesi, a number of other items of 
correspondence were dealt with, including correspondence 
involving Ms Diedericks from the Gauteng Department of 
Human Settlements.  Do you recall that? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I just want to summarise, if I may, 
the confusion or the deliberate concealment of facts and how 
they played out in this correspondence.  The first point is 
that in correspondence that you have referred to in your last 
appearance, you sought the extension of the National Annual 
10 
Contract 
and 
Mr 
Zulu 
cooperated. 
 
That 
was 
in 
correspondence to National Department.  
MR MOKHESI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Later on, you sought to extend to 
Gauteng contract.   
MR MOKHESI:   Correct, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms Diedericks sought to extent the 
panel, not an individual appointment.  Do you recall that? 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, I seem to recall that.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms Diedericks and Mr Zulu, at least 
20 
up to a point, yourself talked about Blackhead.  The 
appointment lead to appoints the Joint Venture.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have dealt with this. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, we have dealt with it. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 32 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we know that this is not a panel 
appointment.  It is the sole appointment of a joint venture.  
Not Blackhead.  Not a panel arrangement.  And we also know 
that it is not in accordance with the Gauteng Terms and 
Conditions, especially price. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  You to deal with another 
topic that appears in correspondence.  If you go to page 190, 
please.  I just referred you to the Service Level Agreement 
entered into between the department on the one hand and 
10 
the Joint Venture on the other.  The SLA refers to removal... 
well, identification and removal and disposal.  We know that. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I think at some stage you called your 
legal department to account for not making it clear what the 
appointment actually should have been forth.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That appears in the transcript of 
your interview at Bundle FS6-442 to 443.  Your legal 
department drafted this.  Correct? 
20 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You need some file?  I think, if you need 
some file Mr Mokhesi, they can assist you.  I think he wants 
to look at something. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  If you want to see it 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 33 of 244 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   FS... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You want to see it? 
MR MOKHESI:   Oh, okay.  Now if...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I mean ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   I thought ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...I think you accept that we told 
your legal department to draft this. 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this is what they gave. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps it should have just 
restricted the appointment to what they were actually 
appointed to do and that is to identify the asbestos houses. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what is important is, is what 
follows.  At FS8, page 234 appears the contents of the letter 
that begins at page 232 and I would like to drawn your 
attention to the transcript of 234.   
20 
MR MOKHESI:   232 or 234? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, do you have... or perhaps, just 
go to page 232. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 332? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   232 Chair. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 34 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   232? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes of FS8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now we know Mr Mokhesi that Mr 
Zulu played a role in the finalisation of the contractual 
arrangements and in particular on the making available of 
funds to allow it to happen.  We know that.  That evidence 
has been given. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By yourself, especially. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In order for the funds to be made 
available, they had to be transferred from the budget from 
another province to the Free State. 
MR MOKHESI:   H’m.  Not... no, not in that manner. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How did it have to happen? 
MR MOKHESI:   Every year, right, after a couple of months 
there is an opportunity or there is... you are given an 
opportunity 
to 
revise 
your 
business 
plan 
particularly 
specific... in respect of specific ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Face right. 
MR MOKHESI:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, face... [laughing] 
MR MOKHESI:   Specifically, in respect of projects because 
we... you run to pay multitude of projects at the same time.  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 35 of 244 
 
And then you always have this specific or projects that will 
not make it in terms of the expenditure throughout the year.   
 
So normally, you are allowed to revise your business 
plan and that is how it happened.  It is not about... it is 
about the revision of the business plan, reprioritising and 
indicating what is really and what can we perform at a 
particular point in time.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   So ordinarily, the DG will then approve that 
reprioritisation.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But where would the money come 
from? 
MR MOKHESI:   Within the very same budget that... you can 
have sometime the budget.  For example, which is not 
performing for a variety of reasons.  It could be for a variety 
of reasons that the project is not performing.   
 
Procurement 
issues 
and 
sometimes 
that 
particular 
project is stopped because we operate within communities 
and there might be problems.   
 
Sometimes this particular problem might also be relating 
20 
to just in capacity of some of the contractors to simply 
perform. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or it might be temporarily stopped 
because of legal challenges? 
MR MOKHESI:   It might be... yes, correct. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 36 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOKHESI:   You know, it could be a variety of factors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOKHESI:   So there is always, particularly within the 
sector, there is also that particular problem where we have 
every... where you have to revisited the business plan. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you would have a business plan 
which would involve the allocation of funds to various 
projects.  A revised business plan would allow the movement 
of funds allocating to ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Allocating to be ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...from one project to another. 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or from one province to another 
province. 
MR MOKHESI:   To another.  Correct.  That is also an option. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So let us not spend too 
much time on that issue.  We know, to put it at its lowest, 
that in order for money to be made available for the 
Asbestos Project, it would have to be taken from somewhere 
20 
else, another project or another province. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in order for that to happen, the 
Director General would have to see a revised business plan. 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 37 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And he would have to persuaded that 
it was in order to do so.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   He will have to approve it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this letter at 232 of FS8, is the 
motivation addressed to Mr Zulu of the National Department 
by yourself on the 27t h of November 2014. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that is, obviously, after the 
appointment but that is another issue.  The appointment took 
place on the 1s t of October.  This motivation for a revised 
10 
business plan was the 27t h of November.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now what Mr Zulu was told.  
Remember, this is a letter intended to persuade Mr Zulu to 
make funds available, either from another project or from 
another province.  We understand that.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On page 234, you tell Mr Zulu: 
“The object of the project is two-fold.   
- Quantify audit and assess the number of houses 
20 
roofed with asbestos sheets. 
- Remove and dispose asbestos to an approved 
and registered disposal site.” 
 
That is what you tell him, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct.  Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 38 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You go on to say: 
“The 
rate 
will 
be 
to 
conduct 
door-to-door 
assessment at R 850,00 per house excluding VAT.” 
 
The letter continues: 
“All asbestos will be removed and disposed of as 
laid out in the Occupational Health and Safety Act 
and Regulations 85 of 1993.” 
 
What follows is important.  It says: 
“The above unit rate includes the following.” 
 
And then various items are listed but over the page, the 
10 
last three bullets read: 
“- Transport 
of 
the 
asbestos 
to 
a 
registered 
disposal site. 
- Disposal cost of the asbestos. 
- All relevant paperwork pertaining to health and 
safety regulations.” 
 
Now 
this 
is 
an 
inference 
that 
can 
be 
drawn 
in 
submissions but that list of tasks looks remarkable like what 
the Gauteng Project put up but I am not going to go down 
that route for the moment.   
20 
 
All I want to point out to you is that Mr Zulu was told 
when he had to consider making funds available that the 
R 850,00 per house would include the transport of asbestos 
to a registered disposal site and the disposal cost of the 
asbestos.  Correct? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 39 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which is wrong.  It is incorrect.  It 
did not. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, what is... I agree.  What is missing 
here in this particular... in this letter.  Because it is actually 
impossible to do that at R 850,00 per unit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is impossible...? 
MR MOKHESI:   Sorry.  It is not possible to do all that at 
R 850,00 per unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   So what should have, the letter should have 
included.  It should have included, which is also part that 
they care of the... because if the removal was also 
replaced(?), the 32, I think which was mentioned in the 
proposal, the 32 which was the Phase 2 part of it.  Because 
you... at R 850,00 per unit, it is just not possible.   
 
It actually was meant to refer to the Phase 1 of actually 
taking stock of what is there, what... you know, that was 
basically.  I consider what should have been included, there 
should have been a... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mokhesi, that is very strange to me.  
To say now that the price that you specified as the 
department in the letter of appointment for a job that 
constitutes of two tasks to have done ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 40 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was actually not the correct price.  And I 
guess... I mean, there are a number of... I think there are a 
number of letters, I think, that the price would also have 
been in the Service Level Agreement, I would imagine.  Or 
not?  I have not checked now.   
MR MOKHESI:   It will be on the ITW. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in the ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Instruction to performing in the service 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In the service but ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOKHESI:   ...that gives effect for the work to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
but 
how 
do 
you 
say 
in 
correspondence as a department, the price for doing A and B 
is R 850,00 per house, when actually R 850,00 per house is 
the price for A only?  How does that happen?   
MR MOKHESI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, if you can do that, it seems to me 
you are capable of actually saying the service provider for 
one of the two tasks.  In other words, if the first task for 
audit, identifying and assessing was 850 per house and the 
20 
second task of removal, let us assume for argument’s sake 
that it was also 850 per house which means what, 1.7 per 
house, that is the whole job, okay?  So it means 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   I did not get that, sir. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 41 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am saying let us say for 
argument’s sake, you know that the first task that you 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   Call it an assessment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you gave to the joint venture was to 
quantify, audit and assess the number of houses, roof 
being asbestos sheets. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the first task. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The second one is remove and dispose 
asbestos to an approved and accredited disposal site.  
Now what you have just told me is that the price of 850 per 
house was only for quantifying, auditing and assessing the 
number of houses roof with asbestos sheets, it was not – it 
did not include to remove and dispose asbestos to an 
approved and accredited disposal site, right? 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I am saying that that is – I find that 
quite strange because it means that if you can say 850 is 
20 
the price for both when it is actually price for one, it means 
you could actually take the price for both – let us say here 
for argument’s sake 1.7 per house and say it is for one of 
the two tasks.  It just seems to be – so it seems to be 
gross negligence to say the least.  You understand what I 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 42 of 244 
 
mean?  How does such a mistake happen and to make it 
worse, the service provider does not point out that no, no, 
no, no, no, Mr Department, you have got it wrong, 850 is 
only for the first task, it does not include the second task.  
So everybody in terms of paper accepts that 850 per house 
is for both tasks but you are saying no, actually it was for 
the first task. 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay, the original proposition or proposal, 
you find it in that particular manner.  In fact, the original 
proposal was say – I think it was saying 1.7, if I remember.  
10 
I am just speaking – 1.7, but was reduced to 850, that 
involved assessment, call it assessment and so on.  In 
Gauteng we know that it was 650 and that was also the 
first part of the problem in terms of why this contract was 
[indistinct – dropping voice] and the second of the proposal 
indicates the 32 which will involve all these other issues. 
 
Now at 32, I think 32 000 per unit which will also 
involve – because if you remove you also have to replace 
so it would not have been possible for 850.  I hear what 
you are saying, Chair, in terms of material omission from 
20 
what the proposal was originally.  However, this would 
have been – if, for example, everything was – there was no 
problem in terms of the appointment and so on and will 
have continued into the second phase, this would have 
been corrected. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 43 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move onto another topic if 
we may, Mr Mokhesi.  We know that in this particular series 
of transactions the contract with the joint venture for the 
identification of houses and perhaps certain other word to, 
I will come to that in a moment, was in the region of R250 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just raise your voice, Mr Pretorius, 
please? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that the agreement 
10 
between the department and the joint venture agreed to 
pay the joint venture an amount of over R250 million, 
correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
We 
know 
that 
there 
was 
subcontract and an appointment of Blackhead for an 
amount in the region of R54 million to do most if not all the 
work.  We know that, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Originally we – okay, I know of it now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you know of it now, so I am 
20 
not saying you knew of it then.  In fact, that is precisely 
the point I want to raise and perhaps you can assist the 
Commission in this regard with your experience and 
knowledge.  We know that there was a further subcontract 
for most if not all of the work to be done for R21 million to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 44 of 244 
 
the ORI Group.  We know that, correct?   
MR MOKHESI:   My response will be the same as what I 
have said to [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, alright, we have that. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It can hardly be alleged therefore 
that there was value for money in the payment of R250 
million, would you accept that? 
MR MOKHESI:   Mr Pretorius, can I – okay, sorry, Chair.  
Can we – or I do not know whether should I say agree, I 
10 
suppose and also, you know, taking the -  about what has 
happened around this issue of value for money, you know, 
and I earlier indicated that there was this court decisions 
that says there was no overpayment.  I thought the 
Commission had that, you know, but I was just informed 
that they do not but we would make that available. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We would like to see that, if we 
could. 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you say that decision said, I 
20 
am sorry? 
MR MOKHESI:   A political party took the department to 
court. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR MOKHESI:   And they - you know, one of the decisions 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 45 of 244 
 
or one of the findings that was made was that there was no 
overpayment, okay.  It is in the court judgment but it is not 
on the merits, let me indicate that.  It is not on - in other 
words, it is not on whether the contract is irregular or not, 
that is beside the point, I think – ja.  And one of – how we 
said value for money, we relied on what the judge said at 
that particular – in terms of that.  That was that. 
 
The second part was also part of internally, you 
know, how do we deal with irregular expenditure when it 
has occurred, you know, there is a process of a framework 
10 
in terms of how we deal with that.  We also dealt with that.  
And I am certain the AG will not have agreed in terms of 
the write-off it – maybe it is because of none of the parties 
involved there were experts.  Maybe it is because of that.  
I am just saying.  But there was a process, that is the 
second part. 
 
And subsequently,  there was also an investigation 
by 
the 
Public 
Protector 
who 
arrived 
at 
a 
different 
conclusion.  I think the Commission and the Public 
Protector ’s conclusion are the same.  We now have an 
20 
investigation by the SIU.  Now all that I am saying because 
also the SIU will also come up with things(?) to say let us 
leave in terms of the issues of the value for money, can we 
then leave it perhaps also either to the SIU …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we cannot. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 46 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   To …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, Mr Mokhesi, we cannot.  We 
have to make our own decisions, we are not going to 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay, can I leave that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   …to let somebody else make decisions 
on this. 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay because …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So even if a judge that said there was 
no overpayment, just from that… 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have not read the judgment, I do not 
know what the judgment says but it seems to me that he or 
she might be talking about whether you paid more than you 
had undertaken to pay which is different from the question 
that Mr Pretorius is asking, namely, when you have regard 
to A, B, C, D are you able as HOD at the time to say the 
department got value for money?  So you are going to –
what do you mean when you say value for money, you look 
at what happened and you say yes, we are able to say we 
20 
got value for money or you say look, knowing what we 
know now, we are not able to say we got value for money. 
MR MOKHESI:   It is a tricky question for me because, you 
know, there is no – what will I say, there is no conclusion 
because we might – we might at a later stage, the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 47 of 244 
 
department might have to write back based on the – either 
the outcome of the Commission, or whatever, body that has 
been tasked to investigate this issue for value for money.  
So we might have to write something back and also pursue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that worries me even more, Mr 
Mokhesi.  I take it that one of your obligations, your 
responsibilities as HOD at the time was to see to it that 
whatever contracts your department entered into with any 
service provider was such that the department would get 
value for money and that when that service provider had 
10 
finished doing the work, you had an obligation to apply 
your mind to the question in regard to this contract, did the 
department get value for money?  And if the answer you 
get from that is no, the department did not get value for 
money, you would be worried and you would need to act on 
that. 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the answer you are giving me 
suggests to me, and maybe I misread what you are saying, 
that you did not do that because if you had done that, you 
20 
would be ready to deal with the question that Mr Pretorius 
puts to you.  You say I do not know what the SIU will 
decide, I do not know what this Commission will decide but 
I have applied my mind to the question as HOD and my 
answer is A, B, C, D. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 48 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, at that time, right, this information 
that Mr Pretorius is talking about that they subcontracting 
and so on and so on, that information was not there at that 
particular point in time.  The fact that it was written off it is 
because there was certain work that was done and they 
came to a conclusion that there was value for money, that 
that was before the other inquiries like the inquiry right 
now, that is happening, which attempts to get deeper into 
the issues.  
Now obviously when that comes – that is why I 
10 
mention in this – this independent, which I will say 
independent outside the department, right, will then be in 
the position to inform because I am sure the service 
provider themselves will also want to make a point or a 
case in terms of whether value for money.   
The outcome of this Commission in terms of that is 
going to be very important as well because then it is done 
independently, 
outcome 
of 
the 
Commission 
plus 
the 
outcome of any independent institution like SIU and I am 
sure somewhere you will converge and there will be 
20 
indications as to why there is either no value for money 
because I have done that already and what is being done 
now seems to contradict that conclusion based on the 
information that was available there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 49 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you wish to take the short 
adjournment now?  I am happy to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can either take the adjournment or 
you want some – pursue one or two questions before we do 
so, I am happy to …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, perhaps we should just tie up 
this topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mokhesi, we do not know what 
the court was told in relation to this contract and its 
10 
performance.  We have asked for the judgment and 
perhaps we will still get it. 
MR MOKHESI:   I think that the initial investigation that 
was given to the investigators, not – I will make that 
available. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but the point we do not know 
what the court was told and what conclusion it drew in 
relation to the facts that we now know before us.  So I am 
not sure we can rely on the court as a …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   I am not …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   …an informed judge of whether 
there was value for money. 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, I am not saying that, Mr Pretorius, 
you 
should 
because 
even 
that 
judgment 
was 
never 
appealed against.  Okay and so in the absence of anything 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 50 of 244 
 
to the contrary one is bound to conclude as I have 
concluded. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I am putting the contrary to 
you, Mr Mokhesi, we do not know what information the 
court was given in regard to value for money, nor do we 
know now what it found.  As the Chair has pointed out, it is 
for this instance to make its own findings on the facts 
before it. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You now know the facts and we 
10 
now are dealing with hindsight, not what you knew at the 
time.  I am quite willing to approach this matter with the 
benefit of hindsight for the present purposes. 
 
It appears – and I want to get to another point 
because the Chair will make up his mind as to whether 
there was value for money.  There is plenty of evidence 
including the evidence found by the Public Protector that 
the work was done for approximately R21 million, right?  
And R250 million was charged for the work and quite 
frankly, it is quite obvious that there was no value for 
20 
money here.   
 
I want to raise another point with you and that is, 
what happened here, unbeknown on your version and we 
must accept that for the moment, unbeknown to the 
department 
there 
were 
two 
levels 
of 
subcontracts 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 51 of 244 
 
happening, correct?  First to Blackhead for R54 million, 
then to ORI for R21 million, if you do the fieldwork, 
correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were not told that. 
MR MOKHESI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said Blackhead, Mr – I think 
you meant Master Trade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Master Trade, I am sorry, Master 
Trade.  Ja, first to Master Trade and then to ORI, correct?  
10 
You 
were 
not 
told 
about 
these 
subcontracting 
arrangements.  With hindsight, how would you regulate 
matters to prevent this sort of thing happening again?   
 
So what we have here and it is not uncommon, 
according to the investigations of this Commission, is that 
you get a company that tenders for government work and 
the subcontracts it at a much lower price and makes a 
huge profit, simply for intervening as the contracting party.  
Can this be prevented?  Can prejudice to the state be 
prevented?  Can you help the Chair? 
20 
MR MOKHESI:   In terms of making suggestions? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   For how …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were on the ground, you know, 
you have experience.  Perhaps you can help the Chair. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 52 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, Chair, sometimes the contractors are 
also becoming very creative.  It is very difficult but 
ordinarily there would be a – particularly on construction 
because people do sell work, we know that it does happen, 
like Mr Pretorius has indicated.  In terms of trying to 
maybe prevent or try to – because we cannot completely - 
you know, I do not believe there is anything that says you 
can completely, but we can minimise opportunities for that 
happening, is to have a contract with the main contractor 
about who – how much, you know, in other words putting 
10 
up the rules to say yes, you can subcontract because – you 
can subcontract because there will be work that needs to 
be subcontracted in any contract in any event, you know, 
setting out the guidelines to say you can only subcontract 
no more than 20 or 30% of the work, the rest it must be 
done by yourself as the main contractor and get perhaps a 
list of the people who will be doing the work and prove that 
they are the actual people, you know, the actual  - you are 
actual employees, so to speak. 
 
So in requesting those particular details perhaps 
20 
maybe for the future it could assist to prevent, you know, 
people subcontracting or selling work 100% to others. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, just one point, it seems that 
from the side of the various departments that give work, we 
have heard both in this matter and in the housing, matter 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 53 of 244 
 
are very creative ways of avoiding competitive bidding and 
it appears that greater control must be exercised and 
loopholes must be closed.  Do you agree? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, there is just one more brief 
topic to deal with, Chair.  May we take the short 
adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before we take the adjournment, I 
am interested in hearing what you have to say, Mr Mokhesi, 
to Mr Pretorius’ proposition that on what we know now, the 
10 
department did not get value for money.  He mentioned to 
you some of the things.  You have told me what you 
thought then, sometime ago.  Are you able to say whether, 
with what you know now, you still stay with your view that 
the department got value for money or are you saying, with 
what you know now, you no longer – you think the 
department did not get value for money? 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay, Chair.  On the face of it, without 
saying how much that value is because it has still got to be 
determined, 
you 
know, 
there 
will 
be 
– 
to 
say 
the 
20 
department per [indistinct] 22.38 did not get full value for 
money.  Without putting an amount and this amount I think 
will be the outcome of the enquiry at this stage to say this 
is what we think and then obviously, as I have indicated 
now, the department based on that evidence will then have 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 54 of 244 
 
to write back that which is deemed not to have been value 
for money and try and recover it.  I think that will be the 
normal process going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your answer that your view is that the 
department did get some value but you are not able to say 
it got full value for the R250 or so million that you paid? 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, taking also into consideration that we 
did not pay the full amount particularly when the Public 
Protector started the investigation.  Also, as a way of 
managing the risk because, you know, we could not predict 
10 
what the outcome of the Public Protector would be at that 
particular time so – and I think the same information that 
the Public Protector had in her investigation is similar to 
what the Commission and possibly the Commission did 
more basically.  Now, based on that and with possibly the 
quantum that I am sure the Commission will be able to 
determine, you know, whatever remain, what will have to 
be written back but my answer is possibly the department 
did not get full value for money in this instance, I am not 
able to say how much. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Let us take the – 
yes, Mr Mpofu? 
MR MPOFU:   Thank you, Chair, it is just a request more 
for personal reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 55 of 244 
 
MR MPOFU:   Mr Pretorius has indicated to me informally 
that he needs another ten minutes or so, so I wanted to 
request if it is at all possible whether we could deal with 
that and then take the break or… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, no, we can, we can do that. 
MR MPOFU:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, let us do that. 
MR MPOFU:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe before we do that, let me ask 
another question that I was going to ask after the tea 
10 
adjournment.  You might not need to go to this page, Mr 
Mokhesi, but it is page 234, that is one of the pages of the 
letter 
that 
Mr 
Pretorius 
referred 
you 
to 
which 
you 
addressed to Mr Zulu.  You signed it on the 27 November 
2014.  At page 234 there is the part where you say the 
objective of your project is twofold and then you specify.  
You know which one I am talking about? 
MR MOKHESI:   234? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you might not need to read, to look 
at it, but you can if you want, page 234. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, I am on page 234. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, somewhere in the middle of the 
page you say: 
“The objective of the project is twofold.” 
Then you specify the two objectives, I am not going to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 56 of 244 
 
repeat them.  Then later on down the line, you say: 
“All asbestos will be removed and disposed of as 
laid out in the Occupational Health and Safety Act 
and the Regulations 85 of 1993.” 
I take it that that is the Act and the regulations that also 
specify the requirements or qualifications of – that need to 
be met by anybody who wants to remove asbestos, is that 
correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Mr Sodi gave evidence here and he 
10 
conceded that Blackhead and the joint venture did not have 
the qualifications and were not accredited to remove 
asbestos.  Did you hear that part of his evidence? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, I have noted that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have noted that. 
MR MOKHESI:   That evidence that he gave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now were you aware of that prior 
to him giving that evidence or were you not aware? 
MR MOKHESI:   No, I was not aware that they do not 
have… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The qualifications. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, I assumed basically that they should 
have because they did work in Gauteng but, as I have 
indicated earlier, Chairperson, you know the documents, if 
we were cover the documents of all the Gauteng in terms 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 57 of 244 
 
of what we – this matter would have picked up as early as 
that particular time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you see, I am worried because 
from the fact that you say in this letter all asbestos will be 
removed and disposed of as laid out in the Occupational 
Health and Safety Act and the Regulations, gives me the 
impression that you are aware that there is a special 
procedure that must be followed as laid out in that Act and 
I take it that you would also have been aware that not 
anybody …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …could do this job.  This job requires 
somebody 
to 
have 
certain 
qualifications 
or 
to 
be 
accredited.  You were aware of that, were you not? 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, ja, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   And this – okay, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, my question therefore is how 
was it possible that as HOD you could not at least say to 
your officials where are the qualifications or where is the 
20 
accreditation of this entity that they can do this job 
because that must be quite an important and basic 
question to ask before you give anybody a job. 
MR MOKHESI:   Let me respond to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 58 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   It is not the first time that we remove 
asbestos, it was only – this case is a different – was a 
different one.  We have been particularly with old pre-1994 
houses which are dilapidated and so on.  Now we have 
been removing them albeit not on a larger scale and so on, 
only two people who qualify – to those individual ones who 
are qualifying for government assistance and are living in 
those houses. 
 
Now it is not a new thing, the issue of the removal 
of asbestos, I do not have to repeat it to the officials, so 
10 
they know that, as I have indicated.   This was not the first 
time Chairperson we have done that partly in Soutpan even 
in Mangawu 
certain houses where you know – and 
ordinarily what will normally happen in that instances while 
we appoint a 
contractor to do that he 
would have 
outsourced because that is not maybe the main part of it.   
He would have requested somebody because there 
is quite a few people in the province who are qualified to 
remove that, to remove the asbestos.  He will then do that 
before the demolition of a structure so that we have been 
20 
doing even before then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying to me that you were 
– okay you said earlier on it was the first time you heard 
that that they did not have, Blackhead did not have 
accreditation or qualifications.  So you were under the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 59 of 244 
 
impression that they did have the necessary qualifications 
or accreditation, is that correct?  
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were under that impression? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is something you had not 
checked you assumed that they did.   
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, because and in our normal course of 
work we have always you know somehow as I have 
indicated removed asbestos and there are procedures.  
10 
The first one is you must produce the certificate that the 
person who is going to remove that you know there is a 
process as to who qualifies and so on the dispose of sites.  
It is not anywhere you cannot just dispose it for example in 
any landfill site and so on.  So we have been doing that 
before.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you were doing it before did 
you ask to be satisfied that the person who would do the 
removal, who would be qualified did you ask for the 
qualifications to be placed before you to know that okay it 
20 
can be done.        
MR MOKHESI:   Okay let me put it this way it is not before 
me but before the officials because it is not the first time.  
They are there the removal, the removal of asbestos as I 
have indicated we have been doing it as a matter of course 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 60 of 244 
 
particularly for the beneficiaries who are qualifying to do 
that – ag sorry who are qualify for government assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why is it, why is there nothing that is 
given to you that says if we give this job to this entity or 
this person it is in order because in terms of legislation a 
person 
who 
does 
this 
job 
must 
have 
the 
following 
qualifications or accreditations and this one has got those 
accreditations or qualifications.  And if necessary, here are 
copies or whatever maybe they do not say that but at least 
they say it is there we know it but I would have thought 
10 
that they would attach to whatever documentation they give 
to the HOD to satisfy him or her that this person meets the 
legal requirements to do this job.   
Now in this case the officials do not give you 
anything 
to indicate that you are appointing somebody who meets 
the legal requirements to do this job.  I would have thought 
that it is quite basic to say if you want me to appoint 
anybody, I must at least know that they qualify in terms of 
the law to do this job because I cannot appoint somebody 
20 
who 
might 
turn 
out 
later 
not 
to 
actually 
have 
the 
qualifications.       
MR MOKHESI:   Chair certain things are so basic like you 
have just said now you know are so basic that I do not 
even as an accounting officer have to see it because this is 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 61 of 244 
 
the work that we 
have 
been doing.  You 
know in 
government things are largely standardised right to say if 
this is what you have to do there is a checklist of the 
usual.   
So and I think I have earlier indicated you know 
with the span of control of 11 people that reports to me it is 
actually - and each one of them being’s senior managers in 
their own right and could be actually accounting officers in 
their own right.  They can apply for my job, right and then 
they are running their own respective fields, right.  So in 
10 
most of the cases you know it is through engagements and 
reports and so on.  So that is in a checklist basically 
and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you expect them to do that.    
MR MOKHESI:   I expect that you know I do not have to 
even to tell them because it is not even the first time that 
we are dealing with asbestos.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well now that we know or let me ask this 
question.  If you knew that Blackhead or this joint venture 
did not have the qualifications or the accreditation required 
20 
to do the removal of asbestos would you still have 
appointed them to do this job? 
MR MOKHESI:   No.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not have appointed them.  
MR MOKHESI:   They do not qualify they will not have – I 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 62 of 244 
 
think we will probably will be only in the position to pick up 
this at the second phase because then they will have to 
produce 
because 
now 
other 
parties 
will 
be 
involved 
department of labour for example in this whole process 
because of the sheer magnitude of the work.  And 
definitely labour would have been involved and you know 
there would have been checks and balances along the way 
even before they started, they will have to produce that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it seems to me that the joint venture 
of 
Blackhead 
also 
made 
a 
misrepresentation 
to 
the 
10 
department because in the service level agreement they 
assured the department that they had the capacity and the 
experience I think there is qualifications if I am not 
mistaken to do the job and the job as specified included 
the removal of asbestos which they were, they had no 
accreditation to do.  Is that right?     
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that your understanding as well? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes that is my understanding they were 
not accredited to do the job.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MOKHESI:   Yes now that we know…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and there may be a risk I would 
imagine but you might have a different view.  There might 
be a risk that if a when you want to do the actual removal 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 63 of 244 
 
maybe whoever you appoint might say well the first part 
was not done properly and they need to do it themselves 
and then there might be duplications of payments or do you 
think that is not likely to happen.   
MR MOKHESI:   Well that is a risk Chair as you have 
indicated you know that is a risk, that could have been a 
risk perhaps when…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am sorry Mr Pretorius I understood 
Mr Mpofu’s request to be aimed at us finishing with Mr 
Mokhesi before we take the adjournment, he said for 
10 
personal reasons but I understood you to still have another 
topic or something that you wanted to raise.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, there are two topics Chair and 
perhaps your guidance on one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ten minutes is perhaps typical of 
counsels forecast and I include myself in that very 
optimistic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay we still got to deal with the 
20 
one discreet topic there is a question on arising out of this 
exchange that I would like to ask.  Then there is the Public 
Protectors findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now the Public Protector ’s findings 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 64 of 244 
 
are a matter of record they are there in black and white 
they are not going to change as of a result of anything that 
happens here today.  But it may be a consideration that if 
you are going to have regard to those findings it may be 
fair for Mr Mokhesi to have a chance to comment on them 
and that is a reason why we have extracted certain 
findings to enable Mr Mokhesi to comment on them should 
he so wish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.     
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He does not have to comment but 
10 
at least he has the opportunity I am not sure what your 
preference is Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So on your assessment if you have 
got to deal with all of that how much time do you think you 
might need? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   30 to 40 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Mpofu what is your situation? 
ADV MPOFU:   It is okay Chair we can take the break.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is okay, okay let us take the tea 
adjournment it is ten to twelve and then we will resume at 
20 
five past, ja okay.  We adjourn.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before Mr Pretorius continues Mr Mokhesi 
I just want to say that do you think it would be unfair to you 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 65 of 244 
 
to expect that given what you found when you were 
appointed as HOD to this department relating to the R1 
billion housing project or R1.3 or R1.4 billion project about 
which you testified sometime last week – given when you 
knew had happened under the watch of your predecessor Mr 
Mokoena 
and 
the 
losses 
– 
financial 
losses 
that 
the 
department had suffered money that was not accounted for 
which you testified about tax payers money that seems to 
have been paid away with no real work being done.  Do you 
think it would be unfair to expect that your attitude would be 
10 
that under your watch as Head of that department you would 
be more stricter in terms of making sure that processes were 
followed and legislation was followed because you would not 
want something similar to happen. 
MR MOKHESI:  Is the Chair saying I should have been more 
stricter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am asking – so maybe let me put 
it this way.  It seems to me that there may be room for 
saying given what you found when you were appointed as 
Head of this department and what I am talking about is the 
20 
financial loss incurred by the department in regard to the R1 
billion housing project under Mr Mokoena your predecessor.  
Given that that is what you found and it was quite – quite 
you know a big problem I would expect that you would have 
been more determined to make sure that such losses as far 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 66 of 244 
 
as possible were avoided under – during your term and that 
for the – for that reason you would be stricter in making sure 
that legislation and processes were complied with during 
your term.  So I am putting the question, do you think it is 
unfair to expect that that is the attitude you should have 
adopted? 
MR MOKHESI:  Chair I do not think it is unfair for – for – to 
expect that and you know during that particular time as well 
also due consideration should be taken that we particularly – 
there was a period where we did not – where we you know 
10 
we – because of – because of the disciplinary process and 
so on which – in positions that we could not [00:04:14].  
Somehow even the controls perhaps were not as they should 
be.   
And as I re - indicated I have done a lot of 
introspection around this particular issue.  And you know I 
cannot undo what has happened but I can sincerely do 
something about going forward to say what happened people 
that I trusted you know particularly those that I work with.  
Because my attitude has always been that you know until – 
20 
unless a person – because if you do not trust individuals that 
you work with it is also a problem because you have to at the 
position that you are holding you have to trust individuals 
and hope because this other individuals or this particular 
individual was not part of that which was there.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 67 of 244 
 
As I have indicated that I have known him before – 
even before I joined the institutions.  I have worked with him 
elsewhere and I know his capabilities and – and I thought at 
the time this is the person – this is new blood that I needed 
in the institution because of the expertise.  But it has 
happened and you know I cannot change it and I feel terrible 
about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Would 
you please go to Bundle FS1 Mr Mokhesi at page 59?   
10 
MR MOKHESI:  Page 59. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair this is the second 
affidavit of Mr Mokhesi.  To the best of my recollection it has 
been admitted as an exhibit but perhaps just in case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 57 – 58 rather of FS1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is where it ends or not? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is Exhibit TT2.2 
CHAIRPERSON:  No he gave me FS12 instead of FS1.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 60 of FS1 is that your signature 
20 
Mr Mokhesi? 
MR MOKHESI:  Page 60? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 60. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And this is your second affidavit to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 68 of 244 
 
the commission? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is Exhibit TT2.2 Chair.  If you go to 
page 59 paragraph 7. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say in paragraph 7.1: 
“During the time of the Asbestos Audit I 
became acquainted with Mr Edwin Sodi.  We 
became 
friends. 
 
As 
a 
result 
of 
my 
appreciation of Sodi’s business skills and my 
10 
impression that he enjoyed wealth I resolved 
to approach Sodi to join me in the investment 
in a property transaction referring to the 
acquisition of the property referred to in 
paragraph 6”.   
The 
property 
referred 
to 
in 
paragraph 
6 
is 
a 
residential property in Bloemfontein, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 7.2 and the statement in 
paragraph 7.1 is that correct – true? 
20 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 7.2: 
“Sodi was interested where after the Lekomo 
[?] 
family 
trust 
represented 
by 
myself 
concluded a commercial transaction.  The 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 69 of 244 
 
terms of the commercial transaction are 
contained in a written agreement annexed as 
Annexure D.” 
 
We will get there now.  Correct. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The third statement you make in 
paragraph 7 says:  
“It needs to be recorded that at this juncture 
that the Asbestos Audit which was conducted 
by Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited was 
10 
already finalised at the time the transaction 
was entered into.” 
 
At that stage certainly the stage the agreement was 
entered into payments were still being made to the Joint 
Venture, is that correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 7.4 reads: 
“Sodi in terms of the provisions of our 
agreement cause payment of the amount of 
R650 000.00 to the trust account of Fraumo 
20 
Veman [?] Joubert Attorneys in order to 
settle 
Sodi’s 
portion 
of 
the 
purchase 
consideration in respect of the property 
investment.”   
Correct? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 70 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now we know that Sodi did not 
purchase the property – the trust purchased the property, 
correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And Mr Sodi himself had no interest 
in the trust, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So we know that Mr Sodi had no real 
right in the property.  He did not own it whether via a trust or 
10 
otherwise, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The only obligations and rights that 
he had appear in the agreement which we will refer to in a 
moment, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say that: 
“Sodi was interested where after Lekomo 
Family 
Trust 
represented 
by 
myself 
concluded a commercial transaction.” 
20 
 
Let us look at FS1 page 91 please.  Correct me if I 
am wrong or putting the position incorrectly.  That is the 
signature page of the agreement? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is signed by yourself on the 1 April 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 71 of 244 
 
and by Mr Sodi on the 1 April. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If one goes to page 89 you will see 
the first page of the agreement. 
MR MOKHESI:  Page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  89 of FS1.  You see that? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
It 
is 
an 
agreement 
between 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited and the Lekomo Family 
Trust – IT444/2015[B]. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is the registration number of the 
trust? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This agreement was signed was it in 
this form each page is initialled on the 1 April 2015, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the… 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Registration details of the Lekomo 
20 
Family Trust are there is type face, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know from documents that are 
attached that the trust was indeed registered in 2015 but the 
trustee from FS1 page 84 if you would go there was signed 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 72 of 244 
 
on the 4 May 2015 you see that? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The various trustees signed and you 
as the founder trustee signed in Bloemfontein on the 4 April 
2015.  This document was the trust deed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page did you say we 
should go to Mr Pretorius?  Did you say we should go… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 84. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 84?  84. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This is – 84 – this is the signature 
10 
page of the trust deed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The first page is at page 62. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So the trust deed was officially 
created or officially signed and the trust created on the 4 
May 2015, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it is only after that that the trust 
could have been given a registration number because it did 
20 
not exist before 4 May 2015, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  4 May – yes 4 May 2015.  So when 
the agreement was signed in April there was no trust firstly 
and it could not have had a registration number because it 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 73 of 244 
 
could not have been registered by that date. 
MR MOKHESI:  Okay.  The… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you explain that? 
MR MOKHESI:  Can I just… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It seems to me that the… 
MR MOKHESI:  Can I respond to that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The – well perhaps you should 
explain before I suggest an examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And please look this side. 
MR MOKHESI:  Okay.  We – in terms of the agreement to 
10 
form a trust was already there.  Indeed, the agreement was 
concluded on the 5t h; the trust was subsequently formed 
thereafter.  The – the trust number was put there later.  This 
is what I – we – in terms of the [00:16:50] that the – was 
going to be used around for the acquisition of this – of this 
property indeed agreement was that I would form a trust.  
Although indeed the number the trust was registered later 
and the purchase of the property of course also was later.  
But the agreement had already been reached. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us get to whether the agreement 
20 
of April reflects the correct facts in a moment.  But I 
understand it reasonable to conclude that the trust was 
created as a vehicle to conduct this transaction. 
MR MOKHESI:  We already had an agreement Mr Pretorius.  
We already had an agreement even though the trust was 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 74 of 244 
 
registered later.  Because currently the trust – the only asset 
that the trust holds is this asset. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So my proposition that I am putting to 
you seems fair Mr Mokhesi that you decided with Mr Sodi to 
create a trust that would own the property. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The answer was yes? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  is that right the answer was yes. 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And so the insofar as the agreement 
was entered into before the trust was created it records 
something that could not have been correct.  Because at the 
time the agreement was entered into no trust existed yet the 
agreement reflects that the trust did exist at the time. 
MR MOKHESI:  There was no trust at the time but the 
agreement was that we will form – I will form a trust. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes alright so we are at least on the 
same pages as it were.  The way that this arrangement was 
made from Mr Sodi’s point of view he makes a payment to 
20 
the trust account of an attorney, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If one follows the trail that payment 
then is allocated to the benefit of the Lekomo Trust, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 75 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So – and the property is not 
registered either in your name or in Mr Sodi’s name, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Even though it is a joint investment. 
MR MOKHESI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So nowhere in Mr Sodi’s books as it 
were does it appear that he made a payment for your benefit 
or for the joint investment let me put it neutrally.  Nowhere 
10 
does it appear that he is the owner of a property together 
with you in any record.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Well I do not know what actually is in Mr 
Sodi’s [mumbling]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it does not appear – it would not 
appear in any bank accounts that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he means there is no documents that 
would reflect that anywhere.  He means there is no document 
anywhere that would reflect that Mr Sodi owns the property 
or has rights into the property. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:  No he only has – he only has a not real right 
I think personal right in terms of… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but apart from that agreement 
which creates the personal right as opposed to the real right 
that Mr Sodi has as investor in a property and that is another 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 76 of 244 
 
issue that maybe Mr Sodi can explain.  There is no official 
record in other words there is no – nothing in the deeds 
office that shows that Mr Sodi owns a property with you.  
There is nothing in any bank account that shows a payment 
to you.  Correct?  All that exists is a payment to an 
attorney’s trust account.  That is in Mr Sodi’s records 
presumably.  And it does not show his interest in a property 
together with you.  There is no document that would show 
that except the agreement privately entered into between 
you and he. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:  In respect of the property. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:  That is the agreement that - is it – yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  As far as you are concerned 
there is no record in your bank accounts of money being 
received from Mr Sodi, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  No it could not be – it could not – the record 
that exists is the record in the attorneys. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:    Right.  Plus you know there is a trait about 
20 
that plus that for the acquisition of the property in which 
instance I have on my side I have raised 60% of the required 
through a bond and him 40% of the property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please look this side. 
MR MOKHESI:  Sorry, sorry Chair. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 77 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just so that – I do not hear. 
MR MOKHESI:  I am saying – I am saying the record that is 
– that is available is the record – it is what goes to the 
transferring 
or 
the 
transferring 
attorney 
and 
plus 
the 
purchase later stage in – on the – on the deeds – on the title 
deed which indicates the full amount plus what I have raised 
0% of the required capital and 40% of – the full amount is 
reflected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Pretorius’ proposition or question. 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that even in your bank accounts there 
would be nothing that would show that Mr Sodi put in this 
amount for this joint venture between the two of you 
concerning this property. 
MR MOKHESI:  It cannot be on my…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct, is that not correct? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes but it cannot be on my bank account if 
the – if our agreement was for investment in a property – in 
properties.  It could not be in my bank account. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well whether it could not be or was 
20 
not the fact that it – nothing appeared in your own bank 
accounts in relation to any money given to you by Mr Sodi. 
MR MOKHESI:  This money is not given to me it is for 
investment purposes.  Maybe let me try and indicate that the 
property that is in Bloemfontein that is what my primary resi 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 78 of 244 
 
– it is not my primary residential property.   
I am staying in that property because I work in 
Bloemfontein.  That is the only reason why I had to do it and 
I also stay there for – sorry – I also stay there – you know if 
you want to stay in a place for more than three years the 
rule of thumb is instead of renting you must buy.  And I have 
stayed indeed for the past three years or so before this I had 
already changed – I had rented and moved twice from 
different places simply because the – the landlords were 
selling at that particular – and I could not get the 100% bond 
10 
from the bank.   
Why I could not get a 100% I – ABSA picked up that I 
had a – a judgment against me which was obtained by SARS 
and therefore my credit rating could not be in a position to 
offer me to be able to raise the 100% bonding.  I must also 
indicate that before I get to know that Mr Sodi is investing in 
properties I had also approached family members who are in 
– who are also albeit in a small way who are also involved in 
property investment but they could not come to me – after 
they – they could not – they were not in the position to 
20 
support me in that because of the commitment at that 
particular time.  So this was not – and – this was not money 
for me because it has got to go back to Sodi as an investor.  
First the guaranteed capital plus whatever surplus or profit 
one of 60/40 profit sharing.

CHAIRPERSON:  But you – it seems from what you just said 
that you needed to have – you needed accommodation in 
Bloemfontein, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had challenges in getting a full 
bond because of the SARS judgment, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct.  Which I was not aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR MOKHESI:  I am saying which I was not aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until ABSA raised it. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:  Until ABSA raised it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You then – you then 
approached Mr Sodi, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:  Correct because I learned that he – he also 
invests in property.  He has – he has investment in property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then the two of you had a 
discussion about investing in some property? 
MR MOKHESI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what I see it looks like you were 
not talking about properties you were talking about just one 
20 
property. 
MR MOKHESI:  Just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one property, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:  Especially that – that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A specific property. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 80 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:  That specific property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you identified the property by the time 
the two of you spoke? 
MR MOKHESI:  No we have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not. 
MR MOKHESI:  There is not much here.  Let me try and 
explain Chair – this process Chair.  You see if – because 
when we enter into that type of [00:28:40] it cannot just be 
any property it has got to be a property that can demonstrate 
the appreciation in value because issues like location and so 
10 
on becomes important right.   
Now if you – if you – with all this particular issues 
you will normally say to the estate agent this is what I am 
looking for right.  And it must also be a secure property 
because that is not my primary residence and I must not be 
worried when I am away for an extended longer period that 
you know what is happening there and so on.   
So – and the area as well becomes key – becomes very 
important as well.  Now you give the – the estate agent to 
say right this is what I am looking for and indeed he goes out 
20 
and he identifies a – a property.  To say this is the property 
that I think which indeed is the property that is secure it is in 
an area – in fact it is a new area in Bloemfontein over – over  
twenty up till now.  You know, on its turn, it has been... the 
prices have been going there at 16... ag, sorry, at 11%.  That 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 81 of 244 
 
information is... had been going there at 11% per annum, 
right.   
 
Now, and obviously, if you have to ask somebody to 
invest.  You know if I were to ask you to say:  Please, invest 
with me in this particular programme.   
 
The question is why should I invest with you when I can 
take my money, for example, and put it elsewhere?  In the 
bank where there is a risk-free.  You know, you sleep very 
well.  You do not have to worry and then you will get your...  
 
You must demonstrate that you are going to get a return 
10 
on investment that is more than what you would get if you 
were to put in a risk-free investment.   
 
Now what is the most... what is a risk-free investment 
in... that is available around?  You know, not even the bank.  
The absolute risk-free investment that you can compare it 
with it is a Treasury Bonds Investment which forms the 
basis.   
 
If I take this money for a period of an investment of 
seven years and put it in a Treasury bond, how much will I 
get in terms of value of that investment?   
20 
 
Obviously, 
the 
Treasury 
bonds 
have 
got 
different 
maturity periods, okay.  I am just trying to give the thought 
what... the thought behind this particular issue.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR MOKHESI:   Okay.  The Treasury bond that matches the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 82 of 244 
 
maturity period of this investment is R197 which is 5.5 CPI 
of a rate of 5.5% because it is the safest investment that is 
risk-free that is available that will match the investment 
period or the maturity period of that which is seven years.   
 
Okay, it was issued in 2001 but the maturity period of it 
is December 2023 which nicely makes the seven... this... ag, 
for the seven years of that investment. 
 
Now what I have done on all... in terms of the return of 
the investment for the portion of... he will come out better 
than when he play it... when he puts that money in a risk-
10 
free investment of 5.5.   
 
So the sums that I worked out, if he puts that for that 
particular seven period, it works out roughly around 950 000.  
But if he invests in this particular for a seven-year period, he 
will 
get 
first 
his 
full 
capital 
950 
plus 
approximately 
roundabout 350 000 which works out 1.1 million that he will 
get on his investment. 
 
How does that happen for example?  Now the bond that 
are taken on the one million, in fact, all the risk that release 
for the properties are with me okay and not with me.  That 
20 
means, your property rates, property insurance, suretyship 
and so on.  They are with me. 
 
Now how does that happen?  The loan period of the one 
million bond that I have taken, it is over a period of 20-
years.  The instalment on that it is roughly around about 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 83 of 244 
 
7 800.  The interest, it is 6.8.  This is the contract that I have 
signed with the bank.   
 
Now I am not paying 7 600.  I am actually paying 15 000 
of that bond, of that particular bond.  Why?  To reduce the 
repayment period and by so doing, I have halved the 
repayment period.  Instead of 20-years to 10-years. 
 
Now the balance of the capital as at the end of... in 
period seven, in seven years will be roughly around about 
300 000 in the manner that I have been paying consistently 
more. 
10 
 
I think you will also appreciate and know that if you pay 
more on a bond, you tend to reduce the period very quickly 
because bond payments’ interest on that are, you know, the 
bond is... it is on a daily basis.  Interest is charged on a 
daily basis.  It therefore pays... it pays to pay a little bit 
more. 
 
Which then says at the time when we were selling the 
property because right now, the properties in that particular 
area, you know, the last saves(?) from September... from 
August up to September, for example, the lowest was at 1.8 
20 
and the highest was 2.6. 
 
Now if I were to sell this particular property now, I will 
easily sell it for 2 million.  However, I cannot do at this 
particular... because the only person who will benefit 
currently out of the... if I were to sell it now, it will be the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 84 of 244 
 
other party and not myself.   
 
Taking into consideration that currently all the costs that 
relays to those properties are with me.  So at the end of... I 
will have to wait for seven years to be... to sell so that it can 
be for mutual benefit of both of us because currently, the 
favour is on his side given the risk that I have taken.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But the idea between the two of you of 
investment and property 
was 
limited to this 
property.  
Subsequent to this transaction, the two of you did not 
involve... did not get involved in any other properties 
10 
together, or did you? 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, he himself has got investment in other 
properties as ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the two of you? 
MR MOKHESI:   It was only to this particular ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Only this property? 
MR MOKHESI:   Only in particular to this property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand from your answer 
two facts at least emerged.  The first is that you could not 
20 
raise a bond beyond a million rand.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   I could not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second is that you intended to 
live in the house and did live in the house. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 85 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So in order to obtain a house worth 
R 1.6 million in a secure estate with all the attributes you 
have spoken of, you needed assistance.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you have been able with your 
limited ability to raise bond finance or delimited ability to 
raise bond finance to live in that house since 2015.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you that, at the very least, 
after seven years, as you say it on your calculations, this 
10 
arrangement between you and Mr Sodi would have been 
mutually beneficial. 
MR MOKHESI:   At this stage, if... as I have indicated, it is 
mutually beneficial, okay, in terms of the period.  Because 
understand that all, what I will refer as landlord expenses, so 
to speak, are with me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry.  Yes, had you finished? 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I did not want to interrupt you.  I am 
sorry.  If you have not finished, please ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOKHESI:   No, what I am saying.  The point I am trying 
to make Mr Pretorius is.  You know, the amount of... all the 
expenses, your maintenance, property, taxes, insurance and 
over and above that...  
 
I have also indicated that I am paying more to reduce 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 86 of 244 
 
the repayment period and possible at the end of ten years 
...because in these instances, the plan is after seven years, 
either two things will happen, right?  I will refinance the 
property further or simple sell it outright.  Alright? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I understand. 
MR MOKHESI:   And make the calculations in terms of what 
should have been, okay? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   But... Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   That is the decision that one will have to 
make at that particular... but his original investment is 
guaranteed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, that is the point we will come 
to in a moment.  Can you explain why Mr Sodi who wants to 
invest in property, would not register a share of that property 
in his name but limit his rights to the rights against a family 
trust?  Can you explain why he would do that?   
 
Ordinarily, an investor in property would want rights in 
that property.  I would understand.  But in this case, all he 
20 
does is enter into an agreement with a trust and presumable 
any collapse of this whole scheme would leave him with 
rights against a trust only.  
MR MOKHESI:   Well, how would it so collapse in these 
instances because... it is what it is Mr Pretorius.  I do not to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 87 of 244 
 
say why would he do that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because something could happen to 
you.  You could go insolvent.  You could fall ill.  God forbid, 
you could ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, so much the reason. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Too much... sorry. 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank ...[intervenes]   
MR MOKHESI:   Okay.  Alright.  Sorry, sorry. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For one or other reason, you could 
10 
stop payment.  That property could be attached by the bank.  
All that Mr Sodi would have would be rights against a family 
trust which might at that stage just be an empty shell.  He 
does not have the security of this investment in the property.  
That is strange. 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay alright.  Let us look at what is the 
value of this particular house and the value of the... or the 
bond itself, where it is.  Now, what... now assuming that... 
assuming what you are saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Mokhesi ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOKHESI:   Oh, I am sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am going to interrupt you.  I 
think you seek to answer Mr Pretorius’ questions on the 
basis of what the value of the house is now.  I think his 
question requires you to cast your mind back to the time the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 88 of 244 
 
agreement was made to say, he is saying to you.  Mr Sodi...  
 
One would have expected that Mr Sodi would insist on 
having rights in the property itself rather than having you did 
it with it personal rights.  Personal rights in terms of the 
agreement.   
MR MOKHESI:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he is saying that is strange.  Are you 
able to explain why he would have done that in the light of 
the risks that he has already articulated? 
MR MOKHESI:   Oh, okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think I would add because you did 
say that he is involved in a lot of properties.  Now somebody 
involve in a lot of properties would know definitely that if he 
really has an interest in that property, he should have rights 
in the property.  So that, despite that probable knowledge of 
his part ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he decided to agree to an arrangement 
which did not involve such rights, it is strange.  Are you able 
to say why that is not strange as you see it or is strange but 
20 
it should be understood in a certain context? 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay maybe... you know, maybe to try and 
answer for Mr Sodi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are not answering for Mr Sodi.  
You are answering for yourself because you see this 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 89 of 244 
 
transaction occurs between you or your family trust and Mr 
Sodi about four, five, six months or so after Mr Sodi’s 
company has been given the job that it was given if you look 
at the Service Level Agreement when it was signed. 
MR MOKHESI:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOKHESI:   Maybe Chair, it could be in the manner of 
the commitment that I put or the risk that I placed myself in 
the property, the investment part of it to say, I am more than 
him in terms of the proportion in that particular property.  
10 
The suretyship and so on.   
 
Now, that... and further that one has... you know, until 
such time we are... we have, you know, have come to the 
end of the term, for a lack of a better word.   
 
In other words, end of the term of the seven years or 
when I have insisted or kept away from, you know, putting 
the trust at risk, either by trading and so on.   
 
That I have done with the trust but the trust also 
commits further in terms of its obligations beyond what it 
has.  Beyond what it has done.  The first... the main 
20 
attributor of this trust, of course, is the bank.  And it has 
also built some sort of equity through...  
 
I will say, through acceleration of payments on my side 
so that there is neither risk for myself or for the investor.  So 
that perhaps could have been a reason. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 90 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you accept the proposition that this 
is strange that he was prepared to agree to an arrangement 
in terms of which he would have no rights in the property 
itself?  His rights would be limited to personal rights in terms 
of the agreement.  Do you accept that that is strange 
particularly or somebody who is quite involved in properties? 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, I have put up the proposal and he has 
accepted it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   So... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   You know, it was upon him to say:  No, this 
is further what I wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   You know and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
MOKHESI: 
 
 
Different 
investors 
will 
have 
the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mokhesi, if one looks at the 
20 
documentation relating to this arrangement and agreement 
and assuming that it is genuine and not just a cover for a 
donation to... and that is an assumption that is made here 
for the purposes of these questions.  But it is not accepted. 
Certainly, by the legal team as necessarily a correct 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 91 of 244 
 
assumption.   
 
You were able to buy a property in which you were to 
reside now for at least five years with, at that time, 
R1.6 million when you could only raise a bond of a million 
rand.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, one million. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not only did you enjoy personal 
occupation of the house but also you enjoyed the benefit of 
what 
you 
have 
described 
as 
a 
potentially 
profitable 
investment after seven years.  Correct? 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which you would not have had, 
either which you would not have had, had Mr Sodi not 
invested R 650 000,00 in the scheme.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, but that is an investment Mr Pretorius.  I 
think I made that point to say it is a commercial transaction. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but had he not made that 
investment, you would not have enjoyed in that residence in 
that house by ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Mpofu wants to say something.  
You can say it from where you are. 
ADV MPOFU:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 92 of 244 
 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you.  Chairperson, I am... I have left 
this for a little bit because I did not want to interrupt Mr 
Pretorius.  So I think now it was getting into the area 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The area that ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU:   Yes because it is clear what Mr Pretorius is 
doing.  The witness might not be aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU:   He is now establishing an element of a crime 
which is the benefit or potential benefit.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU:   And that is exactly where... we are not 
supposed to go.  He, of course, is not dealing with other 
elements, like mens rea and so on but we all know that this 
is a crucial element of some of the things that are being 
investigated, allegedly investigated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, just two points Chair.  The first 
is that there must be a positive assertion that this is an 
incriminating question and reliance must be made on that 
assertion.  So what Mr Mpofu has said, appears to have said 
20 
and one can accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You confirm Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU:   Yes, I do.  I do confirm that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   Well, that is the crux of the objection. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 93 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second is.  We have done our 
homework in relation to this and other matters.  You will 
know the publication of beer(?) on commissions of inquiry, 
international leading publication, where he deals with the 
question of incriminating issues or questions.   
 
In order to be fair to the witness, it goes further than 
simple:  Did you commit a crime, yes or no?   
 
Such a question that might elicit elements of an offence 
or lead to further investigations which may expose an 
10 
offence, is a grey area but... yes, it is an incriminating 
question insofar as it seeks to establish an element of a 
crime.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  That then, I guess that was not 
your last question? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I have more questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay the you move to other 
questions then. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I am not clear that Mr Mpofu did 
that to cut me short.  [laughing]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay let us leave aside the issue of 
benefit.  I think the question has been answered in any 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 94 of 244 
 
event.  The issue is now whether it can be used against you.  
The agreement itself...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me ask this question Mr Pretorius 
before you proceed.  Mr Mokhesi, you did say that Mr Sodi 
has a lot of properties in which he is involved.  Would you 
know whether he has a property development business or is 
it properties that he just buys? 
MR 
MOKHESI: 
 
 
Ja, 
what 
I 
have... 
he 
invests 
in 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In properties. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   ...in properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOKHESI:   You know, in various areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MOKHESI:   All in the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay. 
MR MOKHESI:   I think in the Eastern and Western Cape and 
so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay your voice is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Sorry.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think...[intervenes]  
MR MOKHESI:   Ja.  I am saying, he... I know that he invests 
in properties.  Like, in... I know that in the Free State, he 
has invested.  Even in properties, I think as well in the 
Western Cape ...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 95 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, your voice goes down.  
MR MOKHESI:   And so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay you know that he invests in 
many properties.  Is that right 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  He could have invested in any 
property that he liked in the area where this particular 
property on his own without you?  Do you know or do you not 
know whether he could have done that on his own? 
MR MOKHESI:   I honestly do not know whether he could 
10 
have done it on his own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, you see, when one looks at the 
agreement that the two of you concluded, one gets the 
impression 
that 
he 
was 
not 
bothered 
about 
this 
R 650 000,00.  He did not bother to say:  I must be part... I 
must be one of the owners of the property.   
 
He paid the R 650 000,00 and on the assumption that 
this agreement was... is genuine, concluded the sacrament.  
And maybe basically to assist you.   
 
Otherwise, he did not need to have any... to invest in 
20 
any property with you.  He could have invested on his own 
as he has done with other properties.  And maybe he was 
assisting you. 
MR 
MOKHESI: 
 
 
Well, 
there 
are 
properties 
where 
...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 96 of 244 
 
ADV MPOFU:   Chairperson, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  [laughing]  You say even the 
Chairperson... [laughing]   
ADV MPOFU:   Yes.  I think Mr Pretorius will have to be the 
adjudicator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV MPOFU:   Because I am objecting to the question of the 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV MPOFU:   I think Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV MPOFU:   In fairness, I understand what Chair is trying 
to say but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  You do not 
have to respond to that.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  I am entitled Chair to answer 
questions insofar as they reflect on Mr Sodi’s conduct.   
ADV MPOFU:   What... I am sorry, Chair.  Of course, Mr 
Pretorius is correct but the in relation to the real question of 
self-examination and so on.  But the... what I am object 
20 
against is for him to ask this witness to speculate on 
whatever was happening in the mind of Mr Sodi.  As I say, 
outside of the main issue which is the self-incrimination 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 97 of 244 
 
ADV MPOFU:   It is a waste of time because it is not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us wait until there is an 
objection from the question. 
ADV MPOFU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   All I intend to do is to put to you 
certain clauses of the agreement so that I can understand 
what you say about those clauses.  What I would wish to do 
and if there is an objection, we can deal with it at the time.

If one goes to FS1 at page 89, you will see there that 
that is the agreement.  FS1, page 89.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Time flies.  I see we are two minutes past 
one.  But I think we are close to finishing, are we not? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Public Protector’s findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will be very brief in my questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That I can undertake. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe let us continue.  What is your 
20 
estimate? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of how long my questions will take? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and answers ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It will take a very short time.  Five to 
ten minutes.  But it is the answers I cannot control. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 98 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay Mr Mpofu, I think let us try and 
continue. 
ADV MPOFU:   I am very indebted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so that when we take lunch, we are 
done with Mr Mokhesi. 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us do that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us try and move as fast 
as we can. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I know that there is a time when I 
allowed Mr Mokhesi quite some leeway in explaining... I did 
so deliberately.  I could have cut him short but I thought it is 
an important part, at least for him, to give that explanation.  
So but in order for us to try and finish reasonable soon, I 
might interrupt and keep him to the questions.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And I will try and avoid 
questions that are merely putting the exact issues I want to 
raise in the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I will go directly there.  
Paragraph 2.5. 
“The Lekomo(?) shall be entitled to rent the property 
to whomever it so desires.” 
 
Was the property rented to anybody? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 99 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   It was not rented. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you pay rent? 
MR MOKHESI:   As I have indicated.  All that I am doing, I 
am paying additional ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So you did not pay rent? 
MR MOKHESI:   I did not pay rent but, you know, I am far... 
there are expenses that I am carrying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Paragraph 2.7 says what will 
happen if the property is not sold within seven years.  Now 
Mr Sodi has given evidence in respect of this and it needs to 
10 
be clarified.   
“If the property is not sold within seven years, then 
Lekomo shall pay Blackhead its initial investment of 
R 650 000,00.  Its proportionate share of the rental 
income, 
less 
any 
expenses 
incurred 
for 
the 
maintenance of the property.”   
 
Now we know there is no rental income.  Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, you will have to say yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And 3: 
“An amount equal to R 65 000,00 per annum in 
respect of the capital appreciation of the property.” 
 
Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 100 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If, however, and I am referring to 2.8 
now.   
“If the property is disposed of, sold and that 
agreement, each party shall receive their initial 
investigation.  The parties agreed to share the 
capital appreciation and the parties will share any 
rental income less expenses.” 
Correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But again, we know there is no 
10 
rental income.  Of course, the is an anomaly in paragraph 
2.7 which says that if the property is not sold, Blackhead is 
paid out and says where after the trust shall retain full 
ownership in and to the property.  Of course, it has always 
had full ownership, you know that, correct? 
MR MOKHESI:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a clause and the import of 
those clauses are a matter for argument and submissions 
and we can deal with that independently.  Paragraph 8: 
“The 
parties 
confirm 
that 
the 
terms 
of 
this 
20 
agreement 
and 
negotiations 
leading 
up 
to 
its 
conclusion are confidential and will not be disclosed 
to any third party.” 
Why was it necessary to insert that clause? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what clause is that? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 101 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   8, okay. 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, Chair, I took this as a standard 
agreement between two – in any way it does not in any 
event exclude parties like commissions or legal – but not 
private parties.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It appears to exhibit an intention to 
keep the terms of this agreement secret.  Otherwise what 
you will see [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MOKHESI:   Only for – only for the people who are – 
10 
the Commission is, for example, I am just making an 
example.  Commission is entitled to this information. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not saying it has been 
breached.  What I am asking is why have it in the 
agreement in the first place if not to keep this agreement 
secret? 
MR MOKHESI:   No, Chair, I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No comment? 
MR MOKHESI:   No comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us then move to the findings of 
20 
the Public Protector, they appear in bundle FS3.  It is not 
necessary for you to go there, let me just introduce the 
series of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that, Mr Pretorius, I am sorry, 
before that.  This agreement, Mr Mokhesi, as I said, was 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 102 of 244 
 
concluded 
about 
what, 
five, 
six 
months 
after 
the 
appointment of the joint venture to do the job. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now there was a part of the job that had 
not been done, namely the removal of asbestos.  So this 
agreement was entered into at a time when Blackhead had 
been appointed to do a job that had two tasks.  Let us say 
it may have finished doing the first part but I had not 
started on the second party, namely the removal of 
asbestos, is it not and as far as you knew at the time you 
10 
took it that they were accredited to do the second part of 
the job.  So was it not problematic for you to do that? 
MR MOKHESI:   At the time …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, my question is, as HOD 
was it right for you to enter into this arrangement even if 
you were doing so through your family trust with Blackhead 
in circumstances where Blackhead had been appointed by 
your department to do a certain job the first part of which 
they may have finished but the second part of which was 
still to be done? 
20 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, I am sorry… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is it one of those? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, it is one of those.  The first part is 
quite, to be fair to you, Chair, you know, the first part 
where you obviously establishing the sequence, I think that 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 103 of 244 
 
is – I cannot object to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOKHESI:   But the second part where he either has to 
say that he was capable or not, clearly that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe if we do not look from a 
legal point of view, let us look at it from an ethical point of 
view.  How is that?  From an ethical point of view, Mr 
Mokhesi, was it fine for you to enter into this agreement in 
these circumstances at the time? 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, this was a commercial transaction, 
10 
Chairperson, you know, inviting somebody to come and 
invest 
with 
you 
on 
specific 
terms 
which 
are 
purely 
commercial and that individual could either have said yes 
or 
no, 
I 
am 
not 
interested, 
because 
it 
was 
purely 
commercial from that point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you entitled to enter into such a 
commercial transaction ethically as head of department 
with an entity that was in this position such as Blackhead 
at the time, namely had been appointed to do two tasks?  It 
had done one, there was still a task that it was still going 
20 
to do. 
MR MOKHESI:   So the Chair is saying on a commercial 
whether it…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   From an ethical point of view as HOD, 
you know, was it ethically appropriate for you to enter into 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 104 of 244 
 
this commercial transaction with a service provider to your 
department who one, had done the first part of the job but 
was still to do the second part? 
MR MOKHESI:   Okay, at – one was at around – at that 
particular point in time I think at – when we went to the 
second, indications were that they will – we will not 
continue and I will indicate what came out at that particular 
point in time.  It was a - you know, the differences in 
prices, the irregularity at that particular time was already 
flagged up not in terms of the other issues but in particular 
10 
in terms of the 650 versus 850.  So from our point that, you 
know, it will have ended there and then and not continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What would have ended then and there? 
MR MOKHESI:   I am saying the first phase and not the 
second phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MOKHESI:   Because it turns out, you know, that 650 
versus the 850 thing rendered the whole thing irregular. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   The entire – even though we later learned 
20 
that these other factors also came into play. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that at the time you 
entered into this commercial agreement, as you call it, with 
Blackhead, you had – you were aware, you had come to the 
conclusion that the contract was irregular, the contract with 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 105 of 244 
 
Blackhead to do this job and that therefore it was not going 
to – phase two as not going to be done. 
MR MOKHESI:    It was not going to – phase two was not 
going to – but also, Chairperson, not – also issues that I 
have learnt - where I learnt that this particular individual is 
involved in investment in properties and I already, as I 
have indicated earlier on, I did not - you know, I did not 
start with it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not what? 
MR MOKHESI:   Start with it, I started with family members 
10 
who were also involved in this particular investment in 
properties as …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, just …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   I learnt in the process that he is also – he 
also invests in properties and that is why I approached… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Let us – just to make 
progress, go back to my question.  I get the impression 
that your answer to my question is yes, it would not be 
ethically appropriate for you as HOD to have entered into 
this commercial transaction if Blackhead was still going to 
20 
continue and do the second part of the job.  Am I right? 
MR MOKHESI:   Let me put this way to you, perhaps 
maybe to assist.  Maybe on hindsight, Chairperson, to 
respond directly to that question, maybe I should not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So you are saying on hindsight? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 106 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
think 
it 
was 
not 
ethically 
appropriate. 
MR MOKHESI:   On hindsight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On hindsight, yes.   But at that time, you 
saw 
noting 
problematically 
about 
it 
or 
did 
you 
see 
something …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   Particularly because I saw this as a purely 
commercial transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   And that is why it had to be recorded in 
that manner and also my trusteeship as well be disclosed, 
you know, in the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Also, ja.  So it could …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So at that time, you did not see anything 
wrong with entering into this transaction from an ethical 
point of view, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:   At that time, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that was because you saw this as 
20 
simply a commercial transaction. 
MR MOKHESI:   I saw that as commercial transaction and 
also the disclosure of my trusteeship in a disclosure form.  
You know, we are also – every year we are required to 
disclose our… 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 107 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the issue about whether Blackhead 
was still going to do or not do the second part of the job, 
namely the removal of asbestos, that was not an issue that 
influenced you in …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
In 
entering 
into 
the 
commercial 
transaction. 
MR MOKHESI:   No, I was not influenced by that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not influenced by that.  But as 
a matter of fact, was that the position at that time or is 
there something that arose later namely that they were not 
going to do the second part of the job, namely the removal 
of asbestos? 
MR MOKHESI:   Well, it – we – because of, as I have 
indicated, because we learnt of the 650/850 at a later 
stage, it came to my attention that Treasury was not 
approached at that time because that was the only thing 
that we knew. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Plus as well as – because what prompted 
that was actually when the investigation of the Public 
Protector started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But you say that arose later? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 108 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   That arose later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So the only thing that made you 
believe that you could enter into this transaction with a 
service provider at that time was simply that this was a 
commercial transaction. 
MR MOKHESI:   It was a commercial transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that reason, Mr Mokhesi, does not 
sound convincing to me because if that was a good enough 
reason, it would mean government officials could have 
these commercial transactions with service providers any 
10 
time because they say commercial transaction whereas my 
understanding is ethically it is precluded because you do 
not want any perception that you may be doing favours for 
a particular service provider because of any transaction or 
arrangement or closeness that you may have with them. 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, I appreciate where you are coming 
from and I have indicated that on hindsight because I 
indicated it was a commercial transaction, my trusteeship 
was declared, I had no intention of hiding that transaction, 
it is auditable or it is traceable, you know, for lack of a 
20 
better word and one wanted to keep it in that particular 
level or a commerce transaction so that you deal with it in 
that particular case in an event that anything happens and 
I 
contributed 
substantially 
more 
in 
that 
particular 
transaction as well, in that particular transaction, just to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 109 of 244 
 
show what is it.  But maybe on hindsight I should not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, I have some difficulty in 
accepting – maybe later on when I have more time to look 
at everything, I might not have the difficulty but I have 
some difficulty in accepting the reason that you give as 
justification for entering into the transaction because I am 
thinking if any of your officials had come to you and said, 
you know, I want to have this kind of transaction with 
Blackhead while Blackhead was doing business with the 
department and they came to you as HOD for advice, would 
10 
you not have said no, you cannot do that?  Would you not 
have said that? 
MR MPOFU:   Yes, Chair.  I am sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mpofu? 
MR MPOFU:   Yes.  No, I object to that question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MPOFU:   Not so much again on the technicalities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MPOFU:   But in fairness to the witness, Chair, and of 
course I do not want to be putting words in the witnesses’ 
20 
mouth.  The witness has indicated, Chair, that the issue of 
disclosure, which is very important at least in the area that 
we are discussing now of the ethics of… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MPOFU:   And it is a grey area which is almost always 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 110 of 244 
 
I misunderstood, Chair, that the duties is not so much not 
to do something always rather than to disclose it, if you 
have done it, so that let us postulate what the Chair was 
talking about earlier.  If the second phase – let us assume 
the second phase was still going to be tendered for, then 
Mr Mokhesi would have had a duty not to sit, for example, 
in that decision making on the basis of the disclosure that 
he would have made of this transaction.  That is where his 
ethical duties stand, not so much that he must not breach 
or speak to someone or not even do a commercial deal if 
10 
he wants to but he must – as he long he knew the ethical 
consequences would be that, then he would not be able to 
adjudicate on anything.  So it is an objection in that light. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand what you say. 
MR MPOFU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, you know, as the HOD and the 
accounting officer, I expect that from time to time officials 
would come to him for guidance. 
MR MPOFU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I just want to see how he would have 
20 
– yes, thank you.  How would you have advised an official 
in your department saying HOD …[intervenes] 
MR MPOFU:   Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, let me finish. 
MR MPOFU:   Oh. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 111 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   HOD, here is my situation, I want to do 
exactly what you did, I want to do it but the service 
provider has a relationship with the department and so on 
and I do not want to do something wrong. 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, I will also do not want to do it, 
because it has never happened in my experience, it has 
never happened.  However, what normally happens is the 
disclosure part of it where you then pick it up because 
normally the adjudicators of that particular thing will be the 
Public Service Commission.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but remember, he is coming to you 
before he enters into the transaction.  He is coming to you 
before he enters, he wants to know whether he is 
precluded from entering into this kind of transaction. 
MR MOKHESI:   Chairperson, it has never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is the position of the 
department? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, it has never happened that somebody 
comes and I will want to know any DG or HOD who said 
staff members has come on this particular thing.  All they 
20 
have to comply – because there are rules. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   All they have to comply with are the rules 
that are set out in terms of that and then you measure that 
against those particular rules. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 112 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would the rules permit him to enter 
into this kind of transaction provided he discloses or would 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, there are disclosures that we have 
because you also have to – you have to disclose that.  Now 
I think lately there has been a rule that says you cannot do 
business with the state, right, as I say, but before you 
could provide you disclose, you know?   And those are the 
developing trends over time and so on. 
 
Now to ask me that question in a way, you know, is 
10 
actually unfair to me because it has never happened.  You 
can put it to any HOD or DG and that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is just – it calls for knowledge of 
the rules or policies of the department to say as HOD I 
know that we have a policy that says A, B, C about this or I 
know the policies do not say anything about this or I know 
they say you may do it provided you do this or that, that is 
what the question calls for.  But if you say look, I do not 
know what my advice would have been, that is what you 
can say. 
20 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know what the answer would 
have been.  Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Two points arising out of that, 
Chair.  The first is that we know that at the time the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 113 of 244 
 
agreement between Mr Sodi and Mr Mokhesi or his trust 
was entered into, payments were still continuing in relation 
to the so-called first phase, if that reference can be made 
and 
they 
were 
being 
continued 
in 
controversial 
circumstances and we have heard evidence about that, 
notwithstanding, 
for 
example, 
the 
Auditor-General’s 
findings of irregularity of the underlying agreement.  So 
that is the first issue.  It is a matter of record, we need not 
take it further. 
 
But the second point is a more general point, of 
10 
course, Chair, is that the matter of concern to the 
Commission and the evidence leaders not only that this 
conduct might be criminal activity but it appears from 
evidence, including this evidence, but other evidence as 
well that it is very easy to disguise a transaction, it may be 
a transaction that is said to be a deposit on a car or a 
repayment of a debt or payment of a debt accumulated in a 
pub, there are various ways that it can be done and it 
seems that a line must be drawn where, as a matter of 
policy, this type of activity is not allowed, whether 
20 
legitimate or illegitimate to avoid this type of matter 
happening.  So if I may move on to the Public Protector 
issues, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Who prepared this agreement for 
you, Mr Mokhesi? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 114 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, I made an input on this agreement 
and I gave it to Mr Sodi to finalise and make an input as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was not lawyer involved. 
MR MOKHESI:   No, certainly not from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So he …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   Certainly, from my side because I was 
inviting him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Sodi was ultimately responsible 
for putting it together with your input? 
10 
MR MOKHESI:   With my input. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  On the disclosure – 
I am sorry, on the disclosure, Mr Mokhesi, is it correct that 
the disclosure you are talking about is the disclosure 
within your department? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   My trusteeship in the trust. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what you disclosed was that you 
are a trustee of your family trust, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not disclose that you received – 
you 
did 
not 
disclose 
that 
Mr 
Sodi 
had 
made 
this 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 115 of 244 
 
contribution in this commercial transaction of which the 
family trust was [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MOKHESI:   No but, Chair, this is not in my personal 
capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is in your family …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   Because an impression here is created 
that I received it in my personal capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Now this is a joint venture between – 
okay, maybe …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   A commercial transaction. 
MR MOKHESI:   A commercial between two individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   I hold a trusteeship and I did disclose who 
the trustees including the beneficiaries are in that trust 
plus the – what the number because you also have to 
disclose that particular issue and from time to time the 
Public Service Commissions who investigate all this, once 
you disclose whether it is your membership in a company 
and so on and so on, they do independently investigate 
20 
those and a few months later they give out a report about 
what parties are doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the family trust had not been used in 
this transaction and you had entered into this arrangement 
with Mr Sodi in your personal capacity, would you have had 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 116 of 244 
 
to 
disclose 
in 
the 
department 
that 
there 
was 
this 
arrangement?  
MR MOKHESI:   Chair, I will not - you know, my marginal 
tax rate is 45%, okay?  Now I cannot use and receive the 
money directly.  You know, you have to use some sort of a 
tax-efficient structure in a way because I am at the highest 
at 45% and this might be – if it comes directly – and this is 
what informed the formation of a structure like that in the 
main, right?  Number one. 
 
Number two – and also you do not want to mix up – 
10 
because I also have assets and properties in my personal 
capacity between myself and my spouse.  Now, if you bring 
in a third party in this type of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mokhesi, what is the answer to 
my question, is it yes, you would have had to disclose it if 
you had entered into it in your personal capacity or is it no, 
it would not have had …[intervenes] 
MR MOKHESI:   Yes, no, you have to disclose it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have had to disclose it. 
MR MOKHESI:   In a personal capacity. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOKHESI:   Like all others that are in my personal 
capacities that I am disclosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So one advantage of using the trust to 
enter into this transaction is that you would not have to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 117 of 244 
 
disclose this amount because you did not get into the 
arrangement in your personal capacity, is that right? 
MR MOKHESI:   It is not an advantage? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOKHESI:   It is not an advantage, it is a commercial 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, Mr Mokhesi, it is an advantage 
because you told me that you could not get a hundred 
percent bond, you needed a place for accommodation.  
ABSA could not give you a full bond, you needed somebody 
10 
in order to get accommodation beyond R1 million.  You 
spoke to Mr Sodi, this arrangement was done, you were 
then able to live in the house.  That is a benefit, is it not, 
the advantage otherwise you would not have had. 
MR MPOFU:   Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu? 
MR MPOFU:   I am sorry, sir, I thought my day was going 
to be easy but it looks like it is not.  Chair, with greatest of 
respect that is exactly the question that Mr Pretorius 
refrained from asking.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MPOFU:   That you are putting about the benefit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MPOFU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, I will not insist that he 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 118 of 244 
 
answers it. 
MR MPOFU:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius, continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is related question which is 
not prohibited by the regulation, Chair, if I may ask it.  Mr 
Mokhesi, how many of the other beneficiaries or trustees 
enjoyed rent-free accommodation of the property? 
MR MOKHESI:   I am the only one staying in that house.  I 
am the only person who stays in that house.  I have 
indicated that that is not my primary residence. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on to the last issue if 
we may, Mr Mokhesi, and that is the Public Protector ’s 
findings.  I certainly do not want to invite long debate in 
reviewing the Public Protector 
report but the Public 
Protector did make certain findings and if you wish to 
highlight anything, any fact that you might be aware of to 
challenge the particular finding I am going to put to you, 
you are of course free to do so and it is fair to give you 
that opportunity because no doubt the Chair will take 
account of the findings.  So I am going to put to you 
20 
several findings and you can just say no comment or yes, I 
know a fact that calls that into question or I agree with the 
finding, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Mpofu seems to want to 
…[intervenes] 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 119 of 244 
 
MR MPOFU:   Yes, Chair, again I do not want to baffle Mr 
Pretorius but he can make a choice, so it is not a formal 
objection but, for the record, the witness does not wish to 
challenge any finding made by the Public Protector or 
comment on it at this stage.  If he wants to review the 
Public Protector ’s report he will do it like everyone else, so 
I do not see the futility of reading the report to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, if Mr Mokhesi, you are happy 
with that statement, I think in any event you are bound by 
law by your representative’s statement. 
10 
MR MPOFU:   It is binding, anyway. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you don’t want to challenge any 
of the Public Protector ’s findings, we can leave it there. 
MR MOKHESI:   Ja, I take legal advice from both my 
counsel so...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you pay him [laughing]. 
MR MOKHESI:   And I pay him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the law says you are bound by 
what you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are not paying him peanuts 
20 
[laughing]. 
MR MOKHESI:   Well Chair I will take the stand.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then I do not have further 
questions, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 120 of 244 
 
MR MOKHESI:   Thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mokhesi I just want to make this 
comment and you may want to say something you might not 
have something to say.  Incidentally I seem to see some 
parallel or some common features between what you said 
in relation to the disclosure of the question of disclosure of 
your trusteeship or non-disclosure of the amount because 
as you say it was nothing with the evidence of Mr Vincent 
Smith who gave evidence here some weeks ago.  You 
might 
or 
might 
not 
have 
listened 
to 
his 
evidence 
10 
but…[intervene]    
MR MOKHESI:   Mr Who? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Vincent Smith he is a member of 
parliament or was a member of parliament I am not sure.  
He - while he was in parliament he had – on his version he 
had entered into a loan agreement with Mr Agrizzi of 
BOSASA for a certain amounts so that they could use that 
amount to pay for his daughter ’s studies overseas that he 
said that amount should be paid into the account of his 
company not to him personally that was done in regard to I 
20 
think at least one amount.   
But from BOSASA’s - but when their lawyers sent 
that amount they said it was in regard to an accident, a car 
accident settlement but he insisted he said he had 
disclosed the company which received the money in his 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 121 of 244 
 
disclosure 
in 
parliament, 
disclosure 
documents 
in 
parliament but he had not disclosed the amounts.  So in 
your situation you have disclosed your trusteeship of the 
family trust but not the amount on your side because you 
say you were not getting this money personally.   
So I am just saying there is another case or another 
witness who has given evidence which seems to have some 
similar features at least to some of the features of your 
evidence and incidentally on your version your commercial 
transaction with Mr Sodi of Blackhead was entered into in 
10 
2015 and you say it was for - there was the arrangement 
that after seven years if the property could be sold he to, 
he said his loan with Mr Agrizzi was entered into between 
2015 and the repayment was going to be on the – to 
happen after seven years which is 2023, same 2023 as 
yours.  So…[intervene] 
ADV MPOFU:   Chair, Chair. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I am just saying I am observing 
just certain features you might not wish to say anything. 
[laughing]  
20 
ADV MPOFU:   Yes, Chair he does not wish to say 
anything.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. [laughing].  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU:   No Chair on a serious note the – I hear 
what the Chair is saying. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 122 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV MPOFU:   But I mean I do not know maybe Mr Smith’s 
thing amounts to a criminal offence so I would not advise 
him to comment on any similarities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine.  Do you wish to 
reason or? 
ADV MPOFU:   No Chair, okay thank you very much Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius you are done.      
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair it is safe to point out 
that the value for money issue was clearly found by the 
10 
Public 
Protector 
against 
the 
department 
the 
Public 
Protector found no value for money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright I think Mr, might have 
mentioned that as well. 
ADV MPOFU:   Well Chair now Mr Pretorius is provoking 
me. [laughing] Chair my understanding was that he is 
partly right.  So my understanding was that as the witness 
stated certainly there was some value for money whether it 
amounted to two hundred and fifty or not that is a 
debatable issue but certainly it is not as if there was just 
20 
money that was drawn out there was some work that was 
done but I am sure that what Mr Pretorius meant, ja.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Well 
the 
findings 
remain 
unchanged. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 123 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we at twenty to two Mr Mokhesi 
thank you very much for coming back to give evidence and 
I will excuse you now and if a need arises for the 
Commission to request you to come back, I am sure you 
will come back.  But thank you very much and thank you to 
Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are going to adjourn for lunch and 
resume at twenty to three.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you ready Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  The next witness 
will deal with the housing matter and his name is Mr 
Tsoametsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have a file that does not seem to 
have his statement here FS17, is that the file I am supposed 
to have? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  He does not have a 
signed affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Well I saw an earlier one or rather I 
saw a file that had his statement and I also saw one that had 
his… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it is unsigned Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transcript.  So but you say I have got 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 124 of 244 
 
the right one here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I will take you through what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is relevant Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath. 
REGISTRAR:  Please keep the microphone on.  Please state 
your full names for the record. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Mmuso Martin Tsoametsi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:    Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may continue Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsoametsi there 
is a draft affidavit on record but it has not been attested to 
by yourself, am I correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In fact, it is a draft of the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 125 of 244 
 
investigators. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
But 
you 
did 
interview 
the 
investigators and there is a transcript of that interview.  I will 
just give the info – reference for the record Chair.  It is at 
FS13 page 486 and following.  You also gave evidence 
before a disciplinary inquiry in fact on two occasions, you 
recall that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I think it is one occasion but that is 
correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well you were recalled as I 
understand it to give evidence very briefly. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  It is possible yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway, those references are in 
FS17 page 767 and following and FS8 page 441 and 
following.  If I may refer you to Bundle FS17 page 767 
please.  If you would go to page 767 please. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I am there.  767? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This is the transcript of your 
evidence before the disciplinary inquiry. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And I will in due course refer to it.  
During 2010 and 2011 Mr Tsoametsi what position did you 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 126 of 244 
 
hold? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I was Deputy Director General Local 
Government and Traditional Affairs.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In the Free State Province. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  In the Free State Province. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  We know that there were 
various divisions and changes of name in the Free State 
housing or Human Settlements Department. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The 20 – 2009/2010 financial year the 
department was called the Department of Local Government 
10 
and Housing which means it had one Head of Department 
and two branches.  One for housing and the other one for 
Local Government and Traditional Affairs.  And I was 
responsible for Local Government and Traditional Affairs. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To whom did you report/ 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I reported to the HOD then who was Mr 
Kopung Ralikontsane. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have a B.Prop degree I 
understand? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Have you ever practiced law? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have heard evidence about the 
sequence of events in 2010/2011 Mr Tsoametsi and I do not 
intend to take you through all those events.  They become 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 127 of 244 
 
relevant you will no doubt raise them when they do become 
relevant.  But as I understand it and if I could take you 
please to FS13.  As I understand it at some stage a meeting 
was called to deal with the question of under spending in the 
department, do you recall that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is dealt with in Bundle 13 at page 
485 and following.  Just to place this document on record.  I 
am sorry page 485 of FS13.   
MR TSOAMETSI:  Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now you were interviewed by the 
investigators of the commission during February of 2020, 
correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what appears at page 485 of 
Bundle FS13 and following pages is a transcript of your 
interview. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Once again this interview deals with 
various matters and to the extent that you take issue with 
20 
the contents of the transcript you of course may do so.  But 
for the moment we at least from our side are going to 
assume that it is a correct transcript. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go to page 497 of that 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 128 of 244 
 
bundle please.  The department would have submitted a 
business 
plan 
to 
the 
National 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements for the year 2010/2011 correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what occurred during the course 
of the year was that the National Minister notified the MEC 
and the DG at the Province or the Head of Department at the 
Province that there was a problem of under spending.  That 
has been the subject of much evidence – we need not go 
into the detail what I am interested is – in is the response to 
10 
that notice.  Correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So the MEC and HOD receive a 
notice from the National Minister to the effect that the 
Province in the Human Settlements Department is under 
spending and the Minister requires some sort of response.  
That is the position where we start, correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes the Minister… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The Minister indicated under expenditure 
20 
and requested the Province to present a plan of how do I 
deal with the under expenditure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And that we have known as the 
expenditure recovery plan? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 129 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was a meeting then called in the 
Province to deal with that request from the Minister? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You deal with that at page 504 of the 
transcript.  By way of introduction you paraphrase the letter 
from the Minister at page 504.  It is not really a quote of the 
letter it is your paraphrasing of what the letter contained.  
You say the letter says: 
“We are concerned we are not going to spend 
and normally goods so in the event you do 
10 
not have 
a plan.  The money will be 
redirected to a province in need of additional 
funds or redirected back to the National 
Housing office.  Please present a plan.” 
 
Now although those were not the exact words of the 
communication that is the import of the communication? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  It is a general principle that is applicable 
in dealing with spending and under expenditure by the 
relationship between National and Provinces. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In response to that 
20 
communication a meeting was called as you have said. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That meeting would have taken place 
during September/October 2010? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Correct. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 130 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who chaired that meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  In the first meeting that I was invited in 
the chair was – or the MEC was present and the CFO was 
present.  The HOD was not in the Province in that first 
meeting.  I think he had an official engagement outside the 
Province.  So the CFO stood in for her and the MEC was 
also present in that meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And who was the CFO? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But who chaired the meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I was not party to the original meeting 
10 
Chair because I was called into a meeting that – where 
people were already sitting.  So because the MEC is the 
most senior in that meeting it was the meeting of the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so it would be the MEC. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The MEC Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who chaired the meeting. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is Mr Zwane. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you were present? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I was called in then yes I was present. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were called after the meeting had 
started? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 131 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have an idea how long after it had 
started or you do not know? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I think it should have just been after 
maybe they have done a role call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh just … 
MR TSOAMETSI:  And then they ask who else is here then 
people said no Tsoametsi is in his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So I was called. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so… 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Because when the meeting started and 
the purpose of the meeting was explained I was in the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so for all intents and purposes you 
were there. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I was in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were there throughout the meeting. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of substance. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright you deal with the content of 
the meeting on page 507 towards the second part of that 
page.  What was discussed?  How did the Chair deal with the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 132 of 244 
 
meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The principle Chair was that we have 
received this concern from the Minister the Province is 
expected to develop a plan.  I am expecting officials to 
develop a plan.  And that is when we started to say what is it 
that we can do as officials. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Were various problems associated 
with the under-spending issue discussed? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  In order for us to deal with a problem we 
had to go through what I will call for purposes of this 
10 
presentation a project plan that when you – when you build a 
house you first need to make sure that you have the 
necessaries.  So the question was asked officials that are 
responsible for beneficiaries what is the – what is the plan; 
how far are you?  Make sure that everything that needs to be 
done in relation to beneficiaries are attended to.   
 
The second will be the component that deal with land 
availability.  Sites so that people are able to build.  So those 
officials were then mandated to do exactly that. 
 
The there was a third responsibility that deals with 
20 
technical officials that will then have to be in contact with 
organisation like NHRC that deals with technical quality 
assurance.  They had to deal with that.  
 
Then there were issues…. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry to interrupt.  The NHBRC? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 133 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Then there were issues around ensuring 
that the approved projects will then be captured.  Normally 
we use a system – electronic system called HSS which is 
where approved projects, list of beneficiaries, sites will then 
be captured.  So that had to be dealt with.  And all that was 
then populated in terms of the – the plan and from there we 
then said how then do we turn around the original plan to 
meet the current challenge? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You said on page 509 of the 
transcript at the bottom of the page that after the problems 
had been discussed and I quote you: 
“That is where I come in.  A meeting says 
can you go and investigate?  What is it that 
can be done?  So I go out of the meeting.” 
 
And Mr Swanepoel the investigator says to you: 
“So who directed you?” 
 
And you answer: 
“The meeting it is a decision of the meeting 
20 
that we said yes.” 
 
Just explain please to the Chair what was happening 
there? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Chair I thought we were still dealing with 
the development of the turnaround plan.  The second 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 134 of 244 
 
meeting that is being talked about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Is the second meeting… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That came later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That was dealing with different scenarios. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Oh okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So I will suggest that we deal with the 
plan, we conclude the plan and then we will go to the second 
10 
phase which is the second meeting that now dealt with the 
issues of advances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it is not clear from the transcript 
here that there were actually two meetings.  In fact, the – as 
one reads it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is your recollection that there were two 
separate meetings? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  There were – there were more than – 
there have been many meetings Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are many meetings. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  But for the relevance of what we – we are 
talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  It is where the MEC was present. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 135 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Remember we will then be going as 
officials 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  To develop this turnaround strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  And look into technical issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us go back then to that meeting. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  To the plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us just say there is this meeting that 
10 
you have testified about. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was chaired by the MEC. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where the HOD Mr Mokoena was not 
present. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the CFO stood in for him. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that meeting did you say that it ended 
20 
on the basis that a turnaround plan must be developed? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is the one Chair I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And different people who were 
attending the meeting had different issues to attend to? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct Chair. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 136 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What part were you required to 
attend to? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  In that there was no part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had no part in that one. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No that – I had no responsibility that I had 
to follow up on at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So who were required to do 
what in terms of that meeting about the – the turnaround 
plan? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Like I said Chair it – in that meeting it was 
10 
executive managers so it was Chief Directors in the main. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So the chief director who is responsible 
for 
the 
area 
that 
deals 
with 
land 
issues 
was 
then 
commissioned to go and look at those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The Chief Director responsible for 
technical issues, engineering services was then given the 
responsibility to deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The Chief Director that was responsible 
for planning and consolidation of all this information I think 
Maxatshwa was for planning.  The Chief Director for 
technical services Mamike Mogele and then the Director for 
technical services engineering I think it is Ndada Koloi. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 137 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So those were the type of colleagues that 
had to go and deal with responsibilities according to their job 
description. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the responsibilities that they were 
given – the tasks that they were given those were intended 
to form part of the turnaround plan? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is consolidated turnaround plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would consolidate and put together 
what they – the product of what they were going to do. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So the meeting ended on that basis. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there an arrangement as to time 
frames to say how much time did, they have to do this?  By 
when the turnaround plan should be ready? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That – that was the first decision that was 
taken in that meeting.  The second decision was that we are 
going to be meeting weekly and then we will produce this 
document and we will present it to the MEC and the HOD for 
20 
their 
approval 
and 
then 
based 
on 
their 
approval 
or 
disapproval we will then take the process forward.  So we 
were then meeting almost on a weekly basis and on a 
fortnight type of arrangement then the MEC will then come 
and see what is the progress in relation to finalising the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 138 of 244 
 
plan.  Now in the second meeting when… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh before the second meeting.  This first 
meeting you say was around what September or somewhere 
in September? 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
Ja 
just 
September 
early 
October 
somewhere around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  If I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then you say from then on you 
had weekly meetings? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  We had – just officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without the MEC? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you had bi-weekly meetings 
which involved the MEC? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the weekly meetings did they involve 
the HOD? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The – no the weekly meetings – if he is 
available Chair he will come but in the main it was us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  As officials. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 139 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Those are consolidating this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he would be present at the bi-weekly 
meetings? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  At the bi - yes.  Because those will then 
be the meeting where we are now expecting the buy in and 
the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At a certain stage I guess the 
consolidation – the turnaround plan became ready, is that 
right? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  It became ready. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long after the first meeting did it 
become ready more or less? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I think within – within a space of two – two 
and a half weeks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Because remember all the information was 
available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Projects had been approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Contractors have been identified and 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So it was a question of saying how do we 
make sure that we fast track spending in relation of the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 140 of 244 
 
different milestones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Taking into account that we are only left 
with November, December and January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  And utilising that period develop a 
turnaround plan and ensure that we – when it is approved, 
we go and we present it to the list of approved contractors 
and if they buy in into that we are then able to forward it to 
National and say this is our plan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Which we should be able to implement it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius do you want take over? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  These meetings that took place on a 
regular basis were these the so called War Room meetings? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you say every second week they 
would be chaired by the MEC? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Second week yes by the MEC or the HOD. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  Let us go to the point where 
20 
you came in.  Where one of these meetings said to you 
please go and investigate what can be done? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that one of the bi-weekly? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No Chair. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 141 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no it is a separate one. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just let me – just ask for your 
indulgence for a moment. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We do not have a sworn statement of 
yours to work off. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No I am fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We only have your interview and so 
there may be some… 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Sequential… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Some disconnect in the sequencing I 
accept that one hundred percent but that is all I have to go 
to.  So – but I would like you to deal with that meeting. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Well in dealing with this meeting now 
Chair.  After – after we have received an in principle 
approval of the turnaround plan, we went to Welkom to go 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry – In principle approval by 
whom? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  By the HOD and the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Then we went to Welkom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that would have happened around 
about when? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 142 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That will now be in the middle of October 
towards… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Middle of October. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes.  Now we are moving towards 
November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was approved is what we have 
here as a.. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Ja what do we call it? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  A recovery plan. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Recovery plan yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what was approved. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is the one I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then you took that to Welkom? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So the recovery plan had an implication 
for the implementation on contractors. Because you needed 
to get their buy in for it to be realised.  So that is where – 
that is the reason why we had to go to the meeting of 
Welkom and meet these contractors.  So the… 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Before you go to the Welkom meeting 
it is important that we get the sequencing right.  In – just 
have a look please at page 510.  At the top of the page you 
say: 
“All these things that I am talking is now 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 143 of 244 
 
resolutions of the meeting to say we need to 
have a plan on this element so people must 
go out within the next five days, get what you 
can 
get 
so 
that 
you 
develop 
this 
implementation plan.  So my responsibility 
was to say, how do we support contractors to 
get material and then you say, I called the 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
in 
Gauteng. 
 
They 
told 
you 
about 
the 
relationship with the builder’s market and 
10 
after that the meeting was called at Welkom.” 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that is what this transcript says 
but you – we are asking for your evidence. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I am saying the meeting of Welkom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Dealt with the issue of the implementation 
of the turnaround plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  And that meeting raised certain issues. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second before you proceed. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
– 
the 
turnaround 
plan 
or 
the 
expenditure recovery plan. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes.  Expenditure – oh let me – 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 144 of 244 
 
expenditure recovery plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just – ja let us stick to the same 
terminology. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Ja I .. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Otherwise 
somebody 
who 
reads 
the 
transcript will be confused whether we are talking about 
something else.   
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the expenditure recovery plan. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The contractors would need to buy in into 
because it contemplated work being done building of the – 
building of houses during the December holidays, is that 
right? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why you needed their buy in among 
other reasons. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So you go to this meeting at 
Welkom and this is a meeting of officials of the Department. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  And the MEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the MEC with the contractors. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Continue. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  At that meeting… 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 145 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But before you go to that meeting, I 
know you will continue in due course.  When did you speak 
to the Department of Human Settlements in Gauteng?  
Before or after this meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  After this meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  After this meeting.  I will explain what 
triggered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  This.  So we go to this meeting then 
10 
contractor raises three pertinent challenges that they are 
confronted with.  The first challenge that they raised is the 
challenge to say it is – we are going to the festive period.  
Availability of material might be a challenge. 
 
Secondly, we have a challenge of access to finance. 
 
Thirdly by saying – by us as a department or as 
government saying to them that they must intensify where 
during the December festive period it will then require that 
they must employ more people which then means that they 
will have to be spending a lot of money with relation to the 
20 
labour costs. 
 
So these are the issues that they are raising.  So we 
take – we take note of those issues and we came back to 
Bloemfontein.  And this meeting that is being referred to then 
took place. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 146 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the issues they raised is it the fact 
that they might have to employ more people and the fact that 
there might be – so they would need money and the fact that 
there might be challenges in getting material.  Those are the 
two issues they raised. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Those three issues that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That I mention out of contractors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which contractors were invited to the 
10 
meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The contractors – the project recovery 
plan.  That would be the contractors that we have appointed 
and approved as contractors that are implementing projects 
of 2010/2011. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say they were appointed? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That is my assumption. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Who appointed them? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The normal procedure of appointing Chair 
in the department... just to go back a little bit.  2009/2010, 
20 
whilst we were still in that department I have talked about, 
we have issued a tender.   
 
Or even before that, I think, yes it is 2009 and we issued 
a tender and we requested PWC to assist us to develop a 
database and to be able to create different categories of 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 147 of 244 
 
contractors according to their functionalities.   
 
So that would then have been the data from the 
database that was utilised during that period but this 
database ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Twenty... or two-thousand and... 
MR TSOAMETSI:   2004 to 2009, it was an administration... 
after the election it was a particular administration.  So 
during this period of this administration, we invited... we 
issued out a tender with PWC that developed database to 
run housing for that period. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So in 2009, it then expired.  It means, 
you need to re-advertise and get a new tender to be able to 
develop a database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Database. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So that is the process that we will follow, 
informed by the Supply Chain Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So when I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   When I say they were appointed Chair 
because I was not partied to that process.  I will assume that 
it is in alignment with that Supply Chain Management 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 148 of 244 
 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  But the point is, you knew about 
the database that applied during the period 2004 and 2009. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   2004 to 2009.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know whether there was a 
database that was appointed after that. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you assumed that there was. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, that... if I say, contractors are 
appointed in Human Settlements ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   ...I assumed that it had followed that 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we know from evidence given 
in the last week Mr Tsoametsi that in 2010 a new data base 
was formed. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Following the same process? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, not following any competitive 
tender process.  Well, following a tender process that was 
20 
abandoned.  That is what happened in 2010. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I will not understand, Chair.  My 
understanding of a general principle is that the accounting 
officer will implement the Supply Chain Management policy 
of a department.  And it will then require that you should go 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 149 of 244 
 
out and advertise.  And then through that process be able to 
develop.  Now, if there has been deviation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When develop a database or develop 
what? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   To go through the same process that we 
had gone through, 2004 and 2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To open a database? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Now if there has been a deviation from 
10 
that process, it should be a deviation that is approved by the 
accounting officer.  So I am not so sure.  Are we talking 
about him deviating from that normal process and approving 
the deviation or what are we talking about? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, Mr Tsoametsi.  We are talking 
about your knowledge.  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.  I do not know ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not your assumptions for the 
moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, h’m. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   There are ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have been told that in 2010, 
there 
was 
indeed 
a 
public 
procurement 
process 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Okay. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 150 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...that was initiated.  The tender 
period expired.  Oh, the tender validity period expired and 
the tender process was not reinstated or corrected.  It was 
abandoned and a database was then compiled from various 
sources, a new database in 2010.  That is what we know 
from the evidence.  Do you know that that was not the case? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So I am asking then.  This database 
that was used to inform the selection of contractors to be 
invited to the Welkom meeting, do you know where that came 
10 
from? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The database? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   It ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But all I am saying to you is, who 
was invited to the Welkom meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I have just said it... my assumption is that 
it is contractors that we approved to implement projects that 
were contained in the expenditure recovery plan. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Now, how... what I am saying 
20 
is.  Who appointed those contractors or how were appointed? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And I have just explained Chair that my 
knowledge is that they get appointed through the process of 
going out on tender, developing a database, selecting from a 
database, having recommending(?) to the MEC that these 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 151 of 244 
 
are the contractors that must be appointed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You... 
should 
you 
not 
answer 
Mr 
Tsoametsi be you do not know because you do not know if 
and whether there was a database pursuant? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I have said that Chair but it looks like 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you do not know how they were 
appointed.  They were invited.  Is that right? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   At the Welkom meeting, they were 
invited. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they were invited but how they were 
selected ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to say, who must be invited, who must 
not be invited ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you do not know? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, that was outside my ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you assumed ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that they must have been on a 
database. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 152 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But whether that is so or not, you do 
not know. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I do not know, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Mr Tsoametsi, notwithstanding 
the fact that witnesses might be taken to task for saying I do 
not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sometimes it is a legitimate answer.  
[laughing]   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Where I can help, I will be more than 
willing to do so. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsoametsi.  Anyway, 
we know that contractors were invited, a tender bid at the 
Welkom meeting.  And you then, after that meeting, went 
back to the War Room. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And was it at that stage that you 
were given a task to perform? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So in this meeting ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, just before you go on.  When 
would that meeting have taken place?  Sometime in 
November? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair, it is should still be within the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 153 of 244 
 
October.  If it is in November, it should have been maybe 
early.  Early.  I am not definitely sure in terms of the dates 
but it is at this meeting that now we are reflecting on the 
outcome of the meeting of Welkom and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was attending this meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The meeting was chaired by the MEC, 
attended by the same teams that... the HOD was there.  It 
was the meeting of the MEC and the HOD.  And the CFO was 
there.  And myself and all these colleagues that I have 
referred to as part of the executive management.  So it is in 
10 
this meeting that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And the CFO was Ms Dhlamini? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Dhlamini, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So in this meeting, we then discussed 
and reflected on the issues that have been raised by the 
contractors.  So the MEC asked the question:  Why can we 
not support contractors and get material for them?   
 
Because it is clear that if we are able to meet them 
halfway, they would be able to participate in this or that.  
20 
And we will be able to go a long way in delivering on the 
commitments that we have made.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  So following on... if I may just 
interrupt you to get the sequence right.  Your evidence is 
that following on from the Welkom meeting, there was, 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 154 of 244 
 
presumable, a report back to the War Room and the MEC 
then came up with that idea? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   He came up with that question.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Then in that meeting, it...  Chair, I will not 
be sure but you said I should not say I assume.  But what I 
will not be sure.  But the issue was raised to say:  No, in the 
previous projects of the previous year, we had a situation 
where we have partnered with Nurcha and we are able to buy 
material for contractors to be able to contract in the project. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the record.  That is n-u-r-c-h-a? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So discussions took place about, is this 
the right way to go about?  Will you be doing the right thing 
if we are saying we are buying material for...?    
 
So the meeting decided that I should go and do a 
research on this advancement be formed by the fact that 
there was this Nurcha advanced payment that had taken 
place.   
20 
 
So I am given this task to go out and research on this 
matter.   So that is where I started this research that I was 
talking about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  As I understand it.  The 
context in which that mandate was given to, was the tabling 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 155 of 244 
 
of a proposal or an idea that the contractors be helped in 
some way by prepayment or some other means.  And you 
were told:  Please, go and research this matter.  I 
understand that that would have been a factual research that 
you would... a piece of research you would do.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   The research were ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...go and see how it can be done. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Research whether it has been done with 
Nurcha.  That will be the first thing.  And secondly, as to how 
it can be done. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought you also said at the 
meeting it was said that you should look at whether it would 
be right to do things this way. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, I am saying the discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the discussions.  Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   It was not said that I should go and 
investigate whether it should be right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I mean, out of the discussions, many 
views are being expressed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   But the end results were that, go and 
investigate this advanced payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 156 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, if your mandate was go and 
investigate this issue, it could be argued that that included 
whether it will be lawful to do it, whether it would be 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Within the policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you got the right to do it within the 
policy. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whether it would be a wise thing to 
do. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, it could be argued to be quite 
broad. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, it is a broad mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a broad mandate. 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
 
You 
are 
being 
informed 
that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes 
MR TSOAMETSI:   ...go and see what is happening and 
come up with a plan. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is right.  Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, so are you... I would ask the 
question.  Is that how you understood the mandate to be as 
broad as that or not really? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 157 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I just... it is just to get this broad 
mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A broad mandate. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And I went out with that understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That this is this broad mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Go and out and see what is happening 
and comes with what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I think go into some detail and 
please itemise the mandate as you understood it.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Ja, like I said Chair, the mandate was, go 
out and investigate this advanced payment taking into 
account that in the previous year it was done with Nurcha.  
That is how it was ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   But we never had any elements. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, it never had any elements 
but you would go and investigate where it had been done 
20 
and how it had been done. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, that was at my... the where and the 
how is what came out of my initial draft. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So was in the mandate but the where 
and how came out of your initiative? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 158 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you... the mandate said:  Go and 
investigate this prepayment system.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   I do not know it.  Call it advance 
payment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Advance payment. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, call it so.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, that is maybe an important 
difference and the terminology but you had to go out and 
investigate this advance payment system.  There were no 
10 
specific mandates given to you with... other than that broad 
mandate.  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did you actually do then? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So the first step that I did Chair was to go 
into the resources of National Parliament and try and find 
out as to what presentation has been made at that level by 
the National Department in relation to housing.   
 
So if you go into all presentation of different portfolio 
committee, there is one.  Portfolio Committee on Housing.  
20 
That when national departments or any other entity appear, 
you are able to get their presentation of what is it that they 
are saying, what is the situation in relation to the sector.   
 
So that my first take.  So I went in there and I was able 
to get a presentation that deals with this area of 2009 to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 159 of 244 
 
2014, which is...  
 
Remember Chair, that after the election of 2209, we now 
moved away from just implementing a project.  We are now 
moving into a human settlement approach.   
 
So the policy was no longer housing but it now became 
human 
settlement. 
 
And 
because 
it 
became 
human 
settlement, it had different elements that are trying to assist 
government to deal with.   
 
So I went into that and I came across that presentation.  
And I also went into the National Department’s website and I 
10 
came across the policy on the creating new grounds which is 
a policy that was now giving meaning for this human 
settlements that we intend to implement.   
 
In 
reading 
that 
policy, 
a 
problem 
statement 
was 
presented in that policy and the breaking new grounds.  And 
to paraphrase that statement, it says.   
 
Since the new dispensation since 1994, in the sector of 
human settlement, established and well-resourced and well-
incapacitated 
contractors have 
pulled 
out 
of providing 
support government, creating an opportunity for SSME and 
20 
medium contractors who lacks capacity.   
 
In the main, they lacked capacity in financial access, in 
accessing material, quality material and in technical access.  
So in my mind, the same statement that was said by the 
contractors is now contained in a government policy to say, 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 160 of 244 
 
this is a problem within the sector.   
 
So I said to myself:  Yes, there is a diagnose.  But what 
is the prescription?  Then I started investigating contractor 
development or contractor support.  Who is doing that in the 
country?  Is there something like contractor development or 
contractor support?   
 
So I came across partnership established by Human 
Settlement Department of Gauteng.  I called then to say:  I 
am busy dealing with this type of research.   
 
I see that we had a partnership between... with the 
10 
private sector that you support contractors.  Can you give 
me more information on that?   
 
They then said:  No, speak to our legal section.  I spoke 
to the legal Section.  The legal section says:  Yes, we have 
what we call a tri-party agreement.   
 
The building material, the government and the contractor 
where government is supporting the contractor but there is 
also partnership with this building material company.   
 
I requested that copy to also be forwarded to me.  So it 
was forwarded to me.  So that was the second, now, part of 
20 
my research outcome.   
 
The third part was that I then went to Nurcha.  One thing 
to understand, whether is it factual that they had this 
programme of supporting contractors within together with us 
as the department.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 161 of 244 
 
 
When I went to them Chair, it was at a stage when they 
were closing their offices of Free State but there were still 
officials there.   
 
So the official then said to me:  No, but the person that 
was managing this whole thing is having a private company.  
Mr Herschel.  I do not remember.  Herschel Coetzee or so.   
 
So this company is first thing.  I called into the office.  I 
asked him:  Did you have something like this that you had 
managed?  And he gave me how they have managed it.  He 
gave me a how to mitigate the risk.   
10 
 
In everything that we had said Chair is that you need to 
have partnership with the material suppliers.  You need to 
have a very strong monitoring and evaluation team that 
would 
then 
be 
the 
one 
that 
is 
doing 
for 
yourself 
reconciliation of collecting of material and so forth.  So I 
came back now with these three outcome.    
 
And then I said, we have contracts with contractors.  Are 
we not able to amend the contract that we have and create 
an addendum through this process that will ensure that 
contractors are able to be supported so that the original 
20 
contract should then be able to be amended to include this 
support that we came about?   
 
And that is what led to me putting the document that I 
put and that I have submitted to the HOD for consideration.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  It seems to be that what you 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 162 of 244 
 
did, was you looked at parliamentary records, you looked at 
the Nurcha experience and you looked at certain other 
experiences in Gauteng.  Right?  And you collated all those 
and you transformed them into the ideas into your document. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So at no stage did you sit down with 
a 
particular 
proposal 
and 
go 
to 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management Act, the Housing Act or any other legislation 
10 
and 
compared 
the 
proposal 
to 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
legislation?  You did not do a technical legal opinion? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No.  For me it was around, here is what I 
have found.  I am of the view that maybe if we support the 
contractors through the contract that we have and we amend 
that contract and create an addendum through this tri-party 
system, we will have achieved what we wanted to achieve. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  What is of concern perhaps 
is, why was this being done in November of a financial year 
ending in March?  Why had this work not been done earlier? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair, because there was a concern 
triggered by the minister.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   The minister had raised to say:  Look, I 
have approved your plan.  We are now moving towards the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 163 of 244 
 
end of the financial year.  There is no performance. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  That I think is consistent with 
what the other witnesses are saying. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But the need for this plan was to 
address the problems of the minister ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...to avoid losing the money. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the question that arises Mr Tsoametsi 
10 
is.  Here you, officials of the department are there.  You 
were the Deputy Director General.  I do not know if you were 
the only one in that position.   
 
So you were the second in charge, I guess, in terms of 
hierarchy in the department.  Maybe the CFO was on the 
same level as yourself, I am not sure.  You were high up 
there.   
 
The department had been given more than one billion 
rand, had been allocated 1 point, 1 point 4.  I cannot 
remember how much of that came from the previous financial 
20 
year but more than one billion rand to build houses during 
the 2010/2011 financial year.  The letter of the minister, I 
think, came in October or is it September? 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
 
I 
think 
middle 
September 
or 
...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 164 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe September. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it looks like you were about five or six 
months of the financial year had gone.  And from what other 
witnesses have told me or at least one of them, no houses 
had been built as yet in terms of the 2010/2011 allocation.   
 
There 
might 
be 
houses 
that 
were 
built 
with 
the 
2009/2010 financial allocation.  Now why is that it takes the 
National Minister in Pretoria to get to you say:  Hey, man.  
There is a problem.  We are not building houses.  We are not 
10 
spending.   
 
You know, the money that has been allocated for the 
benefit of the people.  Why does it take somebody in 
Pretoria to say:  Hang on, what are you doing?   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair, that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are part of the leadership of the 
department. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I think Chair, there are two factors that I 
need to bring to attention.  The first one is that this 
department was in transition.  In transition in the sense that 
20 
now there was a determination to say you are now having 
two departments.   
 
This means that you are now going to have two heads of 
department.  Now that is number one.  Number two is that 
when you create that department, the people that gets to be 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 165 of 244 
 
transfer into Human Settlement is not a total well-oiled, well-
capacitated departments.   
 
Because remember, the department will have different... 
you will have corporate service for example.  When this 
transfer took place, Corporate Service did not go with it.  So 
they needed to create their own new Corporate Service.   
 
So the capacity was an issue with this department, 
number one.  Number two Chair.  I do not know whether it 
was put before you that there was a court challenge by 
contractors 
who 
were 
allocated 
for 
the 
previous, 
the 
10 
2009/2010, who took the provincial government to court 
because of the delays in allocating and appointing them.   
 
So there was also that legal matter that was dealt with.  
So yes, the delays are the delays that are internal through 
this all, dealing with all these challenges.  And the impact of 
that is therefore this delay therefore that...  
 
Like 
Mr 
Pretorius 
now 
says, 
that 
including 
the 
management of the SEM(?), it ended up expiring.  I mean, 
immediately it expires.   
 
It then means you are confronted with a challenge or 
20 
how now are you dealing with SEM when you have allowed 
this process to also collapse?   
 
Now Chair, the point... you will then maybe asking as to, 
these things that you are saying, why did you not say in the 
department?  That is like ...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 166 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The whole department was asleep. 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
 
Yes, 
that 
is 
what 
I 
wanted 
to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Until Mr Sexwale in Pretoria said:  Wake 
up! 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That is what where I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you not see what is happening? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That is what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are spending money you are not 
working. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.  That is where I want to come in 
Chair to say, I was not the DDG for both legs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were on Traditional Affairs. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I was on Traditional Affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 And 
maybe 
you 
can 
be 
forgiven.  
[laughing]   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Now, that is where I come in to say, this 
issue that I am... I am talking about these issues as second-
hand ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not under housing. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not dealing with housing. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I was not dealing with housing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The only time I came to know that getting 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 167 of 244 
 
involved in housing is when I was called in to that meeting 
for the first time, the one that we have dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is worrying.  I have mentioned it to 
one of the witnesses, maybe on Friday, about the lapsing of 
the tender validity period.   
 
I said, but the people who were involved are supposed 
to have made a judgment call at a certain stage, because I 
was told that there were too many bids that had been put in 
and dealing with them and processing them took time.   
 
That is why the period expired before the relevant 
10 
committee could make the necessary decision.  But I said, 
somebody should have made a judgment call to say:  If we 
have got so many bids, we will not be finished within this 
time.   
 
Therefore, we need to ask whoever has the authority to 
extent the period before it expires.  But it is like people were 
sleeping.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   You will have head Chair that I have said 
in that period of 2004 and 2009, we went out on tender but 
we also appreciated the fact that we do not have capacity 
20 
internally. 
 
And 
that 
is 
why 
we 
had 
appointed 
PricewaterhouseCoopers to be the one that is handling this 
volume.   
 
Because obviously, people will have interest and the 
volumes would always be there.  So that is why we had 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 168 of 244 
 
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to be the one that collate 
all this date, prepare it, present it to us and then accept it 
and if is approved then it became our database. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  During the latter part 
of October, beginning part of November and perhaps 
further into November you had two documents that have 
been relevant to the evidence that we have heard this 
week, perhaps last week.  
 
The first is the document that you prepared that 
10 
signed on the 25 November 2010.   
 
The second was a document we have referred to as 
the expenditure recovery plan, it was actually a slide 
presentation, correct?   
 
The one that you were involved in developing was 
the document, let us call it the 25 November document. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I will say I was part of both. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were you part of the [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I was part of – the fact that I did not 
20 
have specific function does not mean I was not part in. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I was part of that because I was part of 
that meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, now both documents had to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 169 of 244 
 
go 
to 
two 
committees 
which 
involved 
the 
National 
Department.  Could you tell the Chair what those meetings 
were? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, Chair, the point that I was trying to 
convey to the investigators, which might have not come 
clear on the transcripts, is that when the Minister raised 
concerns and he say develop a plan and let your HOD 
present that plan to the Director General, immediately the 
plans 
are 
developed, 
they 
HOD 
of 
Free 
State 
will 
communicate 
with 
his 
technical 
counterpart 
with 
the 
10 
Director General and share the plan with the Director 
General within intention that the Director General will then 
apply their mind and they advise the Minister.  That is one 
communication 
channel 
that 
I 
was 
explaining 
and 
I 
indicated to say this communication channel in terms of 
intergovernmental relations is called Mintech because it is 
where technical officials are meeting.  Then I have 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have referred to it or other 
witnesses have referred to it as technical Minmec. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
But 
what 
is 
the 
correct 
abbreviation? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The other way around, technical 
Minmec and then I am saying it is Mintech, so the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 170 of 244 
 
ministerial technical committee. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That sounds better. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.  Now the second part will then be 
the political oversight, political communication and that will 
be 
between 
the 
MEC 
that 
has 
the 
relationship 
to 
communicate with the Minister and the MEC will then be 
able to communicate and say in line with your concern, we 
have developed this plan and the plan has been forwarded 
to you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Those are the key channels [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So there are two – in fact these 
two channels took place, these communications through 
these two channels took place at two meetings we know 
that were held in November 2010 on the 18 and 19 
November of 2010.  On the 18 November there was a 
technical Minmec or a Mintech and on the 20 November 
there was the political oversight meeting, the Minmec, 
where the Minister would have been with the MEC. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that second meeting we know 
that 
the 
MEC 
and 
the 
HOD 
were 
not 
present, 
Mr 
Maxatshwa attended, right?  We have evidence as to what 
happened at that meeting or those meetings and we have 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 171 of 244 
 
evidence – we have the minutes actually, which we have 
dealt with but what is interesting, you told the investigators 
that Maxatshwa and Mokoena came back from those 
meetings or Maxatshwa come back, reported to Mokoena 
and Mokoena reported back.  What did they say? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair, what I have said to them is that 
the approval to implement the expenditure recovery plan – 
even as I am seated here today, I have never seen any 
documentation confirming that what you are proposing as a 
plan is not acceptable to us.  So based on that I assumed 
10 
that there was approval to implement.  
 
Then I also said, Chair, that there is letter that I 
have seen where the Minister was now threatening to take 
the money, that was written by the HOD to the Director 
General and when you look into that letter, somewhere it 
says based on the agreement that we have reached with 
the delegation from National, that meaning the delegation 
that was in the province, we agreed that we will be 
reporting on a quarterly basis to you.  If in the evidence 
there is such a letter I will appreciate if you can go to it. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will get there.  I will put 
…[intervenes] 
MR TSOAMETSI:   It will explain, Chair, that where do I 
come from when I say there was an approval. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well …[intervenes] 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 172 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But am I correct in saying – in 
understanding your evidence to be that you are not sure 
that there was approval but you thought that – or you 
assumed that there was approval. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The second part, Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Is that the document that I developed in 
November, after developing that document – remember, I 
received the instruction where the two authorities were in 
the meeting, the political authority and the administrative 
10 
authority which says go and research on this thing.  So 
when I developed that document, I gave it to the HOD.  I 
write it to the HOD and I gave it to him.  He approved the 
document – he will come and deal with that – he approved 
that document.  To me he said leave this document, I will 
come back to you.  He later called me around about five 
and say the document has been approved, you need to 
start working on the preparations of documentations. 
 
So at not stage did I get an impression to say this 
that you are trying to do has no approval whether from 
20 
National or within the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, equally, at no stage did you get told 
expressly by anybody that the National Department had 
approved the plan, is that correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Expressly told that we are going to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 173 of 244 
 
present the plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   But that is to approval, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so I understand your 
evidence, you assumed that the plan could go ahead 
because firstly, you never saw a document saying that it 
could not go ahead and secondly, you referred to a letter, 
10 
which we deal with in due course.  In due course I will put 
the various versions of other witnesses to you for your 
comment but would you go to page 529 please of FS13? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I am here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you see at line 9 – you see line 
10 there in the left hand column? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Tsoametsi says: 
“Yes, so him and the HOD, it was Kaizer…” 
That is Mr Maxatshwa, is it? 
20 
“…who 
was 
responsible 
for 
planning 
and 
development and the HOD, then they had to go and 
make that visitation to National. 
Mr Gerhard Swanepoel: 
“At Mintech” 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 174 of 244 
 
Mr Tsoametsi:   
“At Mintech” 
Gerhard Swanepoel: 
“Yes”. 
And Mr Tsoametsi then says, that is yourself: 
“Yes, in response to that letter.  Then they came 
back and said we have approval, we can go ahead.  
Are you with me?  Then we start to implement the 
project, so that is my book where I was involved.” 
Is that a correct statement? 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That is the approval I was just 
indicating to Chair that it was assumed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, but there are two versions. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, I am saying that is the approval to 
say I assumed that they have the approval. 
 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, I accept that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is not an assumption, it says you 
were told. 
20 
“They came back and said we have approval, we 
can go ahead.” 
Can we now accept that they did not do that, you 
assumed? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I accept that. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 175 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Tsoametsi, how can you now 
say you assumed because when you were interviewed by 
the investigators here, they asked you specifically at page 
529, line 21, Mr Swanepoel says to you: 
“That statement that you made now, are you a 
hundred percent sure about that?” 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the statement that you said 
they told you that there had been approval. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your response is: 
“That is the…” 
And then he says: 
“Are you categorically telling us that Kaizer and Gift 
came 
back 
from 
Mintech 
and 
said 
they 
had 
approval?” 
And the transcript says you responded: 
“Yes, I am saying so.” 
Then Mr Swanepoel says: 
“Is there some document saying that somewhere?” 
20 
And then you say: 
“Kaizer and Gift will be able to provide it.” 
Then Mr Swanepoel says: 
“Okay.” 
Then you repeat, you say: 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 176 of 244 
 
“Yes, I am saying so.” 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That seems very categorical. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That is the categoric that I was 
explaining now, Chair, which you ultimately corrected me to 
say I am assuming.  Remember? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my problem is, if you had said there 
was approval and you did not say they said so and the 
10 
investigators left it at that and then you now say you know, 
during the interview I said there was approval and the 
issue was not taken further but actually I have reflected, 
there was no approval that I am sure about, I assumed 
because of the following facts that were known to me.  
That would be different but here they take the trouble, that 
is the investigators, to give you a chance to reflect whether 
you want to say to them you are sure about what you are 
saying or to say look, I am not sure.  They say are you 
hundred percent sure, categorically?  You say yes, I am 
20 
saying so.  So what I am putting to you, is it does not look 
like – it looks like you were very categorical here, you 
were not making an assumption. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 177 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair, I am saying – and I was 
trying to justify what is the categoric in terms of the 
investigators when I said yes, ask Kaizer and Gift because 
they went to the Minmec and Mintech and secondly, I just 
said, Chair, as I am even, when I am seated here, I do not 
have anything and I have not seen anything that says this 
is not approved but based on what you have said, Chair, it 
means I was wrong in being so categorical there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but my concern is that you seem to 
have had every intention to say what you said.  You were 
10 
given a chance to reflect whether you really wanted to say 
they told you that there was approval.  You were given a 
chance not one, not twice, more than that and you 
persisted in saying that is what you were saying.  So why 
were you so categorical when you knew you were not sure 
about this? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Well, Chair, I think it was more of an 
emphasis and like I am explaining now, what let to that 
categoric but I am prepared to concede to say yes, it must 
have been an assumption and not a categorical approval. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Mr Tsoametsi, do you accept 
now that the two versions cannot live together.  You on the 
one version assume from the absence of certain facts and 
another letter that a certain attitude was taken by Minmec 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 178 of 244 
 
or Mintech.  On the other you say you were directly told.  
They cannot live together, do you not agree? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I accept. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because you repeated at page 551, 
line 22.  551, line 23, in fact.  It is actually line 22.  In the 
context of the Mintech and the Minmec meetings, Mr 
Tsoametsi, you say – sorry, do you have it?  551, black 
numbers, line 22.  But have you got page 551 there? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Line 22, near the bottom of the 
10 
page.  Well, at the bottom of the page.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   I see line 20. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So go two lines down. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Tsoametsi: 
“They went, Gift and Kaizer, they went as people 
that are going to do that presentation for all these 
elements and then they came back to say there is 
no problem.” 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, that is the same as the… 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As the earlier reference. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you say that is wrong? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, the fact that they went, yes.  
Correct, they went.  The fact that there was categoric 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 179 of 244 
 
approval, it was an assumption. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  In any event, the plan was 
then implemented.  You say that at page 530, at the bottom 
of the page.  What plan are you referring to there, is that 
your plan in the document of 25 November? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The expenditure recovery plan and the 
document of [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But both those, as I understand 
your evidence, both those were prepared in order to ensure 
that money was spent and money was not taken away and 
10 
they worked together in a way. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct.  At page 531 – of course 
you left the department at some stage during this period. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair.  Because, Chair, there was 
– like I said, there was this restructuring.  The two of us, 
me as the Director of Local Government Traditional Affairs, 
and my colleague who was the Director of Housing, we 
were both removed from our positions and we started 
working with the two HODs, that is as support waiting to be 
20 
placed because of the reconfigurations and in December I 
then received my letter to say you are transferred to 
Agriculture and that is the time when I was to be 
transferred to Agriculture. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  So you did not stay through 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 180 of 244 
 
to March 2011 in the Department of Human Settlements.  I 
am just wanting to explain to the Chair why your evidence 
in relation to the events ends there. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Then, Chair, upon receiving this letter 
to say go to Agriculture, the position that was said I should 
go to, there was already a person in that position so I had 
issue with how do you take me to a department where there 
is a person already in the position and expect me to go and 
remove the person and occupy his position?  So effectively 
I was then allowed to say okay, wait, we will then revert 
10 
back to you and that is the period.  So that is basically 
what had happened to me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you say that on page 531, you 
say: 
“Yes, where I now moved to Agriculture.” 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But in that context you say: 
“Five of my colleagues get to be fired.” 
And you asked the question why not you as well? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in fact you said that in the 
inquiry. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair, now I am in the Department of 
Agriculture, that is 2011, 2012, I think.  A new MEC and a 
new HOD come in, in Human Settlements, it is no longer 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 181 of 244 
 
Tata Zwane.  I think he also – there was a reshuffling in 
the province around about March, February – February, 
March, I think somewhere around there where he was also 
now 
moved 
to 
Agriculture. 
 
The 
HOD 
for 
Human 
Settlements moved to the municipality.  Now there is this 
disciplinary hearing with our remaining colleagues and I am 
required to come and give evidence, to give exactly what I 
am giving now, in the disciplinary hearing and my take 
was, why am I on the other side when what these people 
are being charged with, I was central working with them to 
10 
make sure that we achieve this.  So yes, indeed, that is 
what I put in the records at the disciplinary hearing and 
that is what I have repeated with the investigators. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you give any explanation why 
the 
five 
relatively 
junior 
officials 
were 
targeted 
or 
disciplined or not others? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I will not have raised it in the 
disciplinary hearing and if I knew, a perception by doing 
that has now been created that we were the protected one 
and they are now the goats that must be slaughtered.  So 
20 
that is the perception that has been created and that is – 
that is an albatross that we are living with.  
 
But it is not nice when people that you have 
worked with, people that you were in one meeting up until 
the solution gets to be implemented, gets to be fired.  On a 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 182 of 244 
 
daily basis, on a weekly basis you meet them, they are 
getting in and out of hospital of stress to an extent that 
one of them ultimately succumbed and she passed on.  It is 
not an environment that is conducive to still be saying you 
are an official, you are not charged, the rest are charged.  
So it is this perception, Chair, that we are carrying 
because look at what happened.   
 
I moved, I go to Agriculture, the HOD moves, he 
goes to the municipality.  Later, when there is changes in 
the political changes, the MEC moves to Agriculture 
10 
together with the CFO.  So anybody that is standing out 
there and looking at these things will come to that 
conclusion and I will not have an answer but that is why I 
had raised this issue in that meeting to say if this is a 
disciplinary hearing, I think I am sitting on the wrong table, 
I am supposed to be sitting with these people because I 
worked with them towards achieving the solution that they 
have implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who made the decision to remove you or 
transfer you from Human Settlements to Agriculture? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   My letter from – I sat in Local 
Government and Housing, I was reporting to Ralikontsane.  
So my letter was signed by Ralikontsane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was the HOD. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   He was the HOD at that time. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 183 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, hang on, Mr Mokoena has left? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, no, no, Mr Mokoena was still the 
HOD – when I left, he was still the HOD for Human 
Settlements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you were at Human Settlements 
which – you were at Department of Human Settlements 
which had come together with another department, is it 
not? 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Remember I had said …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were at Traditional Affairs, Free 
State. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I was DDG Local Government and 
Traditional Affairs.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a separate department. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, within the department that was 
called Local Government and Housing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Then come the election. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Then government reconfigured itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 184 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And in reconfiguring itself it created two 
new 
departments 
now, 
the 
Department 
of 
Local 
Government – or COGTA.  Now it gets called COGTA and 
the other one gets to be called Human Settlements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So HOD, Ralikontsane was the HOD 
under COGTA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   COGTA, yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And I was the DDG under COGTA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So as at the last few months 
10 
of 2010 you were taking – when you were taking part in the 
meetings that we talked about… 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not at Human Settlements. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were in a separate department. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were just brought in for whatever 
reason. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, okay, now I understand. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But, of course, what it means is 
that with regard to why you were not disciplined when 
others were disciplined, there is the distinction that they 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 185 of 244 
 
were in a department which was not your department, you 
were in another department, whoever needed to – it would 
not have been the same person to take a decision to 
discipline those and to discipline you.  It would have to be 
different people. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes but I am still a public servant in the 
Provincial Government of the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I accept that, ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Ja, so if there was discipline to be 
implemented, it will have just taken a letter from either the 
10 
accounting officer or the MEC there to say in your 
department you have an official who participated in this 
thing and we are therefore requesting that he must form 
part of this discipline. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   The same way as they were able to 
send the letter requesting me to come and give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   They could have done exactly the same 
thing if they wanted to discipline me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but at least I think – I think at least 
what I did not know before, what I did not appreciate, I 
thought 
you 
were 
in 
a 
certain 
wing 
of 
the 
Human 
Settlements department whereas you have now clarified 
that you were in another standalone department but you 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 186 of 244 
 
had been brought in to assist on a specific thing.  So 
legally if somebody had to make a decision to discipline 
you, it would not have been somebody within the Human 
Settlement department, it would have had to be the HOD of 
COGTA.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go please to page 534 
of FS13?  There the investigators were discussing with you 
the implementation of the plan and I am referring to the 25 
November document here and Mr Swanepoel asks you: 
“In other words, you were going to or you were 
10 
planning to pay companies that were not vendors of 
the department.” 
As I understand it, what he was putting to you is that 
suppliers that you were going to pay as part of the 
execution of the plan were not on the database of the 
department. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, the point you are saying, Chair, 
was that these material suppliers that we are – you are 
now saying you are going to pay are not on the database of 
the department.  And I said to him no, these material 
20 
suppliers that we are paying, are material suppliers that 
have entered into an agreement with the contractors that 
we have legally – I am using that term now like I have been 
corrected to say you do not know whether the process 
followed, that have been legally given contracts.  So we 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 187 of 244 
 
are assisting those people because we have a legal 
relationship with them.  So that is the point that I was that 
I was explaining to you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Not suppliers that we are sourcing with 
supply chain process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, I just 
want to make sure my mind can move away from this 
previous question about inconsistency and discrimination 
10 
in terms of discipline.  So going back to that issue, so why 
is it that the Human Settlements Department invited you to 
their meeting to discuss the response to the National 
Minister, why were they bringing somebody from another 
department? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair remember what I said exactly, 
with this reconfiguration the two DDG’s, one for Local 
Government and one for Human Settlement, my colleagues 
from Human Settlement, we were removed from our 
positions as DDG’s and I will call it, we were in a waiting 
20 
room to be placed out of this new reconfiguration that was 
taking place, so HOD’s will use us as and when there’s 
issues that they need to be – to be attended to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   They will then use us, example Chair in 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 188 of 244 
 
order to develop and to reconfigure these two departments 
I was very central, I played a very central role there, 
although it is a Corporate Savings function, but I played a 
very central role there working together with consultants 
that were appointed. 
 
So it was that type of work ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so just that you were available. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Available then I get called. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and in a way you didn’t have much 
work to do because ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Because I am in a waiting room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay now I understand.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair it is quarter past four, I 
would like with your leave to try and finish this witness, 
however long it takes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am quite happy to continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I know the witness is from 
Bloemfontein but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Tsoametsi you are fine if we 
continue to try and finish? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I will appreciate that chair because I 
still have the responsibility of an audit that I must deal with 
at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So I would appreciate ...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 189 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your counsel they are fine with that? 
COUNSEL FOR MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes Chair, we are 
happy to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To try and finish. 
COUNSEL FOR MR TSOAMETSI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a very polite and tentative 
...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL FOR MR TSOAMETSI:   Ja, as long as we can 
just stay in the time that we need to be home before twelve 
tonight. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We may start at 11.30 tomorrow so 
I have time to prepare for the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We can discuss that later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is tomorrow’s witness represented 
by the same legal team? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright, oh you directed that to 
me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, just a quick pro quo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is alright, let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The legalities of the direct payment 
to suppliers is a legal question and I really don’t think it 
would help the Chair much if we debated that, and in fact 
you yourself say at the bottom ...[intervenes]  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 190 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   While I accept that Mr Pretorius I wanted 
to ask the question bearing in mind your understanding of 
the broadness of the mandate you were given why didn’t 
you look into the question whether it would be lawful to 
make advance payments? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair the only question that I had asked 
from the then legal aid was the one that I am talking about, 
whether will it be lawful to amend the contract and create 
an addenda that will allow contractors to be supported. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what did he or she say? 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   He said an addendum it will be allowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he spoke to you on the basis that 
there were existing contracts that had already been 
concluded? 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
 
Between 
the 
department 
and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The contractors. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And contractors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that make you believe that therefore 
it ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   It will be legal to support, to support 
contractors through this method. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now you see that question is 
important because my recollection is that both Mr Mokoena 
and Mr Maxatshwa said at the meeting that you have 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 191 of 244 
 
referred to as the first meeting to discuss a response to 
the National Minister ’s concern they said Mr Zwane said he 
had a solution to the problem and the solution was 
advance payments and Mr Mokoena I think said his 
response was but this will be illegal MEC.  I may be 
mistaken about Mr Maxatshwa but I think he said the same 
thing and they said Mr Zwane said he had talked to 
somebody who had said that this would be legal, but he did 
not want to disclose who that person is.  Do you know 
anything, any discussion along these lines that happened 
10 
at that meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No Chair except you will recall I said in 
that meeting, that is the meeting after Welkom, when we’re 
reflecting on the discussions in Welkom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, oh, okay so that it was the first one. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   That is where the MEC said, based on 
those discussions in Welkom I think I had a solution that 
we must buy material and he has indeed you know a 
discussion to say is it legal, is it not legal, but the end 
result of the discussion was that I should go and do this, 
20 
so it is those discussions that had taken place in those 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, you see for me, one, the fact that 
the mandate was as broad as it was, two, that the question 
of the legality of advance payment was raised at the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 192 of 244 
 
meeting meant that and should have been understood by 
you to mean that it was one of the issues you should look 
at, because obviously if this would be – would not be 
lawful, would not be legal it shouldn’t be done.  What do 
you say to that, in other words I expect that against the 
background of that discussion and that broad mandate you 
should have looked at the issue of whether this would be 
legal or not and your document should have addressed that 
issue. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I hear you Chair, at the time when I am 
10 
presenting this misinterpreted mandate to the Accounting 
Officer, and if it had gaps and there was still further clarity 
that is required on the legality there’s two avenues that the 
accounting officers could have utilised, the first one is the 
head of legal, the second one is the Premier in the 
Premier ’s office, the legal, the provincial legal advisor, 
which is the avenues that are immediately available to an 
HOD and not to me, that he could have access to say look 
I have received those documents and it does not cover all 
the issues that are needed to be covered, please advise 
20 
me on the legalities, so yes it might mean that me coming 
out of that meeting I interpreted this according to all these 
things that I have done, but there were also other 
opportunities before signing to say look in my position let 
me take it to my – to the head of legal or even better take 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 193 of 244 
 
it to the office of the Premier to the legal advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you accept as fair the proposition 
that in the context in which you were – the mandate arose, 
it is fair to expect that you should have dealt with the 
question of whether it is legal – it was legal ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:    I accept Chair, I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, of course maybe for the 
sake of completeness I should say Mr Mokoena did say 
that when you brought your document to him he rejected it 
and still maintain that doing things between, making this 
10 
advancement payment would be illegal, he says you went 
away and then he got a call from Mr Zwane who called him 
to his office and they had a discussion about whether this 
would be legal or not and he says Mr Zwane, I think he 
says Mr Zwane, I don’t know whether it was earlier or not, 
but at some stage Mr Zwane said well if he – this was his 
plan if he did not want to implement it he should tender his 
resignation 
and 
he 
will 
be 
poor 
blah-blah-blah 
and 
ultimately he signed it. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair I prepared a document for the 
20 
HOD, I left the document for the HOD, so that the HOD will 
apply his mind, he will gazette it, he will sign it, at no 
stage Chair did I discuss that document directly with the 
political office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 194 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Because my protocol has always been, 
even if you are in the meeting with an MEC but your 
communication 
to 
the 
political 
head 
is 
through 
your 
administrative head, so it is another perception that is 
being created to say I call the MEC to create pressure on 
the HOD, I think that will be a – it is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I don’t necessarily think that is 
what he meant, but what he did say is that you, the two of 
you, you and the HOD, had a discussion on the document 
when you brought it to him and he maintained that advance 
10 
payments would be illegal.  My recollection is that he said 
you went away with the document because he was not 
prepared to sign it and subsequently he got a call from the 
MEC, I don’t think he necessarily says you spoke to the 
MEC or you didn’t, maybe you did, but he simply says he 
was called by the MEC, they had a discussion and by the 
end of their meeting he signed. 
MR TSOAMETSI:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of your discussion with him 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   We had the discussion and I left the 
document with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With him, did he raise any issue about 
the advance payments being illegal. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No Chair, I gave him the document, he 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 195 of 244 
 
said I will look into the document and I will come back to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And he called me roundabout half past 
five in the afternoon to say the document, your document 
has been signed.  As to what had transpired between him 
and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I don’t know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To be fair to you Mr Tsoametsi you 
weren’t employed as a legal expert in the Free State 
Human Settlements Department, it wasn’t your job to 
advise on the law and in fact at the direction of the 
Premier there is a legal advisor in the Premier ’s office 
whose specific purpose would be to have advised on this. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   To advise HOD’s and MEC’s. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if either the MEC or the HOD 
20 
wished to have certainty that is the course that should 
have been followed, and as you say when you discussed 
the legalities of this issue with Mr Swanepoel at the bottom 
of page 534 that your mandate was to find out how to 
support contractors that are in need of support.  I did not 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 196 of 244 
 
think about the legalities, I gave it to the legal people, 
correct, and that’s the reference to the amendment to the 
contract? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Am I correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   You are correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you repeat that at the bottom 
of page 536 when this debate continued as to whether it 
was legal or not to make advance payments, but let me put 
one practical issue to you because ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that Mr Pretorius, you see 
Mr Tsoametsi part of my difficulty insofar as you may be 
saying, and I don’t know if that is what you are saying, 
insofar as you may be saying you don’t think you were 
expected to deal with the legalities, is that Mr Mokoena 
said, and I think Mr Maxatshwa said also the legality of 
advance payment was raised at the meeting at which you 
were asked, you were given the assignment.   You also say 
in that meeting there were people who raised the issue of 
whether it would be legal, okay. 
20 
 
Now you were a legally qualified person in that 
meeting, you didn’t belong to Human Settlements, you were 
brought in and you remember earlier on I was saying why 
were you brought in, and you were brought in, you see.  It 
may be that I mean the fact is the document doesn’t deal 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 197 of 244 
 
with legalities, but as I have said you know Mr Mokoena 
said they raised the issue of the legalities and the MEC 
said somebody advised him that it was legal, they said it 
was illegal, somebody who is legally qualified is going to 
just prepare a document and doesn’t address this question. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair I hear you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I just want you as  you give 
answers to Mr Pretorius understand why I was asking the 
questions I asked. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I hear you Chair but in a meeting like 
10 
that where you have an  HOD who was – who is supported 
legally by the head of Legal Service and the Premier ’s 
office, who deal with legal matters, and you have the CFO 
who is the custodian of the PFMA and its legality. When 
discussions are taking place and somebody says it is not in 
accordance with Supply Chain I assume Chair that the CFO 
will then take the responsibility to deal with issues of 
financial management.   If the HOD had issues with Legal 
Service, 
the 
opportunity 
that 
availed 
it 
could 
have 
requested the head of legal or requested the office of the 
20 
Premier to provide him with that.  Yes myself I did not go 
to that level. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the head of legal part of the 
meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   He was not, it was a meeting of the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 198 of 244 
 
Executive, the Chief Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, were you the only legally qualified 
person in that meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Matetwa was also a legal person Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were other legal people? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Matetwa has a legal background, it was 
myself and I think we were the two that were of legal 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    The Chair is absolutely right, 
10 
there 
is 
another 
version, 
which 
may 
not 
be 
totally 
irreconcilable with your version, we will get there, and that 
version comes from Mr Mokoena and Mr Maqatshwa but I 
was going to deal with that later Chair towards the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it does seem that when the 
idea was raised its legality was discussed.  I’m sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, is there a problem? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No the phone is on Chair, I just want to 
switch it off. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay if you can switch it off. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Sorry sir, sorry Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Tsoametsi the different versions 
which have been highlighted now by the Chair I will put to 
you in due course, but it does seem that when the idea was 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 199 of 244 
 
proposed after the Welkom meeting by the MEC that the 
legality 
of 
advance 
payments 
was 
indeed 
discussed, 
correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Like I said discussions took place. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you were then given a 
mandate. 
MR TSOAMETSI:    ...[Indistinct – not speaking into mic]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, as I understand your 
evidence at least, and we will look at the other evidence 
later you understood your investigation to be factual 
10 
research into ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   How to support. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How to support and what had been 
done before, right, and as you say at the bottom of page 
536 you didn’t think about it from a legal point of view, 
correct?  So what we know from the outcome is that 
document that was signed on the 25 t h of November was not 
a legal opinion correct?  And had they ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you have to say yes so that 
that’s captured, ja, if you nod the answer is not captured. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I say yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So despite the fact that in the 
presence of the MEC the legalities of advance payments 
had been raised, it seems that no legal opinion was 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 200 of 244 
 
obtained, correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As a matter of fact. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whether you should have done so 
or not you have dealt with the Chair on that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the further point that is 
important that had Mr Zwane or the HOD wanted a firm 
legal opinion on the legality of the scheme the advance 
10 
payment scheme, there was the office of the Premier where 
Mr Venter was in charge where that opinion could have 
been properly researched and given.  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was it not a matter of concern to 
you that this was not done? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No Chair because I was dealing with 
what was expected from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I just ask this, going back a little 
bit, this evidence by Mr Mokoena and Mr Maxatshwa if I 
20 
recall correctly that Mr Zwane when the issue of the 
legality of advance payment was raised at a meeting said 
he had been advised that it would be legal to do so but did 
not disclose who had advised him, is that something you 
remember as having happened at the meeting as well? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 201 of 244 
 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
 
I 
can’t 
recall, 
I 
can’t 
recall 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It might have happened it might not have 
happened. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No I can’t recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go to page 539 
please, there are a number of issues that arose in your 
discussions with the interviewers.   Mr Lambrechts at page 
539, line 4, asks: 
10 
“Did you pay the supplier before he supplied the 
material? 
Mr Tsoametsi:   Yes if you are the supplier.” 
It is the view of a number of witnesses that suppliers were 
paid before goods were supplied, correct?   
MR TSOAMETSI:   With this intervention of how are we 
supporting contractors, for as they are able to implement 
the expenditure recover plan.  The idea was the contractor 
will approach his or her supplier, they will agree on the 
cost for material, they will also agree that the supplier will 
20 
service the storage facility for the material.  The two of 
them 
will 
come 
to 
the 
Department 
and 
request 
the 
Department to agree in supporting the agreement. 
 
So what ultimately we were intending to do that 
Chair was now the suppliers, the contractors will no longer 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 202 of 244 
 
have an issue of access to material.  Secondly we would 
have mitigated the risk that material will have been 
delivered in own ...[indistinct – dropping voice], it will not 
be guarded or we needed now to incur another expense of 
employing a lot of security to guard, so by asking the 
material suppliers to be the warehouse or storage facility 
or what we call off-site delivery, it then allow for this 
tripartite agreement and like I said Chair that the advice 
that I received from the people that had implemented it is 
that when we have done that it is important in order to 
10 
mitigate the risk that you create that you create this 
monitoring capacity that will then be able to be the one 
that reconciles for you and produce the reports as and 
when the material goes out, verify it with the work done on 
the ground for us to be able to reconcile that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But as I understand it is that the 
scheme involved payment to the suppliers before the 
suppliers actually delivered the materials to the contract? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, because they were off-site storage 
facilities. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well wherever they were in the 
meanwhile, but from a practical point of view, leave aside 
the legalities because we have dealt exhaustively with the 
original contract with the contractor, its relationship with 
the tripartite agreement and the validity of the cession 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 203 of 244 
 
agreement, I don’t really need to do that anymore, the 
contracts are there and they can be read and judged in 
their own right, but the ordinary contractual arrangement, 
practical arrangement on the ground, would be that you 
would have as a department a contract with the contractor.  
 
The contractor would then have the responsibility to 
secure materials, you say yes.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, no I was still following before I 
respond, sorry Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The payment that would be made 
10 
by the Department as the client would only be made once 
those materials had been delivered within the budget of the 
contractor and once those materials had been incorporated 
and the foundation, and that had been verified by the 
inspectors of the department. 
 
The structure of that scheme has its own checks 
and 
balances 
for 
the 
sufficient 
expenditure 
of 
the 
Department, correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Okay Chair like I have indicated that 
the problem statement that was analysing the state of 
20 
housing delivery in the country, the fact that there is this 
capacity 
gap 
that 
was 
created 
by 
well 
established 
contractors 
pulling 
out 
from 
supporting 
government 
programmes and creating a vacuum or a gap that allowed 
emerging 
contractors 
to 
be 
the 
ones 
that 
are 
now 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 204 of 244 
 
available, who will now have a problem of access to 
finance, a problem of access to material, and sometimes a 
problem of technical support. 
 
So what Mr Pretorius is now saying is that under 
normal – had there not been any delay the normal practice 
would have been we have appointed contractors, they must 
go around, go to the banks, whether they go – they must 
go around and source the required finance that will enable 
them to buy material, do the work and claim for the work 
done, that is the normal conditions that is what will 
10 
happen. 
 
But in this abnormal what I call abnormal situation 
of wanting to turnaround delivery within this period of time 
this is what was then proposed Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You make the point fairly Mr 
Tsoametsi that this extraordinary scheme was developed 
not so much as to support emerging contractor but to make 
sure you spent the money in time, correct. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, no, it is not about money, it was 
about – remember this thing we were reacting to what has 
20 
been raised by contractors, and contractors were there to 
deliver houses, so in supporting them as contractors an 
expenditure gets incurred, but in the main it was to support 
them so that we are able to implement our expenditure 
recovery plan, and the reason it is called an expenditure 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 205 of 244 
 
recovery plan is because it entails money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well then Mr Tsoametsi I think you may 
have misunderstood Mr Pretorius.  From your own evidence 
and from the evidence of I think every other witness who 
has testified maybe including Mr Zwane maybe I am 
mistaken about that.  This was a reaction by the Human 
Settlements Department in the Free State to the National 
Minister’s concern. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  There is no expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the Provincial Department was not 
10 
spending enough money that had been allocated. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And even before there may have been a 
threat from the National Minister or the National Department 
everybody knew that if there was no plan that was 
satisfactory to the National Department as to how you would 
improve your performance money would be taken away from 
you. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so this whole – all these activities – 
20 
this whole thing was happening because you were seeking to 
make sure that the department in the Free State did not find 
itself having money taken away from it. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the process of wanting to achieve 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 206 of 244 
 
that you then sought to assist contractors. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair and not only that I – I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words the assistance of the 
contractors. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was secondary.  The major thing was to 
improve the expenditure. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I hear you Chair.   But the impact of that 
solution is that we were then able to continue to deliver on 
the promises that we had made around houses.  Chair I do 
10 
not know as to whether the commission that looked into the 
annual reports of the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have not looked at the annual 
reports but I am just concerned about the proposition your 
response to the proposition that Mr Pretorius put to you. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you seemed to dispute and I did not 
expect you to dispute and I want to make sure that we are all 
on the same page. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understood the proposition he meant 
to say the – there was a recovery plan. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was a response – the Provincial 
Department’s response to the concern of the National 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 207 of 244 
 
Minister. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this recovery plan for it to work it 
became necessary to assist contractors because otherwise 
they would not come on board. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the primary thing was responding to 
the National Minister’s concern. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think we are on the same page 
now. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  And I was just saying Chair I know that we 
are not dealing with the impact here it might be something 
that – but when you look into the – the annual reports of the 
department 
and 
you 
look 
under 
the 
performance 
of 
2010/2011 which is reported – which is recorded as 5216 
units completed.   
But when you go to the next financial year and it is 
20 
also recorded in the annual report it then shoot up to 9070 
and when they indicate why there is this high volume they 
then say it is in completion of the backlog of 2010.  So yes 
there are these houses that have been – the support that we 
have given to but it has produced.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 208 of 244 
 
It has assisted the Province to produce on the ground 
that is number 1 Chair.   
2. It will be very important to check with the same 
contractors that were assisted whether by doing these things 
have we been able to meet – remember that diagnosis I have 
talked about Chair.  Have we been able to assist them to 
then start to be financially better by providing them with 
material without having to go through?   
So what I am saying Chair is that the – the product in 
terms of units that have been produced during that financial 
10 
year which are contained in the annual report of that 
financial year indicate that on the ground there is complete – 
completeness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the HOD of the Department the one 
who followed Mr Mokoena says that arising out of how the 
department responded to the National Minister’s concern 
there is more than R500 million or R600 million that is 
unaccounted for.  You might not be able to say anything but I 
just – I just want you to know that as you look at what you 
say may have been benefits. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes.  That is in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I concede Chair that is why I am saying 
when you develop a solution you will always have to take an 
assessment identify the gaps, identify opportunities then 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 209 of 244 
 
going forward then be able to say is this thing something 
that can work and can it be improved?  Now just more than 
that I am talking about Chair.   
In preparing to – to come here I again went back and 
say maybe there was something wrong are there other 
provinces now that are doing exactly that – this thing of 
supporting contractors?   
I then discovered again that in the Western Cape 
partnership between ABSA, material suppliers, government 
and an NGO has been established to make sure that there is 
10 
capacity and support to contractors so that they are able to 
deliver.  So there is this thinking in the country to say sub-
contractors needs to be supported.  How it is being done 
[Chair speaking over witness]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the principle cannot be wrong.  It is 
how you do it. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is what I am saying Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got to do it in a lawful way. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go please for the 
moment to FS17 I want to deal with a few things that you 
said in the disciplinary inquiry.  This is the transcript of the 
disciplinary proceedings. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 210 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS17 – 777. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know there was a data base.  We 
know you may not know but the data base was composed of 
various categories of persons including those who had bid 
for the tender in 2010.   I understand that you do not have 
direct knowledge of that.  But what happened was that from 
a large data base it appears that a selection of 106 
contractors was made.  Do you remember that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is why when you refer to the ERP 
10 
Chair we are calling it the 106. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes right. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Because it – yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So – and not only was the selection 
made – the houses were allocated to those contractors.  
Some were allocated 500; some were allocated 300 and the 
like.  Who made that allocation? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I would not know but the principle Chair is 
the MEC has the responsibility to provide leadership, 
direction and oversight in a department.  Now direction in 
20 
Human Settlement means there will be a plan and this plan 
will say in this year these are things that we are going to do 
and we are going to do them in the following municipalities 
and towns.   
And based on the situational analysis that will have 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 211 of 244 
 
been done it will say because these are the hotspots we will 
allocate more houses in those areas.  So that is the 
leadership and direction that will come from a MEC.  The 
HOD will then provide the administrative implementation 
which under normal – normal circumstances will then be to 
go into the data base, develop a data base.   
Give proposal based on the functionality of different 
contractors to say based on their functionality this is what 
we are recommending.  Discuss it with the MEC then it gets 
to be an approved list of contractors allocated to the projects 
10 
in different towns where there have been identified.  That is 
how I understand it Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well look please at page FS17, 777. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At the disciplinary inquiry you said: 
“What normally happens in the department is 
that the MEC will make allocations and then 
after 
making 
allocation 
there 
will 
be 
appointment letters going to contractors.” 
 
So they will receive these letters to say you are 
20 
appointed please come and sign the contract, is that 
correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes Chair that is the point that I was – the 
sequences that I was talking about that after that has 
happened – after the HOD has consulted with the MEC and 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 212 of 244 
 
then there is this list that has been approved then that is the 
time people – those who are on that list will then be invited 
and then they will get their letters from the department.  And 
then just become an administrative function. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because we know that list of 106 is 
signed by the MEC. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He makes the allocations and then 
that is implemented with the HOD. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just one other matter before I get to 
the versions that need to be put to you; the Gauteng letter 
and one other matter.  If you go to FS17 791 please.   
MR TSOAMETSI:  FS17 7? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS17 at page 791. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You were explaining to the Chair of 
the disciplinary inquiry two issues.   
1. That the contractor had to provide a guarantee, correct 
in the original contract? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Chair the – the issue around providing 
guarantee from a policy point of view it is contained in the 
policy to say that that is the ultimate where I think we want 
to go as a sector.  That contractors will provide guarantees.  
But the practice taking into account the conditions that are 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 213 of 244 
 
prevalent in terms of the contractors that have been getting 
– it has always been difficult and I think the department has 
been lenient on the issue of guarantees.  But when you read 
– when you read the policy you will come across such an 
intention to say guarantees needs to be – be provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is – does the policy make the provision 
of a guarantee a requirement or does the policy say in the 
future we will have to look at requiring contractors to provide 
guarantees?  In other words to the extent that in practice the 
department may not have been insisting on guarantees was 
10 
it going against an existing requirement or was the fact that 
there was no existing requirement for the provision of 
guarantees but there was an indication in the policy that at 
some stage in the future this may have to be made a 
requirement? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I think it was an indication Chair it was 
not a requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is our understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In any event the contract provided a 
guarantee requirement.  And the contracts also provided for 
a retention.  In other words that the department would retain 
certain of the contract price until it was satisfied that the 
building was in accordance with the contract.  Both those 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 214 of 244 
 
issues firstly the guarantee but especially the retention were 
reduced in your version abolished on other versions or not 
enforced on other versions.  The result is well 
1. To help contractors but 
2. To speed up expenditure. 
Because the money would then be spent and not retained. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  You know Chair I – like I explained.  The – 
that even if it was in the contract there must have been a 
discussion that says contractors are not in a position to 
comply with a guarantee and therefore the department did 
10 
not implement that.  But I am not certain Chair I am not able 
to give an immediate… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You do not know. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I am just raising those two 
together 
because 
you 
raised 
them 
together 
in 
the 
disciplinary inquiry. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The point I think – a more important 
point is that there was a retention amount that was kept by 
20 
the department.  In other words not spent but the department 
decided it would spend and – and hand that over to the 
contractor before the retention period expired.  Were you 
aware of that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Well I cannot comment on that – on the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 215 of 244 
 
daily – but if that has been achieved as a fact Chair I accept 
it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright you do not – fine that is okay.  
I would just like to put to you briefly Mr Mokoena’s version 
and Mr Maxatshwa’s version in relation to certain issues.  Mr 
Mokoena says that at a stage Mr Zwane called a meeting to 
say he had a solution or proposal in relation to the unspent 
monies.  The monies that had to be spent.  Now it may not 
be so irreconcilable with your version except to say that you 
say that that meeting occurred after the Welkom meeting, 
10 
correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Zwane made the proposal. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say the legality was discussed. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The implementation of the document yes 
and other people raised issues of legality in the meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Did Mr Mokoena have an issue 
with the legality?  He says he did. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I think – like I said I think he spoke – ja 
20 
he spoke on the issue of the legality in the meeting.  It is 
one – like I said there were many [00:18:20] so yes he is one 
of those that spoke on the issue of legality.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  He says after the meeting – 
well Mr Zwane is reported by Mr Mokoena as having said 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 216 of 244 
 
that you were mandated to research the legitimacy or the 
legality of the plan.  That differs from your evidence. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No not – from what you are saying it is 
like outside then outside that meeting the MEC mandated 
me.  I am saying in the meeting out of the discussion the 
absolution of the meeting was that I should – yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do factual research? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You did not understand your mandate 
there to be… 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  To do legal. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To research the legality. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well Mr Mokoena’s version is that 
that was indeed your duty. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I did not understand it that way. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Mr – you conceded that Mr 
Mokoena raised the issue of the legality on advance 
payment.  Do you remember whether he raised it in the 
20 
sense of expressing a view that there was no problem with 
the legality or did he raise it with a view to say it was illegal 
or he doubted that it was legal. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No he raised with the view that the 
legalities needs to be looked into. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 217 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No, not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes.  I mean Chair when – when an issue 
gets raised in a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Different views, different – or somebody 
will come and say the financial sustainability needs to be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looked into. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Somebody will come – the risk needs to 
10 
be looked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So in that spirit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  It was raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Mokoena also gave evidence of a 
meeting he held personally with Mr Zwane alone after 
perhaps this meeting or another meeting.  You were not privy 
to that discussion? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Were you at a meeting with the 
Minister in February 2011? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  During this transition Chair like I said me 
fighting while going to – I am not so sure whether was I part 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 218 of 244 
 
of a meeting but it is something that we can check.  I cannot 
recall that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us just go to the reference it 
is in FS12 page 348.   
MR TSOAMETSI:  Sorry you said FS12? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 348.  This is the affidavit of Mr 
Mokoena.  He says in paragraph 27: 
“During February 2011 the MEC of Human Settlements Mr 
Zwane, myself our new CFO Ms Debbie Hattingh and if I 
recall correctly Mr Mmuso Tsoametsi attended a meeting 
10 
called by the Minister, Mr Sexwale and the Director General 
of Human Settlements Mr Thabane Zulu who explained why 
we made the advance payments.  Did you attend that 
meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is the meeting that I am saying I 
cannot recall attending a meeting with the Minister.  I do not 
have that recollection. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
MR TSOAMETSI:  May I put it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Ja you can put it away.  Is it correct 
20 
you may have attended that meeting but you would not then 
recollect what happened? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I do not recollect Chair but it is just such 
an important occasion to sit in a meeting with the Minister 
that – I find it strange for me to forget. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 219 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  In relation to the meeting at 
which 
the 
advance 
payment 
scheme 
or 
system 
was 
discussed Mr Maxatshwa gives evidence or has given 
evidence and he also said that Mr Zwane called a meeting 
saying he had come up with a plan for dealing with the 
unspent monies.  That is the way he put it.  Whether he 
came up with a solution or came up with a plan or came up 
with a proposal if this meeting took place after the Welkom 
meeting it would be more or less consistent with your 
evidence.  Correct? 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct.  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  However one might describe the fact 
that Mr Zwane made a proposal.  We know that he had the 
proposal.  Correct. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Maxatshwa says the opinion of 
that meeting was that the payment scheme would be illegal.  
What do you say about that?  I think you would disagree? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I am not so sure… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might say he does not know. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I am not so sure what to say.  I do not 
know what to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not at the meeting? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No, no that is the meeting that I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say you do not remember whether 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 220 of 244 
 
you attended it or not. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes that this – the whole meeting 
concluded – I do not remember such a decision on the 
meeting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well he did say that at that 
meeting Mr Zwane answered objections to the lawfulness of 
the plan. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  In the discussion yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes by saying that he had been 
advised of the lawfulness of the plan which had been used in 
10 
other provinces.  Now that would be consistent with the 
evidence that the Gauteng example had been raised at the 
Welkom meeting. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  No at that time Chair when I was asked to 
do research nobody had known – nobody knew about this 
Gauteng because I had to come up with – after doing my 
desktop.  So it is impossible in that meeting what was raised 
was that in the previous financial year advance were paid 
through [00:26:00].  That is the only thing that was – not 
Gauteng. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that Mr Zwane may have said 
that he had been advised that advance payments would be 
lawful, would be legal is there a chance that you might have 
been the one who advised him like that or is there no 
chance? 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 221 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then Mr Zwane who is still to be 
questioned in this regard Mr Tsoametsi put a version up in 
his affidavit – in his affidavit he said: 
“In as far as the incident of funds advanced 
to the suppliers to deliver materials to the 
contractors without the contractors paying for 
10 
them 
with the 
department tendering the 
payment thereof a legal opinion was sought 
in this regard and the legal department of the 
Provincial Human Settlements had advised 
positively to this effect and proceeded to 
draft the agreements between the suppliers 
and the department.” 
 
What do you say about that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  The legal opinion of the Department will 
be the Head of Legal in the department. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well that is what he says.  What do 
you say about that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I will not know Chair whether he had a 
discussion with the Head of Legal.  I will not know about 
that. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 222 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well I think he clarified that in his 
testimony on the 25 September, Friday last week and he said 
there that well really he was talking about your document.  
He was not really talking about a formal legal opinion but the 
document you provided. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So he… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Your 25 September. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  So you regarded my document as a legal 
opinion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is what he said.  He said when he 
10 
says legal opinion he is referring to your document. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I will not know why would he say that I 
mean. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The one thing is clear from your 
evidence is that it was not a legal opinion. 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then you have explained – I had 
versions to deal with in regard to the response to what was 
said at MINTECH and MINMEC those meetings of November 
2011.  Maxatshwa said he reported back to Mokoena and the 
20 
purpose of that was so that Mokoena could relay the 
criticisms of the scheme and the advice that it was unlawful 
to yourself and to Mr Zwane.  Did Mr Mokoena ever do that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  Not to myself Chair.  I do not – like I had 
said initially I will now be knowing that there is – not to 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 223 of 244 
 
myself. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Mr Zwane’s evidence was 
that the HOD reported back to him after the MINMEC 
meeting that certain adjustments had to be made to the 
expenditure recovery plan.  Did you ever come to know of 
that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:  I would not know the outcome of 
discussions between the MEC and the HOD Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In any event we know and do you 
know that ultimately the Minister – National Minister said 
10 
these advance payments must stop. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That never happened or you do not 
know? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, I know that in... is it January or so? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   February 2011 and I... that is the 
meeting I referred to. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And asked you whether you attended 
it or not. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Oh, is it February?  Oh, I think by that I 
was already gone.  You see Chair, that period of that that 
land(?) and me fighting where I am going and what is it that I 
am going to do.  I was no longer as active. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  Something else that Mr 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 224 of 244 
 
Mokoena 
said, 
before 
signing 
the 
document 
of 
the 
25t h of November, “your document”, that he took issue with 
the legality of the proposal in the document.  Mr Mokoena 
says that you then went to the MEC and the MEC then 
summonsed Mr Mokoena to ask why he was refusing to sign 
the document.  Do you recall anything of that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Like I have already said to the Chair that 
what I recall is that, yes I have prepared a document and I 
gave it to the HOD and he said:  I will revert back to you.  
And later that afternoon he called me.  At no stage, did I 
10 
discuss that same document with the MEC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You referred to a letter that we 
should put to you and unfortunately it was not put to Mr 
Mokoena and if necessary, that can be done.  It appears at 
FS12-252.  Is this the letter you were referring to from the 
HOD to Mr Thembani Zulu of the National Department? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   FS... 252...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   252. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, I am on it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You raised a letter... the issue of a 
20 
letter between the Provincial Department and the National 
Department.  Is this the letter? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What point do you make on this 
letter in regard to this letter?  We had not put it to Mr 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 225 of 244 
 
Mokoena and might have to do so. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair I have raised this letter in the 
context of approval from National.  Now I am saying, in the 
first paragraph of the letter, it raises a disappointment.  Now 
if it raises a disappointed, it means there was a stage where 
there was a meeting of mind.  It says: 
“I am disappointed that I learnt from the media this 
morning of your announcement in Pretoria yesterday 
regarding 
the 
possible 
forfeiture 
of 
conditional 
grants, funding at the Free State of Department of 
10 
Human 
Settlements 
due 
to 
an 
inadequate 
expenditure and performance.” 
 
And 
it 
goes 
into 
to 
explain 
the 
issues 
that 
the 
department embarked on the ERT in November 2010 which 
saw the establishment of the executive high level and 
operational intervention teams.  
 
And somewhere Chair it talks about... or I think it is 
point number 4 that: 
“During a meeting held with representatives from 
National 
Department 
in 
November 
2010, 
we 
20 
committed to report on our expenditure to the 
National Department on a fortnight basis.” 
 
Now we report on what has been agreed upon and 
accepted.  And that is the point that I was saying, my 
assumption was coming from that when I looked into these 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 226 of 244 
 
things like there was an approval but I might be wrong in my 
interpretation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let me put to you what 
happened.  At the meeting of the 18t h of November, the 
MINTECH meeting it was said in very clear terms to the 
departmental persons who attended that this expenditure 
recovery plan is not going to work.  That is the evidence and 
it is backed up by the minutes and I can show you the 
minutes if you like. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At the... that was noted at the 
meeting the next day the MINMEC, the Ministers’ meeting.  
And it was reaffirmed there that monies would be deducted 
where necessary from the budget or not paid over.   
 
The evidence has been that notwithstanding that, Mr 
Zwane insisted that the programme go ahead.  What 
happened then was that the National Department stopped 
paying the money, R 256 million because they were not 
happy that the expenditure recovery programme would work.   
 
Consistent with the approach taken on the 18t h and the 
20 
19t h of November and inconsistent with the approach in the 
department by Mr Zwane when Mr Zwane’s leadership that 
the expenditure recovery plan should continue. 
 
Those are the facts as we have them, backed up by the 
minutes.  So it was not as if there was a change of mind on 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 227 of 244 
 
the part of National.  National’s position was consistent 
throughout.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   I hear you Chair but the only point that I 
am not able to understand is.  When you say your... the view 
is that your plan will not work, is that the disapproval?  And 
when Mr Mokoena later tell ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course it is a disapproval.  Because 
you cannot approve a plan that you think will not work, can 
you? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Chair, when you present.  Remember, the 
10 
instructions.  You must come and present to National.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Your plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So normally is that National will evaluate 
the plan and it will confirm to say, your plan is not approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Now the point that I am making is that, 
yes they are saying it will not work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   But on the other letter that is from the 
HOD to the Director General, it says, we are committed to 
report on a quarterly basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   So that for me what it says that, yes they 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 228 of 244 
 
might have raised a concern that your plan is too ambitious 
and it will not work.  However, give us your weekly... 
quarterly... weekly expenditures that will show whether you 
are meeting this plan as you have promised that you will 
meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Because later... later, I think that is when 
now the minister made the determination to say, even 
notwithstanding this, I am still now taking a portion of the 
money away from the province. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Well, the consistent with the 
approach of the department which seems to have been 
accurate not only at the time but with retrospect.   
 
The 
witnesses 
that 
have 
given 
evidence 
on 
the 
expenditure recovery plan but to one degree or another, all 
agreed that it was unrealistic and had no chance of being 
implemented in fact.   
 
And so the representations in this letter would be 
subject to the same criticism.  Do you agree? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Probably realistic, yes.  In the sense that, 
we had planned this thing within the period that is called the 
resting period because it is the period of December.  But it 
would have made a big dent in the sense that work would 
have been on the ground.  Completely no, but big progress 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 229 of 244 
 
would have been achieved.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that plan did not addressed the 
question of how the department would achieve the targets 
that were set out in the plan.  It... the plan indicated that... 
indicated in fact to certain targets by certain ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...dates. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my recollection and I have put this to 
some of the witnesses.  I think, it could have been Mr 
10 
Mokoena that if you look at the plan, it did not address how 
the department would achieve those.   
 
And if the National Department looked at it, they were 
bound to raise that question to say:  We can see your 
wishes.  You wish to reach this target, that I get.  But your 
plan does not tell us how you are going to get there.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   I hear you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you understand that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   But the fact that all of us, including 
officials in municipalities were on a daily basis getting 
reports, monitoring what is happening on site, both in terms 
of the level of whether it is foundation well-played or 
completion.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 230 of 244 
 
 
And condition those reports to say, this week so many 
foundations are complete.  So many work plates are 
complete.  No completion of the final structure.   
 
We were able to have that information that being to 
show there is progress that is taking place on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there may have been progress 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOAMETSI:   But it was not contained in the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The plan did not show how you would 
make that progress. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I concede, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the comments of the Chair are 
consistent with the minute and that minute has been put in 
evidence. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I see. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Where the remark was made at the 
MINTECH meeting that the plan as presented has not 
demonstrate the ability of the province to spend the 
R 1.42 billion from now until the end of March 2011.  And it 
20 
turned out to be correct that that was no possible.  Correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You nod. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.  I said yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, it may be that to call it a plan.  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 231 of 244 
 
[laughing]  It is a wish list.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is one more issue that I have 
to deal with and that is the issue of Makwena Properties.  
You know that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it is dealt with in the transcript. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is at page 558 of FS13.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   F...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS13, page 558.   
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But will you tell the story, please to 
the Chair about Trans-Makwena and Makwena Property 
Developers?  And once you have told the story, I will ask 
certain questions. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.  Chair, I am now in the Department 
of Agriculture in late 2011 or so.  And an opportunity 
presented itself that there is a contractor in the nearby town 
that is looking for people that can implement his project.   
 
Now people that I was sitting with indicated to have an 
20 
interest to approach this contract.   
 
And I have indicated to them that:  Look, I will also have 
an interest because I have a situation that I must get 
employment for my wife.   
 
So if there is an opportunity of bidding for sub-
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 232 of 244 
 
contracting, I will be more than willing to join your group and 
go and make such a presentation.   
 
And it happened that the contractor that wanted to have 
somebody implement his Makwena Properties.  And we 
approached him and we said, we would like to make a 
proposal to you on implementing your project.   
 
We will bring together a pool of capacity with different 
knowledges and then implement your project.  And that is 
how Makwena Properties was approached   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Just by way of background.  
10 
At this time, you would have known that special measures 
have been put in place by the department in the Free State 
to assist contractors.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Even to arrange for advanced 
payments.   
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And with that knowledge, you went to 
one of the developers, Makwena Property Developers.  One 
of the contractors, rather.  And said:  Let me build some of 
20 
your houses.  You have been allocated 500 houses.  I want 
to build some of those houses.  Correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In the... we know that Makwena 
Property Developers was granted a contract to build 500 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 233 of 244 
 
houses. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Could they do it? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   They had started Chair in building the 
houses.  I think they have started with the foundations.  And 
when we met him and we asked as to why do you want...?  
He then said:  I have to focus.  He had other projects in 
other districts.   
 
And he said, travelling to Bloemfontein and coming to 
manage this project, it is actually a lot of his time and 
10 
therefore I would like to focus on other projects that I have 
in the Eastern Free State.   
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
How 
many 
houses 
did 
he 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the question was whether Makwena 
Properties could build 500 houses.  In other words, did they 
have the capacity to your knowledge? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I mean Chair if they had projects in 
Bloemfontein and in other... and they are running other 
projects, I think... I did not ask them about their capacity 
20 
really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Because it was not an issue of:  We do 
not have capacity.  It was an issue:  We are focussing 
somewhere else.  And this project needs to be implemented. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 234 of 244 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You agree with him then that you 
could build houses under his contract? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How many houses? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   It was still the 500 project.  There were 
some few foundations that were constructed Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How many did you end up building?  
How many houses did you end up building? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   When the... when Makwena Contract was 
10 
ultimately... because like I said, because of performance.  
When we were ultimately it was terminated, on the ground 
we have 128 completion.  We had 300 foundations.  And we 
had material that we had bought that were onsite to the 
value of R 600 00,00.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand it, you informed the 
investigators on page 562 that you built around 20 to 30 
houses. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   No, it is... Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is at page 572(?) ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I think it is at this stage that I need to 
reflect my discomfort.  The Commission calls me.  The 
Commission says:  We are send by the Chair and the Chair 
is asking whether are you willing to help us to clarify certain 
things in...  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 235 of 244 
 
 
I said:  Why not.  Anytime, I am prepared to tell what 
has happened.  So I am going into a meeting with the 
Commission with that open mind.   
 
In 
the 
Commission, 
the 
Commissioner... 
the 
representative says:  When is the police coming to question 
you?  Now, immediately it creates a discomfort.   
 
I am here to talk to the Commission with the hope that I 
am 
assisting 
the 
Commission 
to 
achieve 
a 
particular 
objective.   
 
Now when I am being asked when is the police coming 
10 
to... it then changes the environment an... so when I was 
asked the question, I wanted...  
 
I was trying to illustrate that on a week, we would be 
able to build 20 or so.  Even before I completed that.  So 
little.   
 
Then I realised that look I have must have said 
something that I was not supposed to have said here and... 
so in that context, that is where the 20 comes from.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  How many houses were 
ultimately built is not the issues, certainly as far as we are 
20 
concerned, this side of the room.   
 
What is of concern, perhaps to the Chair, is that 
someone who is integrally involved in the development, then 
plan to help contractors in a way that is, to say the least 
extraordinary.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 236 of 244 
 
 
Its legality 
also seems to 
be a 
matter 
of 
much 
agreement.  Maybe not total agreement.  Then obtains the 
opportunity with his position and knowledge to construct 
houses and benefit from that scheme.  Did you see any 
conflict of interest? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Okay.  Yes, Chair.  This 500 project Chair 
did not receive the advance.  So it did not benefit on the 
scheme that was... that we are talking about.  The material 
that was bought there was bought by resources that we 
provided, not the resources from the scheme.   
10 
 
So when I was asked the question:  Do you see a 
conflict of interest in sub-contracting to a contractor that has 
received the work from the state?  I then said:  No, I do not 
see a conflict of interest.   
 
Because I raised two issues, Chair.  The first issue was.  
The Free State’s economy is 60% driven by government 
investment which simply means that almost everybody in the 
Free State is dependent on government resources one way 
or the other.   
 
And therefore, if somebody has acquired a project with 
20 
the state, I did not see it as a conflict of interest if I get to 
sub-contract with that particular person.   
 
And in that context, that is why I raised the issue that I 
do not see the conflict of interest.  I may be wrong Chair but 
that is...  
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 237 of 244 
 
 
Then the second issues that I raised Chair which I see... 
I see it as a big problem for the country very soon.  And it is 
about the bottle neck of what we call middle class officials 
and their families being able to make an economic living in 
this context of the Free State being 60% of...  
 
Where we are now, the position is, no government 
official must do business with state including their relatives.   
 
Now if you take the Free State where the bulk of what 
you call middle class, are people that are employed either by 
municipalities 
or 
by 
state 
enterprises 
or 
provincial 
10 
government or national departments that have offices in the 
province, and you take them to be a minimum of 500 000 and 
each one of them is responsible for three heads in there.   
 
It means that in actual fact, out of the population of one 
of 2,8 million, already 1.5 million of that population is 
strapped into not being able to do business.   
 
Now I am calling the middle class Chair because the 
bulk of people that are able to have like children going to 
school and coming back out of school and not being able to 
be absorbed by the state because the state can absorb 
20 
everybody for a job, but the ones that are sitting in this 
category of unemployed youth with qualifications.   
 
And if we interbreed this issue of not doing business 
with the state, in a broad interpretation, we are setting 
ourselves for a big problem.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 238 of 244 
 
 
Because very soon we are going to have a problem 
where this interpretation of you cannot do business.  It 
simply means Chair, even... when my son applies for a job 
and the same committee comes, there are a few people that 
will be doing selection.   
 
They will find it difficult to put their names on the short 
list because they will then say it is nepotism because their 
father is also in government.   
 
Now he goes out.  He is not able to do business with the 
state because if you do business with the state you must 
10 
declare the tenders, the normal process.   
 
Now he goes to the third leg, trying to do business with 
the private sector ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
TSOAMETSI: 
 
 
...which 
is 
having 
business 
with 
government and it is also a big problem.  So I was raising 
this issue of conflict of interest of that context Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we are not dealing here with a 
person who is employed by the state doing business 
20 
generally with the state.  That is a different question.  It is 
been addressed politically and perhaps the Chair will have 
his own recommendations in this regard.  
MR TSOAMETSI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We are dealing here with the 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 239 of 244 
 
narrowing, a much narrower issue.  We are dealing here with 
a person employed by a particular department dealing with a 
particular project doing business within that project. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And let me just take that a little 
further.  In your capacity Mr Tsoametsi as an official dealing 
with the contractual arrangements with contractors, it would 
be your duty to make sure that the principles that govern 
procurement 
and 
public 
expenditure 
of 
money 
are 
implemented. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that the public who are the 
benefit of the project, the department with the allocation of 
its funds and the contractors and suppliers are dealt with in 
accordance with a certain set of principles.  Correct? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The contractor may or may not have 
a public motive, public interest motive and want to do good 
and provide a service.  But essentially it is there to make a 
living and to make a profit.  Correct? 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is where the conflict arises.  
That you were on both sides of the fence.  You were on the 
one hand dealing with a certain sets of issues and on the 
other hand you were benefiting from those.   
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 240 of 244 
 
MR TSOAMETSI:   [laughing]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were... that is the interests 
clash and the interest differ and you held interest on both 
sides of the fence. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   I do not think so Chair but I hear what Mr 
Pretorius is saying.  At that stage of the appointment of 
selection of contractors, I was totally not involved. I was in a 
different 
department 
called 
Local 
Government 
and 
Traditional 
Affairs. 
 
When 
a 
department 
received 
a 
ministerial concern, yes, I did get involved.  When the 
10 
solution was implemented which I was party to, I was 
involved.  When I had left that department and I am now in 
Agriculture and this opportunity availed itself, if this 
contract had received an advance payment, it will have 
meant that I have created a situation of an advance 
payment and I am now implementing it on this side and 
yes, in that situation I will have seen it will have been a 
conflict of interest but the facts in this matter is that yes, 
there was this contract that was allocated, it never had an 
advance payment, all the funds that were utilised is funds 
20 
that we had to bring together to make sure that the process 
gets implemented.  That is the …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, just one qualification to what 
you have said, we do not know the answers to those 
questions, the investigators have not established them but 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 241 of 244 
 
if at the time you were creating a regime to assist 
contractors 
you 
were 
also 
contemplating 
going 
into 
business as a contractor, the conflict of interest would be 
more accentuated, you agree to that? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Definitely, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, subject to just looking 
behind me for a second?  Those are the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination? 
COUNSEL FOR MR TSOAMETSI:   No, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No re-examination? 
10 
COUNSEL FOR MR TSOAMETSI:  Ja.  We are satisfied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Tsoametsi, for 
coming to give evidence.  If the Commission needs you 
again we will request you to come back but for now I am 
going to release you.  Thank you to everybody for your 
cooperation, we have sat until quarter to six. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, again. 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Thank you for the opportunity, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR TSOAMETSI:   For me to come here and share what 
had happened and I hope, Chair, I still hope that the 
government of today will be able to find an amicable 
solution and in dealing with the colleagues of ours.  It is 
not nice for people to fight government but where there is 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 242 of 244 
 
wrong, it must be dealt with but in this situation where the 
intention was to try and assist government to achieve -  
yes, it might have been irregular, yes, there might have 
been challenges but I hope that the government will be 
able to look into holistically what is it that has been 
achieved, what is the impact of that solution to the 
contractors, is there work on the ground and find it within 
themselves to amicably resolve the problem with my 
colleagues that are still battling and are still outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOAMETSI:   And secondly, Chair, yes, I was 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, just to interrupt you, you are 
talking about the persons who have been disciplined? 
MR TSOAMETSI:   Yes.  And secondly, Chair, like you have 
indicated that where we have done wrong, I accept, Chair, 
that we might not have been vigilant enough and yes, we 
might have rushed the issues and for that I will like to take 
part of the responsibility as part of the team that came up 
with 
the 
solution 
and 
with 
all 
its 
weaknesses 
and 
20 
shortcomings.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you, Mr Tsoametsi, I think that 
is very important.  As I said earlier on, I think that South 
Africans will be happy if they see more leaders and more 
senior managers who are prepared to look at what has 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 243 of 244 
 
happened, look at the evidence and look at themselves and 
say did I do the right thing throughout, did I fall short and 
be able to say I can see where I fell short and for that I am 
taking responsibility, here is where I fell short and because 
those people can then be people who can take part in 
saying what is the solution because if you deny that you 
fell short, you will not see any need to come up with a 
solution.  So that is quite important.  We are going to 
adjourn.  Tomorrow, Mr Pretorius, we are supposed to have 
Mr Zwane and Mr Sodi, is that right? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The former we have 
postponed, having discussed it with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I had hoped that we would – they 
would come here or at least the lawyers tomorrow so that 
we could postpone it to a specific date, postpone his 
evidence to a specific date.  Maybe such arrangements can 
still be made. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, such arrangements can be 
made, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because I do have some days that 
20 
we can look at. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which are not too far away.  I heard 
earlier on you wanted a deal about what time we start 
tomorrow. 
28 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 272 
 
Page 244 of 244 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I paid my price, Chair.  Chair, 
it is just that I have to prepare. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For Mr Sodi and I need to get some 
instructions in relation to the further investigations that 
have been done.  I have not had a chance to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is your suggestion? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   11.30, it will be brief, Chair, we will 
be finished by one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   11.30? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will start at 11.30 then tomorrow and 
then we will be hearing Mr – well, one, we will formally 
postpone Mr Zwane’s evidence to a specific date and then I 
will hear Mr Sodi’s evidence for him to complete on the 
asbestos matter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you, everybody, we will 
20 
now adjourn.  We adjourn.
