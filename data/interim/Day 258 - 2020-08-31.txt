PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 31 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
Good 
morning 
Chairperson.  
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  We are ready.  Chairperson remember 
last week Ms Thomas, Sandy Thomas appeared under a 
subpoena and she asked time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A summons? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It was under a summons.  She asked 
time to prepare an affidavit and so that she can testify 
today and the – you allowed her to – you allowed the 
adjournment to today and you allowed her to give an 
opportunity to prepare the summons.  And she has 
prepared the summons and it was filed over the weekend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I am sorry.  She prepared an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja not a summons. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Not a summons.   And it was filed – it 
20 
was filed over the weekend.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson where this all starts it 
starts from the evidence of Mr Agrizzi.  Mr Agrizzi his 
testimony was to the fact that… 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 4 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  For what it is worth I do condone the 
failure to file the affidavit on Friday. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And – So Mr Agrizzi had referred to – 
his evidence was to the fact that in the interactions with 
Ms Mokonyane – Ms Mokonyane she had been – he had 
been dealing with Ms Thomas and then there was also the 
affidavit of Ms Gina Peters.   And the affidavit of Ms Gina 
Peters I will refer you to when we deal with the evidence.  
10 
We will refer to it in the bundle wherein she also states 
that in her affidavit she dealt with Ms Thomas and then 
there is also the evidence of Richard Le Roux to the effect 
that he received instructions from Ms Thomas to do some 
repairs at the house of Ms Mokonyane.   Chair Ms Thomas 
is here to give evidence can she be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
basically 
Ms 
Thomas’ 
evidence 
relates to BOSASA and the evidence given by Mr Agrizzi 
and Mr Le Roux as well as he evidence still to be given by 
Ms G Peters with regard to allegations of a close 
20 
relationship between BOSASA both Mr Gavin Watson with 
Ms Nomvula Mokonyane and Mr Agrizzi’s evidence that 
BOSASA did various things for Ms Mokonyane or her family 
because according to Mr Agrizzi Mr Gavin Watson said Ms 
Mokonyane was very influential and then needed to look 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 5 of 103 
 
after her in order for them to as BOSASA to have 
protection from prosecution or certain investigations by the 
SIU.  So Ms Thomas’ evidence will deal with what she 
knows with regard to any interactions that may have 
happened between BOSASA, Mr Agrizzi, Mr Gavin Watson 
and Ms Mokonyane as well as herself.  You may administer 
the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS THOMAS:  Sandra Thomas. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
10 
prescribed… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ah sorry.  I suspect the transcribers will 
not hear you maybe you can remove your mask for now. 
MS THOMAS:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – or move it a little bit so that… 
MS THOMAS:  I will just do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS THOMAS:  My full name is Sandra Thomas. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
20 
MS THOMAS:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 6 of 103 
 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MS THOMAS:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you; you may be seated Ms 
Thomas.  If you do not have any objection you could 
remove your mask so that we can hear you on the 
understanding that there is enough social distance but you 
must tell me if you have a problem. 
10 
MS THOMAS:  If I find that it is a bit difficult then I will 
remove it Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS THOMAS:  I am saying if I find that it is a bit difficult 
then I will remove it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I cannot hear you. 
MS THOMAS:  You cannot hear me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is better that it.. 
20 
MS THOMAS:  I will just keep it this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is – ja okay.  Alright thank you.  
Mr Notshe.

representatives of Ms Thomas that she wants to say 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 7 of 103 
 
something before she starts with her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us get them to be – to place 
themselves on record first.  You may do so from where you 
are just to place yourself on record. 
ADV MANALA:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  I am Manala 
ME I am instructed by Madlanga – Mr Madlanga of 
Madlanga Incorporated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MANALA And we together appear for the Ms Thomas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ms Thomas you 
10 
want to say something? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes good morning Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  And everybody else here.  Sir I just wish to 
apologise for the in – the mistake that happened last week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  It was in all Honour a communication 
mistake and a breakdown there and I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  It was not an intent for me not to be here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THOMAS:  And I – really it was a bit embarrassing 
though but really, I do apologise humbly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THOMAS:  And I am here now. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 8 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  We can go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I – your apology is accepted.  I do 
accept that you did not intend to be disrespectful 
MS THOMAS:  No I did not Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Ms Thomas you will find in front of 
you there is a black file.  Chairperson I refer to the file 
which is marked BOSASA Bundle 1.  Do you have that in 
front of you Ms Thomas? 
10 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I do. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well do we call you Ms or Mrs Thomas? 
MS THOMAS:  I am Ms. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Thomas. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not – I do not see on the spine of 
this file that you have got Mr Agrizzi’s statement here as 
well as Mr Le Roux’s statement.  Is it in another file that is 
here or? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The – the excerpt of Mr Agrizzi and Mr 
Le Roux that referred to her [00:08:18]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I accept or the whole statement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No there is an excerpt which is 
attached to the – to the summons – the relevant part 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 9 of 103 
 
attached to the summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that – does that excerpt only relate 
to – only relate to what Mr Agrizzi said about Ms Thomas 
or does it cover what he said about Ms Mokonyane as well? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No it does cover both. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does cover both? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You will see – yes you will see on page 
33 Chair where it deals with Ms Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it covers the supplementary and 
the reply because there was the first affidavit then there 
was a supplementary affidavit and there was Mr – Mr 
Agrizzi’s response to Ms Mokonyane’s affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No those are not – those are not 
included. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not included? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja in the… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But what is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the supplementary is it – I think there 
is something in the supplementary that relates to Ms 
Mokonyane.  I think Mr Agrizzi’s story about Ms Mokonyane 
is contained in his first affidavit, in his supplementary 
affidavit as well as in his response. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 10 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Ms Mokonyane’s affidavit.  That is 
where you get the whole story. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The only – the only reason Chair that 
those are not here in this – in the summons it is because 
they do not refer to the witness.  You will find Chair where 
on issue – if you were to turn to page 41 – page 41 of 
Exhibit 27 and then there it starts and page 41 starts the – 
10 
the evidence of Mr Agrizzi before you.  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The relevant part of that evidence is on 
page 44. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Let us proceed I would 
have liked to have the complete version so as to see how it 
diverges or converges with her evidence.  But that is fine 
let us proceed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Ms Thomas you are on page – 
there is – if you see the tag – there are tags in this bundle 
20 
you have been given – there is a tag which is 27.1 – it is 
called Exhibit 27.1 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And if you there you turn to page 57 – 
57.3 that is your affidavit.  The numbering we are using we 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 11 of 103 
 
are using the black numbers. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I am.  I am with you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you.  That is the – the affidavit.  
Now if you – you turn to whilst you are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Turn to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is whose affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is Ms Thomas’ affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 57.3.

you questions.   You are talking to the Chair.

MS THOMAS:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It might even – is it alright now? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 12 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:  No problem it is just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you comfortable? 
MS THOMAS:  The chair is a bit uncomfortable but I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wobbly? 
MS THOMAS:  I will make it – not wobbly it is – I would 
like to move it a bit but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja move it a bit if that will make you 
comfortable. 
MS THOMAS:  It is just heavy. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is a funny chair Ms Thomas. It is 
10 
stuck.  It is stuck. 
MS THOMAS:  Ja kind of. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  In order to – in order to move it a bit 
kick – sit on it and then like kick or push it. 
MS THOMAS:  Okay I think this is better.  It is lower but it 
is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is low but it is fine? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes, yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS THOMAS:  I will just lift up the file to see. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I wonder whether anything can be 
done.  Okay alright let us continue. 
MS THOMAS:  We can proceed it is not a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now turn to page 57.25.  There in that 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 13 of 103 
 
page 57.25? 
MS THOMAS:  57.5? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja.  57.25.  Point 25 ja.  Bearing in 
mind we using the black numbering. 
MS THOMAS:  This is my affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  In your affidavit yes.  At the top. 
MS THOMAS:  I am there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Left hand top – left hand top.  
MS THOMAS:  Point 25 is the last page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes the last page.  There is above the 
10 
word deponent there is a signature there, is that your 
signature? 
MS THOMAS:  That is my signature yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No this document starting from 57.3 to 
27.25. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that your affidavit, you confirm? 
MS THOMAS:  This is my affidavit yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now if we then go back to 57.3. 
MS THOMAS:  57.? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Point 3 of the affidavit.  In the 
beginning of your affidavit. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes.  I am there now. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now your affidavit you begin by giving 
a background of… 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 14 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that do you want me to admit this 
affidavit Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair can this be admitted? 
MS THOMAS:  You confirm that this is your affidavit? 
MS THOMAS:  This is my affidavit Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you confirm that the contents of 
the affidavit are to the best of your knowledge and belief 
true and correct? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I do Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What exhibit number should it be? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is T27.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is it T27? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  T27.1.  Not T27 is the summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that the spine should indicate 
exactly what it is.  It should not just says Coetzee, Thomas 
because I take that to be their affidavits.  So – but you say 
that 27 is the summons.  I think it must make it clear what 
it is that one will find inside.  So – oh okay.  Ms Sandra 
Thomas’ affidavit is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit 
27.1. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now just before we deal in details with 
your affidavit.  Ms Thomas where do you work now? 
MS THOMAS:  I am now based at Luthuli House in – yes. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 15 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that the ANC headquarters? 
MS THOMAS:  ANC head office.  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And are you still the personal 
secretary – assistant of Ms Mokonyane? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you employed by the ANC now? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I am Sir – Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I see that you have got the same 
lawyers as Ms Mokonyane? 
10 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is she paying for you for the services 
as well? 
MS THOMAS:  No we have not come to discuss myself and 
my attorneys on what my fees would be because all of this 
was just a bit of a rush.  So we will get to that when we are 
done here today hopefully. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well I do not think it can be rushed – 
could be rushed because according to your statement you 
were with these attorneys since 2019? 
20 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So since 2019 you have not made any 
payment arrangements with them? 
MS THOMAS:  We have – we need to finalise the total 
amount after today. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 16 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who is paying for you – who is paying 
for them? 
MS THOMAS:  Well I have not paid them as yet. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Come again. 
MS THOMAS:  I have not paid them anything as yet. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who is going to pay them do you know? 
MS THOMAS:  I am going to pay them. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Now in your affidavit you give a 
background of when you started with Ms Mokonyane can 
you confirm that when did you start working for her? 
10 
MS THOMAS:  I started in the Department of Safety around 
1999.  I was employed as an administrative secretary who 
ultimately is responsible for like running the office kind of 
– like some – not an office manager but ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then for Ms Mokonyane did you 
start working for her? 
MS THOMAS:  Directly? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  At the time that was in the office – in the 
private office. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Of Ms Mokonyane? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And then did you continue with 
her when she became Premier? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 17 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  How did that happen? 
MS THOMAS:  During the period in – at the Department of 
Safety 
the 
PA 
she 
did 
not 
pitch 
up 
for 
work 
and 
unfortunately or should I say fortunately either way – 
fortunately I was there and I occupied her seat not knowing 
you know the formalities about being a PA and the 
protocols of safety and the police.  So I was there and I 
filled the seat and I had to learn very quickly because she 
just did not come back.  I had to learn on my feet so it is 
hitting the road running.  I learnt and I think I executed my 
10 
duties rather well because I then moved with her to the 
Department of Housing. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Were you not employed by the 
Department of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ah sorry.  You might have to … 
MS THOMAS:  I might have to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shift it even more. 
MS THOMAS:  Why do I not just take it off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I – ja  Okay, okay alright.   
Thank you. 
20 
MS THOMAS:  Let me just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I am – I am missing somewhere 
just to speak ja. 
MS THOMAS:  It kind of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so.. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 18 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:  No Your Honour it is fine now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I want to hear everything you are 
saying. 
MS THOMAS:  Okay no my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much better. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes Mr Notshe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So you – you – were you not employed 
by the Department of Safety and Security? 
MS THOMAS:  I was employed by the Department of Safety 
10 
and it had many names – Community Liaison. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  And it was on a temporary basis in the 
beginning. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the – how do you then move 
to Department of Housing when Ms Mokonyane moved? 
MS THOMAS:  Look that is the choice of the member of the 
executive as to who 
would accompany them 
to the 
following departments.  That choices are theirs.  But they 
could even leave you or they could take whoever is at the 
20 
department.  It is entirely up to them. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And then you – you then moved 
with her when she became the Premier? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I did. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then when she became the Minister 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 19 of 103 
 
of Water Affairs you moved with her again? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes I did. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So basically, you have been with her 
for a number of years – for a long time? 
MS THOMAS:  Twenty years to be exact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From 2002? 
MS THOMAS:  2000 – 1999 to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh from 1999? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes Sir to date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that is like what 21 years? 
10 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is a long time. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  A long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It means she must be very happy with 
you? 
MS THOMAS:  I – I would hope so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it means you are very happy with 
her? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes we do hard. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS THOMAS:  And if you have the energy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THOMAS:  You must always pre-empt your Ministers or 
your principals. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 20 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I understand.  And I understand from 
your affidavit you have become almost part of the family? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes – yes it is different when you – when 
you working with I would not to be gender based but 
working with a female Minister they – they have – they are 
Ministers in their capacities but they are also women and 
they are also mothers and some of the tasks they cannot 
fulfil.  So you know when they are in for example I would 
just say if they are in the lagotlas for example their phones 
are off.  If they are in the cabinet meetings their phones 
10 
are off.  Any meeting their phones are off.  So if there is 
anything happening if they cannot reach the spouse, they 
would contact me and I would obviously find a way to 
either speak to the spouse or either speak to her.  But if I 
know where she is I know that it is – I would know if she is 
in a cabinet meeting clearly, I would not be able to relay 
the message.  If she does get the message it will only be 
during the lunch period you know.  But by then it would be 
possibly too late.  It depends on the kind of emergency.  
So I would obviously contact the spouse the late Mr 
20 
Mokonyane that would be my first point of contact. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So from her – from the – from what you 
are saying and from the affidavit you dealt with some other 
things which are outside your official duties? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes and this is what I am saying that I am 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 21 of 103 
 
coming back to the issue of you know when you work with 
female Ministers they are also mothers and they are also 
wives.  So you – you kind of fill the gap and you do things.  
So it – it is – everybody – well let me put it like this.  Every 
PA he or she may have a different role because we do not 
just come in women form – there are men PA’s as well.  So 
you fill in the gap where you have to and you try to do the 
best you can.  Because obviously it is just the dynamics of 
the 
office. 
 
You 
are 
not 
bound 
to 
your 
role 
and 
responsibilities but it is then again how you work with your 
10 
Principle. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I suppose in those situations you 
even visit the private home of the Minister?  
MS THOMAS:  Not, not – no.  Look not often. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But you do? 
MS THOMAS:  Not really because I am not the kind of 
person that would just go.  I do have a line.  I would go as 
and when requested to. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you… 
MS THOMAS:  Not just on my own. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you confirm that you did visit Ms 
Mokonyane’s home now and again? 
MS THOMAS:  Yes.  Yes on – when I have to accompany 
somebody like the driver I would take something home or 
when there is files that needs to go.  I would accompany 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 22 of 103 
 
the driver.  Just to brief on what we have and so on. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I mean from your side… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – I am sorry are you talking about 
her driver? 
MS THOMAS:  It comes – the department driver.  We do – 
in the private office whether it is the MEC or the Ministry 
there is a private office driver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not necessarily. 
MS THOMAS:  Driver/messenger. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Alright.

MS THOMAS:  Ja.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you – in your summons. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I am sure – I am sure you were 
following 
the 
proceedings 
where 
the 
name 
of 
Ms 
Mokonyane was mentioned and her relationship with Mr – 
the late Mr Gavin Watson was mentioned? 
MS THOMAS:  Well not much but here and there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Do you know – do you know Mr Gavin 
Watson? 
20 
MS THOMAS:  I knew Mr Watson telephonically for a very 
long time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You know the relationship between her 
and Ms Mokonyane? 
MS THOMAS:  I – I do not know exactly the – I know that 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 23 of 103 
 
he is a family friend but I knew him by talking to him on the 
phone. In fact yet the funny part is that you know when you 
talk to somebody for quite some time you try and then put 
a face to the name so you Google and then you see okay 
this is the person.  So that was my first point that I decided 
to let me Google this man and see who am I talking to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And – but you never saw the – saw him 
the face besides Google face? 
MS THOMAS:  No.  I think once.  Once at the son’s funeral 
10 
he came to sympathise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THOMAS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Did you also – of course you also 
attended the funeral? 
MS THOMAS:  It was during the run-up you know during 
the period before the funeral he just came to sympathise 
and that is when I – I actually met him 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long ago was that if you are able to 
remember? 
MS THOMAS:  She was still – she was in – she was a 
Premier at the time Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So that was before 2014? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 24 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is between 2009 and 2014 I think. 
MS THOMAS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that is when I think she was the 
Premier. 
MS THOMAS:  I am sorry you know this – this whole Covid 
has just messed up one’s date and sense of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS THOMAS:  I am saying this whole Covid thing just 
messed up your date and sense of time so ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Mr Agrizzi, do you know him? 
MS THOMAS:  I have spoken to him not often but I have 
seen him too during that very same period.  In fact I am – 
if I am not sure they may have come to – I do not know 
together to sympathise but something like that ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What did you speak to Mr Agrizzi 
about? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before that.  Do you – do you 
say that you saw Mr Agrizzi at the Mokonyane home during 
20 
the period leading to the funeral? 
MS THOMAS:  It could be yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  I am not too sure but – look it has been 
quite some time so… 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 25 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Is your recollection that you 
saw him also only once in the 21 years or so that you – 
well maybe not 21 in – over 15 years – 16 years – 17 years 
that you were working for Ms Mokonyane? 
MS THOMAS:  I am not sure but that is the one that I can 
definitely confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you can remember. 
MS THOMAS:  But I will come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:  You know Your Honour because I will – it 
10 
will come back to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will come back okay, no that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you have just told the commission 
that you spoke to Mr Agrizzi on the phone.  You did speak 
to him on the phone? 
MS 
THOMAS: 
 
Once 
or 
twice 
but 
most 
of 
my 
communication was with Mr Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  What did you speak with Mr 
Agrizzi about? 
MS THOMAS:  Well he would call.  At one stage he called 
20 
we did not go into details as to what it was.  You know he 
called and I said to him that – I think he heard – must have 
heard that I am a bit drowsy and he called.  I said to him 
look I am not work I am going to send you the number of 
my colleague and you can speak to her.  And he wanted to 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 26 of 103 
 
know like why, what is happening?  And I was – just said to 
him that I am off sick.  And – and that was it.  So he – I 
referred him to my colleague – my late colleague to speak 
to because I was no position to talk to him at all. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that – is that the only time you spoke 
to him? 
MS THOMAS:  He may have called once before then but as 
I am saying you know it will come back.  It will come back. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I understand.  I understand.  Tell me 
the birthdays – did you give him your birthday at some 
10 
stage? 
MS THOMAS:  This is the funny thing.  Mr Watson like any 
other – well not any other person but you know what 
happens Your Honour is people would call and it is not just 
necessarily people but it is people that we liaise with and 
amongst the Ministers we have dates of whose birthdays 
they are especially those that she is quite close to.  So you 
send – my duty would be I would obviously call the PA and 
say listen you know what is your Principal’s preferred 
flowers, chocolates what do you think?  Or what perfume 
20 
does your Principle like.  Those kinds of things.   
So outside of the work relations there is also other people 
that would call and say you know I want to get your boss 
something but what do you think I should get?  Do you 
think I should get flowers?  If I say flowers.  Yes, these are 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 27 of 103 
 
the colours she prefers.  So the person has already decided, 
you know.  Some of them have already decided that they are 
going to buy flowers.   
 
They just want to know from me, what does she prefer 
because it is no secret that she suffers from very bad 
asthma and sinus.   
 
So some of the flowers... and so do I... some of the 
flowers like your lilies, for example, they give off that terrible 
pollens.  Man, you in a room and you just smell lilies.  So it 
messes me up.   
10 
 
So the same thing with her.  So I would just say:  Look, 
do not give lilies.  If you want to get some flowers or 
whatever roses, these are the colours that you do.   
 
And if somebody decides that they want to get a 
perfume, I will correct them and say this is what you do.  
This is the preferable choice if is not... it is okay with you.   
 
Because I do not quite know what price they are but I 
would say this is the perfume of your choice... of choice.  
And if they want to do something else it is up to them.   
 
So in the years that we have been working together and 
20 
it happened quite funny because we had a tea-lady which I 
was very close to and one day I just said to her:  Hey, it is 
my birthday.   
 
You know, come with me and let us go and buy a carrot 
cake.  In the building we had a canteen.  And it was funny 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 28 of 103 
 
because in the mornings we could stop there religiously and 
buy carrot cake before the boss arrives and we would have 
carrot cake. 
 
But on this day, I said to her:  You know what, let us go 
and buy cake and see if we can get something else besides 
carrot cake because it is my birthday.  And she used to be 
with the MEC at the time, the former Minister from the 
Department of Agriculture.   
 
So she then said:  Oh... I will put it the way she said put 
it:  Oh, Khandi, you and the minister, you share a birthday 
10 
date, month.  I am like, really?  And she then explained to 
me that no the minister is on... a day after mine.   
 
So that was... it was funny.  It is... I suppose it is how it 
is supposed to have been.  We share... that is how I 
discovered that we share. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are the same star? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, we are.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, perhaps I did not come out 
clearly.   
20 
MS THOMAS:   Sorry? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Perhaps I did not come out clearly in my 
question. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Agrizzi - how did he come to know 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 29 of 103 
 
about your birthday? 
MS THOMAS:   Oh, I would... it was probably Mr Watson 
because Mr Watson knew when my birthday was and he 
would call.  He would call either on my birthday or the day 
after my birthday but somewhere in that period because... 
and he would call and he would say,  “What do you think?  I 
want to do flowers but what do you think?  Can you 
recommend somebody?” 
 
So at time I would recommend somebody that normally 
does the flowers in her home.  And say,  “Go speak to this 
10 
lady because she knows what she wants.”   
 
And that would be it.  And I think maybe through their 
discussions and obviously talks and so, he then discovered 
that it was my birthday.   
 
We share a birthday in, you know, the same week.  And 
it is with that then they that... he would often call me or 
surprise me with something.   
 
More often call me or send me a message and a happy 
birthday and things like that.  In the latter years, it was just 
surprises, you know.  Not necessarily a conversation but a 
20 
surprise.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you do confirm in that over years, 
you and the minister were receiving birthday present and 
...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Not all. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 30 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...from Mr Watson? 
MS THOMAS:   Mr Watson, yes.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Including Mr Agrizzi? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, probably.  I do not know how they work 
in that office.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
MS THOMAS:   I say probably.  I do not know how they work 
in their office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I have no idea. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see. 
MS THOMAS:   But it is like I am saying it is not all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us say that by... Mr Agrizzi left 
BOSASA I think in 2016 or 2017.  That would mean that he 
would have had, by that time been PA to Ms Mokonyane for 
about 17 year or about. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Out of 17 years, what would be your 
20 
estimate of how many of those years Mr Gavin Watson might 
have sent presents to you and miss...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   To myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, say to yourself. 
MS THOMAS:   Let me say to myself. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 31 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   Because of... I mean, at times, I would not 
even know if he sent her or it would be that odd times that 
he would call me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And so ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   But to myself, not very often.  It was not a 
yearly thing.  It would come as a surprise.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Not... it is not all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  About five times, ten times?  What 
10 
would you say? 
MS THOMAS:   Maybe even less, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe even less? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And as far as presents for Ms 
Mokonyane, out of the 17 years what would you say?   
MS THOMAS:   I would not... it would be that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Those that you saw. 
MS THOMAS:   ...one odd call that he would ask me:  What 
do you think? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   What do you think?  Because we have no 
exhausted... maybe I bought flowers.  Let me surprise her 
with something different.  What do you think?  Sometimes I 
would not know. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 32 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I would say to him:  You know what Mr 
Watson, let me think about it.  And I, obviously, maybe you 
should get because you become block down but he would 
then also remind me.  So I do not know what he would send.  
I would not... it would not come through me.  It would 
obviously go directly to him.  If he chooses flowers, if he 
chooses to send something else, I would not know and I 
would know if it has actually been sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is the position that you would get 
10 
calls from Mr Gavin Watson ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   I did, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...about your birthday as well as about Mr 
Mokonyane’s birthday present?  But the discussion, for 
example, about Mr Mokonyane’s birthday present what you 
would suggest he should buy for her, would not necessarily 
mean you would see if it was sent. 
MS THOMAS:   Exactly Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It 
might 
just 
be 
a 
discussion 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS 
THOMAS:   It 
is 
a 
discussion 
and 
I 
would 
not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...but what he ultimately bought, you 
might not see? 
MS THOMAS:   I would not know.  I would not even know if it 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 33 of 103 
 
got there because I am not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   And from twenty... the latter part, we were in 
Cape Town most of the times.  So whether things actually 
arrived or not, we do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you would wish the minister a 
birthday, a good birthday on her birthday? 
MS THOMAS:   Me? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, you. 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Obviously.  I would arrange flowers from... 
we would put together in our office and we buy cake and 
flowers and cool drinks and balloons and we were... the 
private office staff, we would have something depending... it 
does not matter where we are.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I am sure after the birthday day 
celebrations, you would also tell her that Mr Gavin Watson 
did... want to send you something.  Did you receive it? 
MS THOMAS:   No, no, no.  Look, I am... those are 
surprises.  I do not... cannot ruin a surprise. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I man after the surprise, after the... 
MS THOMAS:   No, I should... I would... after... you know... I 
am sorry, Your Honour but sometimes you are so busy, you 
actually forget.   
 
So after some time, I would maybe ask her or maybe 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 34 of 103 
 
not.  It does not... if she says, you know, this is what I have 
received from X, Y, Z or this is what I have.  It is not 
necessarily from who, I would know but whether he has 
actually bought it or sent it, I would not know. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I understand.  And then the... do you 
know Mr Gavin... sorry, Mr Agrizzi’s PA, Gina Pieters? 
MS THOMAS:   Okay, I discovered her name actually the 
other day when I received the notice that she was going to 
testify.  I spoke to her once.  And that was the time when Mr 
Agrizzi called and I said to him that I am at... I am actually 
10 
in...   
 
He needs to speak to my colleague.  And when I... then I 
got a call from her, wanting to know my home address.  And 
in fact, she was more:  Where should I send it?  So I said:  
No, send it home.  And I gave her my home address and that 
was it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is that the only time that you spoke to 
her? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, to my recollection.  Yes.  Because I did 
not... I honestly did not even know her name until I received 
20 
the note. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You saw her affidavit? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I did. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you saw that she refers to more 
than one present. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 35 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   I saw that and I can count for the get-well 
gift for sure. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay let us start with the get-well.  Turn 
to page 85.  Page 85, Chair of the bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This is an email from Gina Pieters to 
Dube and other people.  And here she says, you must 
arrange a ladies hamper to be delivered to Ms Sandy 
Thomas and then she gives the address.  Is this the get-well 
you refer to? 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, it is.  Yes, it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It was in 2014? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now if you turn to page 83.  Now 
in June 2015, she is asking people to assist with two 
hampers and then she gives the address of Mr Nomvula at 
105 Blouberg Street, Noordheuwel.  And I think this is the 
address of Ms Mokonyane.  Do you confirm?  
MS THOMAS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 83. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   I am just going to the next... just a second. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, Ms Thomas. 
MS THOMAS:   There is an email here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes? 
MS THOMAS:   I see that the email goes to a Dudu Dube. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 36 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Is that the one? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if you... it says:  Hi, all... I am 
reading the email: 
“Please can someone assist me with two ladies’ 
hampers to the value of R 1 500,00 each as follows:  
Ms Nomvula, 105 Blouberg Street.” 
 
You confirm that is Ms Mokonyane’s home address? 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, that is her home address. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then to Sandy Thomas.  1 Customer 
Street. 
MS THOMAS:   That is my address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You forgot Mr Notshe... did you forget and 
read the address? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh, I beg your pardon.  I beg your 
pardon, Chair.  And then there is the address Sandy Thomas 
and then there is an address there. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And it says: 
“Please do not make any reference to BOSASA and 
the contact number for both parcels is Sandy 
Thomas.” 
 
And then it gives a number, a cell number. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 37 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is your cell number? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I can confirm that this is my cell 
number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now over the page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That is an email dated 
29 June 2015. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sent by Ms Gina Pieters at eight minutes 
10 
past eleven to Dudu Dube, Innocence, Jamaria and Alpha 
Hand.  Is that right? 
MS THOMAS:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject is:  Two times urgent 
ladies hampers.  Confidential.  Yes, continue.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then over the page on page 82, we 
see there an email.  This is from Kombelo to Gina Pieters.  
The same date and it is 11:57.  And it says:   
“Re:  Two urgent ladies hampers.  Confidential.   
Hi, Gina.  I processed the orders as requested.  I 
20 
am just waiting delivery confirmation from the 
supplier.  Kind regards.” 
 
And then... do you see that? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, we then go over the page to page 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 38 of 103 
 
81.  And then, if you start at the bottom.  I always find emails 
funny to read.  Will you start at the bottom when you read 
them?  Look at page 81. 
MS THOMAS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Are you there? 
MS THOMAS:   Just give me the top part where it says... 
because I am actually using my own file here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh. 
MS THOMAS:   H’m-uh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is an email... in the beginning it is an 
10 
email from Kombelo ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why you are not using...? 
MS THOMAS:   This one and mine because I put it... I put my 
own file together here.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Let me go to the page.  What did you say? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because there will be confusion. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, page 81. 
MS THOMAS:   81? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the top left-hand corner.  The black 
numbers. 
MS THOMAS:   Let me go there.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look, you will have all the time.  If you 
want you will check something in your file.  You have the 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 39 of 103 
 
time. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, I will do that.  Just a second.  I am just 
going there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 81. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is under tab number 29. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja.  Okay I see the email.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look at the bottom.  We start at the 
bottom.  It is from Kombelo, the one... the name we saw on 
the previous page.  It says: 
10 
“Hi, Gina.  I just want to let you know that this order 
will be delivered tomorrow.  I will keep you posted.  
Kind regards.” 
 
Do you...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I see that.  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then Gina responds and say: 
“Thank you, dearie.” 
 
And then at the top, at the top of that page.  Oh, no.  On 
the 1s t of July, Kombelo sends and email to Gina and says: 
“Good morning, Gina.  The hampers were made 
20 
yesterday in the afternoon.  We delivery hamper 
deliveries.  We made yesterday afternoon.” 
 
Do you see that? 
MS THOMAS:   Okay I see that too, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did you not receive these hamper 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 40 of 103 
 
deliveries? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, be it on Wednesday, I was obviously at 
work.  So.  You know, I am going to say in all honesty.  When 
I receive Ms Gina’s affidavit.   
 
I have an 83-year-old mother.  An 83-year-old mother 
and I asked her:  Right, when did we get... were you... did 
you receive any hampers?  Did you...?   
 
I was at work.  It was a Wednesday.  I was at work.  So I 
all honesty, my recollection of receiving a hamper, I did not 
receive that.  I was not there.  I was at work.  I did not come 
10 
home and find a hamper.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So are you saying to the Commission 
that as you are sitting there today, you are saying you never 
received the hamper? 
MS THOMAS:   No, I was at work on that particular day.  So 
even if I... our... I at this point, I cannot say to you whether I 
was in Cape Town or whether I was in Pretoria. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I understand. 
MS THOMAS:   Right.  But I did not sign for it.  So I cannot 
recall receiving a particular hamper on a Wednesday, the 
20 
1s t of July.  It is a weekday.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you confirm this is around your 
birthday? 
MS THOMAS:   My birthday is on the 26t h of June. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  So it is not far from your birthday. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 41 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   No, it is not far from my birthday. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And when you saw this affidavit 
of Gina Pieters...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...and she says there were these 
hampers delivered and you say you cannot recall of whether 
you received... it was received by your family or not.  You 
must 
have 
seen 
that 
there 
is 
also 
reference 
to 
Ms 
Mokonyane, delivered to Ms Mokonyane’s home. 
MS THOMAS:   I saw that reference because it was sent to 
10 
both ladies. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Did you ask her now:  Hey, when 
did you ever receive this? 
MS THOMAS:   No, I did not.  I did not ask. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now I was looking ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Because ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...in your affidavit...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Normally, Wednesdays it is either a Cabinet 
meeting or a sub-committee meeting and that would be 
Wednesdays.  So I can say, I do not know, were we in Cape 
20 
Town, were we in Pretoria during this period because I... 
when I look at it we were at the Department of Water.   
 
So I cannot confirm whether she has received it.  I have 
not even asked her even when I received this.  Look, I 
consider this affidavit of Ms Pieters to be more related to me 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 42 of 103 
 
because that is what the emails said that I can question her 
and so forth and so forth.   
 
So if Ms Mokonyane had received something, I cannot 
confirm on behalf on behalf of anybody.  I do not think it is 
fair that I should confirm that she has received.  She may 
not even have received it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  I understand. 
MS THOMAS:   But again, and I want to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Your Honour? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...you are only required to tell us what 
you know. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not know whether she received 
it, you say you do not know. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes.  Yes, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do know you say:  Yes, she did. 
MS THOMAS:   No problem.  Thank you.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I was... as I was reading your 
affidavit, I was reading with a bated breath that you would 
20 
say you received yours or did not receive it.  You confirm 
that in your affidavit, you do not deny receiving. 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I do not deny receiving the flowers. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 43 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, this... the hamper. 
MS THOMAS:   Look, there may have been.  Like I said and I 
indicated earlier.  There may have been once or twice but as 
I indicated that it will come back.  It will come back.  I can 
confirm the flowers, the get-well flowers.  And I know that 
maybe at some point but I cannot confirm whether it was that 
particular day or whether it was any other time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And all I am saying now is you... in your 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Yes? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...you must have forgotten to deny that 
you have received the hamper. 
MS THOMAS:   No, I did not deny.  I am not denying.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh, I see. 
MS THOMAS:   I am saying I may have received. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She says ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   I received ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...she is not sure whether ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   It was on that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...she received this particular one. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think she says she may have 
received a hamper at some stage or another ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and as to when that will be, maybe that 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 44 of 103 
 
will come back to her. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, I understand. 
MS THOMAS:   I am not denying.  I just... it may not be that 
time.  It maybe another time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And can you confirm that in your 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...you do not say you do not you do not 
remember receiving the hamper? 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I do know.  I can say I know.  I can just 
not say to you that is it on that particular day because it may 
have been any other time but not that particular day because 
like I am saying that date is Wednesdays, it is at work.  So it 
could have been any other time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And you are telling the 
Commission that you dealt with Mr Agrizzi one? 
MS THOMAS:   Once or twice.  Ja, once or twice.  Not 
necessarily that I would call him to pick up whatever or 
whatever.  No.  My communication was mostly with Mr 
20 
Watson.  And how they did their communication in their 
office, I would not know.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if you turn to page 85. 
MS THOMAS:   Of my affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, of the page 85 of the bundle. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 45 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   On page 85? 
MS THOMAS:   Page 25? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 85.   
MS THOMAS:   85? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, 85.  Ja.  
MS THOMAS:   I am looking at 85. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  You confirm you receiving the get-
well flowers? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I did. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The get-well hamper. 
MS THOMAS:   It was flowers or something like that.  
Whether it was flowers, whether it was a hamper, I do not 
know but I do know that when I got home there was a little 
card. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And the card reads: 
“Dear, Sandy.  Wishing you a speedy recovery.” 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, it was... yes, it was ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And everything of the best. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   God Bless. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, it was. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Angelo Agrizzi. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, it was. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And not from Mr Gavin Watson? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 46 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   I do not... as I indicated earlier, Mr Agrizzi 
called me.  He called and I said:  I cannot assist you.  I did 
not know what it was about.  And I said:  I cannot assist you.  
I am going to give you my colleague’s number and you can 
talk to her.  And he wanted to know where I am.  Maybe he 
heard some things in the background, I am not sure but I 
said to him that I am hospital.  You can speak to my 
colleague. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Then that is the reason why obviously the 
10 
card would have his name. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then, the person... you had spoken 
to him twice, then sent you this message? 
MS THOMAS:   Excuse me? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I said the person who had spoken to you 
twice ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   We have spoken... when I say we have 
spoken once or twice, I am saying once or twice.  We could 
have spoken more.  It depends on what the necessity was 
but I have spoken to him and I confirmed that yes, I did get 
20 
these flowers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I understand.  So you spoke to him once 
or twice or more?   
MS THOMAS:   More. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What did you speak about? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 47 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Well, it would depend on what he needed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What would that be? 
MS THOMAS:   I would not know.  At one stage, I think he 
called.  Like I said, the day when he called, I was in hospital.  
So I do not know what that one was all about. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   He called once.  I was at work. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   So obviously... I know I was at work and I 
was another call. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I cancelled the call and I said I will call back, 
okay?  So I called and he was in a meeting. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And by then... so that call, he did not follow 
up.  He could call me... he would call me about various 
things.  Mr Watson ask me to call him. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   There were a number of issues that Mr 
Watson would ask him to call him for. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What are those issues, please? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, it would be that Mr Watson had spoken 
to Ms Mokonyane and I need to... I cannot quite recollect 
what some of the issues were but it was quite a number of 
issues Mr Watson would have made with the late Mr 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 48 of 103 
 
Mokonyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And you cannot even remember 
one issue. 
MS THOMAS:   It will come back to Mr Nokkie(sic).  I will... I 
am sure I would be able to answer that.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   When?  Today? 
MS THOMAS:   Not today. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Right, now... so you... finally, 
your evidence is that you spoke to Mr Agrizzi more than 
twice. 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Yes.  Mr Nortjie(sic), the nature of my job is 
such and Your Honour is that, you know, when you call 
people or people call you and depending on their tone, you 
can befriend a person.  This is how I did things.   
 
You can become comfortable and have a relationship 
with that person without knowing that person.  If somebody 
calls and say:  Hi, Sandy.  It is Angelo here.  I need to... I 
would oblige and be as friendly as I am.   
 
So it is not a matter it had to be something necessarily.  
It would be just:  Hi, Sandy.  Can you help me with a number 
20 
of this?  Can I... can you help me with a number of that?  Did 
you know anything of this?  Do you... who can I contact here 
and there?   
 
Simple little things.  You know, you develop relationships 
with people telephonically.  And as I have indicated in my 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 49 of 103 
 
affidavit.  Look, I speak to people and have spoken to 
people, a lot of people and to date I still cannot face to those 
voices. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   It is just on how you work with people.  You 
network telephonically and as a PA it helps.  So I may call 
you at one stage and say:  Mr Nortjie(sic), remember this 
day and that day?  Can you help me out with something? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I understand.  Sorry, sorry.  I did not 
want to embarrass you.  It is Notshe.  My surname is 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Notshe?  Okay sorry. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, no.  Do not worry.  It is fine.  I am 
used to it. 
MS THOMAS:   I thought I was putting it in an Afrikaans way. 
[laughs] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I know.  Ja, I know.  At times, you know, 
I get to places and the people think I am Nortje. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, it is Notshe. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   It is Notshe.  And did I say Nortjie in 
Afrikaans? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Nortje, I think.  [laughs]  Now just tell 
the Commission about this.  You said at times because Ms 
Mokonyane was away at meetings and what, you would have 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 50 of 103 
 
to deal with her domestic things? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Domestic affairs? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you say in those instances, perhaps 
you would be called by Mr Mokonyane? 
MS THOMAS:   I would call Mr Mokonyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   To deal with these stuff? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja.  Because the train that followed was for 
them to call me because Mr Mokonyane himself will maybe in 
10 
a meeting and even if I could not reach him, I would ask his 
PA where he is and I would send him a message:  Sorry, Mr 
Mokonyane, I need to talk to you urgently.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   So I would be the one making contact with 
him.  And he would then advise and tell me:  This is what 
you must do and that is what you must do. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then also when there were problems 
at the house.  If he says there are problems, you would go 
and try and assist him there? 
20 
MS THOMAS:   The ladies at home would call me, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.   
MS THOMAS:   Often... more often the ladies at home.  And I 
would also call them because we had to establish a 
relationship with the ladies working at home. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 51 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Well, I had to.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you would go to the home if 
there was a problem? 
MS THOMAS:   Not necessarily, no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   when you say not necessarily, you say 
you could? 
MS THOMAS:   Look, if they call and then there is a problem 
and I can handle it at the time and sort it out, I would do so.  
But I would only go to the house if and when it is necessary. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Was it necessary when you visited... Mr 
Agrizzi says in his evidence... and I will take you to the 
page.  Turn to page 44.  Actually, it starts at page 43.   
MS THOMAS:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look at page... if you look at the lines. 
MS THOMAS:   Okay? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This the... or let me just orientate on 
this.  This is evidence, transcript of the evidence of Mr 
Agrizzi ...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...when he testified before this 
Commission. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I have seen this Mr Notshe as part of 
my summons. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As part of the summons? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 52 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I have seen it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you... without me going into it, if you 
have seen it, Mr Agrizzi says: 
“On one occasion they had to drive to the house, Ms 
Mokonyane’s house and had a meeting with you 
there.  And it was him, Gavin Watson and you.” 
 
You were there.   
MS THOMAS:   No. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let...[intervenes]  
MS THOMAS:   I read it a couple of times.  I read this one a 
10 
couple of times and I tried to recall this.  Ja, I see there, 
where it says her PA was there as well.  Sandy.  Sandy 
Thomas.  I think her name was. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   This one I cannot honestly... Mr Notshe, I 
cannot recall.  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You do not recall an incident where you 
were at the house with Mr Agrizzi and ...[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   And Mr Watson? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   No, no.  Not in this instance, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying that it did not happen.  
You are simply saying you do not remember whether it 
happened? 
MS THOMAS:   I cannot remember anything like this. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 53 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS THOMAS:   It has been quite some time.  I... this one, I 
do not remember anything of this.  I went through it quite 
some time over and over and... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now Ms Thomas, can you just tell 
the Commission, you... the... is it correct that the only things 
you did regarding the house, was to arrange for the repairs 
of things that had broken down in the house? 
MS THOMAS:   No, that is not the only things.  
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What are the other things? 
MS THOMAS:   Do I have to elaborate? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Sorry, can I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maintenance issues …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   Can I give an example? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said maintenance issues. 
MS THOMAS:   Maintenance issues, it would depend on 
what it is and whether the ladies would actually call me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Sometimes they would …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you refer to maintenance issue, 
what kind of issues are you having in mind? 
MS THOMAS:   Okay, for example, sometimes the lights 
would go off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 54 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   So at times the ladies are not sure whether 
it is power failure or whether there is a problem, a switch 
or something in the house.   What I would first do, Your 
Honour, is ask her to ask the police at the gate just to 
come and check what exactly it is and also find out in the 
area if it is in the area. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   Before we do anything and they would 
come back to me.  If they come back to me and they say 
no, no, it is in the area or it is just this house, that is when 
10 
I would 
call 
Mr Mokonyane and say look, there is 
something wrong at home, we are not sure whether it is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did you say Mr or Ms Mokonyane? 
MS THOMAS:   Mr. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is when you would call him? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I would call him because he was 
responsible for most of things around maintenance at 
home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now how would you have become 
20 
aware of the maintenance issue. 
MS THOMAS:   Well, what happened was, Mr Mokanyane 
had indicated to me that look, from time to time the ladies 
would call you directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the helper or what? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 55 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   At home yes, their personal home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would call you directly. 
MS THOMAS:   It is not necessarily maintenance issues, 
that is why I am asking do I elaborate, it is not just 
maintenance issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, I accept that. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We talk about others, I just wanted to 
know what you are talking about when your maintenance 
issues because in your affidavit you do refer to what you 
10 
call maintenance issues, so I just want to [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, I am referring to that as maintenance 
issues 
but 
overall, 
at 
home 
it 
would 
not 
just 
be 
maintenance issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no. 
MS THOMAS:   It would be whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will get to the others. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on maintenance on what you call 
20 
maintenance issues you are talking about if the lights go 
off. 
MS THOMAS:   If the light go off, if the water goes off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the water goes off. 
MS THOMAS:   If there is a toilet leak. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 56 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  There are problems with the 
security. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Features in the house. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the electric fence. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, whatever.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That kind of thing, ja. 
MS THOMAS:   Anything – well, the ladies just had this 
thing that they would call me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And if I know that Ms Mokanyane is not 
there, available, I would call Mr Mokanyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   But, you know, it ended up more so that I 
would rather just end up calling Mr Mokanyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay. 
MS THOMAS:   He is, after all, the principal of the house 
so I would call him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would they call you even if he was not 
20 
present in the house? 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he would call in that case. 
MS THOMAS:   He would call if he needed to call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So whenever the helper called for such – 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 57 of 103 
 
called 
you 
on 
such 
issues 
it 
would 
mean 
that 
Mr 
Mokanyane is not home. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  And then once you have 
been told exactly what the problem is …(intervenes) 
MS THOMAS:   I would then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe the police at the gate have 
looked around, you would then phone Mr Mokanyane to tell 
him what has been brought to your attention. 
MS THOMAS:   There is often – look, it depended, Your 
10 
Honour, on what it was.  If it was a plumbing issue, would 
call the plumbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you would call a plumber? 
MS THOMAS:   Directly, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
MS THOMAS:   If there was a leak, I would call the 
plumbers.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   If there is electrical fault, I would call the 
electrician. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   But if it is something that I do not have any 
clue on how to address it I would call Mr Mokanyane. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 58 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And I saw in your affidavit – I got 
the impression that you would call Mr le Roux sometimes 
for certain things. 
MS THOMAS:   Well, it depended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   For example, I know that there was a day 
the alarm went crazy and they – I said to them switch it off 
at the mains or switch off the mains or switch off the power 
or whatever.  And for some reason it still did not help.  So I 
then called Mr Mokanyane and said Chief, there is this 
10 
problem at home, what do I do because it was rather noisy, 
according to the ladies, and he then said look, call this guy 
and speak to him about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr le Roux? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   But knowing – no, I did not know his 
surname was Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS THOMAS:   I just know him as Richard. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Richard? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  Did that happen a 
number of times that when there was some or other 
problem at home …[intervenes] 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 59 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I would …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said call Mr le Roux, Richard? 
MS THOMAS:   Call, Richard.  Ja, we would get Richard to 
come out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it happened a number of times? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja or I am in – wherever he is, can you 
please call Richard.  Otherwise …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then in that case you would 
then call Mr le Roux? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, as far as you know, he would 
then go to the house and try and attend to the problem. 
MS THOMAS:   He would try and attend to it and often I 
would ask him to please let me know whether it is attended 
to or sorted or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and he – would he report back to 
you? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, he would, he would tell me no, it is 
20 
sorted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   He would – I would ask him, what was the 
problem so that if it happens in future what do I do, you 
know? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 60 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And would he tell you? 
MS THOMAS:   He would tell me that no, it is the switch or 
that switch, but… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And that is where it ends. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you have said that that happened a 
number of times.  Would you say it is stretched over many 
years, I mean, you were with Mrs Mokonyane for about 
…[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   No, not – it would not stretch over that 
10 
many years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe from 2010 maybe or for…? 
MS THOMAS:   No, we have had – there is people that was 
there to do the electricity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   There is people that was there to do the 
plumbing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   So where I could sort it out, I would sort it 
out. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And not necessarily have to call Mr 
Mokanyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I would call him after. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 61 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And say – or even tell her after. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   You know, sometimes I would forget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   That there was this problem and it has 
been sorted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are able to say there were a 
number of times when you were asked to conduct Mr le 
Roux – that is Mr Richard le Roux… 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, Richard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …to go and attend to some problem, 
some or other problem in the house but you cannot say 
over what period. 
MS THOMAS:   No, not – it was not over a long period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not over a long period. 
MS THOMAS:     No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now why would you – when there is the 
issue of the alarm, why did you not call the alarm people 
20 
as you say you usually do? 
MS THOMAS:   I do not have anybody that – I do not know 
who deals with the alarms. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I do not know anybody that – if there was 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 62 of 103 
 
somebody that was dealing with alarms or with the alarm or 
if I had known who installed the alarm or I would have 
called that person.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But now in instances where you would 
call the electrician, would you then arrange for the 
payment of the electricians? 
MS THOMAS:   They would leave the invoice at the house 
and it would be paid by Mrs Mokanyane.  They would 
always leave the invoice with the ladies at home. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now did Mr le Roux leave and invoice 
10 
for the alarm? 
MS THOMAS:   I do not know. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you confirm when you were asked 
by the Chair that you did not call Mr le Roux, you called 
him a number of times. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, a few times. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And you – on page 37 there is 
an email – an SMS, I think, on the 1 June 2017. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the SMSes from you to Mr le Roux. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, like I said, I did not know his surname 
was Le Roux at – the one that read: Dear Richard. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is this from you to him? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And when you say:  Dear Richard – let 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 63 of 103 
 
me read it: 
“Dear Richard, there is a problem with the house 
with the alarm system, for some reason it keeps 
ringing so it now has to be switched off at the 
switch.” 
Now you did not give a house number, am I right? 
MS THOMAS:   No, I did not. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Why? 
MS THOMAS:   I was told by Mr Mokanyane to contact 
Richard and say to him that there is this problem with the 
10 
alarm, please he must tell me what to do and that was it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So Richard knew – Mr le Roux knew 
what house you are talking about? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, he obviously would have known 
because I was told just to tell him that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He told you not to tell him which house 
it is? 
MS THOMAS:   No, no, I did not – no, no, I am saying he 
would have known.  I am not saying that he did not know or 
that I did not tell him, I am saying he would know because 
20 
I was told by Mr Mokanyane to contact him. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, based on what the witness has said, 
Mr le Roux apparently had gone to the house a number of 
times, is it not? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 64 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he would know the house. 
MS THOMAS:   Look, he may have even been at the house 
without my knowledge, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   But I was told by Mr Mokanyane contact 
him and ask him to assist.  Hence, I am saying that please 
let know what to do because I had no clue what is going on 
with the alarm so this email – sorry, this SMS. 
MS THOMAS:   SMS. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Was not your first contract with Mr le 
Roux.   
MS THOMAS:   No, no it was not my first contact with Mr le 
Roux. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Hence you do not have the house 
numbers here. 
MS THOMAS:   No, I do not have the house numbers 
because I – once I called him, I think more or less for the 
same problem, I just called and said the alarm is still doing 
the same thing, the alarm is ringing.  It was a time the 
20 
alarm was just giving problems, so I would call and say the 
alarm if going off.  If he is in the area, he would say I am 
in the area, I will sort it out and I will tell Mr Mokanyane 
that Mr Mokanyane, I called Richard, he will go and sort it 
out from there on. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 65 of 103 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And you said you dealt with the 
issues of maintenance and other issues. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, that is why I asked if I should 
elaborate. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Please elaborate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, elaborate. 
MS THOMAS:   Other issues like, for example, you know, 
sometimes we had a lady that – like I said earlier, we had 
a problem with one of the toilets and it was leaking water.  
So the ladies had called me and said Sisi, there is this 
10 
problem with one of the toilets and it was – I know it was 
leaking water, so the ladies have called me and said Sisi, 
there is this problem with the toilet, so I would call the 
plumber.  It is okay, let me call the plumber and they will 
come out.  So they would – look, I do not know what will go 
on there and we then call the ladies and then they will tell 
me no, it is sorted and that is it.   
Other issues, there is a lady I know that used to or 
still does, I am not sure, delivers flowers, so she would 
also leave the invoice at home and the lady at the house 
20 
would say to me so and so was here and she delivered the 
invoice, please remind mama to pay it and then I would say 
to her you know what, put it at a place where mama can 
see it and then you give it to her when she gets there 
because I am not in a position to say that there is this 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 66 of 103 
 
thing, I may not even see her because more often you do 
not even get to see – so when she comes home, you just 
give it to her. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you were not involved in the 
ordering of new equipment we fitted at the house. 
MS THOMAS:   No, I …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And Mr Mokanyane did not instruct you 
to... 
MS THOMAS:   No, Mr Mokanyane would – no, Mr 
Mokanyane would do those things himself because I would 
10 
not know what exactly is needed there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  Now this Mr – this Richard... 
MS THOMAS:   Richard, yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Where did he work? 
MS THOMAS:   I did not know where he worked, I did not 
even know what company he was working for. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And how do you get hold of him? 
MS THOMAS:   Mr Mokanyane gave me his number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And there was  - he never arranged for 
the installation of CCTVs at the house of Mr and Mrs 
20 
Mokanyane? 
MS THOMAS:   No.  No, my only arrangement, I would just 
say look, as directed, I would just say that Cynthia – oops, 
sorry, x, y, z is – or not even Cynthia, Busisiwe, somebody 
is coming to the house, Ntata will tell you what they are 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 67 of 103 
 
going to do.  If he has not told you, this is what is going to 
happen, people are coming and this is but not what time or 
whatever, I do not know what time they would come. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But you were never instructed that 
there were people going to install CCTVs. 
MS THOMAS:   No, not CCTVs, no, not to my knowledge.  I 
would just be told please tell Busi or please tell this one or 
please tell Grace that people are coming, they must open 
for them so that they could tell the police. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You were the link between the outside 
10 
world and the department – between the department and 
the minister.  Anything going to Minister, official, will come 
through you? 
MS THOMAS:   Not quite as – I am the PA, I am maybe the 
link. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some things will come through you, 
others will not. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, some things would come, some would 
not.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   We also had a Chief of Staff, we also had a 
media liaison and they had direct access to her so it would 
or would not come through me. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And no department, no government 
department 
liaise 
with 
you 
to 
install 
CCTVs 
at 
Ms 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 68 of 103 
 
Mokanyane’s house. 
MS THOMAS:   At home? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  At home. 
MS THOMAS:   Okay, when we were at housing, it was a 
whole arrangement, I know that they did upgrades and it 
was a whole arrangement because I had to facilitate them 
going to the house.  So I had to inform the ladies at home 
that people are coming from the department and that 
happened during the time when we were at the Department 
of Housing. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So Department of Housing contacted 
you? 
MS THOMAS:   It is not the Department of Housing, per se, 
we were at the Department of Housing at the time.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   And it is not the Department of Housing per 
se but obviously there is security and risk analysis people, 
they would be there, the security guys, all of that was 
arranged through the office of the Premier. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Let us get this clear.  Who contacted 
20 
you about the installation of CCTVs at Ms Mokanyane’s 
house? 
MS THOMAS:   The gentlemen at the Office of the Premier. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the Office of the Premier said 
there will be installations at Ms Mokanyane’s house? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 69 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Well, the first point of contact was when 
they told me that they needed to go and do an assessment 
and they had to visit the house to see what needs to be 
done, what needs to be installed and what needs to be 
repaired and for security reasons I needed to just inform 
the ladies that they would come. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And do you inform the ladies? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I would inform the ladies. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then did you get a feedback about 
the assessment that had been done? 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Not a full feedback because it was not 
within my scope.  We had a head of office even then, so 
the head of office would also, as the head of office, they 
have broader scope but I would not get feedback.  They 
would either talk to head of office or – but not even directly 
to Ms Mokanyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. I am sorry, Mr Notshe, let us take 
the tea adjournment.  We will adjourn now for tea and 
resume at twenty five to twelve. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it, Mr Notshe, that you should be 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 70 of 103 
 
able to finish in the next 25 minutes?  Ja.  H’m?  Switch on 
your mic. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well, it also depends on Mrs Thomas or 
Ms Thomas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, as I see, it should not be a 
problem, finishing within 25 minutes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Thomas, I just want you to confirm 
this.  You say that the Office of the Premier went and did 
assessments, security risk assessments at the private 
home of Ms Mokanyane and then they installed CCTVs at 
10 
the home of Ms Mokanyane? 
MS THOMAS:   At the private residence and this was 
during her time as the MEC for Housing. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And did they write back to you or send 
you an invoice or...? 
MS THOMAS:   No, I just – all I had to do was facilitate 
their visit there.  Other than that – no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You facilitated their visit to install 
these? 
MS THOMAS:   To do the risk assessment, to go and have 
20 
a look at the house and they obviously had their reports 
which they would not share with me.  I am not privy to that 
kind of information. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They talked to you making a risk 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 71 of 103 
 
assessment? 
MS THOMAS:   No, Your Honour, they just may ask me to 
please make sure that they have access to the property. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   And they were also accompanied by one of 
our security people in the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you – that was for a risk assessment 
10 
as you understood the position? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Continue? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then they then later on asked you 
to arrange for them to install the CCTVs? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, they would have spoken to Mr 
Mokanyane but they would have done that too and my 
knowledge, I also in that made that arrangement to 
facilitate that they had been given access and that was it.  
I do not …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, are you saying that they 
spoke to you when they wanted to install CCTV cameras? 
MS THOMAS:   I would - Your Honour, I would just be the 
one that would ask, they would say make arrangements for 
the people at home, we are coming on this particular day. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 72 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I am asking is, whether you are 
saying at some point they contacted you. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And asked you to make arrangements. 
MS THOMAS:   So that they could go back to the house 
and they will be working at home, that is all.  The word 
was, they will be working at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, they did not talk about installation of 
10 
the CCTV, they just said they want to do some work. 
MS THOMAS:   I would ask, I would say what are you going 
to do?  No, we are going to do the fences, we are going to 
check the gates and we are going to – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say that is what they told you? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, they just said we are going to do the 
fence, the gates, cameras. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   The lights need… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   Ja.  But that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not know whether they 
actually did that, you just know they talk to you about 
planning to do it. 
MS THOMAS:   They were there.  They were there because 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 73 of 103 
 
at one point Mr Mokanyane met with them to discuss the 
issue of the gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so – okay, what you are dealing 
with is quite important.  Now you say you know for sure? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I do, Your Honour.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That they did what? 
MS THOMAS:   That they went and they put on the electric 
fence, they did the lights. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   They put up the electric fence.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, they did the lights and a few 
other things, I am not sure what else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Security lights. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, there was quite a number of things that 
they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And CCTV cameras. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   They put up a room for the police. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   You know, to be sheltered, especially in 
rainy weather and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   So they had to put in monitors and things 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 74 of 103 
 
like that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that you know. 
MS THOMAS:   That I know, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you know it because they told you 
so or because you were there when they did it. 
MS THOMAS:   No, I know that because I was told this is 
what – because I asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS THOMAS:   I cannot just say that you need access to 
the house, I need to know what you are going to do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now the investigators, and you know 
the investigators for the Commission, you have met them 
on occasion. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The contacted the Office of the 
Premier. 
MS THOMAS:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And it said it did not do any – did not 
install any security features at the house. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   Well, I find that strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did she not say it was Housing 
department? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, she says it was done by the 
Premier ’s office. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 75 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   It was a time when I know that there was 
things that was done at MEC’s homes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was when Ms Mokanyane was MEC. 
MS THOMAS:   An MEC, not a Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was she MEC for Housing at the 
time? 
MS THOMAS:   She was MEC for housing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was people from the Housing 
department that you spoke to. 
MS THOMAS:   We had a person from the Housing 
10 
department and we had people from the Office of the 
Premier who coordinated and SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   They coordinated because there was a 
need for – I do not know, some sort of an upgrade to 
MEC’s homes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS THOMAS:   So it was not just Ms Mokanyane as the 
MEC at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   It was something to do with MEC’s homes, 
but not during her term as Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:    Your evidence now before break, you 
said this was done by the Office of the Premier. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 76 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I am saying that Office of the Premier 
with a person from the Department of Housing and SAPS, it 
was all coordinated. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The Office of the Premier said they did 
no upgrades and they did not install security features at 
the house.  
MS THOMAS:   Well, that I did not know but what I can say 
and I can confirm that whatever was done it was done 
through SAPS at the Office of the Premier. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Which office? 
10 
MS THOMAS:   It may even be the Department of Housing, 
I do not know those technicalities. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But which office said to you, you want 
to go to Ms Mokanyane’s home to install security features, 
please …(intervenes) 
MS THOMAS:   The gentleman that we were working with 
at the Department of Housing that is responsible for safety, 
so it was a matter of assessments and things like that and 
I do know …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember his name by any 
chance? 
MS THOMAS:   I remember his face.  I am not sure if it is 
Thabo, something like that but I cannot remember his 
name. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 77 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   But he was responsible for security. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anybody else …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   At the office of – at the Department of 
Housing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anybody else either in the 
Premier ’s office or in the Housing department or SAPS 
whose name you remember? 
MS THOMAS:   Not SAPS, I would not know, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not SAPS, ja.  Premier ’s office?  
10 
Somebody that…? 
MS THOMAS:   Office of the Premier they have their own 
security, I do not know if there was still – if there is people 
there, the same people, if they are still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but are you able to remember the 
names of some of the people from the Premier ’s office who 
were 
involved 
who 
would 
know 
about 
this 
if 
the 
Commission wants to check? 
MS THOMAS:   We – there was a Colin, I do not know if he 
is still there or if he was even involved during that period.  
20 
I just know his name as Colin, I do not know if he was part 
of the involvement but he was at the office of the Premier.  
Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the – so just to get it clear so 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 78 of 103 
 
that there is no I misunderstanding.  The person who asked 
for you to arrange for security features to be installed was 
a person from Department of Housing, is that correct? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, it was done through the department – 
gentleman 
that 
was 
responsible 
for 
security 
at 
the 
Department of Housing. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And do you know who the person is? 
MS THOMAS:   As I indicated now, it is either Thabo or 
something, I do not even know.  I can see his face though 
but in terms of his name, I cannot recall.  It could be Thabo 
10 
something, I am not sure. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If the Commission were to ask 
Department of Housing what section of the department 
should they ask …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   It would be the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said security is it not? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, security, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was somebody who was from the 
security.   
MS THOMAS:   Somebody that was working with security, 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Department of Housing. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, in the Department of Housing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know if that person was the head 
of the security unit at the housing department? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 79 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   I do not know, Your Honour, if he was the 
head or …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know, okay. 
MS THOMAS:   Or if he was just assigned to take care of 
the matter, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  Now you had promised the Chair 
and the Commission that things would come back to you. 
MS THOMAS:   H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Has anything come back to you? 
10 
MS THOMAS:   When I went to the bathroom, I tried to 
recall a few things.  No, no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:    Because Mr Agrizzi does recall in his 
evidence what he discussed with you. 
MS THOMAS:   What he discussed with me? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Can I go to that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If you go to page 56 of the record. 
MS THOMAS:   Page 50...? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  56. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Notshe, before you proceed, for 
quite some time I was under the impression that Mr 
Agrizzi’s evidence and Mr le Roux’s evidence was to the 
effect that BOSASA installed the CCTV cameras. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 80 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when I was looking at this affidavit 
Mr Agrizzi last night, I did not seem to pick that up and I 
do not know whether it is in Mr le Roux’s affidavit because 
I did not have that affidavit at hand and when I did not 
seem to pick that part up in Mr Agrizzi’s three affidavits, I 
thought that maybe what he said was that BOSASA 
attended to repairs and maintenance of the security 
features at Ms Nomvula Mokanyane’s private house as 
opposed to having bought and installed the CCTV cameras.  
So I do not know whether it is something you are sure 
10 
about or whether you might be mistaken like I was. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, my recollection is Richard le 
Roux seems to confirm that they installed the CCTVs.  I 
will also have to check. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, that is why it would have 
helped if those affidavits were here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But, Chair, as the matter stand now, 
the witness says these were installed by the Department of 
20 
Housing and I will go back to the evidence and check with 
the witness, with the – and check with the investigating 
officers and then – and look at that with the evidence of 
Agrizzi and Le Roux and then we can deal with that if 
something comes out of it.  But in any event, the 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 81 of 103 
 
investigators will follow up the evidence of Ms Thomas 
insofar as the installation of this by the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is just that if Mr Agrizzi and Mr le 
Roux, if the position is that they do not say that the CCTV 
cameras were installed by BOSASA then that issue falls 
away. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if all they are saying it was – 
BOSASA was repairing and maintaining security features 
that had been installed by somebody else. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And Ms Thomas has made it clear 
that there were a number of times when she had to contact 
Mr Richard le Roux with regard to things to be fixed at 
home, at the private home of Ms Mokanyane. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words, if you need to check 
whether Mr Agrizzi’s evidence and Mr le Roux’s evidence 
includes saying that BOSASA installed the CCTV cameras. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if it does not include that, 
maybe 
there 
is 
no 
reason 
to 
go 
further 
about 
the 
installation. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But with regard to maintenance, I think 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 82 of 103 
 
that her evidence seems to support a least part of what Mr 
Agrizzi said insofar as Mr Agrizzi said at a certain stage 
BOSASA put together a team led by Mr Richard le Roux 
that was meant to take care of whatever issues arose in 
the house, so what she has said seems to be consistent 
with that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Insofar as maintenance and issues are 
concerned. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now just before I take you to page 56.  
Are you there, page 56? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 53? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, five six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five six. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   And is 56 part of the summons? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, no, 56 is part of – yes, the 
20 
summons, it is annexure to the summons.  Look at 56 at 
the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The right hand …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   It is very tiny.  Little tiny [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 83 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, we cannot all speak 
at the same time.  Why is the writing on those pages so 
small? 
MS THOMAS:   I cannot see anything here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Notshe, why? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I suppose, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the other pages are fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I suppose we were trying to save paper 
but I would not know why, I do not know why they print it 
like this.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, somebody should have checked 
this bundle and seen that these pages with such fine print 
should be replaced with others that have got the correct 
size of print.  It is difficult to read here.  Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, just to – on the part of the 
people who keep the records there has been concern that – 
if you look at the pages, they would have had about more 
than 10 pages, 20 pages of this.  I think at times it is 
merely to save paper and costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it does not save – it does not have 
20 
to save paper if we cannot read it.  The whole point is that 
we must read it first, we must be able to read.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can I continue to refer the witness or 
should I get …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, refer the witness if you can, if she 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 84 of 103 
 
can see – maybe you …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   It is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will read for us if you able to read 
it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I can. 
MS THOMAS:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, read for all of us but will you arrange 
afterwards that the pages here are replaced by pages with 
pages that have got the correct size of the print? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And it says on page 9 of 142 pages 
10 
and it is the left hand side of the document and it starts by 
21 January 2019, day 37 and then there is Advocate Paul 
Pretorius SC, he says: 
“Were further instructions given to you by Mr Gavin 
Watson after 2002 in relation to Ms Mokanyane?” 
Then Mr Agrizzi says: 
“Chair, there were numerous requests that were 
given through the year.  These I have to contact a 
personal assistant and these included organising 
and paying of funerals in respect of deceased 
20 
family members, I would have to arrange for a 
rental vehicle up to three months at a time for her 
daughter when her daughter was coming back from 
China where she was studying and…” 
And then intervene.  So what I wanted to refer you, it 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 85 of 103 
 
seems as if Mr Agrizzi says …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Mr...? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Seems as Mr Agrizzi says he dealt 
with you arranging funerals and even hiring of cars. 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:    Why do you say no because when you 
say you cannot remember what you discussed with Mr 
Agrizzi? 
MS THOMAS:   I can confirm that I have not arranged 
vehicles through Mr Agrizzi nor funerals and I know that 
10 
there was even made mention of ANC rallies and catering 
and cakes.  No.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And yet up to now you cannot 
remember what you discussed with him? 
MS THOMAS:   Those particular items, I have never 
spoken to Mr Agrizzi about, it is not – did not fall under my 
ambit, unfortunately. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  Now, lastly, do you say these 
security upgrades, TVs and – were installed by the 
Department of Housing? 
20 
MS THOMAS:   I – Mr Notshe, maybe just a point, I am 
sorry that I have to interrupt and I am sorry, Your Honour, 
but …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, do not worry, it is fine. 
MS THOMAS:   I made it clear that I said it was a 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 86 of 103 
 
coordinated matter between the security people at housing, 
SAPS as well as the security people at the Office of the 
Premier. 
 
So 
who 
installed 
it, 
who 
paid 
for 
it, 
I 
unfortunately cannot answer on that one. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now do you know when these had 
faults, why would you call Mr le Roux instead of calling the 
department that had installed them? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, if you look at the timeframes, we 
were at the office of the Department of Housing.  Where 
and why I was called, Mr le Roux was much later in the 
10 
time and that is what it is.  At the Department of Housing 
and at the Office of the Premier I was not relating to Mr le 
Roux at all.  So this installation was way before the time of 
Mr le Roux and Mr le Roux only came in the latter part of 
the year so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you deal with Mr le Roux during the 
time when Ms Mokanyane was Minister of Sanitation and 
…[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   That particular SMS, Your Honour, was 
during that time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja and that was her private home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you also deal with Mr le Roux at 
other times other than when Ms Mokanyane was Minister? 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 87 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was only when she was Minister as far 
as you remember? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, just lastly – or just for reference, 
I had referred to emails on pages 83, 85.  Those emails, 
Chair, are on EXHIBIT T29 which will be the affidavit of Ms 
Gina Peters, I am merely mentioning them for purposes of 
reading and record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This affidavit, we will have it admitted 
later when Ms Gina Peters testifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I have no further questions for the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is the arrangement about 
when she is testifying? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Testifying on Wednesday, the 2 n d. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On Wednesday? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have another witness who should 
take the whole day on Wednesday. How long do you think 
she is going to be? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  She should not be long, she should not 
be long, Chair, this is …[intervenes] 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 88 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is like what? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  If unless you were to make an 
arrangement for her to start at nine, we should finish by 
ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so I think we may have to make 
that arrangement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I will arrange now, it is early enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is early enough for us to arrange to 
start at nine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then by ten we will be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Or maybe we say half past nine? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Half past nine still, it is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Even if we start at half past nine, 
Chair, we will just – the latest will be just on the other side 
of ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us say half past nine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That is fine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Ms Thomas... 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Your Honour? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In your affidavit you have also dealt with 
Mr Agrizzi’s evidence relating to the  - or his evidence that 
BOSASA provided Ms Mokanyane with groceries.  Do you 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 89 of 103 
 
remember that? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and he listed in his affidavit some of 
the items of the groceries that he said were bought for Ms 
Mokanyane and they included meat and they included 
liquor and they included a number of things.  I think they 
are set out in his affidavit. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have responded in paragraph 91 
to that part of his evidence and you said: 
10 
“Another aspect that warrants specific mention 
pertains to large scale groceries, arrangements for 
the 
mentioned 
birthdays 
and 
burials 
of 
the 
deceased, loved ones of the Mokanyane family.  
The large-scale groceries could not have been for 
the family consumption.  I believe this aspect was 
cleared 
by 
the 
former 
Minister 
herself. 
 
My 
knowledge 
of 
the 
arrangements 
in 
the 
house 
objectively conveys the message that the type of 
large 
scale 
groceries 
could 
not 
have 
been 
20 
accommodated in the house.” 
You remember that is what you say in your affidavit, that 
paragraph 91.1? 
MS THOMAS:   Let me just go to that, sorry, Your Honour? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to find it in your affidavit? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 90 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I was there now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, paragraph 91.1.  Okay and then in 
91.2 you say. 
“However, I distinctly remember that there were 
instances 
when 
I 
corresponded 
with 
people 
including Mr Agrizzi. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “...Relating to such large scale 
 
type of groceries that is mentioned for the  
community projects for the elderly in Kagiso.” 
10 
And then: 
“Even then Mr Watson would always be the person 
that 
initiated 
the 
entire 
process. 
 
He 
would 
telephone me and intimidatingly and yet joyfully say 
“Now we are stop everything and focus on the 
people that really need a bright festive season.” 
And you say: 
“I would immediately know who to contact and 
establish the anticipated number of people in need.  
I would also make sure that the relevant dates are 
20 
noted in the calendar.” 
Now it seems to me – and you must tell me if I 
misunderstand your evidence, it seems to me that you are 
saying you know about groceries paid or purchased by 
BOSASA but you are saying as far as you know they were 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 91 of 103 
 
for needy people in the community and not for the 
Mokanyane family. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MS THOMAS:   That is correct, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now the – your involvement in all of 
this, these groceries, I take it you were involved because 
your principal, Ms Mokanyane, had something to do with 
them, there was a role she was to play? 
MS THOMAS:   Parcels would be made. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS THOMAS:   Parcels would be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   And it would go to families in Kagiso. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   We would – ladies would know who to 
invite, which families are in most need and it would then go 
to those families.  The numbers would normally vary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   So even if you are proving for 70 or 30 
20 
people, you know, word of mouth, you will always find more 
people so one would try and accommodate for just the bit 
extra. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 92 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say the ladies who would know?   
MS THOMAS:   We had …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said something that ladies 
would know. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, I did say.  We had a network of people 
in the area, Kagiso community work.  They did not just 
work, they did not work for Ms Mokanyane or anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   They did mostly community work in Kagiso. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS THOMAS:   So they would know, you know, where there 
is a need. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And they would identify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   But it is not the same ladies, it would 
always be different people because people come and go.  
But they would know who the needy are, the most needy, 
actually.  And it was a yearly thing.  There was one time 
when we did it even for her birthday but it was arranged 
20 
completely differently so that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, would Ms Mokonyane be involved 
in the distribution of those groceries or parcels? 
MS THOMAS:   Well, I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 93 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   So I do not know if she was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   But I was not there, I would just be part of 
the here and there and make sure that this is there and 
liaise with her sister, who is late, and she would also know 
that this is coming and this is what it is needed for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I did not here that. 
MS THOMAS:   I would liaise with her late sister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whose late sister? 
MS THOMAS:   Ms Mokanyane’s late sister. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would liaise with her? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  In order to identify …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   No, no, just to indicate that there would be 
this coming. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS THOMAS:   And this is where you put it because we 
would be making parcels. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, did she leave in Kagiso? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, she is from Kagiso. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   But she was living at the home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So was she a common 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 94 of 103 
 
feature, you said the ladies would change, it would not be 
same 
people 
all 
the 
time, 
would 
she 
always 
be 
…[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:    She was at the house.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS THOMAS:   And besides – she was living at the house, 
so besides the ladies, the helpers, she was there living at 
the house so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that at Ms Mokanyane’s house? 
MS THOMAS:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, her sister lived in that house? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS THOMAS:   So obviously for me that would be the 
safest person in the safest place to have things dropped 
off so that we could coordinate it from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Because if it was taken directly to Kagiso it 
would have been a bit of a problem as to where and – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS THOMAS:   And it would be done, taken and 
distributed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   People would be invited to come and… 
CHAIRPERSON:   So these parcels or groceries would be 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 95 of 103 
 
delivered to Ms Mokanyane’s house but for – as far as you 
know for onward delivery to Kagiso, not to stay in the 
house? 
MS THOMAS:   Not standing there, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS THOMAS:   Not standing at the house, it would go to 
Kagiso. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am asking is whether 
you are saying the first point …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Your Honour. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   …would be that they would be brought to 
Ms Mokanyane’s house? 
MS THOMAS:   To the garage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the garage. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then afterwards they would then be 
taken to Kagiso. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To be distributed to the community. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Your Honour. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would this happen around Christmas 
time December? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Festive season? 
MS THOMAS:   It would happen around Christmas time, 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 96 of 103 
 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Sometimes it would try to be a bit early. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   Because we normally would finish off at the 
15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   So sometimes it would be after – even after 
the 15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay and would it be a yearly 
10 
thing, did it happen every year? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Ms Mokanyane would have this yearly 
event every year save for the last two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS THOMAS:   Due to ill health and the morning of her 
husband. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so Ms Mokanyane would be there 
for these deliveries? 
MS THOMAS:   Not for the deliveries, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but she would know about the 
20 
arrangement? 
MS THOMAS:   At times she would not even know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   I would be told by Mr Watson let us do this 
and let us do that. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 97 of 103 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS THOMAS:   I would indicate to him that okay, I am not 
sure how many people we are looking for and try and 
contact the ladies and establish how many people we are 
looking for – looking at to accommodate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And we would take it from there  I would 
just indicate these are the number of people and whatever 
is brought, it is not my call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS THOMAS:   Whatever is brought is brought and 
packages would be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know how these parcels of 
groceries were taken from Ms Mokanyane’s house to 
Kagiso? 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who took them and so on? 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know that? 
MS THOMAS:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and in terms of how they were 
brought to Ms Mokanyane’s house do you know if that was 
BOSASA? 
MS THOMAS:   I would be the one that would be called.  
Mr Agrizzi would indicate that, you know, you would get 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 98 of 103 
 
this call, just for a day and make sure that somebody is 
home to take responsibility of these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they would be put into the garage, 
in the garage? 
MS THOMAS: I know that it went into the garage because 
there is…   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there was a lot …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   There was no space. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no space. 
MS 
THOMAS: 
 
 
Ja 
and 
it 
would 
immediately, 
not 
immediately but, you know, as soon as possible be taken 
away. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
maybe 
after 
a 
few 
days 
or 
something. 
MS THOMAS:   Not even a few days …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe a day. 
MS THOMAS:   Ja, maybe the next day, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Now did you say – you said it 
20 
would happen around the festive season, Christmas period. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, Christmas period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sometimes a little earlier. 
MS THOMAS:   A little earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, like early December. 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 99 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Depending on when Mr Watson would call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now would it happen like every 
year?  I do not know, I may have asked you this question, I 
just want to …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   Sometimes it would happen year after year 
and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  So sometimes they will skip a year?  
MS THOMAS:   Sometimes they would skip a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   But Ms Mokanyane would also then arrange 
10 
her own …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Make her own arrangements? 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, to give people food. 
MS THOMAS:   To give.  At one time we went and we did a 
blanket distribution …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry did you say he or she? 
MS THOMAS:   She. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mokanyane, Ms Mokanyane? 
MS THOMAS:   She.  At one time we did a blanket 
20 
distribution to the old people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS THOMAS:   As well as groceries and those kind of 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now from the time that you 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 100 of 103 
 
started working for Ms Mokanyane which you said was 
1999. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
To 
2019 
when 
she 
stopped 
being 
Minister, for example, are you able to say that maybe most 
of those years this happened even though it might not have 
been every year or are you not able to say that? 
MS THOMAS:   It would happen most of the years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Most of the years. 
MS THOMAS:   Sometimes it would be in the middle of the 
10 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or sometimes even …[intervenes] 
MS THOMAS:   For her birthday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   She would take the initiative of instead of 
spending her birthday, she would spend it with the 
grannies and the granddads in Kagiso. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS THOMAS:   And that would also be in the middle of the 
year. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS THOMAS:   For her birthday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when it happened in the 
middle of the year maybe for her birthday would BOSASA 
have been involved in providing parcels or…? 
31 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 258 
 
Page 101 of 103 
 
MS THOMAS:   Not to my knowledge, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to your knowledge, that would be a 
separate arrangement for herself. 
MS THOMAS:   She would do it by herself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS THOMAS:   And – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but the Christmas period ones that 
involved BOSASA? 
MS THOMAS:   Not always. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not always but most of the 
10 
years. 
MS THOMAS:   Not always BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not always BOSASA? 
MS THOMAS:   No.  She would do some of these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, I accept that. 
MS THOMAS:   Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just talking about those that were
