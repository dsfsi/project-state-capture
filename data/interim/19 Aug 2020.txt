PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 19 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath again? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR SODI:  Pheane Edwin Sodi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
10 
prescribed oath? 
MR SODI:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR SODI:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR SODI:  So help me God. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Sodi I would like for a short 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 4 of 249 
 
while to go back to the position in Gauteng where your 
company Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited did work for the 
Gauteng government. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would look please at Free 
State 1 the bundle is behind you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Bundles FS1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The spines have not been 
changed on all the bundles Chair. 
MR SODI:  Ja I have got it here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I cannot hear you I do not 
know if it is the air conditioner noise.  I think they will sort 
out the air conditioner noise.  Just – you might have to 
raise your voice. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  In fact, if we could ask 
that the air conditioner be switched off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think they will do that.  I think they 
will do that.  I think you were saying something about the 
bundles behind him that is what I did not hear. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair it is not an important 
20 
point but we will refer to FS1 at page 406, do you have 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 406? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 5 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we are using the black numbers 
again, 406. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS1, 406.  Do you have that in front 
of you? 
MR SODI:  I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Sodi that is what we have 
referred to in evidence previously as a service level 
agreement applicable to the appointment of a panel. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So each member of the panel would 
10 
have entered into a service level agreement of this nature? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
This 
does 
not 
contain 
any 
contractual terms and conditions for example price or the 
nature of the work to be done? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As you have told us that is 
contained in an instruction to perform work IPW? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This agreement is its own terms 
20 
appears to have expired after a duration of 36 months.  It 
was a three-year service level agreement of FS1.  We are 
looking at the black numbers in the top left-hand corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius are we not supposed to give 
it its own exhibit number and admit as – it is not a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 6 of 249 
 
standalone document? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well up to now we have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the arrangement was we would 
deal with them as and when you get to them – the different 
documents in terms of getting them admitted those that are 
standalone documents. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  DCJ the document that we are 
talking about is Annexure ES1 to Exhibit TT8 Mr Sodi’s first 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is an annexure to an affidavit? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay then we do not have to give it a 
separate – okay no that is fine.  You said we should go to 
452? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  The signature of this 
SLA was affected on the 14 September 2010, you recall 
that Mr Sodi you will see that on page 452 of FS1? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So it would – would have expired 
but for the extension three months after the 14 September 
20 
2010? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three months or three years? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry three years? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 7 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Apologies Chair.  36 months.  That 
as 
I 
understood 
your 
evidence 
was 
a 
service 
level 
agreement entered into by each service provider on a 
panel of between fifty and sixty service providers. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The agreement or let me put it 
another way.  Let me deal with that now rather.  That 
agreement was extended and if we look at FS8 159 you 
have just told the Chair that that agreement was extended 
to the month of August 2014 you said late August 2014, is 
10 
this the extension letter? 
MR SODI:  That is the extension letter Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is addressed to you, attention 
Edwin Sodi of Blackhead Consulting.  You see that? 
MR SODI:  I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it is dated the 13 May 2014. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened between September 
2013 when it would have expired and the date of this letter 
the 13 May 2014? 
20 
MR SODI:  This could have been the second extension 
Chair I would not recall but this probably – this letter 
probably refers to the second extension because it would 
have expired the previous year.  So… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright we have not seen that letter 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 8 of 249 
 
nor have the investigators been able to obtain any further 
correspondence than that. 
MR SODI:  Ja I do not think I have got a letter either Chair 
but it should have been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well the first paragraph of the letter 
suggests that there may have been a prior extension. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it says: 
“This letter serves to advise Blackhead 
Consulting that the contract to provide 
10 
professional resource teams services to the 
department is extended by five months from 
1 April 2014 to 31 August 2014.” 
And – so it suggests that there may have been… 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A prior extension because otherwise they 
would extend it from September 2013? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair.     
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  I do recall that it was more than one extension 
20 
definitely but I do not seem to have the first extension 
letter.  This would be the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is signed by a Ms Margaret Ann 
Diedericks, who was she? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 9 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  She was the acting Head of Department at the 
time. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In Gauteng? 
MR SODI:  In Gauteng correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you would have been doing 
work for that department for a period of at least three to 
four years? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall receiving more than 
one extension letter? 
10 
MR SODI:  I recall that the extension was done more than 
once Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  More than once. 
MR SODI:  But I do not seem to recall getting more than 
one letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did Ms Diedericks sign both letters 
or just one? 
MR SODI:  I am not sure Chair.  She came in the 
department I think after the HOD then had resigned and 
she came in – in an acting capacity.  I cannot recall the 
20 
exact dates on which she came in.  So it is possible that 
she could have signed the first one or it could have been 
the previous HOD who resigned.  I cannot recall those 
details unfortunately. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then if we could go please to FS8 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 10 of 249 
 
at page 88.   
MR SODI:  Ja I am there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This is a memorandum that has 
been dealt with in evidence which motivates the initiation 
of a plan to eradicate asbestos roofs in Gauteng.  It is 
dated the 13 March 2014.  You recall the initiation of that 
plan, you have spoken about it? 
MR SODI:  We have spoken about this ja.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  I do recall this. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it is addressed to Margaret Ann 
Diedericks and it said she was and you knew her to be the 
acting Head of Department of the Gauteng Province Human 
Settlements, is that correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now this document although it is a 
memorandum 
sets 
out 
certain 
terms 
and 
conditions 
including on page 91 of FS8 a rate of R650.00 per house. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And attached to it – well first of all 
20 
let us go to the recommendations in the memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Did 
you say the rate is at page 91?  Oh yes I can see it.  Okay.  
No you may continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have it Chair? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 11 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is a fixed rate not subject to 
any variations.  I think we have dealt with that. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we have also dealt with the fact 
that at page 92 this memorandum recommended the 
appointment of eight professional resource teams. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And appointment in terms of 
attached Terms of Reference and those Terms of Reference 
10 
appear at page 94 of FS8 and on page 98 there is a 
detailed scope of the work to be done.  Do you see that? 
MR SODI:  I see that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we have dealt with some of that 
including the particular paragraph 5.1 on page 98 where 
the detail of this scope of work is set out in the Terms of 
Reference. 
 
Those 
would 
have 
been 
incorporated 
I 
presume in an instruction to perform work later issued to 
you. 
MR SODI:  That is correct ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Including the price of R650.00? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
And 
this 
provided 
for 
the 
appointment of eight service providers? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 12 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of which Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Limited was one? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The income from the asbestos work 
that Blackhead Consulting did in Gauteng you told the 
investigators in an interview that the – the income was 
approximately R200 million, is that correct? 
MR SODI:  Well the – Chair we were appointed for – to 
audit approximately – I am speaking under correction in the 
region of about 250 000 units.  So the income would have 
10 
been 250 000 multiplied by the R650.00.  So that would 
have been the total – well the total value of the project 
would have been 250 000 multiplied by R650.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think – I think in terms of the 
transcript of the interview you – you put it in the region of 
R200 million if I am not mistaken or somewhere… 
MR SODI:  It could have been – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  I mean – you know it could have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us just go to what you said 
it is in FS6 at page 268.   
MR SODI:  Okay I am there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  At FS6, 268 line 10 one of 
the investigators Mr Gerard Swanepoel asks a question, he 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 13 of 249 
 
says: 
“Okay so last question from my side around 
Gauteng now.  How much money did you 
make on the Gauteng audit?” 
 
And then Mr Edwin Sodi: 
“I think it was about – ja it was about in the 
region of about R200 million.” 
 
Mr Gerard Swanepoel. 
“No, no, no that is the total how much did 
you?” 
10 
 
And then there is a – some exchange of words 
between you – polite words and you reply further down the 
page.  Mr Edwin Sodi: 
“Yes it was – I mean I can give you the 
exact figure but it was in the region of 
about R200 million.” 
“So that was your profit” 
 
Says Mr Swanepoel. 
“No, no, no.” 
 
Says Mr Sodi. 
20 
“It was the total.” 
 
Right.  And then over the page FS6, 269 in relation 
to the profit – perhaps we should go back to the question 
on page 268.   Mr Swanepoel says to you: 
“So that is my question.  You got a total 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 14 of 249 
 
amount paid by the department for the 
work.  How much profit did you make?” 
 
And over the page Mr Edwin Sodi: 
“It would have been about 60% of that more 
or less 50 to 60% of that.” 
 
And you say you were very happy with that.  So the 
exchange here indicates that as far as you were aware 
certainly at the time of the interview you would have made 
at least R100 million in the Gauteng Asbestos Project? 
MR SODI:  Well give or take Chair.  We were appointed for 
10 
R650.00 per house and if I recall our cost for doing the 
work was between R300.00 and R350.00.  The balance 
would have been profit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR SODI:  So that is – that is how I arrived at this. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have more precise figures later 
but for the – for the present just to establish that your 
profit would have been and I stress in the region of R100 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure it looks like much 
20 
more than that.   
MR SODI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if he says the cost was about 
R300 000. 
MR SODI:  Average – so I am saying the – Chair that our 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 15 of 249 
 
costs per house was in the region of between R300.00 and 
R350.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh R300.00 oh – not… 
MR SODI:  Yes.  So if you minus the R350.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was the whole… 
MR SODI:  From the R600.00 you are left with R300.00.  
That would have been more or less our profit margin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but … 
MR SODI:  Per house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But looking at how many houses you 
10 
were to do if you were… 
MR SODI:  Then yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you were – if you – if your cost per 
house was about R300.00 then for the – for all the houses 
then would you not be looking at more or less 300 000 in 
terms of total costs?  Were the houses not about R300.00 
or were they R200.00 and something? 
MR SODI:  No, no it was not – it was like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R300 000.00 was Free State. 
MR SODI:  That is correct ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Gauteng was what?  R200.00 and 
something? 
MR SODI:  It was between – ja it was about R250 – 
R250 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 16 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But actually, if they were less than 300 
then that increases your profit compared to if they were 
300 000? 
MR SODI:  No it – no it does not because your profit 
margin in this case is calculated per house.  So depending 
on the number of houses that we would have been 
appointed for – so in other words if it was 250 000 houses 
for instances and we are making a profit margin of R300.00 
per house we would multiply the 250 000 by R300.00 and 
10 
that would give us more or less the profit margin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I – we are probably under – we are 
probably on the same page but I am not sure. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The R300.00 per house would have been 
your cost not your profit or would that have been your 
profit? 
MR SODI:  Ja so I am saying Chair between R300.00 and 
R350.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR SODI:  That was the cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the cost ja. 
MR SODI:  So in other words – that was the cost.  In other 
words that is the money that we spent to do the actual job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 17 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  So it would have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anything outside of that amount would 
have been… 
MR SODI:  Ja.  So it would have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anything outside of that 300 000 – 
R300.00 or R350.00 per house would have been profit. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes now if you were doing 300 units – 
300 houses okay remember that the – the amount that you 
are going to be paid for the whole project as I understand 
10 
is not going to be changed – is not going to change it is 
fixed. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you were doing – if the houses in 
Gauteng were 300 that you had to do and you are – the 
cost for that... 
MR SODI:  You mean 300 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  300 000 yes. 
MR SODI:  It was less it was about 250 000 but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but let us say – let us say for 
20 
argument sake because we start – I talked about 300 000 
earlier. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us say if the – if they were 300 000 – 
the houses in Gauteng and let us say for argument sake 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 18 of 249 
 
your cost was R300.00 per house okay.  The proposition I 
was putting to you earlier on with which you seemed to 
disagree and maybe we were not on the same page. 
MR SODI:  Maybe it was – maybe I misunderstood you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that – if there were 300 houses and 
you were spending – you were spending R300.00 per house 
your profit would be less than if you had 250 houses.  In 
other words, the lesser the number of houses the more 
profit you make.  The higher the number of houses the less 
10 
profit you make. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the total amount is fixed you are 
not going to change it. 
MR SODI:  Yes.  The total amount is fixed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is fixed but if you – if you are 
going to do more houses on the same price. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously you will make less profit, is it 
not? 
20 
MR SODI:  Ja.  So – maybe let me explain it this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lesser the number of houses 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You make because the total amount that 
is coming to your company from the department is the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 19 of 249 
 
same. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lesser the number of houses you 
make. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The more profit you are going to do.  The 
more houses that they say you must do the less your profit 
is going to be.  Is it not like… 
MR SODI:  I am not sure if that is entirely correct Chair 
and it could be that maybe that maybe you talking about … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me put it this way 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they said they are going to give you – 
what was the total amount in Gauteng that they were going 
to give you, the total amount? 
MR SODI:  It was R650.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us say for 300 houses for 250 
houses. 
MR SODI:  250 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and what was the total amount for 250 
20 
houses that they were going to give you more or less? 
MR SODI:  Well maybe we can get someone to do… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh alright. 
MR SODI:  Calculator and multiply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anyway, let us assume they were going 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 20 of 249 
 
to give you R200 million. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For you to do 100 houses at – and your 
cost 
is 
R300.00 
per 
house 
the 
rest 
is 
your 
profit.  
Obviously, you will make more profit than if they say no 
you must actually 100 000 houses for the same price. 
MR SODI:  Chair the – so the total amount of – or the total 
value of the project is dependent on the total number of 
houses that you audit.  So using the same figures that you 
mentioning.  If in this case it was 250 000 houses. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  Our total revenue would be the 250 000 houses 
multiplied by the R650.00.  So it is linked to the quantities 
that had to be audited or assessed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  If for instance the scope was let us say 100 000 
houses then it should have been 100 000 houses multiplied 
by R650.00.  So obviously the less number of houses that 
you do means that your – your total revenue would be less.  
Do you understand what I am saying?  So if we do… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is if – that is if the total amount 
changes?  If the total amount changes? 
MR SODI:  Ja so – so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the point you are making is… 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 21 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The point you are making is the total 
amount is based on a certain number of houses. 
MR SODI:  No I am saying that we were given a rate of 
R650.00 and we were then given quantities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  That we had to audit and assess. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  So in this case it was – it was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  What is 
happening? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is just that I think the witness 
would be assisted if he could have a pen and paper to 
make his own calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I need to know otherwise… 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja so the point I was alluding to is that – so 
your rate is determined in this case predetermined and 
they say: “here is the rate” and then we get given a scope 
– a scope of work to do.  So in our case it was 250 000 
20 
units and which we had to audit.  Alright?  So the total 
revenue 
as 
I 
have 
said 
was 
therefore 
the 
R650.00 
multiplied by the 250 000.  But as it turned out Chair, we 
audited about 200 000 more than the scope that was given 
to us.  However, our revenue was fixed on the scope that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 22 of 249 
 
was given to us.  So the department did not say, Blackhead 
you were given 250 000 you came back, you have done the 
work, you have assessed, we see your report but the report 
says you have done 400 000.  So therefore we are paying 
you for 400 000.  It was not the case.  So they said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I understand. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but I would imagine that you would 
10 
agree that if you were assigned to do 300 000 – 250 
houses. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a certain fixed rate and you ended up 
doing 400 houses and for each house you were paying 
R300.00 – your cost was R300.00 now instead of your cost 
being limited to 250 units your cost is now for 400 units 
and you will not be paid for the extra. 
MR SODI:  Absolutely you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that extra. 
20 
MR SODI:  Yes.  Reduces your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  From 251 reduces your profit. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  That is correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the point ja. 
MR SODI:  Oh is that the point?  Okay alright. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 23 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  You are absolutely correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we were going to deal with it 
later but perhaps we should complete this line of enquiry 
now.  Firstly, let us just recap Mr Sodi what you told the 
investigators.  As I understand it on FS6, 268 you said that 
Gauteng paid you in the region of R200 million.  That is 
what you said. 
MR SODI:  Give or take Chair ja. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And then you said on page 
269 of FS6 that of that amount 50 to 60% of that would 
have been profit and the calculations can then be done at 
least R100 million would have been profit. 
MR SODI:  Give or take. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Give or take.  If one does another 
calculation on what you say here you say R300 per house 
would have been profit.  If one multiplies 300 by 250 000 
one gets R75 million.  You can trust the calculator on that. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  We would trust the calculator 
20 
on that ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  But there is another 
document that the investigators produced on enquiry from 
the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and that 
appears in FS8 at page 111.  And if it will assist you when 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 24 of 249 
 
we go through this table you want to write down the 
amounts on that piece of paper your attorney has kindly 
provided for you.  This is a document from the Department 
of Human Settlements that the investigators speak to in 
their overall report.   
MR SODI:  Ja I can see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It lists four payments related to – 
do you have it Chair?  It deals with four payments Gauteng 
Asbestos 
Johannesburg 
North, 
Gauteng 
Asbestos 
Ekurhuleni, 
Gauteng 
Asbestos 
Johannesburg 
North, 
10 
Gauteng 
Asbestos 
Ekurhuleni 
and 
lists 
the 
amount 
authorised and paid in relation to four claims arising out of 
those projects. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Payments to Blackhead Consulting 
Pty Limited – CC there.  You see that? 
MR SODI:  I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The total of those four amounts is 
R229 710 000.00 but that includes VAT, VAT.  If one takes 
VAT away the total amount is R201 500 000.00.  You see 
20 
that? 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if you divide that amount by 
R650.00 the amount per house one gets 310 000 units.  
Those are the calculations that appear from this document.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 25 of 249 
 
Do you recall how that could have come about?  Do you 
want me to go through those figures again? 
MR SODI:  I am not sure how that – I mean these figures I 
would imagine I am seeing this document for the first time 
Chair.  But I would imagine that this refers to the four 
IPW’s that were issued Chair to Blackhead Consulting. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For the Asbestos Project. 
MR SODI:  To go and audit in those four areas that are 
specified here on this sheet I cannot – you know say for 
sure those are the exact amounts.  I have not seen this 
10 
document but it may very well be. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Yes. 
 
These 
are 
Human 
Settlement’s records. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And these record amounts paid to 
Blackhead totally – excluding VAT R201 500 000.00 but in 
any event apart from the R1 500 000.00 your recollection 
and 
this 
information 
more 
or 
less 
coincides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
MR SODI:  My recollection with regard to these four 
different areas is correct in as far as the spread sheet – 
20 
this document is concerned.  I cannot for sure say Chair 
that these amounts are exactly what is reflected on the 
IPW’s.  It could be that it is the same amounts but you 
know I am not sure Chair if perhaps Mr Pretorius might 
have the copies of the actual IPW’s because that will be 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 26 of 249 
 
quite helpful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We have got copies of the invoices 
would you like to see those? 
MR SODI:  That is fine we can have a look at those. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The first invoice is FS8 page 127. 
MR SODI:  Yes I can see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is an invoice... if you will just 
bear with me for a moment Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In the amount of 59 280 which is the 
second invoice on the table on FS8 page 111. 
MR SODI:  I can verify that Chair.  It is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So there, at least, there is a 
coincidence ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...between your invoice and the 
payment. 
MR SODI:  That is correct, ja.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If one goes to 134... sorry, I am 
20 
giving you the wrong number.  Page... yes, it is 134 of FS8.  
There is the amount for that total claim by Blackhead 
Consulting to the Department of Housing, as was the last 
invoice, in the amount of R 32 604 000,00. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  I can confirm that Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 27 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The third one is at page 144.  
R 88 9020 000,00.  Invoice to the Department of Housing, 
Gauteng Provincial Government by Blackhead Consulting.  
That coincides with the last amount on the table.  
MR SODI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then on page 151 the total claim 
R 48 906 000,00 invoice by Blackhead Consulting to the 
Department of Housing, Gauteng Provincial Government. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So we know then that the table 
10 
shown at Free State 8 or FS8 page 111 coincides with your 
own records. 
MR SODI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So let us go back to FS8 page 111, if 
we may?  The total of the amounts in that table is 
R 229 710 000,00 but that includes VAT. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Excluding the VAT ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  That is your 
own... that is a number that does not... a figure that does not 
20 
appear on the page.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is two hundred and twenty-nine...? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 28 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  R 229 710 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that includes VAT.  So the 
calculation I am putting and on which I am relying at my peril 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ... is R 201 500 000,00 excluding 
VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two hundred and one million...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Five hundred thousand excluding 
10 
VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thousand...  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the profit you calculate based on 
the 50%? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair.  Well, whatever... at the 
rate was at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  H’m? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In any event.  Simply... Mr Sodi, your 
recollection in the interview is, more or less, give or take 
20 
R 1 000 500,00 
the 
same 
as 
the 
amount 
that 
this 
spreadsheet shows as having been paid to for the Asbestos 
Project in Gauteng? 
MR SODI:  Sorry, Chair.  I am o am not sure.  Where does 
the R 1 000 500,00 come from? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 29 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Actually before that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius, there must be something I 
did not get right here. At page 111, the total including VAT, 
on your calculation, was R 229 710 000,00. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  R 710 000,00, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then there was another figure 
which I understood to be R 201 500 000,00.  What did you 
say that one is? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Excluding VAT. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excluding.  Ja, excluding VAT. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you take the VAT away, you get 
R 201 500 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, from that total.  Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you take... so the total is 
R 229 710 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
But 
all 
those 
figures, 
R 229 710 000,00, all those figures include VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So if you take VAT away, the payment 
is R 201 500 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the total paid to Blackhead Consulting 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 30 of 249 
 
for 
the 
Gauteng 
Project, 
excluding 
VAT, 
is 
R 201 500 000,00? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Now I understand.  I think you 
had the question that Mr Sodi wanted to elaborate on. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, let us leave aside the 
comparison between what you said to the investigators and 
what appears here. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is someone... anybody can do on 
10 
reading both documents but for the present, it appears that 
the figures that appear on Free State 8 or FS8 page 111, 
coincide with your own invoices.  We have established that. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  Ja, we have established that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the profit, if it was 50% of that amount, 
would have been in the region of R 100 million? 
MR SODI:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Give or take, it would have been around there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  So in other words, the cost of doing this job 
was about 50% of what was paid to us here.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, you did say 50/60.  So. 
MR SODI:  Ja, ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 31 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And this was over how long a period? 
MR SODI:  H’m.  Geez, Chair.  I am speaking under 
correction.  This could have been over... anywhere between 
three and five months or six months on.  Three and about six 
months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between three months to six months? 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Ja, somewhere around that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  I cannot recall exactly how many ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
MR SODI:  But I do know that we were able to complete the 
project on record time because we had, you know, appointed 
a lot of people, field-workers, that were deployed in the 
various areas that we had appointed.  So we were able to 
finish and complete the project on record time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way.  How much time had you been 
given to complete the project? 
MR SODI:  Oe ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct] If you cannot find it, I am sure 
we can look later. 
20 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Ja, I am not sure if it is specified on the 
actual IPW. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  No, it is not specified here.  It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you finished it much earlier than 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 32 of 249 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  No, much earlier.  Much earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Much earlier.  Ja, but it was not more than 
12-months that you were given, as you remember? 
MR SODI:  No, no.  Definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was less than 12-months? 
MR SODI:  No, way, way less. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you finished it within... about six-
months. 
MR SODI:  It could have been even less than that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even less than six-months? 
MR SODI:  Ja, ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the number of workers that you 
had to employ to do this, is that something that you are able 
to remember?  In what region you might be ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  No, Chair.  No.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be... 
MR SODI:  Ja, but I would not remember the exact number of 
people that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Over one hundred maybe? 
20 
MR SODI:  Oh, definitely.  It was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Definitely more than a hundred? 
MR SODI:  Ja, definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 33 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Their income would have been 
derived from the costs of the project? 
MR SODI:  Correct so. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just one calculation that I would like 
to put to you.  The amount of R 201 500 000,00, the amount 
excluding VAT, if one divides that by R 650,00 per unit, one 
gets an amount of 310 000 houses.  How do you explain that 
then? 
MR SODI:  [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you explain that? 
MR SODI:  Chair, I am not sure why you would... work it out 
that way because the R 650,00 is inclusive of VAT and the 
R 201 00 000,00 is excluding VAT.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Well, we will redo that 
calculation. 
MR SODI:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But let us just go to a question that 
the Chair asked.  If one goes to FS8 at page 100, this is the 
memorandum we referred to earlier in terms of which the 
20 
instructions to perform work would have been issued for the 
eight service providers to be appointed for the project.  And 
there in paragraph 7 a time-frame of eight weeks was set. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall that time-frame? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 34 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  I seem to recall that now here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was that the timeframe within the 
relevant timeframe completed? 
MR SODI:  In the relevant timeframe that was... ja, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  A few months? 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let us go back to the issue of the 
profit and that Blackhead Consulting made.  On the basis of 
its profit having been 50% of the total value of the project.  
Blackhead Consulting made about R 100 million funds? 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  In the circumstances where it did 
about 400 houses? 
MR SODI:  Correct Chair.  More or less. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, more or less.  Instead of 250.  Actually, 
almost doubled. 
MR SODI:  Almost double to be the scope that was given to 
us.  Correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, almost double to the number of houses 
that you were supposed to do? 
20 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it had done 250, its houses, its profit 
would have been much more. 
MR SODI:  A little bit more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 35 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Ja, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now does that not suggest that the price 
for the houses... for the 250 units was quite high? 
MR SODI:  [laughs]  Chair, you would recall the last time I 
was here, I mentioned that when we were appointed on this 
exercise, we were given a rate.   
 
None of us knew what we were going to come across 
because this had never been done before.  No one had this 
sort of experience to refer to the past to say that based on 
the past, you know, this is more or less how much we, you 
10 
know, we are going to make. 
 
But in any event.  We did not negotiate for the rate with 
the department.  It was not a choice that was given to us.  
This was, as I said, we used the word or, you know, a 
percentage(?) take it or leave it.   
 
It was the department who said:  “Guys, we have done 
our own exercise.  We now want to appoint service providers 
who can go and do this audit or assessment and we are 
going to pay each one of you this amount. 
 
Now we take these appointments and we start working.  
20 
And it is only afterwards.... when you are done with the 
project then, you know, basically you get your expenses and, 
you know, how much you would have spent and so forth.  
Then you are able to determine how much you have made. 
 
So we would not have known upfront whether the rate 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 36 of 249 
 
was high or low.  We would not have known that.  And it 
would obviously again lead onto what happened in the Free 
State, was that this is a precedent now.   
 
Anyway, this is a precedent that has been set that, more 
or less, you know, R 650,00 is the rate that we pay, you 
know, for this kind of work. 
 
The Commission’s own witness who came here, also 
alluded to that fact, you know, because he was... that 
question was posed to him to say:  “More or less, how much 
would it cost do this kind of work?”  And if my memory 
10 
serves me well Chair, he mentioned that it should be around 
in the region of six hundred. 
 
This is a specialist who has been in the industry for 
many, many years.  Much more experienced than any one of 
us.  So one would, therefore, arrive at a conclusion that to 
do this kind of work based on, you know, what the experts 
are saying, would be around that sort of region. 
 
Of course, you know, it does suggest that, based on our 
experience as well, that it is profitable project, you know.  
There is nothing wrong with that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very profitable. 
MR SODI:  It is very profitable Chair.  You know, it happens.  
You get projects that are less profitable in our industry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR SODI:  Where you take a project, some you even make a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 37 of 249 
 
lot.  And you do get projects where ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the point you are making... there 
are only two points you are making about it.  But there is 
one, you did not decide on the rate per house. 
MR SODI:  That is exactly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Gauteng(?) made that decision and said 
you take it or leave it.  Two, you are saying that you did not 
know how many houses you would end up doing.  It could be 
250.  It could be more.  You took your chances and it worked 
the way it worked. 
10 
MR SODI:  You are absolutely correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I understood from your answer Mr 
Sodi that when you went into the project, you did not know 
how much profit you would make because it was a new 
project and it would be a learning experience for your 
company. 
MR SODI:  That is correct, Chair.  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So insofar as one might say that a 
R 1 000 000,00 profit over two months is excessive in the 
circumstances, that would have been based on the fact that 
you made a mistake in over-charging, if it was an over-
charge but you say, in any event, I understand it, that you 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 38 of 249 
 
did not over-charge.  This was their profit.   
MR SODI:  I did not over-charge because, as I have 
indicated, I did not, you know, submit a price to the 
department and say, “Pay me an X amount”.   
 
It was a price that was predetermined that was given to 
all the eight service providers that were appointed.  And as I 
said, it was profitable and we were quite happy with it. 
 
But at the beginning when we were appointed, I had no 
idea at that point in time, how much it was going to cost us 
to execute this project.  We took a chance and said, “Look, 
10 
let us go for it”.  And it turned out that it became a profitable 
project. 
 
And, you know, as a businessperson, I was quite happy 
with the profit margin that we made.  So I cannot consider 
that Chair to have been over-charged.  Think on the basis 
that we did not... we were not given an opportunity to 
negotiate the rate.  It was given to us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, the first issue that one might 
raise and let us place it at the door of the Department of 
Human Settlements for the moment.   
20 
 
Mr Sodi, is that this budget is meant for service delivery 
in respect of people who do not possess enough money to 
live in decent housing. 
 
That is what the budget, more or less, is about and that 
was what this project was about.  Correct? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 39 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Chair, this project, as I have indicated, was about 
getting service providers to go out and do an assessment 
within the province that are roofed with asbestos so that the 
department can then be able to plan accordingly because 
remember, the end goal has always been to eradicate 
Asbestos.   
 
So this budget was about that.  It was about to say, 
“Guys, we know have a challenge”.  And as I have indicated 
previously, the last time I was here, was what triggered this? 
 
It was that huge health storm that happened in late 
10 
2013.  That was the trigger because what was established is 
that a lot of the damaged roofs were asbestos roofs. 
 
And as I have indicated, that caught the department off-
guard because it was like:  “Look, we know there is this 
problem but we just do not know have an idea of how much it 
is going to cost us to deal with it.  And the only way that we 
will be able to get an idea is to actually get this assessment 
done”. 
 
And that is what led now to the appointment of the eight 
contractors to say, “Guys, assist us in determining and giving 
20 
us accurate information as to the number of houses, the pre-
1194 stock, that we have in the province so that we can then 
be able to put a budget for the eradication”. 
 
So the R 650,00 was just for the audit.  That was it was 
meant more, nothing else and nothing beyond that.  I would 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 40 of 249 
 
imagine that there would have been a separate budget which 
I would not have knowledge of but that was probably set 
aside for the actual eradication.   
 
We were not involved in that.  But this particular one we 
are speaking about now Chair, was simple just for the 
auditing assessment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Sodi, the proposition is a 
straightforward one.  In the space of three months in an 
Asbestos Eradication Project and the Department of Human 
Settlements, they paid an amount of over R 200 million, 
10 
allowing 
a 
private 
company 
to 
make 
approximately 
R 100 million.  That is a fact. 
MR SODI:  It is a fact. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Whether that is a good or bad thing, 
we can leave those who are in power to make judgments to 
judge. 
MR SODI:  [laughs]  It is a fact.  You know, it was an 
exercise Chair that had to be done and the department went 
ahead and they did it and they paid for it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, but the point I am making to you 
20 
is that this money comes from the budget that is supposed to 
provide service delivery ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...to poor people. 
MR SODI:  Chair, the budget allocated to... and I certainly do 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 41 of 249 
 
not want to speak on behalf of the departments because I am 
not qualified to do that but the budget that gets allocated to 
the various departments, including the Department of Human 
Settlements, one would safely assume that it is meant for 
services, to provide services. 
 
In this case, it had to provide human settlements, you 
build for, you know, indigenous people and so forth.  So, ja 
the... to answer your question.  The amount or the budget 
utilised would have been used, you know, would have been 
meant to provide for services for people that otherwise 
10 
cannot afford.   
 
And I see this as being part of that.  It may not have 
been utilised, for instance, to build the actual houses, you 
know, but it is a human settlement function, you know, and it 
was used for that, you know, for that function which is human 
settlements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time would your company have 
spent in training the field-workers who would visit the 
different houses? 
MR SODI:  Chair, it was not long.  It could have been a day. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  A day? 
MR SODI:  Ja, it could have been a day.  But it was not long.  
I mean, the training was not complicated training. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  So it would not have taken... 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 42 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know what?  A thought that keeps on 
worrying me and it applies to the Free State but we will talk 
about the Free State soon.   
 
Is if the training that is necessary to be given to the 
field-workers who will visit the different houses in order for 
them to obtain the necessary information, is simple and it is 
straightforward, is...  
 
Well, maybe it takes a day or maybe less than a day, 
whether it would not have been a better idea to say each 
household 
must 
make 
available 
somebody 
from 
the 
10 
household 
who 
would 
attend 
that 
training, 
get 
that 
information from their own house and of which they would 
not need to charge. 
 
The department would not have to ever pay that person 
because that family wants the house to be improved for 
themselves.   
 
So in other words, your company could be obtained but 
to the extent that it is necessary... actually you say, “Look, 
each household...”   
 
Well, I do not know whether you need a matric for every 
20 
person who would attend the training but even if you needed 
matric, you know, I am sure there would have been many 
households who would have somebody who could do that to 
say if you want... we want to check if your house has got an 
asbestos roof because we need to improve your house and 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 43 of 249 
 
your living conditions. 
 
The houses that have got asbestos roofs should be... the 
roof should be removed in due course and another roofing be 
put in place.  It is for your benefit. 
 
Make one person from the household or family available 
in order to assist with this.  Then you do not have to... the 
department does not have to pay.  Safe a lot on what has to 
be paid. 
MR SODI:  Chair, that could be a way of looking at it but how 
we executed this, it is not very far or different to what you 
10 
are proposing. 
 
Because what happened was, in every locality or ward 
that we went to, we first had to engage the ward councils 
and we then said to the ward councils:  “Listen, there is this 
project that ought to be undertaken”. 
 
We have the criteria of the people that we required 
because remember Chair, you know, it is not... it was not just 
about looking at the house and, you know, and making an 
opinion. 
 
There was a set of questions that they compiled and 
20 
some budgets that were utilised. So the questions would 
have been incorporated into the budget. 
 
So 
obviously, 
you 
know, 
you 
would 
have 
needed 
someone with a basic literacy to understand exactly what 
needs to happen because we did not want to produce a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 44 of 249 
 
report or inferior report to the client. 
 
We wanted to make sure that whatever information that 
we provide to the client is information that is credible.  Now 
we were specific that we want to use local people in those 
areas where we were doing the assessments. 
 
And we said to the ward councils:  “You go to.  This is 
the set of criteria.  You go and identify these people, okay.  
And you come back to us.  We will give you the exact 
number of people that we need”. 
 
So if... in one area, for instance, we wanted to employ 
10 
200 people, we would say, “Yes, we want 200 people.  So go 
and find these people.  Here is the criteria and come back 
and give us a list of those people.” 
 
You know.  And that is what happened.  The ward 
councillors would call meetings, community meetings and 
they would deal with that and said,  
 
“Look, there is going to be a project, you know, in our 
locality.  We... it is also job creation, okay.  So there is going 
to be a job creation component and we need so many 
people”.   
20 
 
Maybe 50% women, maybe 50% youth but there was a 
criteria.  And that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the long and short is simple, you are 
saying that the way you did it is not very dissimilar to what I 
am saying. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 45 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it that you are saying you think 
it could have been done that way but it was done this way.  
Of course, what I am saying is, the department could have 
spent less on the project if it was on the basis that I have 
indicated.  Would you accept that? 
MR SODI:  I accept that.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we are about close to tea-time.  I do 
not know how much ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps we should take the short 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let us take the tea-
adjournment. We will resume at half-past eleven. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue and just for the sake of 
completeness, Mr Sodi, on the questions that I asked 
before the adjournment.  Was it as requirement for the 
trainees of fieldworkers to have matric or was that not a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 46 of 249 
 
requirement? 
MR SODI:   Chair, if my memory serves me well, that was a 
requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was a requirement. 
MR SODI:   I think so, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, let us 
go back to FS8111, that table we discussed earlier.  You 
told us in answer to a calculation put to you that the unit 
price of R650 per house included VAT, is that correct? 
10 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair, according to [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if one applies the calculation to 
the amount of 229 710 000 which also included VAT one 
would be dealing like with like, as I understand it. 
MR SODI:   Correct, so the 229, Chair… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Includes VAT. 
MR SODI:   Includes VAT. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if you divide 229 710 000 by 
650  - you can check it if you like, if you have got a cell 
20 
phone there.  One would get 353 400 houses.  In other 
words, if you charged R650 including VAT for each unit and 
you came to a total charge 229 710 000 you would have 
charged for 353 400 houses, not 250 000.  Do you want to 
check that calculation? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 47 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Ja.  Chair, I think maybe before we even do 
that, if I may make a suggestion, with your permission, is 
to look at the four IPWs that we referred to because those 
IPWs would have the quantities there as to how many, you 
know, units must be assessed.  So we can check that 
because then we know that we are talking about accurate 
information, you know? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, the IPW …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was 250 not an accurate number for 
houses? 
10 
MR SODI:   What I said, more or less. 
CHAIRPERSON:   More or less. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SODI:   Sorry, let me see if… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, if I may just make one 
comment by way of question.  Does the IPW not tell you 
what you should do, not deal with what work you have done 
and for which you charge? 
MR SODI:   No, no, the IPW deals with what needs to 
20 
happen. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, not what happened. 
MR SODI:   No, no, no, it deals with what should happen. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 48 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you wanted to establish the exact 
number of [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] that you 
wanted, ja. 
MR SODI:   Ja, so that we do not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know where we find the 
…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   So I am looking at one here.  So this is the 
invoice.  So I am just looking for where …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  I am going to have to 
say this noise must go now.  If I hear that noise again, I 
10 
will kick you out.  Yes, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we were just allowing Mr Sodi 
to find the IPWs relevant to those charges. 
MR SODI:   Ja, we looked at them, Mr Pretorius, I cannot 
remember which page. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We looked at the invoices. 
MR SODI:   Oh, we looked at the invoices.  Oh, okay.  Do 
you not …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The invoices – I can give you – do 
you want the references? 
20 
MR SODI:   Do you not have copies of the IPWs in the file 
because I think that would assist us a great deal so at 
least we know that we are talking about exact numbers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, we could do that exercise 
over the long adjournment and [inaudible – speaking 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 49 of 249 
 
simultaneously] 
MR SODI:   Ja, so that would, you know, give us accurate 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SODI:   So I am not sure if there any in these files 
because that would be quite helpful, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am told that initial glance that 
they are not there but we will check that. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And come back to you. 
10 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But let us just establish the 
sequence.  The IPW tells you what work you should do. 
MR SODI:   Ja, so the IPW tells you exactly what needs to 
happen.  It details, Chair, the amount that would be 
payable.  It also details how that payment would be made. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but because …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Because it would also indicate, if my memory 
serves me well, it would also indicate the quantities that 
had to be …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That had to be done.  
MR SODI:   That had to be …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand your evidence, Mr 
Sodi, you did more than you had to do. 
MR SODI:   We definitely did more than what the IPW 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 50 of 249 
 
stipulated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the IPW would not be an 
accurate guide as to what work you actually did.  The most 
accurate guide would be the charge levied per house. 
MR SODI:   No, no, that is not correct.  Irrespective of the 
number of houses over and above that we did we would 
still be paid according to the IPW, Chair.  So again, going 
back to, you know, what I had stated earlier, we audited 
more than we were supposed to audit.   
So if you look at – take, for instance, project north 
10 
on that spreadsheet on page 111, okay, it gives you the 
project description, the amount and so forth.  That amount 
that is specified there, will not change because we would 
have done more.  Which will still be the same amount and, 
like I said, I can safely, you know, say that we did way 
more than we were supposed to do.  But what we get paid, 
it is still in accordance with the IPW.  It is not based on 
what we found on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the principle that Mr Pretorius 
maybe seeking your comment on is that whatever the 
20 
number of houses were that the IPW talk about, there 
should be – you should be able – rather, the total amount 
paid to Blackhead should be made up of 650 multiplied by 
the number of houses that you were asked to do. 
MR SODI:   Correct, Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 51 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was saying if one looks at 
R229 710 000 and you go back to saying the rate is R650 
per unit, you do not come out with 250 000 units but you 
did say that that was not an exact …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   It is not, ja.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you accept that principle. 
MR SODI:   I accept the principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   And that is why, Chair, I was saying that if we 
are able …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, to get the correct …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   To get the actual IPWs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:   Then we know we are talking about the exact 
things(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Well, 
the 
straightforward 
proposition that is being put, Mr Sodi, is that the total 
amount paid divided by the unit price yields a number of 
353 400 houses which is not more or less 250, it is far in 
20 
excess of 250 000. 
MR SODI:   Again, Chair, we are talking here about a 
project that happened six years ago and I am giving 
estimate on each – it could be close to what was the case 
or it could be a bit far apart.  Hence, I am saying that what 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 52 of 249 
 
would be useful for us so that we do not go to and fro, is to 
be able to have those IPWs then it is very specific because 
it will tell us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   That this is – or these are the quantities that 
had to be audited. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let me put a last proposition to 
you then, Mr Sodi, in a different way. 
10 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you had been told in the IPWs to 
audit 250 000 houses at R650 per house, the total you 
could have charged on that basis would have been 
approximately 170 million, if I recall correctly.  650 times 
250 000. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   1 point… 
MR SODI:   That is correct about 162 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he wants to show you the correct 
20 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   160 approximately. 
MR SODI:   160, ja, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   162 500 000. 
MR SODI:   That is right, ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 53 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  So we have all those figures 
down on the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the position be that if the figure 
of 250 units, houses, is found to be correct, if it is what is 
in the IPW, would the position be that in all probability the 
department miscalculated to come with a higher total 
amount or how would one explain the discrepancy? 
MR SODI:   Chair, I do not think there was any 
miscalculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you think when we get – got 
10 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR SODI:   Ja, so it will …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will correlate. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
SODI: 
 
 
But 
there 
would 
not 
have 
been 
any 
miscalculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In addition, to avoid confusion, Mr 
Sodi, we had perhaps been using terminology of profit 
20 
margins quite loosely. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you invest a R100 million and 
you make another R100 million on top of that, that is a 100 
percent, correct?  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 54 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Correct so. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go to FS6 please at 
page 280. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 282? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Two eight zero, Chair.  FS6, 280.  
Now we know that in Gauteng Blackhead was not the only 
service provider.  Now you say there were five or six 
others, there may have been seven others. 
MR SODI:   It was a total of eight service providers, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And at the bottom of the page 
10 
in relation to their profits in the Gauteng asbestos project 
you say the following: 
“Of course, I mean, I can tell you right now, even 
the other five companies or six companies that were 
appointed, they made exactly that.  They made 
more than that, so it was not just Blackhead that 
made that kind of profit, all of us.” 
MR SODI:   I cannot, Chair, you know, state how much the 
other companies made as a profit margin.  That statement 
obviously is incorrect, if that is what I said.  I would not 
20 
have known, I can only speak for Blackhead Consulting but 
I cannot speak for the other service providers.  So I would 
not have known at all how much they would have made. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you explain why you would 
have said that in the interview? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 55 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   As I have said, I do not recall, I could have 
made it, that statement, but I do not recall making that 
statement and certainly I have got nothing to make it up, I 
have got now way that I can make up that statement 
because I would not have known.  So it is an incorrect 
statement if I did make that statement for myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand it, that is a transcript of 
an 
interview 
you 
had 
with 
the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission, is that right, or - you have seen this 
document before have you not, in your bundle in the 
10 
documents and the files that you have received.  This 
transcript, have you not seen it before? 
MR SODI:   Ja, I do not remember seeing… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR SODI:   Ja, I do not – I did not receive a bundle 
upfront, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  Oh.  Okay, well if you have not 
seen that document just say so, so that your answer can 
be understood in that context if that is actually the case or 
if you are not sure that you have seen it or not seen it, just 
20 
say so. 
MR SODI:   Ja and like I am saying, Chair, you know, I do 
not remember saying it, I am not saying I never said it but I 
am saying that now sitting here and, you know, dealing 
with this aspect, I do not know on what basis I would have 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 56 of 249 
 
said something like that when I never had access to, you 
know, the other eight contractors, I never knew how, you 
know, how much profit they made or what was their cost so 
– it could have been, Chair, that maybe it was in the heat 
of the moment I said it but I certainly do not have anything 
to back up this statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I am sure, if necessary, the 
relevant part of the recording, if it exists, can be played. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   My instructions are, Chair, from the 
10 
investigators, that the transcript was provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was provided. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and do you know whether there is 
a recording that would be available if necessary?” 
MR SODI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And maybe the – one of the 
investigators might be able to actually give instructions 
that definitely, if we go to the recording, there will be this 
part.  Do we know whether somebody who has listened and 
20 
so it …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, there would be direct 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There would be direct evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As to the accuracy of the transcript 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 57 of 249 
 
but there is a transcribers’ certificate that appears at page 
357. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of Free State 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think, Mr Sodi, you may have to 
maybe not now, though it might be necessary to listen if 
you want to listen in due course to the recording. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at some stage you would have to 
make up your mind whether you say yes, I did make a 
10 
statement or no, I did not make it.  As I say, you might be 
in a position to say so while you are seated there. 
MR SODI:   No, no, that is correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe in due course that can be 
arranged, if necessary. 
MR SODI:   No, correct, correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the only purpose of making 
such a statement and according to you, if you made it, 
would be to somehow justify the profit you made by saying 
that others did it as well. 
20 
MR SODI:   Chair, even that, I mean, I would not be 
making a statement like that because I would not know 
what the other contractors, what their costs would be.  You 
know, so it would be difficult for me to make a statement 
like that but, like I said, I am sitting here, I am not saying 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 58 of 249 
 
that I did not make it, I am not saying I made it, I am 
saying that it could have been at the time but, you know, I 
may have made it, I do not remember, I cannot recall that. 
 
But certainly, what I can say for a fact is I have no 
access to information relating to what the other contractors 
would have made.  Those were seven other independent 
service providers, they would have done it in their own 
way, they would not have shared that information with me 
at all.  The same way that I did not share my information 
with anyone in terms of what the cost was.  So, you know… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no  - the distribution of work 
was not on an equal basis among the seven – some did 
more houses than – were expected to do more houses than 
others. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, that is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If we could move to another topic 
please, Mr Sodi.  If you would look at FS8 at page 110, this 
is a letter addressed to yourself, Blackhead Consulting 
20 
(Pty) Ltd dated the 7 April 2014 and addressed to you by 
Mr T W Zulu, Director General.  Do you recall receiving 
this letter? 
MR SODI:   I do recall, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you knew that Mr Zulu was the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 59 of 249 
 
Director General, not of the provincial but of the national 
department?  
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And, as I understand this letter it is 
an appointment to the National Department of Human 
Settlements, a panel appointment. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And then if one goes to 
FS8 169.   
CHAIRPERSON:   169? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   169, Chair.  I think we have dealt 
with this letter before but for the purposes of current series 
of questions that we could just look at it again, it is a letter 
dated 19 June 2014 addressed to you by Mr Mokhesi, 
addressed to the CEO Blackhead Consulting and it reads: 
“The 
above 
has 
reference 
to 
your 
proposal 
submitted to this department and your appointment 
by the National Department of Human Settlements.” 
So the proposal was the proposal by the joint venture to 
the Free State department.  We know that. 
20 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the appointment by the 
National Department of Human Settlements would have 
been the appointment we have just referred to. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 60 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The letter continues to read: 
“Note has been taken of the above and we wish to 
request 
your 
approval 
as 
follows, 
that 
the 
department wishes to extend your current contract 
secured 
by 
National 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
in 
line 
with 
Treasury 
Regulation 
16/06/2005.” 
So what Mr Mokhesi is saying here is that the department 
in the Free State wishes to extend to the Free State the 
National panel appointment. 
10 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we have heard from Mr Zulu 
that you cannot extend a panel appointment because there 
are no terms and conditions in that appointment, am I 
correct?  Or let us leave the law, out of your province. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have debated it even with 
those that ought to know. 
MR SODI:   Ja, absolutely.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I thought there was unanimity 
20 
on was that you cannot extend a panel appointment. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot extend - if one department or 
if the national department has appointed a panel of service 
providers, you cannot as a provincial department seek to 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 61 of 249 
 
ride on the back of that, you must do your own or did I 
understand that …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Chair, this is my understanding and I have 
seen it in practice so I can speak with confidence that it 
does happen.  You get instances, for instance, where one 
sphere of government, could be a provincial government, 
would say we do not have our own panel, we want to 
appointment service providers, we do not want to go 
through the lengthy process of having to advertise and so 
forth and so forth.   
10 
There is work that ought to happen immediately but 
we do not have a panel.  They would then right, for 
instance, to another sphere of government or another 
department that has a panel and they will say guys, we 
would like to participate in your panel, could you therefore 
provide us with a list of companies that are on the panel.   
That department would then say okay, we are 
happy, if they are happy.  They say no, we are happy that 
you can participate in our panel, here is a list, okay, and 
they will forward the list to that requesting department.  
20 
The list would be inclusive of everyone who is on that 
panel and that would then be forwarded to the requesting 
department to say there it is.   
Of course, this happens formally, you know, that 
has to be returned and signed.  That happens all the time.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 62 of 249 
 
So to answer your question …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would say factually or practically 
this is what does happen, that you know. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But whether it is proper, whether it is in 
accordance with regulations, that is something you would 
not know. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, of course do know that the 
10 
panel was not – or a panel arrangement was not extended 
to the Free State, you were appointed. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And as the Chair says, whether 
this is lawful or not is not a department that you want us to 
debate with. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, I would stay out of that debate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The letter goes on to say in 
paragraph 4 that your appointment will be subject to your 
company securing funds to roll out the project in line with 
20 
your proposal and, as I understand, you have dealt with 
that issue. 
MR SODI:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what we do know from this 
letter is that Mr 
Mokhesi was instrumental at least 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 63 of 249 
 
attempting according to a practice that you have now said 
happened frequently, that might or might not be legal to 
facilitate the appointment of Blackhead Consulting in the 
Free State. 
MR SODI:   Sorry Chair, do you mind to repeating Mr 
Pretorius the question again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Maybe I should break it.   
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was Mr Mokhesi that was the 
actor here, he was the Head of Department, Human 
10 
Settlements, Free State. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what he was trying to do was 
to 
use 
a 
legal 
device 
because 
he 
mentions 
it 
here…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In specific terms to facilitate the 
appointment of Blackhead in the Free State? 
MR SODI:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whether what he was doing was 
20 
lawful or proper or not is not a matter that we will debate 
with you at the present.  One goes to this next letter that I 
would like to draw your attention to and I am sorry we 
going to have to change bundles.   
MR SODI:   Okay.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 64 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS1 at page 465.  This is a letter 
from 
Mr 
Mokhesi 
to 
Mr 
Zulu 
dated 
19 
June 
2014 
and…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On my one the date is not legible.  
MR SODI:   Ja, same as my one.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your dates legible Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes it is there is another copy of 
the letter at FS1, 214.9.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay well if you just tell me that the 
dates that you have mentioned is correct that would be 
10 
enough for my purposes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It appears there from a better copy 
that the date is the 19 t h of June 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:   19 June 2014? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And the other letter is it got page the 
one that has got – is legible? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   214, FS1, 214.9.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it appears that what Mr 
20 
Mokhesi is asking Mr Zulu here is to extend the contract 
the national panel contract to the Free State, you can look 
at it.   
MR SODI:   Ja, it appears so Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In affect what it says.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 65 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We agree?  What is significant 
about this letter in paragraph 1 it refers to Blackhead 
Consulting Pty Ltd not the joint venture.  Do you see that? 
MR SODI:   I can see that, ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The joint venture off course was 
not part of any national panel arrangement.  
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry are you still at 465 Mr 
Pretorius? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair your question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you still at page 465? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you still on that page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair, paragraph 1 of that 
letter under the heading refers to Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Ltd not the joint venture that was appointed in the Free 
State.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay no that is fine I think I was – on 
paragraph 1 I was looking at the heading…[intervenes]    
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the heading is like a paragraph 
on its own.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and a better copy it is 
underlined. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 66 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 3 of that letter is the 
letter that talks about the extension of the contract through 
the participation process but we have settled that issue.  
Mr Sodi if you could now go to FS2 page 99.  That is a 
statement of – that is part of the statement of Miss 
Diederick’s we have referred to her earlier an affidavit that 
commences at FS2, 95.  She identifies the document at 
10 
page 99 but let us go there it is at page 111 of FS2.  This 
is a letter also from Mr Mokhesi but now to the Head of 
Department, 
Department 
of 
Housing 
that 
is 
Miss 
Diederick’s, correct?     
MR SODI:   That’s is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But that would have been the 
Department of Housing at Gauteng at that time.  
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it is a letter which appears in 
page, in paragraph 2 of the letter to say the Free State 
20 
Department of Human Settlements hereby request your 
department, that is now the Gauteng department not 
national Gauteng…[intervenes]    
MR SODI:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To extend the services of 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 67 of 249 
 
Blackhead 
Consulting 
Pty 
Ltd 
in 
line 
with 
treasury 
regulations 16A6.6 of March 2005.  So we here talking 
about an extension from province to province not from 
national to province.    
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The next paragraph we see it is in 
therefore this regard that approval is hereby sort that you 
provide written confirmation to extend SAM in line with 
your approved terms and conditions as contained in your 
instruction to perform.  We know by way of example that in 
10 
the Gauteng department project the term and condition 
relating to price per unit was R650,00 per unit.     
MR SODI:   Correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That term and condition was not 
extended to the Free State.  
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we have looked at the other 
terms and conditions that were set out they to do not 
appear to have been extended.  Remember we talked about 
the terms of reference and the detail of those terms and 
20 
conditions.     
MR SODI:   Are you referring to the SLA the ones of the 
SLA? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not the SLA, well there were no 
terms and conditions in the SLA.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 68 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you agree with that? 
MR SODI:   Ja, yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The only terms and conditions 
were contained in an instruction to perform work.  
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that instruction to perform 
work would have contained a unit price of R650,00 per 
unit? 
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So we know that that was not 
extended ultimately to the Free State.  
MR SODI:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But this letter here purports to 
seeks permission or purports to seek approval or an 
extension of the Gauteng contract to the Free State.  
Correct?  
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So now we have so far two 
arrangements in place, one the national panel and two the 
20 
Gauteng contract.   
MR SODI:   Ja, I can explain that briefly…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Please.  
MR SODI:   Chair it was initially according to my 
recollection the Free State Department wrote to the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 69 of 249 
 
National Department requesting that they extend the panel 
to the Free State that is the letter the previous letter Chair 
that we looked at.  Then there was also a subsequent letter 
which is the letter that we are looking at now which also 
came from the Free State but in this case, it was not 
addressed to national.  It was addressed to the Gauteng 
Department of Human Settlements and in the end, what 
happened was the treasury regulation 16A6.6 was utilised 
through the Gauteng Department of Local Government 
Housing not National Treasury.  So that correspondence 
10 
between the province and National Treasury in the end was 
not utilised.  So what was then transferred or extended 
rather was the Gauteng Department of Local Government 
Housing to the Free State.  So that is where they – 
according to my understanding of how that regulation 
functions was the reliance was therefore on Gauteng 
simply because we performed a similar service that needed 
to be performed in the Free State.  And I think that was the 
reason why it was decided in the end that you know let us 
utilise the dual appointment in the Gauteng Department of 
20 
Local Government.               
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay Mr Sodi did you know this 
was happening at the time? 
MR SODI:   I saw correspondence I was aware that there 
was some correspondence happening between the Free 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 70 of 249 
 
State and national and as well as Gauteng.  But I was not 
party to a lot of these correspondence.  I have seen some 
of these letters but I was not – I was certainly not involved 
you know.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But Mr Sodi you have given a 
detailed explanation before this short adjournment of the 
practice that you say was prevalent…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   …in relation to contracts.  
MR SODI:   Ja.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have also now given a detailed 
explanation of the sequence of events in relation to the 
attempt to secure your appointment in the Free State by 
way of some form of transfer or another.   
MR SODI:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you know this at the time?  
MR SODI:   I got to know in the end when you know all this 
had 
happened 
that 
the 
reliance 
was 
placed 
on 
our 
appointment 
in 
Gauteng 
that 
is 
what 
eventually…[intervenes]  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you get to know this the 
time the contract was concluded with you? 
MR SODI:   It was before we started with the execution of 
the project.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   2014? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 71 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Ja, it would have been 2014.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you knew in 2014 that Mr 
Mokhesi was communicating with the national department 
Mr Zulu and you knew that Mr Mokhesi was communicating 
with the Head of Department of Housing Gauteng that is 
Miss Diederick’s…[intervenes]  
MR SODI:   Correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In order to facilitate the finalisation 
of your contract in the Free State.  
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair, I knew.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But just to return to Free State 2, 
111 we know that the approved terms and conditions in fact 
that term and condition that was fixed could be changed 
under no circumstances did not find their way from 
Gauteng to the Free State.  
MR SODI:   Which one is it Mr Pretorius? 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
R650,00 
remember 
it 
was 
immovable.  
MR SODI:   Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Unchangeable term and condition 
20 
of the contract that you would be paid R650,00 per house.  
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was put to you in your own words 
on a take it or leave it basis.  
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 72 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That term did not find its way from 
Gauteng to your contract in the Free State.  
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us go again please to 4 August 
2014 now in the timeline and my apologies back to Free 
State 8.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of bundle FS8? 
MR SODI:   Which page are we looking at? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bear with me a moment please, 
176 if you would FS8, 176.  This appears to be Miss 
10 
Diederick’s reply to Mr Mokhesi because it refers to Mr 
Mokhesi letter of 15 July 2014 which we just dealt with.   
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what we see here in paragraph 
1 is a statement by Miss Diederick’s dated the 4 t h of 
August 2014 in this email or letter.  She says “I hereby 
confirm my decision taken on 21 July 2014 that the 
Gauteng 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
granted 
approval in terms of treasury regulation 16A6.6 for the 
Free State Department of Human Settlements to participate 
20 
in the contract arranged by means of a competitive bidding 
process from the database of the Gauteng Department of 
Human 
Settlements 
for 
professional 
resourced 
teams 
where Blackhead Consulting Pty Ltd was appointed from”.  
That is on the face of it appears to be an approval to 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 73 of 249 
 
extend a panel contract.       
MR SODI:   I am not sure if this is extending the panel 
contract Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well your contract to perform work 
in terms of an instruction to perform work you and the 
seven others in the Free State on the asbestos project that 
was not the result of a competitive bidding process.  As I 
understand it whatever competitive bidding process there 
was, was to get on the panel in the first place.    
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So what she is referring to here is 
a panel not what Mr Mokhesi was referring to which was an 
individual instruction to perform work.  She is talking 
another language.      
MR SODI:   Look Chair I am not the author of the letter so 
it is going to be difficult for me to respond to that question 
to say what she is referring to…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Pretorius seeks your own 
understanding of what is being said here which did concern 
your company.  
20 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja to say what is your understanding of 
what the author is talking about here.   
MR SODI:   Okay so my understanding is that subsequent 
to a letter that was written by the Free State department by 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 74 of 249 
 
Mr Mokhesi specifically to request or rather to get the 
Gauteng Department of Human Settlements to confirm that 
we were indeed appointed there.  So this was the response 
from Gauteng from the acting HOD confirming that indeed 
Blackhead 
Consulting 
was 
a 
service 
provider 
in the 
department and you know obviously that if that particular 
regulation the treasury regulation had to be implemented 
there were certain things that needed to happen.  So it was 
in response to a request from a letter that was resent by 
the HOD in the Free State.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says and I think you have 
confirmed this but let us just deal with it so we can move 
on.  In paragraph 1 is that she has made a decision and 
she made it on 21 July 2014 that is six days after the letter 
of 15 July 2014 to which she refers and the decision is that 
the Free State Department of Human Settlements may 
participate and I am changing the quote for grammatical 
reasons in the contract arranged by means of a competitive 
bidding 
process 
from 
the 
database 
of 
the 
Gauteng 
Department of Human Settlements or professional resource 
20 
teams.  That is the Free State and sorry the Gauteng panel 
contract.      
MR SODI:   Correct, ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that in the Free State you 
were appointed in terms of an individual contract.  SLA 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 75 of 249 
 
which appointed you not a panel.  
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it also refers in case there 
should be any confusion in paragraph 3 this letter to the 
fact that the database will lapse at the end of August 2014 
and we know we have dealt with that.  
MR SODI:   Ja, correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, so far, we have national 
involved in a process to extend a national database to Free 
State which you say fell way.  We have Mokhesi asking for 
10 
a particular contract to be extended, in fact it refers to an 
instruction to perform of work one can read and now we 
have Diedericks purporting to extend a panel arrangement 
to the Free State.  You nod?     
MR SODI:   Ja, I agree.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what is also important Mr Sodi 
is that what Miss Diedericks is doing here is taking a 
decision involving Blackhead Consulting Pty Ltd not a joint 
venture.  Correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure that we have 
the same understanding of what that paragraph 1 means. 
Mr Pretorius is confirming a decision she made on 21 July 
2014 and the decision is that the Department of Human 
Settlements in Gauteng was granting approval in terms of 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 76 of 249 
 
what – that regulation in terms of regulations stated there 
for the Department of Human Settlements in the Free State 
to participate in the contract arranged by means of a 
competitor bidding process.  The contract arranged by 
means of a competitor bidding process which contract 
would that be?  
MR SODI:   This would be Chair the panel contract.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the one that was arranged by 
way of a competitor.  
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To get onto the panel? 
MR SODI:   Absolutely yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she says from the database of 
the 
Gauteng 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
for 
professional resource teams where Blackhead Consulting 
Pty Ltd was appointed from.  So the contract she talks 
about the Free State Human Settlements Department being 
granted approval to participate in the contract.     
MR SODI:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that contract is the contract of 
20 
getting onto the panel in Gauteng as far as Blackhead is 
concerned.   
MR SODI:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MR SODI:   Ja.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 77 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the contract which Blackhead 
obtained after being on the panel namely other assessment 
and auditing of houses.  
MR 
SODI: 
 
Ja 
so 
these 
particular 
paragraph 
here…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, this paragraph.  
MR SODI:   Would refer to that contract…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of getting onto the panel.  
MR SODI:   Getting onto the panel.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And not of actually doing the work.  
10 
MR SODI:   That is my understanding.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay is that your understanding as 
well Mr Pretorius?  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I just wanted to make sure that we 
are on the same page.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it is - well I have put the 
question I am not going to summarise it again it may just 
cause more confusion.  We move to another point, we have 
established that what Miss Diedericks is talking about here 
20 
is Blackhead Consulting Pty Ltd and not a joint venture.    
MR SODI:   Correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   By the 4 t h of August 2014 the date 
of this letter the joint venture proposal had already been 
made to the Gauteng department.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 78 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Free State.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry the Free State department.  
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That was made on the 28 t h of May 
2014 and the proposal appears at FS1, 457 but if you 
agree with that we do not need to go there.  
MR SODI:   I agree with it, yes.  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
If 
you 
look 
at 
FS2 
page 
100…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second Mr Pretorius of course 
10 
paragraph 2 of that letter at page 176 reveals that the 
author of the letter seems to contemplate that Blackhead is 
going to be given work to do by the Free State department 
because she says the approval and she is talking about the 
approval in paragraph 1 is subject to the conditions that 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Ltd must approve in writing that 
it is willing to do the required work for your department and 
that the participation of Blackhead Consulting may not 
negatively 
impact 
on 
their 
performance 
towards 
the 
Gauteng Provincial Government.  That is something else, 
20 
she does contemplate that as a result of this approval that 
she was giving Blackhead would do some work in the Free 
State.    
MR SODI:   Ja, my assumption Chair would be that she 
would make a statement like that because in the letter that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 79 of 249 
 
was addressed to her by her counterpart in the Free State 
it was specific that they dealing with Blackhead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please repeat that last part.    
MR SODI:   I say…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was specific that they.  
MR SODI:   They intending to appoint Blackhead to do 
some work in the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR SODI:   Ja, correct Chair I agree with it, ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, for the present purposes the 
10 
letter at FS2, 111 that you have just referred to from Mr 
Mokhesi to Miss Diedericks or Department of Housing I am 
not 
sure 
precisely 
when 
Ms 
Diedericks 
took 
office 
contemplates the extension of the contract to Blackhead 
Consulting Pty Limited. 
MR SODI:  That is correct and that is precisely the point I 
was saying that you know she would have indicated that 
second paragraph because she was already aware based on 
the letter that she received from the Free State that it had to 
do with Blackhead Consulting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But we know at that stage that the 
proposal for the performance of the work in the Free State 
was a proposal by the Joint Venture and that proposal was 
made earlier on the 28 May 2014. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 80 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if one looks at Diedericks’ 
statement in FS2 at page 100 one sees her response to 
those circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am terribly sorry Mr Pretorius I just want 
to finalise on that – on that letter at page 176.  I am sorry Mr 
Sodi I am disorganising both you and Mr Pretorius. 
MR SODI:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we go back to that letter of Ms 
Diedericks at page 176 I note that she says in the second 
10 
paragraph from the end of the letter that she says – I am 
reading from the middle. 
“Your department may also consider or “ 
 
She says: 
“It should further be noted that the Gauteng 
Department of Human Settlements can – 
currently has in place a data base of service 
providers that provide PRT work.  The data 
base will lapse at the end of August 2014 
and processes are in place to establish a 
20 
new data base.  Your department may also 
consider this should the identified service 
provider not agree or not be in a position to 
do the required work.  If you follow this route 
you 
should 
embark 
on 
the 
procurement 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 81 of 249 
 
process from the companies provided and 
enter into an own service level agreement 
with the successful bidder.” 
 
What is your understanding of this part?  Is it that if 
the Free State Department – is it that the Free State 
Department would be free to approach one of the service 
providers in the – on the panel? 
MR SODI:  That is correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if that service provider was happy to 
do the work then they would go ahead and make whatever 
10 
arrangements.  But if the identified service provider was not 
prepared to agree to do the work then there would have to 
be a new procurement process to be followed.  Is that your 
understanding? 
MR SODI:  Chair that – that is my understanding hence there 
was a letter that was also written to us requesting us to 
confirm that we accept the appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  From the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR SODI:  So that – this paragraph talks to that aspect as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  But after we had said that look, we have got too 
much work. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 82 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  Or we have got a lot on our plate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  We do not think we will be able to take additional 
work in the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  Then they probably would have went to the panel 
and certify let us maybe identify someone else on the panel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  And you know – that is basically what is captured 
10 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  If we could go back 
to FS8 please at page 177.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  177 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC:  Now 
we know from previous 
correspondence that we have just dealt with Mr Sodi that 
when Mr Mokhesi wrote to Ms Diedericks on the 15 July, he 
20 
was referring to the extension of a contract – whatever 
contract that might have been to Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Limited. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it appears on FS8, 177 a letter 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 83 of 249 
 
addressed by yourself to Ms Diedericks. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you knew her as the acting Head 
rather than the appointed Head at that stage, is that correct? 
MR SODI:  Ja she – she was the acting HOD Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It says: 
“Dear 
Ms 
Diedericks 
appointment 
of 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited for the 
asbestos eradication program in the Free 
State Province.” 
10 
 
Now this letter is dated 7 August 2014 we know that 
the proposal that the Joint Venture would do the work in the 
Free State was dated the 28 May 2014. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say to Ms Diedericks: 
“We acknowledge receipt of your fax dated 4 
August 2014 in which you respond to the 
Head of Department Human Settlements in 
the 
Free 
State 
Province 
regarding 
the 
appointment of Blackhead Consulting Pty 
20 
Limited 
for 
the 
asbestos 
eradication 
program.” 
 
Correct? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you are telling her that it is the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 84 of 249 
 
appointment of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited who had 
done work for her in the Free State that was at stake here? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you say: 
“We would like to confirm the following: 
1. That Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited is 
willing 
and 
committed 
to 
perform 
the 
required work for the Department of Human 
Settlements in the Free State.” 
Correct? 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you sign it Mr Edwin Sodi in your 
capacity as Chief Executive Officer of Blackhead Consulting 
Pty Limited? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Why did you not tell her that it was 
the Joint Venture that was going to be appointed? 
MR SODI:  At the time Chair I – my understanding was that if 
one of the parties to the JV has done this sort of work in this 
case we were on the panel from the – on the Gauteng 
20 
Department of Human Settlements.  We had done – we had 
already completed the asbestos audit so my understanding 
was that if on the JV one of the parties had done work then 
you know it is not an issue at all.  Of course, my 
understanding there could have been wrong.  But that is how 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 85 of 249 
 
I understood that Blackhead had done this work, it was on 
the panel from the Department of Human Settlements in 
Gauteng and it was part of a JV.  So my understanding at the 
time was that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  But 
you know it turned out later that you know my understanding 
could have been incorrect but at the time I did not think that 
it was an issue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right but Mr Sodi both Mr Mokhesi 
and yourself in seeking to participate in a Gauteng contract 
tell Ms Diedericks that the party in the Free State that would 
10 
do the work is Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited when both 
Mr Mokhesi and you knew that it was not it was a Joint 
Venture a different entity, correct? 
MR SODI:  Correct Chair this is exactly what I am explaining 
you know that it is – my understanding was that if one of the 
parties to the JV you know had done the work which was the 
case in this case.  My understanding at the time was that it 
is not a – it was not an issue.  You know the fact that there 
was a Diamond Hill that was not mentioned I did not at the 
time I did not see that as a problem you know.  And I can – I 
20 
can also illustrate this point with another example.  That if 
you look for instance at the way government works when it 
comes to partnerships and JV’s I will give you an example.  
If there is a tender that gets issued out usually before 
submission there will be a briefing session which is meant to 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 86 of 249 
 
really give clarity to the potential bidders in terms of what 
ought to happen.  What would happen in most cases that if 
for instance there has to be a partnership the company that 
attends the briefing session and it can partner with any other 
service provider or any other company that did not attend the 
briefing session.  So in this case it could be for instance 
Blackhead goes to the briefing session and we write on the 
attendance register which is usually also a requirement when 
they 
do 
the 
evaluation 
because 
some 
of 
them 
are 
compulsory.  We can choose anyone else for instance if we 
10 
want to partner.  We can choose anyone else or any other 
company that did not attend the briefing session and partner 
with them or form a JV and submit.  That is acceptable, that 
is the standard practice that is what happens in most cases.  
So that I will – even in this case Chair I would have seen it 
in that way because it is allowed that for as small as one 
member of the part of the consortium or the JV or the 
partnership as long as one member had complied in as far as 
you know the compulsory briefing session is concerned that 
is acceptable.  And I looked at it in that context but like I am 
20 
saying some of these things could be legal which I would not 
be able to – to deal with.  But that is the normal practice 
Chair that is what happens in the industry. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us leave aside what the 
Treasury Regulation permits and does not permit and just for 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 87 of 249 
 
the record it – it only permits a contractual arrangement to 
be extended involving the same parties but put that aside for 
the moment.  If it was a matter in which you had the attitude 
on the 7 August that it was perfectly permissible and in order 
for the Joint Venture to do the work why not just say it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words, Mr Sodi I think the point 
that Mr Pretorius or what maybe triggering his question and 
he wants your comment is this.  Mr Mokhesi and yourselves 
– and yourself know that it is a Joint Venture that is going to 
be appointed in the Free State. 
10 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr Mokhesi writes to Ms Diedericks, 
he knows that it is a Joint Venture that is going to be 
appointed. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you write this letter, you know that it 
is Joint Venture that is going to be appointed. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He finds it strange that both you and Mr 
Mokhesi  
20 
MR SODI:  Did not specify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not appear to be upfront with… 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Diedericks to say, we are going to 
appoint a Joint Venture, these are the names, we do not 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 88 of 249 
 
think it matters that you know Diamond Hill was not – did not 
participate in Gauteng because Blackhead did participate.  
So you are open about it because you see nothing wrong 
about it. 
MR SODI:  Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the – on the contrary it appears that 
coincidentally both of you do not see the need to tell Ms 
Diedericks that actually it is a Joint Venture. 
MR SODI:  It is a Joint Venture ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think that is what is triggering his 
10 
inquiry. 
MR SODI:  Okay no I mean I would admit that in hindsight, in 
retrospect we should have specified that you know.  We 
could have done that but like I am saying you know I had a 
completely different understanding but I take the point and I 
am saying that you know given a second chance I would do it 
different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, if it was one of you maybe one 
20 
could leave it at that. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just strange that both of you do not 
mention it. 
MR SODI:  ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 89 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course you cannot speak for him. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can only speak for yourself. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am just saying that is the context. 
MR SODI:  Exactly but also again not wanting to get in a to 
and fro sort of debate and I cannot certainly speak on behalf 
of Mr Mokhesi I can speak for myself because I wrote the 
letter but I would assume the only reason why he would have 
omitted the JV aspect was because it was not the JV that 
10 
was appointed in Gauteng it was Blackhead that was 
appointed there.  Had it been a JV I am sure that he would 
have said listen we intending as the Free State Department 
to appoint this JV.  But as it turned out it was only Blackhead 
and I can only assume that that is only the reason why you 
know he would have just been you know said listen we 
referring to Blackhead here and nothing else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope I understood your – what triggered 
20 
your question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So now I think the point has 
been made by Mr Sodi that the reason for confining the 
identity 
to 
Blackhead 
Consulting 
Pty 
Limited 
in 
a 
communication with Ms Diedericks both from Mr Sodi’s side 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 90 of 249 
 
and from Mr Mokhesi’s side was because you knew that the 
only contract that had been entered into in [indistinct 
00:16:08] in Gauteng was Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So it was deliberate.  I mean 
when you wrote Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited you knew 
what you were doing? 
MR SODI:  I knew what I was doing Chair and as I said again 
that I did not see anything wrong at the time you know doing 
it in this particular fashion because of the examples that I 
10 
gave previously about you know how it works you know.  For 
instance, when one party has complied if there is a 
consortium or a JV or a partnership if one party to that 
partnership has complied with certain provisions then it is 
acceptable that you can do it that way.  But I – but I you 
know I take the point. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  And I am saying that is…  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Mr Sodi.  So you 
deliberately put Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited in there 
20 
when you knew it was the Joint Venture rather that would be 
appointed in the Free State in order to allow Ms Diedericks 
to say that the Gauteng contract which involved only 
Blackhead could be extended. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  That is correct Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 91 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right well she said it did matter 
because she said had she known that it was a Joint Venture 
she would not have extended the contract because it was not 
permitted in terms of the law.  Do you know that? 
MR SODI:  I – no I do not know that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you want to see her affidavit to 
that effect? 
MR SODI:  Ja I am sure if it is in the affidavit, we can look at 
it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes let us look at FS2 page 100.  
10 
Perhaps we should go back to FS2 99.   
MR SODI:  What page are we at Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS2, 99.   
MR SODI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we could just go to paragraph 14.4 
she was shown the Joint Venture proposal addressed to Mr 
Mokhesi and she says in paragraph 14.4: 
“The proposal is dated 28 May 2014” 
 
Do you know that that is the Joint Venture proposal to 
the Free State Department? 
20 
MR SODI:  Correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“Therefore, as of 28 May 2014 Mr Mokhesi 
may have been aware of the fact that 
Diamond Hill will form a Joint Venture with 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 92 of 249 
 
Blackhead.” 
 
Well he knew that is a fact not may fact. 
MR SODI:  Correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.   
“Why Mr Mokhesi did not mentioned this in 
his letter dated 15 July 2014 to the HOD 
Department of Human Settlement in Gauteng 
is unknown to me.” 
 
Then she says over the page, page FS2 100. 
“If the involvement of Diamond Hill were 
10 
divulged 
to 
me 
I 
would 
not 
[and 
she 
underlines not] have issued my letter dated 4 
August 2014.” 
 
Then she refers to another document or the same 
document. 
“At all relevant times Diamond Hill was not 
on the Gauteng date base if the letter from 
the HOD of the Free State applied for 
permission to appoint Blackhead/Diamond 
Hill JV I would not have been able to get 
20 
permission in terms of Regulation 16a6.6 
because this JV was not a registered vendor 
in Gauteng.” 
 
Correct? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 93 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Everybody knew that. 
MR SODI:  Correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that is why reference is only 
made to Blackhead. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we could then move on – if you 
would bear with me a moment please.  Would you go to 
FS8 179 please?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS8 179.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle FS8 page 179.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is a letter from Mr Mokhesi 
dated the 11 August 2014 to yourself as the CEO of 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it – its title or heading is 
Appointment of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited for the 
asbestos eradication program in the Free State Province.  
And it says: 
“The above has reference to the concurrent 
20 
approval 
by 
the 
Gauteng 
Province 
Department 
Human 
Settlements 
dated 
4 
August 2014 regarding your participation in 
an agreement currently secured by them.” 
 
Whether that is referring to a panel or a specific 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 94 of 249 
 
contract does not appear to be very clear so I am not going 
to press you on that but let us look at paragraph 1. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You formerly agree to participate and 
extend your services – now this is to you, Blackhead 
Consulting 
Pty 
Limited 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements Free State in line with the Terms and Conditions 
of their IPW.  So it seems that what Mr Mokhesi is here 
talking about is the instruction to perform work that existed 
in the Free State – um in Gauteng. 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we have been through this a 
number of occasions.  That is not what formed the basis of 
the contract in the Free State? 
MR SODI:  Because the amounts were different. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC:  Yes. 
 And there were other 
differences. 
MR SODI:  Correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But we can go there as well. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then over the page Free State 8, 
180, FS8, 180.  That is a letter from yourself to Mr Mokhesi.  
Do you see that? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now it appears for the first time that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 95 of 249 
 
the Joint Venture at least on the letterhead appears.  Do you 
see that? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
And 
although 
the 
previous 
correspondence deals with – and the invitations deal with 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited you confirm here – well let 
us deal with the first paragraph. 
“We acknowledge receipt of your fax dated 11 August 2014 in 
which you request our written response regarding the 
appointment of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited.” 
10 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SODI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Specifically, Blackhead Consulting 
not the Joint Venture. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.   
“We would like to confirm the following: 
1. That Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited JV is 
willing 
and 
committed 
to 
perform 
the 
required work.” 
20 
So you are quite aware of the distinction in this whole saga 
of events between Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited on the 
one hand and Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited Joint 
Venture on the other because you mention them both 
separately. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 96 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In the same letter, correct? 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So this is a deliberate introduction of 
the JV to Mr Mokhesi, correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair but you would also recall 
that the proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He knew it was going to be the JV. 
MR SODI:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the point you made. 
10 
MR SODI:  So the proposal that was submitted in May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is not going to hear for the first time 
about JV now. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  It was – that proposal was very specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  That it is a JV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  That he is applying for there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I note that even though you do 
include JV in paragraph 1 in that letter you do not mention 
20 
Diamond Hill.  Is there a reason for that? 
MR SODI:  There would not have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it not in the Joint Venture? 
MR SODI:  There would not have been any specific reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the Joint Venture not Blackhead, 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 97 of 249 
 
Diamond Hill, JV. 
MR SODI:  Ja it was.  It was.  I suppose that should have 
been specific there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  That it is a Blackhead Consulting, Diamond Hill 
JV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we move from a point where Mr 
Mokhesi in correspondence with Ms Diedericks does not 
mention the JV at all and you do not mention the JV in the 
other letter that we looked at a few minutes ago.  But here 
10 
there is a difference.  You mention Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Limited and then you say JV. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do not put in Diamond Hill? 
MR SODI:  For the full name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe later you do but at this stage you 
do not. 
MR SODI:  We do not but Chair if you look… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like a gradual. 
MR SODI:  No Chair.  If you look at that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  On top right next to Blackhead there is a 
Diamond Hill stamp.  I do not know if you have got that letter 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 98 of 249 
 
in front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes I see that. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SODI:  So it was not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so there is… 
MR SODI:  To conceal anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so… 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That may be a fair point ja. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and in the footer of the letter too 
Diamond Hill is mentioned as well in fairness to Mr Sodi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is the point ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In the green bar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is instructive about this 
particular letter Mr Sodi?  It was your understanding that 
what was going to happen in the Free State was your 
appointment as a JV and not the appointment of any panel? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we are at one o’clock Mr Pretorius 
maybe we should take the lunch adjournment or do you have 
a last question before lunch? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I do not think it makes much 
difference Chair.  We have got a lot more questions. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 99 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I leave room just in case you had one more 
question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair I will move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment and resume at two o’clock. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, can we 
go to FS8 at page 180?   
MR SODI:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just to recap.  This letter from 
yourself to the Department of Human Settlements in the Free 
State who introduces the JV for the first, in fact, in this 
series of correspondence. 
MR SODI:  Chair, I would not say it is for the first time.  The 
first the JV was introduced to us was when we submitted the 
20 
proposal which was around May of 2014. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, you are entirely correct but what 
I am putting is that, in the correspondence that we have just 
been through ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Okay, yes. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 100 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...between Free State, Gauteng and 
the National Department, the first time it is placed on record. 
MR SODI:  Okay that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We go over the page to FS8 page 
181.  We see there a letter from Mr Zulu to Mr Mokhesi dated 
the 13t h of August 2014.   
 
Now this letter deals with, on the face of it again, not the 
particular 
instruction 
to 
perform 
work 
emanating 
from 
Gauteng but the database contract.  In other words, the 
panel contract we have referred to. 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It also deals with Blackhead 
Consulting (Pty) Limited and not the Joint Venture. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If one goes to the last letter in the 
series that I want to put to you, please.  It is FS8 page 188.  
Now the appointment letter that we have referred to in 
evidence before of 1s t October 2014, addressed by Mr 
Mokhesi the head of the department in the Free State to the 
chief executive officer of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited, 
20 
JV.  Correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the second paragraph reads: 
“The department wishes to advise that your company 
has been exclusively appointed for the audit and 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 101 of 249 
 
assessment 
of 
asbestos, 
handling 
of 
hazardous 
material, 
removal 
and 
disposal 
of 
asbestos 
contaminated...” 
 
And then that next word is clear or unclear rather. 
“...and replacement with SABS approved material in 
the Free State Province...” 
 
I apologise.  The letter is not very clear but that is more 
or less what it says except for one word which I could not 
read. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So what is apparent from this letter 
of appointment is that it is an appointment of the JV as the 
exclusive service provider to do the work set out there.  
Correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it also includes an appointment 
for handling of hazardous material, removal and disposal of 
asbestos contaminated material and replacement with SABC 
approved material in the Free State Province. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If I could just summarise because it 
is apparent that in relation to the extension of the contract 
from wherever it may have originated to the Joint Venture in 
the Fee State, there is, to put it at its lowest, a great deal of 
confusion.  Like if I can just summarise for you. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 102 of 249 
 
 
And in the first place, Mokhesi seeks to... Mr Mokhesi 
seeks to extent a national panel contract and Mr Zulu 
appears to cooperate in that. 
 
And in the second place, Mr Mokhesi seeks to extent the 
instruction to perform work in Gauteng.  In the third place, 
Diedericks 
seeks 
to 
extent 
a 
panel 
contract, 
not 
an 
instruction to perform work. 
 
And in the fourth place, Diedericks and Zulu and up to a 
point Mr Mokhesi talks about Blackhead.  The appointment 
letter appoints the Joint Venture. 
10 
 
And finally, we have a solar appointment of a joint 
venture, not of Blackhead, not of a panel arrangement and 
not in accordance with the Gauteng instruction to perform 
work and terms and conditions particularly in regard to price.  
It is a fair summary of what appears to lack clarity at the 
very least. 
MR SODI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you could assist the Chair, please 
Mr Sodi?  It is in relation to two issues and that is to 
understand what you know of what work was done in the 
20 
Free State and the costs of that work.  You may be able to 
fill in some gaps that exist in evidence thus far. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As I understand it.  In your first 
statement, you said that virtually all of the work on the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 103 of 249 
 
ground was carried out by the ORI Group. 
MR SODI:  Ja, we... Chair, we sub-contracted MasterTrade 
who and then, you know, subsequently contracted ORI Group 
to do the actual work.  But at all times there, I was always, 
until 
much 
later, 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
it 
was 
MasterTrade that was doing the actual work. 
 
I only found out much later when there was a dispute 
between ORI Group and MasterTrade that in actual fact there 
was an entity called ORI Group but at the beginning, that 
information was kept from me.  I was not aware about it. 
10 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 At 
the 
time 
the 
Free 
State 
Department of Human Settlements agreed to pay you 
R 850,00 per unit, did they know that you were going to sub-
contract the work, substantially all the work to MasterTrade 
for R 44 million? 
MR SODI:  Chair, as far as I know the department, at least 
from my side, was not informed that we were going to sub-
contract.  I am not sure if that conversation could have 
happened between my late partner and the department.  You 
know, it may have happened.  I would not know.  But for my 
20 
side, certainly, there was no... that discussion never took 
place. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you not think to inform the 
department of the fact that you could, in fact, sub-contract 
the work for a fraction of the price that they were going to 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 104 of 249 
 
pay? 
MR SODI:  Chair, in normal practice in the industry that we 
operate in, we often sub-contract but what remains is the 
contract is between two parties.   
 
In this case, the contract was between the Department 
of Human Settlements in the Free State together with the 
Blackhead/Diamond Hill.  
 
So the expectation from the department was that the JV 
would do the work.  But as it happens in the industry, you 
from time to time especially where you need services of a 
10 
specialist nature, you would sub-contract. 
 
But there is certainly no obligation, as far as I know, that 
you ought to disclose to the client that we are going to sub-
contract the work.  It certainly does not happen in most 
cases. 
 
You are expected that you will do all the work and you 
be held responsible as the contracted party to deliver on 
what you are supposed to deliver.   
 
So in most cases, it is not a requirement at all that, you 
know, you need to come back or disclose to the client to say, 
20 
“Client, listen.  Yes, we acknowledge that you gave us this 
work but we are actually going to, you know, use the 
services of a sub-contractor”. 
 
It hardly happens in the industry Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Arising from you answer now Mr Sodi.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 105 of 249 
 
Do I understand you to say that it is common practice that 
when contractors do work with a province or a national 
department 
for 
these... 
for 
similar 
sub-contracting 
arrangements to take place?  It happens often? 
MR SODI:  It happens quite often Chair.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can up to a certain point understand 
within maybe certain context a situation where a department 
or any client says, “I am giving you this work.  You know 
what the standards are that must be met.  I will hold you 
responsible.   
10 
 
I do not really care whether you do the work or 
somebody else does the work but if you let somebody do the 
work who ends up not meeting the standard expected, you 
will be accountable”. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to a certain level I can understand that. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also, I can understand a situation 
where the client would say, “I am giving you the work 
because you have put up a proposal for me.  You have 
20 
convinced me that you have got the expertise to do this job 
and the experience.   
 
I do not want anybody else to do the work because if I 
wanted somebody else, I would have given it to somebody 
else.   
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 106 of 249 
 
 
I wanted you to do the job.  So as far as I am concerned, 
it is not permissible for you having got the job from me to 
give it somebody else”. 
MR SODI:  Ja, of course Chair.  If that is specified 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me qualify that. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is unacceptable.  It is not going to be 
permissible for you to give it to somebody else without my 
permission. 
10 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR SODI:  So to respond to that Chair.  If it is made very 
clear by the client that:  “Listen Mr Blackhead, we are giving 
you this project and we expect you to do the work.  We do 
not expect anyone else to do the work on your behalf.   
 
But you, because you have presented to us that you are 
capable that you indeed have the necessary skill and 
experience and qualification to do the work.  So we expect 
you to do the work”. 
20 
 
If that is specified, whether it be in an SLA or whatever 
contract, then indeed, we will have to abide by those 
instructions.   
 
But if such is not specified anywhere, we would typically 
do it, you know, the same that we do with a whole lot of 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 107 of 249 
 
other projects where we say, “Look, at the end of the day it 
is our responsibility to make sure the job gets done.  It gets 
done properly”. 
 
It gets done according to the standards that would have 
been set by the client.  If anything, go wrong, we cannot now 
turn and say, “Well, Mr Client we have appointed someone 
else to do the work.  They messed up.  So deal with them”. 
 
We would still be accountable for anything that goes 
wrong.  So the responsibility still lies with us as the service 
provider to make sure that the product is up to the 
10 
satisfaction of the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We understand Mr Sodi that when the 
state or the executive or when the administration spends 
money in a procurement exercise, it is bound by, not only 
constitutional provisions but a host of other legislative 
provisions and Treasury regulations.  You know that?   
MR SODI:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the Constitution says that when 
money is spend it must be cost-effective.  You understand... 
20 
you know that?  Do you? 
MR SODI:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway, you can trust me.  That is 
what the Constitution says ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Okay. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 108 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...in Section 217. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In order for a state department to 
know that it is embarking upon a procurement exercise which 
must be cost-effective, quite apart from being fair and 
transparent and the like, it needs to have all the information 
at its disposal.  You would agree with that? 
MR SODI:  I would agree with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So, and this is not your responsibility 
because I understand as a businessman you might well say, 
10 
well it is up to the department to do its homework.  Here is 
my bid.  They can give me the work or they do not have to. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But in relation to the department, if 
they had known that, firstly, you were to sub-contract and 
secondly, had they known the terms and conditions of the 
sub-contract, they would have been in a better position to 
ensure that the contract was, from their point of view, cost-
20 
effective.  Would you agree with that? 
MR SODI:  Well, Chair it could be that yes we could have 
assisted the department to come to that determination.  But 
let us bear in mind that what happened in this case was, 
there was a negotiation with regard to the fee that was 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 109 of 249 
 
ultimately agreed upon between the two parties. 
 
The Department of Human Settlements, in this case - 
and I am certainly not speaking on their behalf.  They can 
maybe speak to that point. – my assumption is that they 
were guided as well. 
 
Because remember I said, no one had done this sort of 
project prior to Gauteng.  So they were guided by the fee or 
the price that was charged in Gauteng which was in a way 
some kind of a precedent if one wants to put it that way. 
 
And I explained previously when I was here that the 
10 
reason why the Free State fee was higher than Gauteng was 
to then take care of the unknown factors that I explained, 
you know. 
 
The fact that now we are dealing with the entire 
province, not just certain, you know, certain parts of the Free 
State.  Now we are dealing with the entire province. 
 
So, certainly from their point of view, they would have 
said, “Okay, we have got a benchmark in terms of price.  The 
benchmark is R 650,00.  We know it because it has 
happened, you know, service providers who were appointed 
20 
on that”. 
 
And certainly, when we negotiated with them we said, 
“Look.  Yes, that is what we got”.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I know I am interrupting you Mr Sod. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 110 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the point that Mr Pretorius 
wishes you to comment on is a very narrow one.  A very 
narrow point ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...that you... I think he wishes you to 
comment on. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely, this project was not done in a 
cost-effective 
manner 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
department.  How that came about might be a matter for 
10 
debate but that is a fact.  You accept that?   
MR SODI:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MR SODI:  I do accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that, yes.  That is point one.  
Point two, had the department known what we know now, 
namely, that there was or would be an entity that could do 
this job for much less, there is no reason why we should 
think they would have been prepared so much to you.  You 
accept that? 
20 
MR SODI:  I do accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  I do accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  And just to add onto that.  Chair, you would 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 111 of 249 
 
remember, I also mentioned the last time that I was here that 
from the very beginning when we started engaging with the 
department and when we wrote that first letter, it was never 
anticipated at all that the project was going to be sub-
contracted at least from my point of view because we had 
done this. 
 
So I did not even entertain that thought.  It never even 
occurred to me that we may get to that stage until much later 
when Mr Bombane approached me and asked me if I could, 
you know, be available for a presentation by MasterTrade. 
10 
 
He convinced me and eventually I agreed.  I said, “I am 
fine.  Let us meet.  Let me listen to the presentation”. 
 
Which I did.  And I also mentioned that I was shocked by 
the proposal.  My first instinct was they are not going to be 
able to execute the project at that price.  That was my first 
instinct. 
 
And that was followed by me approaching or saying to 
Mr Bombane:  “But you need to speak to these guys because 
I have my doubts, you know, that they will be able to do the 
project at that price.  I, you know, think you should go and 
20 
speak to them and verify that”. 
 
Which he did and he came back and he said, “Look, 
these guys they are happy.  They are comfortable”. 
 
Of course, Chair we know and I said that, when we 
implemented, we did not have the technology but these guys 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 112 of 249 
 
demonstrated 
during 
the 
presentation 
and 
we 
know 
introduces optimisation and, you know, efficiencies. 
 
But I certainly did not think that the optimisation and the 
efficiencies would greatly reduce the cost of doing this 
project to an extent that it did because all along, and based 
on my experience of the Gauteng project, I anticipated that 
we would spend more... give or take around fifty or so 
percent as the cost of doing the bid. 
 
That is what I thought but of course, as it turned out, 
these guys presented, they said, “Look, we have got the 
10 
most recent advanced technology and you will be able to 
realise some efficiency and optimisation”.  And that is 
exactly what I did.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, it would appear that, to say the 
least, the Free State Department of Human Settlements did 
not do its homework properly in arriving at the amount that 
they arrived at per house. 
 
Because had they known that in Gauteng you had made 
the kind of profit that you had made, they should have said, 
“No, but you should make such a big profit out of this”.  Then 
20 
go and reduce the amount. 
MR SODI:  [laughs]  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you agree? 
MR SODI:  Chair, can I be honest with you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 113 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  I would not have told them the profit margin that I 
would have made.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR SODI:  So I may have said to them:  “Guys, I made... my 
profit margin was 20%”.  We are businesspeople.  So we 
always wanted to keep it light, you know.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you not have been truthful with 
them? 
MR SODI:  H’m? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you not have been truthful with 
10 
them? 
MR SODI:  I am just being honest Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR SODI:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You see Mr Sodi, as a prominent 
businessman and someone who has frequently done wok 
with state organs, it is not the Chair’s duty to only deal with 
this matter.  He has to look at cost-effectiveness across the 
board in all procurements. 
20 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because the country is facing serious 
problems ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Absolutely. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which has even raised, amongst 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 114 of 249 
 
other things, to this inquiry. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So in that sense, we are specific 
questions but they also have a general relevance and a 
general importance. 
MR SODI:  Ja, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But when a service provider tenders 
for a contract or makes a proposal as in this case, an 
unsolicited bid, it is incumbent upon both the service 
provider and the state organ providing the work to ensure 
10 
that what processes takes place are lawful and result in a 
constitutionally compliant procurement process.  
 
One of the conditions or requirements is that it be cost-
effective.  You accept all that, do you? 
MR SODI:  I accept that Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now it may well be that you say, as 
you have just said, “I am a businessman.  I am entitled to 
make my profit.  I do not have to disclose my profit.  It is up 
to the department to make sure that it gives out work in 
accordance with its requirements and its statutory duties”. 
20 
 
That argument may or may not be a good one but I do 
not want to debate it with you.   
 
The point that the Chair has just made and I would like 
to ask you about is that in order to comply with its own 
duties, the department should either do its own homework or 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 115 of 249 
 
make sure it gets full information from a service provider.  
That is ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  I ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If the department is going to 
complain that they have entered into a contract which was 
not cost-effective and to the benefit of the taxpayer, it 
cannot... it can only legitimately complain if somehow it has 
been misled.  It is up to it to do its homework. 
MR SODI:  Absolutely. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
10 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But there is a provision in our law 
and regulations which caters for this and that is the 
Competitive Bidding Process because in the Competitive 
Bidding Process, you would have had a completed which... 
although it would not have seen your bid, would have known 
that in order to win the business, it would have to come in 
with a cost-effective and competitive bid. 
 
The point I want to make is that the very process that 
would have ensured cost-effectiveness here was absent and 
20 
it was absent because of the very complex and confusing 
attempts to extend the contract, which we will submit in due 
course, it is clearly unlawful.  
MR SODI:  Chair, can I... I would like to make a submission.  
That certainly from our point of view, we complied with what 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 116 of 249 
 
needed to be complied with in order to give affect Treasury 
Regulation 16(a).6.6.   
 
Of course I do not know the mechanics of how that 
works but I do have a broader view, a broader understanding 
rather of how it works, you know but not in so much detail. 
 
I mean, over the years I have come to, you know, 
because of this process understand that it has to work in a 
certain way but at the time, I understood it to mean exactly 
what we did from our side. 
 
And one would have expected that the department in this 
10 
case would have made sure that all the provisions of that 
regulation are complied with which I would not have known. 
 
And I doubt if Mr Bombane would have known that 
either.  So from our side as the service provider who wanted 
to get work, we certainly, you know we complied with what 
we needed to comply with.  And that is my submission to 
that point, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I just wanted to say because you 
did not comply when you made that misrepresentation in 
the proposal, that part was not complied. 
20 
MR SODI:   Correct, Chair, but I, at the time, I did not 
know that I was not complying like I explained my – I do 
not know what I put that is what I explained of, you know, if 
you put a proposal through a JV or consortium or 
partnership but if one of the members of the partnership or 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 117 of 249 
 
the consortium …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, we are not on the same 
page. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are thinking of a different point. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the point I was making, you 
remember the misrepresentations we talked about on your 
first day in regard to the handling of asbestos and 
…[intervenes] 
10 
MR SODI:   Oh, okay, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is the part I am talking about. 
MR SODI:   Okay, I get it, I get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to that, that was not complied. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you accept, ja. 
MR SODI:   Okay.  I accept that, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just to deal briefly, Mr Sodi, with 
the subcontracting issue.  You recall in the service level 
agreements – and I can refer you to FS8 191 at paragraph 
20 
4.1, in accordance with that service level agreement you 
undertook 
to 
execute 
the 
project 
in 
line 
with 
the 
agreement, the approved instruction to perform work and 
the applicable legislation and regulations, that was an 
undertaking 
by 
the 
service 
provider. 
 
Paragraph 
4 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 118 of 249 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, on what page are you? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS8 191. 
CHAIRPERSON:   191, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   4.2 reads: 
“The service provider undertakes that they have the 
capacity 
to 
and 
are 
able 
to 
enter 
into 
this 
agreement.” 
4.2.2: 
“They have all the necessary experience, skill and 
10 
capability to render the service in accordance with 
the 
requirements 
and 
expectations 
of 
the 
department.” 
From these clauses it appears that the contents of the 
service level agreement indicated that you would – could 
do the work and you would do the work. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair, but the service level 
agreement does not say that we are not entitled to 
subcontract the works.  It is very fine when it comes to that 
point and this is the point, I made earlier that if it was 
20 
specified …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now I am going to interrupt you. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Mr Pretorius is putting to you is 
that you or the JV and the department are entering into 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 119 of 249 
 
this agreement and no one else. 
MR SODI:   Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that what this 4.2 says is that you 
are saying to the other party to the agreement, namely the 
department, we are – we have the capacity. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the ability to do this. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You are not saying we do not have 
10 
the capacity, we do not have the ability, so you are 
entering into the contract with somebody who will give the 
job to somebody else because they do not have the 
capacity.  He is saying you are saying to the department 
you are entering into a contract with the right people. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have got the capacity. 
MR SODI:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They have got the ability. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree with that? 
MR SODI:   I agree with that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were dealing earlier in your 
recent 
testimony, 
Mr 
Sodi, 
with 
the 
timing 
of 
the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 120 of 249 
 
subcontracting arrangements.  When were those, according 
to your knowledge, entered into? 
MR SODI:   Chair, again, I am speaking under correction 
but I think this was around October/November of 2014, 
somewhere around there.  Cannot recall the exact date but 
it was maybe a month or so before we started with the 
actual work. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, that would have been after 
the letter of appointment of 1 October 2014. 
MR SODI:   Correct, ja. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Manyike, who testified earlier in 
the series of issues, you know who he is? 
MR SODI:   I know him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He is the owner of ORI. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second subcontractor. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He gave evidence on the 7 August 
2020 and I am referring to the transcript of his evidence, 
Chair, at page 15 and I recall this, in any event, because I 
20 
put the question.  I put the following question to him after 
he gave a history of his involvement and the involvement 
of Master Trade, the first subcontractor with the joint 
venture and I put it to him as a conclusion of his evidence: 
“So the arrangement with Mpambani of the joint 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 121 of 249 
 
venture with Master Trade that you would be a 
subcontractor to a subcontractor to do the whole of 
the work was discussed, it appears, and agreed in 
principle before the contract with the joint venture 
and the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements 
was finalised.  That is how I understand your 
affidavit.” 
Mr Manyike: 
“Yes, yes, that is correct, that is correct.” 
Do you have any comment on that? 
10 
MR SODI:   Well, Chair, my comment to that is – and again 
I have alluded to this point previously, that it appeared that 
there 
were 
parallel 
discussions 
that 
were 
happening 
between Mr Mpambani and Master Trade, Sidney, and 
Kgotso as well which I was not aware of.  So it is possible 
that they started having these discussions about Master 
Trade coming on board long before we signed that 
subcontract agreement with them and I am not surprised 
and I will not be surprised if that was the case because, 
like I said, even when he came to me, initially – like I said 
20 
I was very reluctant right at the beginning when he said to 
me that, you know, would you mind if we listen to these 
guys?    
And I was like but why do we even have to listen to 
these guys because we are going to do this job ourselves, 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 122 of 249 
 
we have got the experience, we have got the skill, we have 
got the capacity, why should we even listen to someone 
else?  We are going to do this, we have got the recourses 
and he was adamant, that no, listen to them and, you 
know, you do not have to say yes, you know, but listen to 
them and hear what they say and reluctantly agreed and, 
you know, made myself available to that presentation. 
But, you know, as we – I would have said here, the 
relationship, prior relationship that existed between Mr 
Radebe and Mr Mpambani for many, many years.  So it is 
10 
highly probable that he would have said to him listen, I do 
not think Mr Sodi is going to have a problem with this, you 
guys are going to do the job.  It is possible, seeing the 
character, the kind of character that we know him to be and 
that I came to know him to be later on, that he could have 
simply said to these guys I will speak to him, you know, he 
will get this thing done, so do not worry. 
So certainly, I was not surprised with Mr Manyike’s 
evidence here when he said there were discussions that 
were taking place but I was not party to those discussions 
20 
and 
I 
could 
believe 
indeed 
those 
discussions 
were 
happening long before we even signed or long before they 
even came to do the representation.  They may have had 
their own arrangements.  So that is my submission to that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, for present purposes we can 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 123 of 249 
 
put it higher than that, it is strange that two business 
partners do not how they are going to execute a project of 
this nature at the time they are signing up the agreement. 
MR SODI:   Are you referring to myself? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And Mr Mpambani.   
MR SODI:   I knew how the project was going to be 
executed, I had not even once anticipated that we were 
going to subcontract it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I do not understand the answer you 
did 
not 
know 
how 
the 
project 
was 
going 
to 
be 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him finish, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because you did not know of the 
subcontractor, that is the point I make. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I find that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Mr Pretorius, he had 
not finished. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR SODI:   So what I am trying to explain, Chair, is it was 
never anticipated from my side that we would eventually 
subcontract.  It was certainly not once mentioned to me by 
Mr Mpambani that he would prefer us to subcontract right 
up until the last minute and when he came with his 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 124 of 249 
 
proposal. 
 
So from call it May of 2014 to about October there 
was certainly no discussion at all between the two of us 
about having to subcontract the project to someone else.  
That discussion never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   For that amount for that period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I think what Mr Pretorius is 
saying is to the extent that Mr Mpambani may have 
contemplated that the execution of this contract would 
10 
entail subcontracting and you had contemplated that there 
would be no subcontracting, it is strange that two partners 
who are about to do the same job, execute this contract, 
did not have the same understanding as to how it was 
going to be executed.  That is my understanding of what Mr 
Pretorius is saying to you.  What do you say to that? 
MR SODI:   My short and quick answer to that, Chair, is Mr 
Mpambani may have had his own expectations, he may 
have had his own plans and I certainly came to realise 
much later that he did have his own plans and, you know, 
20 
and so forth.  And that is demonstrated by the fact that he 
did not conduct himself in a manner that he should have in 
the spirit of a partnership as we had envisaged and as we 
had recorded it in our partnership or JV agreement and 
that point, Chair, is demonstrated by two things.   
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 125 of 249 
 
It is demonstrated by the insistence from 
Mr 
Mpambani to utilise the services of a subcontractor.  That 
is one. 
Two, that when a payment was made into the JV 
account, Mr Mpambani instead of acting in accordance with 
the agreement that, you know, costs would be – or 
expenses, rather, would be deducted and whatever remains 
would 
be 
shared 
equally. 
 
In 
the 
last 
payment 
he 
transferred the entire funds into his personal account and 
that became a subject of litigation and so forth and civil 
10 
action. 
So you would expect in a normal environment that 
partners who work together would know what to happen, 
how things have to happen but if you have got one of the 
partners 
having 
ulterior 
motives, 
such 
things 
would 
happen, as it happened in this case and I am sorry, Chair, I 
do not want to speak ill of those that have departed, may 
his soul rest in peace, but this is exactly what happened, I 
got into a contract or into a partnership with someone who 
was not honourable and this is why we see some of the 
20 
things, dealing with some of things that we are dealing 
with. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In fairness to you, Mr Sodi, I 
should put on record that the Master Trade quote was 
accepted by the joint venture on the 25 October 2014.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 126 of 249 
 
That accords with what you have just told the Chair. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the appointment of ORI, the 
second subcontractor, was made on the 31 October 2014.  
That also seems to accord with your recollection, at least 
of the sequence.   
 
We 
have 
been 
a 
bit 
distracted 
down 
the 
subcontracting detour but let us get back to the work and 
the cost of the work.  There are certain gaps that need to 
be filled in. 
10 
MR SODI:   Sure.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is, according to your 
statement, a second phase of the project and I am not 
talking now about the removal and rebuilding phase but the 
capturing and analysis of the data that has been produced 
by the work on the ground.  Do I understand your evidence 
correctly – and we can go to your statement, if you wish, 
that was conducted by Mr Manyike and Mr Zwane and Mr 
Mtau and Zwane and Mtau were employed directly by the 
joint venture, do I understand that correctly? 
20 
MR SODI:   Yes and let me just maybe give context to that, 
Chair.  So the second phase we are referring to – so you 
are quite correct, Mr Pretorius, what would have happened 
in this case was the first phase, as we would call it, would 
be the capturing of the data on the ground.  So the data 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 127 of 249 
 
would be captured by the fieldworkers using the gadgets 
that we referred to, going through, you know, questions 
that would have been given to them.  That information gets 
conducted from house to house and it then gets fed into 
call it a central depository and once it is there, then it has 
to be analysed.  This is now the second phase that Mr 
Pretorius is referring to.   
 
So we would have a – well, we had engineers, a 
team of engineers that sat in the office and they received 
this information and then they analyse it.  The culmination 
10 
of it, it is a report which then gets to be produced and 
been given to the client. 
 
So Mr Zwane, as I said earlier on, was brought into 
the project because I wanted him to make sure that what 
gets produced is what is expected of us because he was 
involved in the Gauteng project.  He was assisted by Mr 
Mtau who is a qualified civil engineer as well.  So they 
would have, you know, made sure that the data that is 
collected is analysed properly, reports are generated 
together with Manyike and then ultimately submitted to the 
20 
client.  So that is the second phase that Mr Pretorius is 
referring to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  That work was performed 
as I understand your statement at least by Messrs 
Manyike, Zwane and Mtau. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 128 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go please to FS8, 
page 66. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 66? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   66, Chair.  This is a spreadsheet 
that has been the subject matter of a great deal of 
testimony before the Chair.  It is headed Free State 
asbestos eradication project and there are a number of 
entries on the spreadsheet and I would like to deal with 
some of them for the present but for the present just to 
10 
establish the costs that you may be able to assist us with.  
You will see there under the head Free State Asbestos 
Eradication Project number of units 300 000, that is the 
number of units involved in this project, is that correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it is a correct reflection of that 
fact. 
MR SODI:   In as far as there was number of units that 
exist, correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And rate P/U, we can assume 
20 
that that is rate per unit, R850. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is also a correct reflection of 
an external fact. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 129 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The project value R255 million, 
also a correct reflection of external fact.  
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is just by way of introduction.  
The column on the left-hand side, if one goes down a little 
way, you will see the name Master Trade.  That was Master 
Trade the subcontractor. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And next to it is an amount of 
R44 208 567.19.  Now that is the amount quoted to the 
10 
Free State deposit, you know that? 
MR SODI:   No, that is the amount that was agreed 
between the JV and Master Trade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, quoted and agreed. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it is correct to the last cent. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now how that amount is made up is 
of less significance to the larger issues that the Chair has 
to consider but we do know that that amount comprised 
20 
several 
payments 
and 
several 
other 
amounts. 
 
For 
example, there was an upfront payment of R4.4 million 
which has been discussed already. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There were three other amounts 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 130 of 249 
 
paid to the FNB account of Master Trade, amount of 
R13 283 427.16, 
R22 600 170.74 
and 
an 
amount 
of 
R600 000.  I do not expect you to recall the detail to the 
last rand and cents but the charges of the subcontractor, 
Master 
Trade, 
were 
paid 
over 
a 
period 
of 
time, 
I 
understand. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Including an upfront payment of 
R4.4 million. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And Mr Radebe of Master Trade 
maintains that he still has a claim against the joint venture 
in an amount of R3.7 million.  He may not be justified 
according to you in making that claim but that is what he 
says. 
MR SODI:   I am aware of that and I am not sure how he 
arrived at that amount because as far as I am concerned, 
the amount of 44 million was paid to Master Trade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That amount …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Plus the change, that is the amount that we… 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And plus, you will see in the 
extreme right-hand column, not in the table, next to the 
name Master Trade R4.4 million payment. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or what is represented to be a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 131 of 249 
 
R4.4 million payment and you say that was a prepayment 
that was actually made. 
MR SODI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that is another external fact 
which is verified in this schedule, correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Zwane, you have spoken about 
him and his role.  Does his name appear here?  I think you 
have told the investigators about this. 
MR SODI:   His first name is Martin. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   And I would assume that Martin refers to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That Martin refers to Martin Zwane. 
MR SODI:   I would assume that, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He was employed by you or his 
company might have been employed by you, Zinawe(?).   
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He invoiced the joint venture in an 
amount of R1.5 million.  You know that?  I can take you 
there if you want.  Would you like to see it? 
20 
MR SODI:   No, no, I am aware of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, so Mr Zwane, depicted here 
as Martin, would have – did invoice the company for R1.5 
million.  So those are external facts correctly reflected in 
the schedule.  You nod your head. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 132 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Ja, correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  And in your statement, 
we need not go to the reference because it is not in 
dispute, you confirm FS1 396, para 39.8, that the amount 
of R1.5 million was in fact paid to Zwane. 
MR SODI:   To Zwane.  Ja, according to my recollection, it 
was paid to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a record produced by the 
investigators showing other payments to Zinawe or Mr 
Zwane, but they are not directly relevant to this project, I 
10 
understand. 
MR SODI:   Ja, I used – well, Mr Zwane worked for 
Blackhead from time to time over and above this particular 
project, so the payment that you are referring to may be 
related to other projects or other work that he did outside 
of the asbestos project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then underneath Martin we see 
Steve.  Do you know who that is? 
MR SODI:   Again, I would make a calculated guess that 
this would refer to Mtau, I have already mentioned, who 
20 
was part of the engineering team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   That was responsible for the data analysis. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And according to your statement, 
we can just go there, you said you could not recall how 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 133 of 249 
 
much was paid to him. 
MR SODI:   No, I could not recall offhand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you would not be able to verify 
that amount, the R1.2 million as being the correct amount. 
MR SODI:   No, I could not – I am not able to verify it now 
but it could be that is the amount was paid to him, we can 
double-check that, it is not going to be a difficult exercise. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  If we could go to FS1 at 
395 please?   
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   395. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is part of your first affidavit. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in paragraph 39 you say you 
were shown the spreadsheet. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now as I understand your 
evidence, which is contained in the statement, you know 
that Mr Mpambani prepared the spreadsheet on your 
20 
computer in your office. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I understand you to have said 
further there is nothing extraordinary in that. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 134 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because he used your office 
regularly and I presume he used your computer regularly, 
is that correct? 
MR SODI:   Not my computer regularly but on this 
particular occasion he did not have his laptop with him 
when he came to the office. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you watch him prepare the 
spreadsheet? 
MR SODI:   I did not watch him prepare the spreadsheets 
as I was in another meeting, Chair, but we had a 
10 
discussion prior to him preparing the spreadsheet and the 
discussion was centred around getting a spreadsheet done  
that would detail the expenses of the project and those 
expenses we knew, the two of us, related to the subbies(?) 
or Master Trade and the other guys that we used like Steve 
and Martin.  So he worked on it and I was in another 
meeting and what then happened was, he then emailed – 
he told me that he emailed the spreadsheet to his 
computer because he was going to do further work on it.  I 
did not read much into it and I certainly did not - the 
20 
spreadsheet that he prepared because in my view it was a 
straightforward spreadsheet that had to be prepared, you 
know just to deal with the expenses of the project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so I understand the 
position to be you are in your offices together with Mr 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 135 of 249 
 
Mpambani, you nod. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you had a discussion about 
the preparation of a spreadsheet, correct – or schedule? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And your understanding of that 
arrangement was that a spreadsheet would be prepared by 
Mr Mpambani which would reflect costs attributable to the 
Free State project business? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct and if I can add on that, Chair, 
10 
we just – we didn’t leave it at just costs, we discussed 
what those costs were and those costs related to the 
service, to Master Trade, it related to Mr Zwane, it related 
to Mr Tau.  So, it was very specific what costs we were 
talking about, when I left him and went into another 
meeting, those were the costs that he was going to reflect 
including the revenue that will come from the project.  So, 
they were supposed to be captured on the spreadsheet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well it was an important document 
I would understand because revenue minus costs equals 
20 
your profit, in other words, you would be able to see from 
the spreadsheet how much money would, ultimately accrue 
to you as profit. 
MR SODI:   That was the whole objective Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I take it, as a business man – 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 136 of 249 
 
experienced business man the revenue minus costs and 
your ultimate profit is an important calculation to see that 
it’s properly done? 
MR SODI:   Absolutely Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because all the costs are going to 
be deducted from your profit, ultimately. 
MR SODI:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in fact, the arrangement, as I 
understand it, was that the – at least at this stage was that 
the 
profit 
would 
be 
split 
in 
equal 
shares 
between 
10 
BlackHead and Diamond Hill, the partners in the joint 
venture. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair, that was in accordance 
with the JV agreement that we had signed, that we would 
subtract the costs and the expenses of the project and 
whatever then remained, would have been split equally 
between BlackHead Consulting and Diamond Hill.  So, that 
was, essentially the purpose of the spreadsheet to say, this 
is how much the project is going to bring in revenue, this is 
how much we’re going to spend to execute the project and 
20 
this is how much is going to remain and based on what 
remains then 50% of that would go to BlackHead and 50% 
would go to Diamond Hill.  So, that was the long and short 
of it, it was mean to do exactly that, nothing less, nothing 
more. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 137 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, as I understand it, you left 
Mr Mpambani to create the spreadsheet or prepare the 
spreadsheet on your computer, on the understanding that 
you’d see it later? 
MR SODI:   I left him to – after we had discussed what the 
spreadsheet ought to reflect, I had another meeting in the 
adjacent boardroom and I left him to, then prepare that 
particular spreadsheet.  I didn’t anticipate that it was going 
to take long because we knew exactly what was going to 
be reflected there.  I went into the adjacent boardroom and 
10 
had the meeting there and when I was done, he was also 
done with the spreadsheet and then his words were,  
“I’ve emailed the spreadsheet to my computer, okay 
because I’ve got additional work to do on it”, 
 
I didn’t read much into that statement, I figured out, 
additional work might mean he wants to double-check the 
figures in the spreadsheet and I left it there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you recall, more or less when 
this conversation and preparation took place in your office 
on your computer? 
20 
MR SODI:   Chair, I cannot recall the exact date but it was 
in 2014, I would be misleading the Commission if I want to 
start guesstimating the date but it was definitely in 2014, I 
can’t remember – I can’t recall exactly when it was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 39.20 FS1398 you 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 138 of 249 
 
deal with an email, which I presume is the same email, is 
that the email you were referring to a moment ago when 
you said the spreadsheet was emailed back to you? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That appears in FS8 and there’s 
another reference in FS9 at page 281 to 284. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle is that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS9, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   FS9. 
MR SODI:   Sorry, what is the page again, Mr Pretorius? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   281, we’ll start there.  Well, first 
let’s go to 284 that’s the spreadsheet, is it, otherwise 
referred to as the cost of business schedule?  Then on 283 
we have an email, it reads – firstly it’s dated the 28 t h of 
March 2015, it’s addressed to Edwin, its title is, fees 
calculation, it says, this is a draft message it says,  
“Sho, Eddie, please note that payments highlighted 
in yellow are the ones you will take care of and the 
rest us as discussed.  I have effected the payments 
in two batches, kindly find attached the updated 
20 
schedule with the following minor adjustments.  JT 
from R1million to R500 000”, 
 
Do you recall receiving this email? 
MR SODI:   I recall receiving this email, Chair, but I need 
to add that my understanding of the email was, there was 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 139 of 249 
 
funds that came into the account from the client and Mr 
Mpambani, who was the transactor from day one was going 
to make the payments in two batches. Meaning the one 
batch is payment that goes to BlackHead Consulting and 
the second batch being payment that goes to Diamond Hill, 
that was my understanding of this. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, that, of course is partly in 
dispute in the Court case but I don’t want to go there, the 
dispute 
between 
yourselves 
and 
the 
Estate 
of 
Mr 
Mpambani, I don’t want to go there but if one goes to 282 
10 
of FS9, one sees the same email but it’s no longer a draft 
email – no it’s not the same email so – it deals with the 
same issue.  It’s from Ego, Diamond Hill, Ego is Mr 
Mpambani’s first name. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC: “Sho, Eddie, it reads, I have  
effected the payment in two batches, kindly find 
attached the updated schedule with the following 
minor adjustments, JT from R1million to R500 000”. 
 
And your details appear in the email chain below 
20 
that? You nod again. 
MR SODI:   Ja, I acknowledge it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then part of the email chain 
appears on page 281 of FS9 but there’s no content on that 
page.  Now, according to your statement, and we’ll come 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 140 of 249 
 
back to this, you say in paragraph 39.21, you never 
discussed payments, I presume payments on the schedule 
with Mr Mpambani? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To which page have you now gone, Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We’re on page FS1 398. 
CHAIRPERSON:   3-9-8? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes – well let’s first deal with 
another matter, just in relation to the schedule itself, if one 
goes back to the schedule, Free State 8 page 66, one sees 
10 
at the bottom at the left-hand side, upfront payments 
R4.4million.  As I understand, from your statement that is 
an amount you paid to Mr Radebe as an upfront payment, 
Mr Radebe being from Master Trade? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you gave that information to 
Mr 
Mpambani 
so 
that 
he 
could 
include 
it 
in 
the 
spreadsheet? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct, that’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it’s a correct reflection of a 
20 
factual payment? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Based on information you gave to 
Mr Mpambani, correct? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 141 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let’s go back, when the 
email, that we’ve just discussed was sent to you, that’s the 
email of 28 March 2015 or that – at the time of that email 
chain was the schedule returned to you? 
MR SODI:   I cannot recall if the schedule, Chair, was – 
you’re referring to this spreadsheet? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Spreadsheet, cost of business 
schedule yes. 
MR SODI:   I do not recall if it was returned to me, at all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you see it again? 
10 
MR SODI:   I – to be honest, I saw this spreadsheet during 
the 
session 
that 
I 
had 
with 
the 
investigators, 
they 
presented me with this spreadsheet and I said, it’s the first 
time that I’m seeing it I did not author the spreadsheet, 
sorry I’m not the author of the spreadsheet but I did have a 
discussion with Mr Mpambani, on a spreadsheet which I’ve 
already explained, which was meant to detail the expenses 
of the project but this particular spreadsheet I saw it for 
the first time when I was – when I had a meeting with the 
investigators. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you learn that your share 
of the profits amounted to R86 195 716.05? 
MR SODI:   So, on the day that we – that Mr Mpambani 
worked on the spreadsheet, remember I said, we had 
already discussed what the expenses were, all that needed 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 142 of 249 
 
to happen was that it had to be recorded on a spreadsheet 
but 
during 
that 
meeting, 
which 
would 
have 
been 
somewhere in 2014, we already knew upfront what the 
costs were, it was not difficult to make a calculation of the 
costs.  So, I knew at that time, how much was going to be 
the share which would have been BlackHead’s share from 
the profits of the project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let’s just look at that, please 
Mr Sodi.  You expected income of R255million? 
MR SODI:   That was – that’s correct, that was the project 
10 
value. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The sub-contractor, Master Trade 
would be paid R44million? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That leaves R211million. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And there would be some expenses 
for Mr Zwane and Tau? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we know those aren’t 
20 
significant amounts? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, did it not concern you that if 
you take your R86million you add another R86million you 
get approximately R172million?  There’s nearly R30million 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 143 of 249 
 
missing. 
MR SODI:   Chair, I said, we discussed, on the day, the 
expenses of the project.  I do not recall if it was R86million 
or it was some other figure but we knew that R44million 
was going to be paid to Master Trade and those other 
amounts that would have been paid to Mr Zwane and Mr 
Tau, the difference between that and the R255million would 
have been the profit margin and that was the purpose for 
which we had to get that spreadsheet done.  So, it had to 
record that but as I indicated, Mr Mpambani mentioned he 
10 
had emailed it to himself so that he can do further work on 
it, so I didn’t bother to ask, what further work are you 
referring to or that is going to happen on the spreadsheet.  
So, I’m certainly not confirming that my profit margin would 
have been R86million but you know, I’m saying it should 
have been the difference between the R255million minus 
the R44million plus the other amounts we spoke about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, well, let’s look at it.  Your 
expected income was R255million, correct.  You knew and 
discussed that a spreadsheet would be prepared where the 
20 
costs of Master Trade would be recorded, R44million. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I’m rounding the figure off, 
Martin Zwane, R1.5million and Steve – you say you don’t 
know but you – are you happy to consider that figure of 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 144 of 249 
 
R1.2million as being accurate. 
MR SODI:   I’m happy with that, Chair, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that’s R47million, correct? 
MR SODI:   Correct ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well let’s round it off to R48million 
because it’s R47.9million. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, one has R48million coming off 
as 
expenses 
of 
an 
income 
of 
R255million 
that 
is 
R207million, correct? 
10 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Your half share of that would have 
been R103.5million. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But according to this spreadsheet 
you’re only getting R86million, weren’t you interested in 
where this money disappeared to? 
MR SODI:   No, hence I’m saying, I only got to see, Chair, 
this spreadsheet, when it was presented to me by the 
investigator, I don’t know how that R86million was arrived 
20 
at, I don’t know if Mr Mpambani is the one that, you know, 
put this figure, I wouldn’t know how he made those sort of 
calculations. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well remember that there are Court 
papers and a whole lot of other documents which we can 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 145 of 249 
 
look at, we may have to ask you in due course, to deal with 
that. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But for the present, I find it rather 
strange that you wouldn’t have known your profit or 
interrogated 
your 
profit 
until 
you 
were 
– 
until 
the 
investigators spoke to you last year, some three/four years 
later.  
MR SODI:   Chair, this is how the project was executed, 
and it’s very simple there’s nothing complicated about it.  
10 
We knew what the costs were going to be and these are 
the costs we referred to and those costs were going to be 
paid to Master Trade and those two individuals that we 
referred to.  What then would have remained, was an 
amount that would be shared equally between the two 
parties and that’s exactly what happened Chair.  Right up 
until the very last payment, which was handled in a 
different way, by the late Mr Mpambani but any amount that 
came into the project, into the JV account would be subject 
to minusing the expenses and a lot of the expenses were 
20 
minused, you know, in the first few payments that came 
through an then subsequent to that, whatever was in the 
account would be split equally.  So, I had absolutely no 
problem at all, or never doubt that, you know, this is how it 
was going to be and it was certainly done in that way up 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 146 of 249 
 
until, as I said, the very last payment, which was then 
handled differently. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you know, that according 
to Mr Mpambani at least, you were only entitled to 
R86million or BlackHead was only entitled to R86million 
and not R103.5million? 
MR SODI:   Chair, as I’ve indicated, most of these figures 
that are on this spreadsheet were – I saw this for the first 
time last year.  If one does the calculation, it’s very easy 
for us to actually get those records to see exactly how 
10 
much was paid to BlackHead Consulting because that 
information is there, it’s there in bank accounts, it’s in our 
statements and I cannot verify right now whether it was 
R86million 
but 
that 
information 
is 
there. 
 
So, 
this 
R86million – so I don’t know Mr Mpambani arrived at this 
figures but I can certainly demonstrate that, bar, for the 
last payment, all the other payments that came in were 
subjected to minusing only these costs that I’m referring to 
here and then what then remained would have been shared 
equally. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, are you saying that the principle on 
which you and Mr Mpambani had agreed was that once the 
costs of the project had been deducted, the two of you, 
that is your companies would share the profits equally, 
that’s the first point? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 147 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   That’s correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Second point, are you saying that, as at 
the time when Mr Mpambani was preparing the spreadsheet 
that you and he talked about on a particular day when you 
were having another meeting, both of you knew what the 
costs of the project were, is that right? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct, Chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore, both of you knew that 
once those costs had been deducted from the value of the 
project then you would share the balance, equally? 
10 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right, are you also saying that, in terms 
of the money that came into BlackHead’s account, that 
money, if you leave out, for the time being the last 
payment, was in accordance with that agreement? 
MR SODI:   Absolutely correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying there was no amount – 
there was no money which appeared to have gone to 
anybody other than persons or entities that you were 
supposed to pay for as the JV? 
20 
MR SODI:   That’s absolutely correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s what you’re saying? 
MR SODI:   Ja and to add on to that, we have the JV 
account which shows the monies that – or the funds that 
went into the account.  The statements also indicate how 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 148 of 249 
 
much went into Diamond Hill and how much went into 
BlackHead and the statements also further indicate that 
the only other payments that occurred from the JV account 
are payments in relation to Master Trade as well as the 
other individuals that we paid, nothing more.  So, that’s 
why I’m saying, we can confidently present that information 
to say, X amount went into the JV, these are the expenses 
which we know, which I’ve spoken about, these are the 
expenses they were minused okay from whatever that was 
paid and the difference was then equally split into the two 
10 
entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course if, for argument sake, 
there were, what I would call illegal payments to be made, 
it is possible that the arrangement or understanding 
between the two partners could  be that, we have received 
money from a Government Department as a joint venture to 
the extent that there’s some people that we must pay and 
those payments are illegal payments, I will have my own 
you will have your own but I’ll give you – we’ll give you – 
we’ll deduct legitimate costs, if you know what I mean – 
20 
legal ones, legal ones, we’ll deduct those and then from 
the profit after the legal ones have been deducted we’ll 
give you your half, I’ll take my half but you must know that 
from your half you must take care of the illegal ones, is it 
conceptionally possible? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 149 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   No, it’s possible Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:   And can I, at this point, Chair, speak on my 
behalf and on behalf of BlackHead Consulting? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR SODI:   Because I certainly didn’t have access into 
Diamond Hill account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   But I can, categorically state that the funds 
that were paid into BlackHead Consulting, were funds that 
10 
were due to BlackHead Consulting, there’s no one else who 
was paid from the funds that went into our account, not a 
single individual.  So, if there were payments that were 
made elsewhere, I wouldn’t have known.  There’s certainly 
no payments or illegal payments that were paid from the JV 
because as much as I was the signatory to the account, I 
wasn’t the transactor but I had access to it, so I could 
monitor and see what was going on and to that extent, I 
can confidently say there’s no illegal payment that came 
from the JV account.  Equally so, there’s no illegal 
20 
payments that came from BlackHead, I don’t know about 
the other side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja well, the one part which you might 
help me understand is the part of the email that says, from 
Mr Mpambani to you that says, as I understand it at least, 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 150 of 249 
 
you must take care of certain payments, he will take care 
of certain payments. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, if those payments relate to the cost 
of the business why are they not being paid from the joint 
account? 
MR SODI:   I certainly didn’t pay attention to that email 
there…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see what I mean? 
MR SODI:   I see what you’re saying and I can understand 
10 
it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it’s legitimate costs of the business, 
there is a joint account, the principle you have agreed 
upon the two we pay the costs first and we share equally 
what remains.  There is a joint account there is no reason 
why the payment of those accounts should not happen from 
the joint account and then we – you share the two. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that when you receive your portion you 
do not have to pay anybody. 
20 
MR SODI:  No, no you are absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  You are absolutely – hence I am saying I did not 
pay attention to that email.  I probably read it in haste. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 151 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  But as I said I understood it to mean when he 
was talking about payment – payments in two batches was 
you know one payment going to Diamond Hill and the other 
payment going to Blackhead Consulting.  I certainly did not 
interrogate, did not – like I said I did not see the part where 
he says the one is highlighted in yellow must be paid by you 
and so forth.  I did not get into those details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because you see that email says: 
“Please note that payments highlighted in 
yellow are the ones you will take care of.” 
10 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
“And the rest us.” 
 
That is Mpambani, Mr Mpambani. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it say: 
“As discussed” 
 
That is what he is saying.   
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says he discussed it with you. 
20 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have affected the payments in two 
batches.  I may be wrong but I understand that to be – to be 
him saying as far as my ones are concerned, I have affected 
payments in two batches. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 152 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Kindly find attached the schedule. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  So Chair this particular email in particular 
this one I only started looking at it and reading it properly 
when 
we 
started 
having 
these 
interviews 
with 
the 
investigators.  Because I went back to my history of the 
emails and I realised the emails that – you know sometimes 
it happens.  Emails that come through that you ignore okay. 
It happens from time to time.  Others you probably maybe 
read the first line and you leave it there.  It just so happened 
10 
that this particular email I only got to interrogate and look at 
it only last year and had Mr Mpambani been alive last year I 
am sure I would have asked him, I said listen there is this 
particular email which is posing a challenge for me.  I did not 
look at it at the time but please explain what you meant?  
But already I mean unfortunately he was not there for me to 
be able to ask him that question.  But I acknowledge that I 
did not go through this email at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Two points before we go back to the 
20 
spread sheet.  You seem to have forgotten a payment to Mr 
Jimmy Tau which I think you have conceded that he was paid 
an amount of R3 million from the proceeds of the asbestos 
audit. 
MR SODI:  What I Chair – what I mentioned was Mr Tau was 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 153 of 249 
 
employed by Blackhead Consulting in the role of a business 
development consultant.  This happened just after he 
stopped playing so I know him for a number of years before 
that and when he stopped, he came to me he said, look I am 
no longer playing soccer and I want to get into business.  Of 
course, he was someone that – that I knew and I decided to 
appoint him as a business development consultant.  So his 
appointment was with Blackhead Consulting specifically.  
And when I – what I meant in my statement was that his 
payment – the payment that was due to him only got paid to 
10 
him once we received funds from the asbestos.  So I was in 
– I was in position of funds at the time from the – from the 
Asbestos Project.  But that payment is not related to – to his 
involvement in the Asbestos Project because he was never 
involved.  It just so happened that over a number of months I 
was not able to pay him because I was not in possession of 
funds.  So it was only when I started receiving payments that 
I started – I started paying him.  So it was an arrangement 
that we had you know.  It was specific that he would be paid 
a certain amount of money per month that was reduced in 
20 
writing.  We signed a contract to that effect and – and he 
was paid by Blackhead Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you mean that for some time before the 
asbestos money came in Blackhead was supposed to have 
paid him but did not pay him. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 154 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had not paid him? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it did not have … 
MR SODI:  Funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Enough money, is that right? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If one goes back to FS, 066 the cost 
of business schedule or the spread sheet as we have called 
10 
it today you will see half way down the column on the left-
hand side or just after half way the initials JT and R3 million. 
MR SODI:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Those initials reflect Jimmy Tau I 
think you have conceded? 
MR SODI:  Chair I – I said I assume I cannot confirm for 
sure.  I cannot with absolute conviction say that those 
initials refer to Jimmy Tau. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well perhaps you can Mr Sodi 
because the R3 million you have conceded was paid to him 
20 
from the proceeds of the income of the project. 
MR SODI:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So JT, Jimmy Tau or Mr JT was paid 
R3 million we know that.  Is it simply coincidence that Jimmy 
Tau is – those initials advocate to – who else? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 155 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  No, no I am saying that I cannot with absolute 
conviction say that because in any event Chair the purpose 
for the spread sheet and I will – I will just go back to this 
point slightly so that you know it is made clear.  The purpose 
for the spread sheet was to record the income and expenses 
of the Asbestos Project period.  Jimmy Tau was not involved 
in the Asbestos Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why was he recorded here then? 
MR SODI:  That is why I am saying I cannot with absolute 
conviction Chair say that refers to him.  It could be that Mr 
10 
Bombani knew and I think we – we probably had this 
discussion before that I had funds – I had owed Mr Jimmy 
Tau for the service that he had rendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  He knew that because – because we ultimately 
became acquaintances the three of us.  So he knew so – but 
– if why he would have recorded it here if you know if that 
was meant to him it is beyond me because the spread sheet 
we discussed was only supposed to refer to the expenses of 
the project. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – well this goes both to the question of 
you not knowing whether JT is Jimmy Tau or refers to Jimmy 
Tau.  Would you not know anybody who was going to be paid 
R3 million out of this partnership?  Could there be somebody 
who was going to be paid R3 million out of your partnership 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 156 of 249 
 
with Mr Mpambani and you do not know who that person is? 
MR SODI:  Absolutely – absolutely no Chair.  Hence I am 
saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would know everybody that was going 
to … 
MR SODI:  I would know everybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Hence I am saying that it is you know – when I 
was presented with this spread sheet last year and I am 
looking at it I am like but you know I cannot with authority 
10 
verify what is in this spread sheet.  I cannot because there 
are some things that makes sense in the spread sheet and 
there are some things that just do not make sense at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but you did say that the purpose of 
the spread sheet was to – to – was to identify the costs that 
would be paid by the business – the Joint Venture.  That it 
was going to be paid out of the Asbestos money basically. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And in that email that we referred to 
earlier Mr Mpambani says – it refers to a discussion between 
the two of you about payments.  You remember that? 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It just seems strange that he would 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 157 of 249 
 
write people to be paid on this – on such a spread sheet 
down for the purpose that you have told me about. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But people that you do not know. 
MR SODI:  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you are a partner in the business. 
MR SODI:  That is precisely the point Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Especially if it is not very small amounts. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe R3 million is not such a big amount. 
10 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To certain business people. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it just seems to me that he would write 
– he would write in the spread sheet information or names of 
people that he knew you would know.  Because otherwise 
what was the point?  Because the point of the spread sheet 
as you indicate it was for both of you.  You had to 
understand who is going to be paid what so that you are able 
to say, the total costs comes to so much.  So our profit is so 
20 
much and I will get 50% of that. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously if he is going to write 
something that you do not know you are going to say, but 
who is this?   
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 158 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  That is precisely what I have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And here if JT is not Jimmy Tau it is 
strange that – it would be strange that that is so when you 
say there is R3 million that you owed Jimmy Tau and you 
paid and here we have got JT and we have got R3 million. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  I have – Sir – Chair I have actually – his fees 
came to more than R3 million.  It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR SODI:  It came to more than R3 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SODI:  But Chair the point I am making here is the first 
time I got to be made aware of this spread sheet was last 
year 
in 
2019 
when 
it 
was 
presented 
to 
me 
by 
the 
investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  That was the first time.  It is just unfortunate that 
the person who offered was not there because I would have 
said to him, Mr Mpambani I see this spread sheet that you 
prepared please take me through so I can understand what 
you meant by the entries that are reflected on this particular 
20 
spread sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the spread sheet that the two of you 
spoke about on the particular day. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said you were having a meeting. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 159 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On that day – another meeting. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he never present it to you, this one? 
MR SODI:  No.  No Chair he did not.  So we discussed – so 
we met and we said okay fine this is going to be the 
revenue.  So we know what the revenue is going to be 
because it is – you know it was – it was given okay.  We 
knew how much Master Trade was going to be paid.  Okay.  
We knew how much Master Trade was going to be paid and 
10 
so forth and so forth.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  And those are the expenses.  Those are the only 
expenses that we discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  So when I left him to you know to prepare it when 
I went into another meeting it was on the understanding that 
it was going to capture the conversation and the discussion 
that we had.  As it turned out when he left he said, look I 
have emailed it to myself because I am going to do more 
20 
work on it.  I did not read much into that as to what more 
work he could have been referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  So I left it there.  Okay.  And that was it until – 
until last year when I was presented with this. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 160 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as I understand it the day on which you 
were speaking you had a conversation with him about a 
spread sheet and the day when he was preparing a spread 
sheet in your office was in 2014 or was it 2015? 
MR SODI:  I think it was – I think it was 2014.  I think it was 
2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014? 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
MR SODI:  I cannot recall the exact dates but I think it was 
10 
2014 ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  And he passed away – he passed 
on in 2017 – 2016? 
MR SODI:  2017 I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2017. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so are you saying that – or over a 
year maybe even two years you never asked him about the 
20 
spread sheet that he was supposed to produce? 
MR SODI:  No because the information – like I said the 
information was – it was pretty straight forward in terms of 
what expenses we were going to incur.  It was lengthy where 
you know for instance I would have said, you know what I 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 161 of 249 
 
have to go through item by item and look at the amounts.  It 
was pretty straight forward.  The biggest costs Chair was for 
the sub-contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The sub-contractor. 
MR SODI:  And the other ones were small amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – but is your answer yes I never 
asked him? 
MR SODI:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Sodi I would have thought that if 
10 
Mr Mpambani of the Joint Venture was tasked to prepare the 
spread sheet or the document which showed the expenses of 
the business which would have to be deducted before you 
could receive your profit that you would be interested at the 
very least in that document and its accuracy? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair it was… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because we are talking tens of 
millions of rand here. 
MR SODI:  We talking a lot of money but we talking Chair 
maybe 
three 
lines 
items 
as 
expenses. 
 
So 
I 
could 
20 
immediately calculate on top of my head that if the cost and 
the expenses are amounting to R49 or R48 million if you 
minus that from the total revenue this is the amount that 
would be left so it was not a complicated exercise at all you 
know to make that sort of determination. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 162 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why would you need a spread sheet 
then?  Why did you need a spread sheet then? 
MR SODI:  Because Chair we need to make sure that the 
amounts are recorded okay and we keep that as a record you 
know that – it has to be recorded somewhere that was the 
feeling that we have got to record that elsewhere to know 
that these are the amounts that must be paid.  So that come 
– when it comes to payment you know of those sub-
contractors then we know exactly how much must be paid.  
So that was really the purpose. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is why Mr Pretorius says and I 
think you agree one would expect that you would be 
interested to check that document to see whether Mr 
Mpambani has correctly recorded the position.  Because you 
intend to use it for the future. 
MR SODI:  Correct Sir especially for payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But what is extraordinary quite 
frankly – let me try and maintain the level of politeness that 
20 
we have maintained thus far Mr Sodi.  
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is quite simply extraordinary is 
that a businessman dealing with a contract worth R255 
million would not want to see the record.  You have 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 163 of 249 
 
acknowledged now that it is important to have these matters 
recorded accurately and you do not want to see it.  And the 
first time you see it is several years later when investigators 
come and visit.   
MR SODI:  Chair again as I have indicated it was not 
something that was difficult to calculate at all and that is why 
for me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is assuming. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the spread sheet he – Mr Mpambani 
10 
prepared was in accordance with your understanding. 
MR SODI:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is assuming. 
MR SODI:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That if you see the spread sheet you do 
not know whether that is what he has done. 
MR SODI:  Yes Chair.  The – the assumption was that what 
was going to be recorded is the discussion that we had about 
those expenses and the revenue and so forth okay.  And I 
already knew even before I went into my meeting, I already 
20 
knew that we have got a quotation from Master Trade which 
was a certain amount.  We knew how much we were going to 
pay Martin and we knew how much we were going to pay 
Steve.  So it was – it was a simple thing.  It was not difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is important to see whether that is 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 164 of 249 
 
what Mr Mpambani has recorded because if he had recorded 
something different you want to take it up with him. 
MR SODI:  So how I checked that Chair was through – when 
the payments were made.  So when the client paid, I made 
sure that in accordance to what he have discussed that 
those expenses are indeed paid to Master Trade and the two 
gentlemen that we are referring to.  And that happened and – 
so beyond that it was not a – it was not an issue for me 
because most of those payments were actually you know 
paid. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well in – in our view the more 
probable version might appear in the transcript of your 
interview and in your statement.  At paragraph 39.25 on Free 
State 1 – FS1, 399 you say: 
“With the benefit of hindsight, I should have 
asked Mpambani about the letters and or 
names that appear on the spread sheet but 
at the time I did not do that.” 
 
That statement presumes or assumes rather that you 
20 
saw the spread sheet at the time but you did not ask 
Mpambani about the letters or names that appear on it. 
MR SODI:  Chair what I acknowledged are two things.  I 
acknowledged that there was a spread sheet that we 
discussed.  The contents of what ultimately came out is 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 165 of 249 
 
different to what we agreed on.  I also acknowledge that 
there is a spread sheet that was emailed to me okay but 
further to that I also acknowledge that I should have with the 
benefit of hindsight I should have opened the spread sheet 
and interrogated it.  Which is something that I did not do 
because had I done that then I would have been able to say, 
but hang on his is not what we discussed.  There seems to 
be other entries on this spread sheet which I am not aware 
of.  Do you mind to take me through these entries so that I 
can understand what it is all about?  And that is what I 
10 
meant by that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well my understanding of the 
instruction – or the advice from the investigators is that what 
was sent to you by Mr Mpambani together with those emails 
that we have discussed the draft one and the other one that 
talked about items marked in yellow the spread sheet was 
attached. You have just confirmed that. 
MR SODI:  That is what I am saying Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Are you seriously saying as a 
businessman you did not look at that spread sheet at the 
20 
time? 
MR SODI:  Chair I did not look at it.  I am submitting – 
making a submission that I did not go through that spread 
sheet at all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Quite frankly that is infallible.  That a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 166 of 249 
 
businessman who is dealing with now profits of hundreds of 
millions of rand for the Joint Venture does not look at the 
very document his partner has prepared showing that profit 
and what has to be deducted from the income. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Chair the simple answer to that and I do not 
want to keep repeating the same point.  The simple answer 
to that Chair was that the spread sheet according to my 
understanding and according to the discussion that we had 
was a fairly simply document okay.  The entries was 
probably three or four entries and we knew what those 
10 
entries were and the amounts.  So if it was a lengthy 
document for instance Chair that had a number of entries I 
am sure that I would have gone through it and interrogated it 
but I knew that look the highest amount that we are going to 
pay if Master Trade and there is one or two amounts.  So I 
left it there but you know – and that is what I said in 
hindsight with the benefit of hindsight I should have opened 
it and looked at it but I said I already know.  So when it came 
through, 
I 
am 
like 
I 
already 
know. 
 These 
are 
the 
assumptions that I made but I already know what it contains.  
20 
I already know the figures so it is pointless for me to look at 
it. And you know it happens that sometimes like I said you do 
go through some emails, sometimes you do not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well in paragraph 39.25 you do not 
say with the benefit of hindsight I should have looked at the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 167 of 249 
 
spread sheet.  You say with the benefit of hindsight I should 
have asked Mpambani about the letters and or names that 
appear on the spread sheet but at the time I did not do that.  
So your omission there was not to discuss the letters or 
names on the spread sheet not an omission of not looking at 
the spread sheet at all. 
MR SODI:  Chair the correct version that I am submitting to 
the court – to the commission is that I did not look at the 
spread sheet and what I meant was that with the benefit of 
hindsight I should have opened the spread sheet.  I should 
10 
have opened the email because had I done so then I would 
have been in a better position to go through it and 
interrogate it and get answers from Mr Mpambani.  And that 
is Chair the correct version. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us look what you said in your 
interview with the investigators and if I may refer you to Free 
State 6 – FS6 at 332.  Exercise is now permitted.   
MR SODI:  What page is that Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  332 FS6.  Here you discussing the 
email about which we talking and the spread sheet with the 
20 
investigators and if you want to take a chance to familiarise 
yourself with the context I am sure you should do so but let 
me first put to you at the bottom of page 332 of FS6 where 
against your name the following appears. 
“Yes an email was sent to me.  Okay it was 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 168 of 249 
 
sent to me and all that I noticed was that 
these payments that we made and I noticed 
that there was payment that came into my 
account and I was happy with that and that is 
where it ended.” 
 
And then you later say you never discussed that with 
him between that time and the time he unfortunately passed 
away.  But that statement is much clearer.  That you looked 
at the spread sheet.  You noticed the payments on the 
spread sheet and you were happy with the contents. 
10 
MR SODI:  Chair again I acknowledge that I received the 
spread sheet but I did not go through the spread – I did not 
interrogate it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, no, no.  Sorry let me – let me not 
interrupt. 
MR SODI:  Okay.  That there was a payment that came into 
my – into my account and that was payment which was the 
50% share you know of what was due to Blackhead 
Consulting.  But the actual spread sheet itself I did not go 
through it as I have stated. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well Mr Sodi there is a big difference 
between not looking at the spread sheet at all which is the 
impression you have given us. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And not interrogating what you see 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 169 of 249 
 
on the spread sheet.  Which was it? 
MR SODI:  I am saying that I – the email came through Chair 
and I could see the email had a spread sheet so I saw the 
spread sheet.  You can see when the email has an 
attachment and that is what I noticed okay.  But there was a 
spread sheet attached to the email – it was an Excel spread 
sheet but I did not open the spread sheet at all.  And this is 
what I am referring to here that in retrospect I should have 
opened it because had I done so then I would have been 
empowered to say, but hold on there is this spread sheet 
10 
which is different to the spread sheet that we discussed.  
And at the point in time I would have been able to then you 
know have a discussion with Mr Mpambani and say, please 
explain what you mean by this you know.  So that did not 
happen because I did not open it and I did not go through it.  
But I saw it as an attachment.  That is what I am referring to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But what you say here on page 332 
Mr Sodi is:  
“Yes the email was sent to me.  Okay it was 
sent to me and all that I noticed was that 
20 
there 
was 
payment 
that 
came 
into 
my 
account and I was happy with that.” 
 
The clear import of what you are saying here is that 
you looked at the spread sheet, you noticed certain things 
and you moved on. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 170 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Chair that is – that is – that is not entirely 
correct.  I again point that the email came through from Mr 
Mpambani with the spread sheet okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Sodi. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you respond to that question. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just bear that in mind – just bear in mind 
that Mr Pretorius is not necessarily – Mr Pretorius’ question 
is not necessarily talking to what actually happened.  He is 
10 
talking to what the import is of what you said to the 
investigators when they were talking to you. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words when you look at what is 
reflected here. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it mean what he says it means?  That 
is the question.  So he is inviting your comment to that. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to where – what actually 
happened. 
MR SODI:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course, when he gives that meaning 
to this he means that is what probably happens because that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 171 of 249 
 
is what you are saying.  But your answer must talk to what is 
the meaning of what you said to the investigators? 
MR SODI:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You can deal with it.  If you want him 
to repeat the question? 
MR SODI:  Maybe he should. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he is saying to you. 
MR SODI:  Ja so that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he is saying to you, his understanding 
of what you are saying here or he is saying what you said to 
10 
the investigators is ABC and you must say I agree that is 
what I said or I do not agree that is not what it means or 
what I said here. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I am going to have to find the 
page again I apologise.  Page 332 you say Mr Sodi: 
“Yes the email was sent to me.  Okay it was 
sent to me.  All that I noticed was that these 
payments that we were make – that we made 
20 
and I noticed that there was payment that 
came into my account and I was happy with 
that and that is where it ended.” 
 
The clear import of what is said here and bear in 
mind what the Chair has just pointed out is that you looked 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 172 of 249 
 
at the spread sheet and you noticed certain things on the 
spread sheet. 
MR SODI:  No Chair that is not what I – what I meant by this 
statement.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja.  Well let us – do you concede that 
what you said was that you noticed certain things on the 
spread sheet?  Let aside what you might have had by way of 
mental reservation. 
MR SODI:  What I am saying in this statement is that the 
spread sheet was attached to the email and I did not open or 
10 
go through the details of the spread sheet but I also noticed 
there was amount that was paid into the Blackhead account 
that would be in accordance with the agreement of the JV 
that we had.  And that is what I meant simply by this 
statement Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius we are at four minutes – what 
five minutes past four let us talk about the way forward.  I 
am quite happy to sit further.  What would you like to see? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well Chair it would be useful for the 
20 
purposes of the investigation whether that investigation 
ultimately involves the Free State Department or Mr Sodi or 
the late Mr Mpambani and his composition of the spread 
sheet for us to accept the offer of Mr Sodi and ask him to 
produce his books for the period and his tax returns so that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 173 of 249 
 
we can interrogate those and he nods and he is quite willing 
to do that.  It is quite important to give Mr Sodi full extent of 
his offered cooperation so that we can deal with this 
thoroughly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What does that say to the question of 
the way forward today? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well I am – I know that these records 
are some years back but they should not be too long to get 
hold of and we could come back in a few days’ time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your suggestion that we should stop 
10 
for today and he – arrangements be made for him to come 
back some other time after that further investigation has 
been done or is the – is your suggestion that we continue 
and cover whatever else we can cover today and then when 
he comes back we deal with whatever arises from the further 
investigation or what is your suggestion? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well I do not want to traverse the 
same territory twice and we will traverse the financial 
aspects at a later stage.  There are other matters I can 
proceed with for an hour or so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Sodi from your side you are 
quite happy that we continue for another hour? 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR SODI:  I am happy with that Chair. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 174 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your Counsel has no problem?  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  He fully cooperates and to 
proceed for another hour there is no issue in that regard.  
We did anticipate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  The only issue that we do have is 
we will cooperate fully with providing the documents we just 
need some assurance of confidentiality because it is the tax 
returns and I think it does extend very wide.  There is full 
cooperation but as long as we are assured confidentiality 
10 
there is full cooperation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  We are going to 
then continue but I think we should take a small break and 
then come back.  Let us take a break it is about seven 
minutes past four.  Shall we come back at twenty past four?  
We will adjourn.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will continue until about twenty five 
past five.  Okay thank you.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Let us go back 
please Mr Sodi to FS8 page 66.   
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 175 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You were asked about the contents of 
this spreadsheet by the investigators at your first interview 
with them or your only interview with them. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that interview, did it take place 
before 
you 
told 
about 
the 
investigations 
that 
the 
investigators had done in regard to the payment to Mr Zulu 
and in regard to the joint investment with Mr Mokhesi? 
MR SODI:  Sorry, Mr Pretorius can you just repeat the 
10 
questions.  I am not sure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You had the interview with them, the 
investigators. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At that stage, they did not put to you 
the fruits of their investigation in regard to the payment to Mr 
Zulu or the payment for his benefit, Mr Zulu’s benefit, the 
payment to the motor deal in Natal, Kwazulu Natal?  At that 
stage, that has not been to put to you? 
MR SODI:  I cannot remember sir.  I cannot remember that. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And at that stage too and I think it is 
apparent from the documentation - and we can show it if 
necessary – at that stage too the information obtained by the 
investigators about the venture, the property investment, the 
joint property investment with Mr Mokhesi, that had not been 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 176 of 249 
 
put to you when you first interviewed? 
MR SODI:  I can also not recall it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, let us just look please at the 
initials in the first column of the spreadsheet on FS8 page 
66.  Have a look at those. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know from your evidence so far – 
and I am talking about the evidence that you have given here 
– that the involvement of Mr Thabane Zulu was necessary for 
this Asbestos Project to get off the ground.  He dealt with the 
10 
budget issues and he also dealt with certain procurement 
issues.  We know that.  
MR SODI:  Chair, I am not sure about Mr Zulu’s involvement 
in procurement issues but from the evidence that he 
presented here, it is apparent that his involvement was 
limited to the budget issues for the Free State Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The suggestion that Mr Pretorius is putting 
to you is whether one calls that involvement of Mr Zulu, 
limited or not, that it was necessary in order for this project 
to happen.  Do you want to comment on that? 
20 
 
In other words, without that involvement, limited as it 
may have been, the project might not have gone ahead. 
MR SODI:  Ja, from the evidence that was presented here, I 
would say that it was necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja, okay. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 177 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because he needed to approve the 
budget adjustment. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know that Mr Thabane Mokhesi’s 
involvement was necessary because he approved the budget 
...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  That is correct.  He was the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...as the head of the department. 
MR SODI:  He was the head of the department, ja.  And 
ultimately, the accounting officer in that department. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You had engaged with both of them.  
you correspondent with Mr Zulu.  You knew who he was. 
MR SODI:  I knew who he was.  Do you want to clarify when 
you say I correspondent with him?  What do you mean by 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe Mr Pretorius, at what stage are 
you talking about.  
MR SODI:  Correct.  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, if we go to FS8 page 110 about 
a letter addressed to yourself to Mr Zulu dated 7 April 2014. 
20 
MR SODI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It deals with the procurement issue 
or deals with the contractual issue. 
MR SODI:  Ja, but can I just explain sir so that we are on the 
same page?  This letter was addressed to Blackhead 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 178 of 249 
 
Consultant for successfully being appointed onto the panel 
of the National Department of Human Settlements.  So it has 
got absolutely nothing to do with the Free State.  It has got 
everything to do with the panel for national.  That is what it 
is meant for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, but the only point that I am 
making at this stage in relation to that letter is that you knew 
who Mr Thabane Zulu was. 
MR SODI:  Chair, I knew Mr Thabane Zulu long before these 
10 
letters were exchanged in a personal capacity.  So I knew 
who he was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you knew that he was involved in 
arranging for the release of funds, the budgetary issue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you talked about when, at what stage 
Mr Pretorius?  When it was dated? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In 2014. 
MR SODI:  Ja, I was not, Chair, aware of what Mr Zulu’s role 
was going to be.  You would recall that I have indicated that 
my involvement at the beginning was to submit a proposal. 
20 
 
And Chair, you would also recall that I also mentioned in 
this Commission that Mr Bombane’s role was to engage with 
the relevant people and officials in the Free State. 
 
Now it was only much, much later that I got to know that 
the process that would have to be undertaken to make the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 179 of 249 
 
budget available would include, amongst other things, a 
revision of the business plan by the Department of Human 
Settlements in the Free State, which business plan had to be 
approved by the DG, National DG. 
 
So in that context I knew that his role was to make sure 
that it gets approved but also to make sure that, you know, 
the funding becomes available.   
 
But at the beginning when we were doing the exchanges, 
I, you know, I was not familiar with the mechanics of how 
these things were going to happen because I left that role 
10 
specifically to Mr Bombane who was running it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you would have come to know, 
on your version Mr Sodi, of Mr Zulu’s involvement in 
2015/2016 because you just said that you came to learn 
...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  No, no.  I... it was probably 2014 still that I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was still 20104? 
MR SODI:  Ja, it was still 2014. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So as early as 2014 you 
knew that? 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we know – and we will deal with 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 180 of 249 
 
it in a moment – the payment made to a motor dealer to pay 
for a deposit on a car to Mr Thabane Zulu that he bought 
there. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you had all this knowledge at the 
time you were interviewed by the investigators? 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Although you did not know that the 
investigators knew about the payment to the motor dealer 
...[indistinct] told you they had time to ...[indistinct]  
10 
MR SODI:  Well, Chair, you know, I dealt with the questions 
that were posed to me by the investigators and as far as I 
am 
concerned, 
I 
have 
dealt 
with 
those 
questions 
comprehensively.   
 
There may have been gaps here and there but I certainly 
did not do anything to conceal whatever information that may 
have been beneficial for the Commission.  Whatever was 
posed to me, I responded. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  When they asked you about the 
contents of the spreadsheet and they have asked you about 
20 
the initials KZ, you expressed complete ignorance of it.  You 
said you had no knowledge of who that could be. 
MR SODI:  Well, Chair.  And I have said this earlier as well.  
I cannot with absolute conviction Chair confirm or make a 
speculation and reduce that into a fact to say that this initial 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 181 of 249 
 
refers to so and so especially because I was not the author 
of this spreadsheet.  
 
I can... we can probabilities to say, “Well, it is probable 
that this initial can be so and so”.  But I cannot, you know, 
put my head on the block Chair and say definitely this initial 
refers to Mr Thabane Zulu.  That is basically what I said, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, fair enough Mr Sodi.  I do not 
think anybody in that interview asked you to put your head 
on a block or say anything with absolute certainty.  They 
merely asked you about those initials. 
10 
 
What you did not do was say, “Well, it could be Thabane 
Zulu.  I know he was involved in the project.  It could be 
Thabane Zulu because I know I made him a payment.” 
MR SODI:  Chair ...[indistinct]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, let me just complete.  Your 
answer was not full and frank.  It was a simple bear denial of 
any knowledge.  Correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair.  I did not want to speculate 
on the initials.  I think Chair you would understand, that 
would have been a grave mistake because if I speculate on 
20 
initials and it turns out that, you know, the speculation is 
incorrect, I would have misled the Commission.   
 
I would have given them incorrect information.  More so 
because I was not involved in putting together.  So it would 
have been difficult.   
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 182 of 249 
 
 
If it was a full name I would have said definitely, I think, 
this I can say that person refers, you know, that name refers 
to this person but it is initials that are on the spreadsheet.   
 
And one can make assumptions, you know.  But to 
absolutely say yes this is so and so, Chair, you know, it 
would have been difficult for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand it, there was a transaction 
in respect of which you used the initials TZ.  
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You referred to Mr Zulu.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it would appear, therefore, if one 
looks at that fact and the fact that in a spreadsheet that your 
partner, Mr Bombane meant for both of you, you used the 
initials... he also used the initials TZ, it seems likely that the 
two of you could have been talking about the same TZ here.  
I am saying likely. 
MR SODI:  It is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not saying certainly. 
MR SODI:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would accept that? 
MR SODI:  I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there another person with those initials 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 183 of 249 
 
that you know both of you knew? 
MR SODI:  Not that I know of Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The only person with those initials 
that both of you knew is Mr Zulu. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well, when asked about it – 
and I am referring to FS6 page 325 in your interview with the 
investigators – you were asked a question: 
“TZ.  Who is TZ?” 
10 
 
And your answer was quite straightforward Mr Sodi: 
“I have no idea.” 
 
You were asked again: 
“You have got no idea?” 
 
Mr Sodi:  “No.” 
“TZ.  Who is TZ?” 
“I have no idea”. 
 
So the answer was, as you like to put it absolute.  You 
did put your head on a block and say, “I have no idea”.  But 
you did have an idea. 
20 
MR SODI:  Chair, I was avoiding making speculative answers 
to very specific questions that were posed to me and that is 
how I answered it.  That I could not make... give a 
speculative answer that I did not that indeed that initials or 
those initials rather refer to the same person that I also 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 184 of 249 
 
happen to know as TZ. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, at the very least, I think you 
clearly conceded that it was within your knowledge and 
capacity at that stage to assist the investigators by telling 
them about your involvement, Mr Zulu’s involvement in the 
project and the payment you made to Mr Zulu. 
MR SODI:  What is the question again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You could have said that at that 
stage. 
MR SODI:  Yes ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You could have said, “I cannot be 
certain.  I do not want to speculate but to assist you, I can 
tell you these things”. 
MR SODI:  If my memory serves me well, I seem to recall 
that I could have mentioned, you know, we can look at the 
transcript that Mr Thabane Zulu was a DG at National.   
 
You know, I could have said that he was a DG because I 
knew that he was a Director General at the National 
Department of Human Settlements. 
 
But I would have answered questions that were posed to 
20 
me and I would have given specific answers to those 
particular questions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, we can argue semantics for a 
long time Mr Sodi. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 185 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But at that time, you knew a person 
with the initials TZ.  You knew a person with the initials TZ 
who had been involved in facilitating the project.  And you 
knew a person with the initials TZ to whom you made 
payment.   
MR SODI:  That is correct sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Your answer, however in the 
interview was:  “I have no idea.” 
MR SODI:  Because the question that was posed to me Chair 
was:  “Do you know who is TZ?”  And based on the 
10 
spreadsheet that was presented to me, which as I have 
indicated, I was seeing for the very first time.   
 
Now I did not want to speculate that the TZ that was on 
the spreadsheet with an amount next to it definitely referred 
to the TZ that I knew to the Director General of the 
Department of Human Settlements. 
 
And I was responding to that question in that context.  
And if maybe the question was posed to me to say, you 
know, or maybe an additional question to say, “Do you know 
anyone who has the similar initials as TZ?”  I would have 
20 
said yes. 
 
I would have confidently said, “Yes, I know a person who 
has got those initials.”  But that question was not posed to 
me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, you were asked later in the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 186 of 249 
 
interview but the bottom line is it cannot perhaps be 
Thabane Zulu.  You say, “I do not know.  I do not want to 
make speculations.”  You have confirmed that now. 
MR SODI:  That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But you insisted you have no idea.  A 
simple proposition I want to put to you is that there was 
much more information you had about the person called TZ 
involvement in the project, recipient of payment that you 
could have given at that stage. 
MR SODI:  I... Chair, I take that, you know.  Sometimes when 
10 
these kind of situations where, you know, where questions 
are posed, you want to be as honest as you can and answer 
the questions and, you know, not be all over the place.   
 
And end up answering things that you should be 
answering to.  So I was assisting the Commission and the 
investigators in dealing precisely with the questions that they 
have posed to me.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  TM, the next name on the list.  You 
knew Mr Mokhesi as Tim Mokhesi.  We have established 
that.   
20 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Again, you said you had absolutely 
no idea of... well, you did not say absolutely.  You said, “I 
have no idea in relation to who TM was.  But again we know 
he was involved in the project. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 187 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  His involvement was necessary in 
order to bring about the project.   
MR SODI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And he entered into a joint venture 
property investment with you, on your version, after the 
conclusion of the project. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Again, information which you knew at 
the time and could have given to the investigators. 
10 
MR SODI:  Again Chair, I dealt specifically with the 
questions that were posed to me and I was not evasive in 
responding to those questions.  I responded to those 
questions. 
 
And that is how the process went.  I was... and I 
cooperated fully and I gave them as much information as I 
could based on the questions that they have asked me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  AM, could you have guessed who that 
was? 
MR SODI:  Absolutely not sir. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You knew who the premier was at the 
time. 
MR SODI:  I knew who the premier was but I... Chair, I was 
not going to again start speculating that AM refers to the 
premier. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 188 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We do not have any evidence that he 
was directly involved in the project although there is other 
evidence that he gave instructions that all procurement 
issues were to be send to his office but that is not something 
that concerns you for the moment.  OM.  Did you know an 
Ollie Mamale? 
MR SODI:  Not at all Chair.  I do not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  MEC.  Could you guess what that 
stood for? 
MR SODI:  Absolutely not Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Member of the Executive Council. 
MR SODI:  It could mean that Chair.  I do not know whether 
it is an initial for someone’s, you know, names or whether it 
actually refers to what Mr Pretorius is alluding to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And just at the bottom above 
2013/2014, Diedericks.  You knew a person called Diedericks 
and you knew that Diedericks had some involvement with the 
procurement aspects of the project.  Correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  The Diedericks that I knew was 
the acting HOD of the Department of Human Settlements in 
20 
Gauteng, 
whose 
role 
was 
limited 
to 
confirming 
that 
Blackhead Consulting was indeed part of the PRT panel in 
Gauteng. 
 
And that is evidence by the letter that we have dealt with 
that was sent to the Department of Human Settlements.  So 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 189 of 249 
 
to call it involvement in procurement, I think would be over-
reaching. 
 
I would not say that she was involved in procurement but 
rather just mere confirmation that this company that you are 
referring to Mr Mokhesi is indeed and that is what happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, perhaps my shorthand can be 
subject to that comment.  I accept that.  But we know the 
extent of her involvement.  We have traversed it in full in 
evidence. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just to clear up something.  I thought 
at some stage the evidence was that the permission of the 
Gauteng Department of Human Settlements was required by 
the Free State Department of Human Settlements for that 
department to so to speak participate in the Gauteng 
contract to the extent that it what was contemplated to be 
done.  Is that not your understanding? 
MR SODI:  Well, Chair I would not call it permission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  What happened in this case was a request to 
20 
confirm.  You know, it was:  Can you confirm that this entity 
has done work in your department or is on our panel? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Okay. 
MR SODI:  So that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Confirmation. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 190 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  She is a confirmation.  Ja, that was sought. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, we can get the letter out but 
again, give permission, it is a semantic debate.  The law 
required her to authorise the participation in the contract by 
Free State and the Gauteng contract. 
 
Of course, we also know that none of these efforts and 
participation 
actually 
resulted 
in 
a 
lawful 
and 
proper 
participation but that is a legal argument again which I will 
spare you. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is it coincidence then that at least as 
far as TZ, TM and Diedericks are concerned that they are all 
people who had, to some degree or another, an involvement 
in the facilitation of the contract with the Joint Venture?  A 
mere coincidence?  You could not have put two and two 
together? 
MR SODI:  I mean, it is the quantum.  But again, I would not 
want to speak with authority on a document that I had not 
role in drafting.   
 
But I, you know, I hear what you are saying that there is 
20 
a coincidence there but there is a name there and the initials 
and these initials, they appear to be similar to initials of 
people that are involved in the process. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  They are not similar.  They are 
exactly the same initials.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 191 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Correct 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Had you seen this at the time 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Let me take that 
one step further. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got TM.  Okay, I have got two TZ.  
No full name is given, just the initials. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got TM.  NO full name is given, 
10 
just the initials.  We leave out AM and OM and MEC.  And 
then you have got Diedericks.  Just a surname is given, no 
name. 
MR SODI:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the chances that it is just mere 
coincidence?  Not a single one of these initials TZ and TM 
and Diedericks, not a single of these initials and its name, 
the surname refers to the people who each had such an 
important role in this project. 
MR SODI:  Thank you for the question Chair.  You will recall 
20 
that I mentioned here that if I had gone through this when it 
was sent to me I would have been inquisitive.  I would 
have called Mr Mpambani and said Mr Mpambani, I want to 
understand what is going on here and I am sure that he 
would have given me some explanation because he offered 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 192 of 249 
 
the document.  I am sure he would have explained, I am 
sure he would have some explanation but as it turned out, 
it never happened and only later on when I received the 
spreadsheet, I then said but what is going on here?   But 
then it was too late because Mr Mpambani was no more.  
So I did not have the opportunity to then go to him and say 
listen, I am seeing the spreadsheets and it has got entries 
which I do not understand, can you explain what they 
mean, you know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I take what you say, what you have 
10 
just said, as meaning that if you had seen these names – if 
you had seen the spreadsheet and seen this initials, TZ, 
TM and Diedericks, that in your mind you would have 
thought of Mr Thabane Zulu, Mr Mokhesi and Diedericks, 
that does not mean necessarily it would be them. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Because 
they 
were 
important 
role 
players, that that is what probably would have come to 
your mind and you would have asked him …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Absolutely and I would have wanted him to 
20 
verify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SODI:   You know, to say please verify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Because I can make speculations. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 193 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SODI:   But seeing that you are the one who offered 
this, can you please verify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   You know and then he would have been able to 
do that, I suppose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   But also, the other problem – sorry, Chair, the 
other I suppose question that I would have asked was but 
why all these amounts for these people?  Why – what do 
10 
these amounts mean?  You know, I would have asked that 
question, you know?  And I am sure he would have given 
me an answer and not that I would have agreed to the 
answer that he would have given me but I would have 
wanted to know, what do these amounts mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   You know?   
CHAIRPERSON:   And, of course, what one notices is that 
on the spreadsheet some names are written clearly, you 
know who they are talking about, they refer to, and then 
20 
these particular ones, it is just initials and in regard to 
Diedericks, it is just a surname.  But why is the full name 
not written just like Master Trade – well, there is Martin, 
there is Rampa, but the full names are written, but why are 
these TZ, TM, OM, AM, why are they are not – why is there 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 194 of 249 
 
no transparency about them? 
MR SODI:   Correct, Chair, and that is one of the questions 
that I would have asked.  I would have asked him, you 
know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they happen – at least the initials 
that I have thought about, TZ, TM and then of course 
Diedericks, we know that on the project that happen to 
have important roles to play and initials that coincide with 
their initials are written, not the full name. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no transparency about who 
these people are. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SODI:   And, Chair, but also, there are other initials 
here that we do not know who they refer to and next to 
them these amounts and I battle to understand what role 
they would have played in the project, you know?  And that 
is what created difficulty for me, to say if you have got any 
fee, you have got – but what role did they play, you know, I 
20 
– and that is what makes it difficult for me to understand, 
you know why this would have been drafted with those kind 
of amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  We know that in March 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 195 of 249 
 
2015 – well, let us just summarise from the beginning, we 
know that you had a conversation with Mr Mpambani and 
his job was to create a spreadsheet showing all the 
expenses of the business. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Particularly the asbestos project. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know that he went away and 
did that on your computer or he stayed and did that on 
your computer. 
10 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He later in March sent you - March 
2015 sent you and email referring to the spreadsheet with 
a spreadsheet attached. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You knew that attached to those 
emails was a spreadsheet. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Your evidence in your statement 
and in your interview at the lowest seems to suggest that 
20 
you looked at the spreadsheet.  I would submit that it 
clearly says you looked at the spreadsheet.  Your evidence 
today says you did not look at the spreadsheet. 
MR SODI:   No, the evidence that I am putting to the 
Commission 
today 
is 
that 
I 
did 
not 
look 
at 
the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 196 of 249 
 
spreadsheets. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, firstly, I would suggest to 
you, Mr Sodi, that it is improbable that that very document 
which contains the income, your expenses and your profit 
would not be scrutinised by you. 
MR SODI:   Chair, remember I have already stated that 
before Mr Mpambani put the figures that we had already 
discussed in a spreadsheet.  That conversation had 
already taken place prior to him reducing it in writing on a 
spreadsheet.  So I knew – so it was not something that was 
10 
unknown to me, actually, I knew what – as I have indicated, 
were the total revenue of the project was going to be and I 
also knew what the costs were going to be.   
So to answer Mr Pretorius’ question that it is 
improbable, I deny that because I knew upfront what the 
expenses of the project were.  So I did not see it as being 
absolutely necessary to go through it because already we 
had discussed and I knew exactly how much it was going to 
be. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Had you looked at it – I persist 
20 
with the probability that you did look at it – you would have 
seen, as the Chair has pointed out, a list of initials and 
then some names.  The legitimate payments, the names 
are in full and the payments where there are initials, had 
nothing to do with the conduct of the business.  If these 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 197 of 249 
 
payments were to be made. 
MR SODI:   Had I looked at it, Chair, I would have asked 
Mr Mpambani questions about it, had I looked at the 
spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as you sit there and knowing what 
the costs of – let me put it – as you sit there, are you able 
to say there is no TZ or there is nobody with the initials TZ 
who had – who was entitled to be paid any legitimate 
money from the business or are you saying there was? 
MR SODI:   Chair …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know of no person with those initials 
who had a legitimate claim to any payment? 
MR SODI:   Absolutely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the same – you give the same 
answer in regard to TM? 
MR SODI:   That is precisely correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And AM? 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And OM. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And MEC? 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And Diedericks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Diedericks. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 198 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to the extent – or rather, let me put 
it, to the extent that JT is not Jimmy Tau, then you give the 
same answer? 
MR SODI:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if JT is Jimmy Tau, your version is 
that he was – he had an entitlement to payment not 
necessarily out of money from this project but you owed 
him some money or something unconnected with this 
project. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if JT does not refer to Jimmy Tau, 
you are saying there is no JT who had a legitimate 
entitlement of being paid. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely and I would have asked Mr 
Mpambani, who are these people, you know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
SODI: 
 
 
And 
why 
are 
they 
appearing 
in 
the 
spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   And what reason do they need to be paid. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   You know, I would have posed those questions, 
you know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   But, as it turned out, by the time that I got to 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 199 of 249 
 
be made aware of the spreadsheet, he was not there to 
answer those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just looking at those particular initials 
and Diedericks, it appears to me that to the extent that the 
spreadsheet reflected – may have reflected an intention 
that those people must be paid those amounts, it would 
seem that your partner, on your version, you are saying 
your partner, knew of about x number of people who were 
to be paid more than R25 million from the business and 
you knew nothing about those people.  Is that what you are 
10 
saying? 
MR SODI:   That is what I am saying but can I just add to 
that?  I mean, what we prepared, Chair, to give to the 
Commission are two things, is a reconciliation of the affairs 
of the JV accounts.  That reconciliation, Chair, will show 
how much come into the business and much was paid out 
to whom.  We have already done that exercise, so it is 
easily available to transfer that information as soon as 
possible. 
 
Further to that, I am willing – and we spoke about it 
20 
earlier, to provide information relating to the affairs of 
Blackhead Consulting and you will notice that from the JV 
account and from Blackhead we had not made any of those 
payments at all to those people that are alleged to, you 
know, to be the recipients of these monies that are 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 200 of 249 
 
reflected on the spreadsheets.  But I have said as well that 
in as far as the affairs of Diamond Hill, I am unable to 
confirm whether there would have been any transactions 
from that side to perhaps any of the people that are listed 
on the spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   One  can conclude reasonably from 
this that where legitimate payments are made one sees a 
name and where payments that had nothing to do with the 
proper operation of the business are apparently to be made 
10 
initials are used, the intent of that is to conceal. 
MR SODI:   Chair, I cannot speak to that because 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Mr Pretorius is doing is putting to 
you the conclusion he arrives at on interrogating what was 
being done here. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To give you a chance to say I agree with 
that conclusion.  There must have been an attention to 
steal of to say no, but I do not think necessarily so, I think 
20 
that there was no – there might not have been an intention 
to steal or there was no intention to steal …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Conceal, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, conceal, sorry. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Conceal, ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 201 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, conceal and steal. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so he is giving you that chance to 
say when you look at this what do you say about that 
conclusion? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Well, I would agree with that.  That, you know, 
just mere reflection of the initials, you know, would in any 
way imply someone is trying to conceal something.  So I 
would agree with that, that version. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in any event you would know, 
as a businessman, Mr Sodi, that this is an extraordinarily 
unusual way of recording the expenses of a business. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we also know that this 
document was only intended to be between yourself and Mr 
Mpambani.  It was not – it will not find its way into any 
official record of the finances, was not intended to. 
MR SODI:   Chair, I do not know what Mr Mpambani’s 
20 
intentions were.  I mean this document, as far as I know, 
and I could be wrong, was produced by Mr Dukwana.  So 
the question that I have is simply this, how did Mr Dukwana 
come to be in possession of this document?  Where did e 
get it from?  So these are the questions that I have been 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 202 of 249 
 
asking myself and I was wondering could Mr Mpambani 
have shared this document with someone else?  I could be 
wrong but I think Mr Dukwana did concede here that he 
knew Mr Mpambani, that they knew each other on a 
personal level.  So the question I have is, is it probable 
that Mr Mpambani could have shared this document with Mr 
Dukwana?  And if that was the case, what would have been 
the reason for that?  I do not have answers to those 
questions.   
So it would be important to know for my sake, at 
10 
least, how he got to have access to these documents, what 
he knows about it and how was it shared with him?  You 
know, I am saying those are the some of the things that I 
would be inclined to know, you know, and maybe it could 
solve some of the answers that we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have I misunderstood but I was 
under the impression that you had accepted that the 
spreadsheet we are looking at is the spreadsheet that Mr 
Mpambani  prepared and sent to – emailed to you which 
you said you did not look at. 
20 
MR SODI:   Interrogate, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you accept that, I do not see why it 
is relevant whether Mr Mpambani shared it with Mr 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 203 of 249 
 
Dukwana for purposes of Mr Pretorius’ question.  You 
understand what I mean? 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you accept that it is the one, it is 
different if you say you are putting that in dispute but if 
you accept that it is the one then the fact is, here are 
names that were put in and initials that were put in by Mr 
Mpambani. 
MR SODI:   Correct, correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Meant to have a meaning to you, his 
10 
partner, you see? 
MR SODI:   I get him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we know, of course, some of 
the contents of the spreadsheet contain information that 
you gave to Mr Mpambani. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it be correct to say the 
spreadsheet does contain all the costs of the business as 
you expected them to be reflected in the spreadsheet that 
20 
Mr Mpambani was going to prepare but that it contains also 
other costs? 
MR SODI:   Additional information, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which you say you knew nothing about? 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 204 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it has everything that you expected. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it has more. 
MR SODI:   It has more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is more is, you accept, would 
have been illegitimate payments. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR SODI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is common cause, it seems, I am 
moving on to a new topic now, Chair, I do not know how – 
it is twenty past.  Okay, let us see how we go with these 
three issues that remain and perhaps we could do the rest 
by way of written question and reply.  So I would actually 
appreciate an opportunity to complete today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, how far do you want to go? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let me not be too bold, let us 
20 
reassess at twenty past. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is common cause, Mr Sodi, that 
you effected a payment of R600 000 to a motor dealer in 
Kwazulu-Natal 
and 
that 
was 
used 
by 
Mr 
Zulu 
for 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 205 of 249 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am terribly sorry, Mr Pretorius, I just 
thought of something that I want to put to Mr Sodi. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not – would you not concede that it 
is strange or extraordinary that a document that both you 
and Mr Mpambani agreed he should prepare for your 
purposes, the two of you, when it comes to the names that 
are there, you seem to know only the people whose 
payments would have been legitimate and you do not know 
10 
a single one of those whose payments seem to have been 
illegitimate and it seems Mr Mpambani would have been 
the only one who knew all of those. 
 MR SODI:  I want to make sure that I answer your 
question properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you understand the question? 
MR SODI:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you want me to repeat it I will but if 
you understand it is fine. 
MR SODI:   Chair, Mr Mpambani, as I have indicated on a 
20 
number 
of 
occasions, 
did 
not 
conduct 
himself 
in 
accordance with the spirit of the JV.  On a number of 
occasions and I have highlighted some of those occasions.  
So it is not improbable that he could have done something 
like this but in a way to conceal, you know, the intended 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 206 of 249 
 
beneficiaries or the intended beneficiary or it could have 
been for himself, you know?   
So – and again, it is illustrated and I am asking 
myself that with this last payment that was supposed to be 
split between the two entities which ultimately was not 
split, did he intend to use some of those funds to deal with 
the arrangement that he had?  You know, it is a question 
that I ask myself, you know, that maybe this guy had his 
own arrangements which he did not disclose to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, if one looks at the 
10 
spreadsheet, it is clear that he did not intend to conceal 
these other payments from you. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see that? 
MR SODI:   Ja, I see that and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not intend to conceal these other 
payments to you.  In other words, he is not …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Well, the fact that he used initials, Chair, I am 
not sure whether – well, we agreed here and I think we 
have admitted that it seemed as – or interpreted as 
20 
concealing, you know, who the actual beneficiaries are 
supposed to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that conceal is not necessarily 
conceal from you. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 207 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Concealed from third parties. 
MR SODI:   Concealed from a third parties, ja, because if I 
had – as I said, if I had opened the spreadsheet 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have seen this. 
MR SODI:   I would have seen this and he would have been 
able to then give me answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would have asked him. 
MR SODI:   Otherwise asked …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he must have been prepared to tell 
10 
you. 
MR SODI:   I am sure he would have, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there could not have been an 
intention on his part to conceal the identity of those 
people, I would imagine, particularly because paying those 
people would be also reducing your profits that you would 
get, is it not, because if the costs are x, the two of you get 
50% of what comes out.  If the costs are higher than that, 
that eats into the amount that you will share between the 
two of you. 
20 
MR SODI:   Chair, I can safely state here that even if he 
had given me an explanation, those people would not have 
been paid from the JV account or from Blackhead.  As to 
what could have happened with his share of the profit, that 
would have been his – you know, his own business and he 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 208 of 249 
 
would have dealt with it, but definitely from my side I would 
said I would have wanted answers to say why would me 
make such large payments to these individuals?  For what?  
Because, I mean, ultimately it is reducing our profit 
margin.  I would not allow that, you know, it would not have 
happened, at all, even if I had asked him those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    From that exchange, Mr Sodi, 
between 
you 
and 
the 
Chair, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
interrogating that spreadsheet now, it would be reasonable 
10 
to conclude that it contemplates illegitimate payments to 
people involved in the project. 
MR SODI:   I would agree with that version. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just to return to the payment of 
R600 000 to Mr Zulu and we know that the route that the 
payment took, to the motor dealer as deposit for a motor 
vehicle.  That is all common cause. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The question that must concern the 
Chair and the evidence leaders is how that alleged debt 
20 
arose.  Your – the explanation is from Mr Zulu and from 
yourself that money was owed by you to Mr Zulu, the 
amount of R600 000. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Tell us how that debt arose please.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 209 of 249 
 
How did that debt arise? 
MR SODI:   Chair, I was asked this question and in the 
affidavit, I responded to that question and I said Mr Zulu 
owned a lounge in Pietermaritzburg and over a number of 
months I bought alcohol.  A lot of it was ordered and 
delivered to my house in Durban, in Zimbali, specifically to 
replenish my bar.  At the time Mr Zulu indicated to me that 
he does not have credit card facilities because I have been 
to the establishment a few times, I had a couple of drinks 
and I would take most of it home and I would order this, 
10 
you know, as I said, to replenish my bar at home. 
 
In December of 2015 I had accumulated a bill of 
just over R600 000 and he called me and he said look, this 
is your bill that you accumulated – I knew more or less that 
my bill was around – and he said this is the amount, this 
the exact amount that you have accumulated, when are 
intending to pay?  I said I have funds as we speak, I can 
pay immediately if you provide me with your banking detail 
and then he said look, I – thank you for that but I am 
intending 
to 
purchase 
a 
motor 
vehicle 
at 
a 
certain 
20 
dealership in Ballito and then he said rather than pay it to 
me please pay it directly to the dealership, I am going to 
use those funds as a down payment for the vehicle and I 
subsequently called the dealership and they gave me the 
banking details and I paid the 600 000.  The balance – I 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 210 of 249 
 
think it was about 604 000 that I had accumulated as a bill.  
The balance of the 4 000 was paid in cash at his 
establishment and that is really the – how this thing 
happened with the 600 000.  So I was given a nominated 
account to pay into and, Chair, I did not see anything 
wrong with it because it was monies that were due to him 
and when he said pay it into this vehicle or into this you 
know establishment I did not see anything wrong with it, I 
paid it there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well it was money due to the 
10 
business that was owned ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:   That is correct, it was money due to – fees at 
large. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   One thing that strikes one as 
rather strange is this question of order and delivery.  How 
far is Zimbali from Pietermaritzburg?   
MR SODI:   Zimbali Chair maybe 100K’s or something like 
that and I need to explain and you know why I would have 
ordered from Mr Zulu…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Zimbali might be – did you say 
20 
about 100? 
MR SODI:   Ja, I am estimating about 100.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is probably a bit more than a 100 
because Pietermaritzburg to Durban is about 80 I think 
86,85 kilometres and as I understand I think Mr Zulu said 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 211 of 249 
 
his business is in the township so that would add I think on 
the kilometres because as I understand it you would have 
to go to town as before you go to the township up there.  
There might be routes that I do not know I am not sure but 
I think your route would go through town.    
MR SODI:   Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So probably the distance certainly 
should not be less than 100 but could be more than 100 
kilometres.   
MR SODI:   It is possible. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SODI:   It is possible but I may need to add that I go to 
that area Pietermaritzburg from time to time and my son 
goes to school in that area and his in boarding school.  His 
been in that area since about 2015.  So I go there from 
time to time for parent’s meetings, for sport activities you 
know to go see my son and in most cases after having 
completed whatever it is business that I do at school I 
would drive past you know Mr Zulu’s lounge.  
          Only a few occasions I have done that and as I said 
20 
this was someone that I knew at a personal level.  So 
going to his establishment was not unusual because it was 
going there to also see someone that I knew and you know 
we get there, we interact, we have one drink or two and in 
some cases I would have taken you know a lot of stock 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 212 of 249 
 
with me okay to the house.  And on a number of occasions 
like I said you know I took a lot of stock some stock and 
eventually the bill or the tab ran into that amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said this was all in 2015, is 
that right?    
MR SODI:   This was in 2015, correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Over how long a period in 2015 would 
you say this happened the first transaction for instance 
maybe happened early in the year or all in the second half 
of the year? 
10 
MR SODI:   Chair I speaking under correction but this 
could have been over a period of about six months or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over a period of over about six months? 
MR SODI:   Plus, minus ja I mean I…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SODI:   I admit that you know it is many years ago so I 
may not have a proper recollection as to exactly but it was 
over a period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SODI:   It was not a once off thing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SODI:   It was over a period of time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, are you able to say maybe it was on 
three or four or five occasions or once a month in six 
months, over six months? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 213 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   Chair there would have been occasions maybe 
in one month maybe I have got two orders.  Some month 
probably one but I think the establishment probably does 
have records that we can get and then we would not be 
speculating because I can be able to produce those 
records and say Mr Sodi you took so much of stock on this 
particular day.  I am sure that they may be able to assist 
us…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR SODI:   …when it comes to that.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius.  
MR SODI:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well what is unusual at the very 
least is to place an order for the delivery of liquor from a 
business over a 100 kilometres away does not make much 
sense.   
MR SODI:   Well Chair this was a business owned by 
someone that I knew.  So it was not just a business out of 
nowhere.  It was owned by someone that I knew and so it 
was for me also a way of seeing as being supportive to you 
20 
know to support the business of someone that I knew you 
know call it acquaintance or friend.   
          So but also it is important to understand as I said 
that I would go and I went on a number of occasions after 
having done whatever business that I was doing at my 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 214 of 249 
 
son’s school.  I would have gone past maybe had you know 
had something to eat, have a couple of drinks obviously I 
was mindful of the fact that I still had to drive about 100K’s 
so I would not have taken you know many and but I would 
also listen let me take extra you know so that I can have it 
at my house and restock and replenish my bar as I said in 
Zimbali.  So it was not…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would there have been deliveries by TZ 
Lounge to your property in Zimbali or did they put the 
liquor into your car each time? 
10 
MR SODI:   It was always in my car; I always took the stuff 
with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In your car? 
MR SODI:   In my car, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not delivered?  
MR SODI:   No it was not delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By TZ Lounge?  
MR SODI:   No, no the stuff that I took with me on a 
number of occasions as I have indicated.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes do you remember about what 
20 
the minimum was that you took on anyone of the various 
occasions 
you 
took 
liquor 
with 
about 
how 
much 
or 
something there? 
MR SODI:   Chair I would not remember the exact details… 
[intervenes] 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 215 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess you never took anything less 
than a R100 000,00?  
MR SODI:   Chair I know I like my holy waters but ja I 
mean you know it could have been around their Chair; I do 
not remember exactly but it could have been around there 
you know those sort of prices but it was substantial.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And is the position that the only time you 
paid TZ Lounge for the liquor was when you paid the R600 
000,00 prior to that you had not paid them anything?  
MR SODI:   No prior to that Chair there would have been 
10 
payments but very small payments.  Maybe I get there have 
something to eat you know, have you known one or two 
glasses of Scotch…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja not for something you take home?  
MR SODI:   Not for something that I take home.  So those 
small amounts I would carry cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
MR SODI:   I mean you know…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But for what you took.   
MR SODI:   For what I took I certainly could not be 
20 
carrying that amount of cash.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You only paid when you paid R600 
000,00? 
MR SODI:   That is correct ja because it was large 
quantities and I would not take a risk of carrying that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 216 of 249 
 
amount of cash.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SODI:   More so because as I said you know definitely 
facilities at the time that I have been there were not 
functioning and so I would not have carried that amount of 
cash, so…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR SODI:   Because of the large quantities I would have 
said listen you know put this in my boot and they would 
record whatever it is that I have taken and the amounts 
10 
and I take it with and that happened as I said on a number 
of occasions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I recall you saying that TZ Lounge 
delivered to your property in Zimbali and when the 
difficulty with that was pointed out I now understand you to 
say that each time you took it in your car.    
MR SODI:   Chair I recall that the stock was taken with me, 
I took the stock with me in my car.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright that is not a delivery that is 
20 
a purchase.  But you say this would have happened over a 
period six months or less.  
MR 
SODI: 
 
 
Again, 
I 
do 
not 
want 
to 
be 
you 
know…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You saying more or less.  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 217 of 249 
 
MR SODI:   I say more or less, ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say more or less once or 
twice a month? 
MR SODI:   No I am saying that there were certain months 
where you know I may have taken two.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But otherwise once? 
MR SODI:   Otherwise it would be maybe once.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that means that on any one trip 
from Pietermaritzburg to Zimbali you would have carried 
between R80 000,00 and a R100 000,00 worth of liquor.  
10 
MR SODI:   That is absolutely correct Chair, yes that is 
correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Extraordinary, anyway I have taken 
a few deliveries recently…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   It is extraordinary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let him say I think he wants to 
qualify something.  
MR SODI:   I do not want to say this in a manner that is 
going to sound you know arrogant but you know there are 
certain types of alcohol which are pricey.  You know I have 
20 
recently and as recent as I think two weeks ago bought six 
bottles of champagne which I do not consume all the time 
but I put them for special occasions especially birthdays 
and stuff like that and I paid, it was between four and R5 
000,00 per bottle.   
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 218 of 249 
 
          But as I said this happens once in a while it is not 
something that happens all the time but I did that because 
for example I know a birthday is coming so I would acquire 
you know four, five and in this case, I bought six bottles.  I 
paid over R50 000,00 just for six bottles.   
          So the point I am trying to illustrate and as I am 
saying Chair I do not want it to come out in a boastful or 
arrogant manner.  It is to say there are certain types of 
alcohol that you pay exorbitant prices and also I am an 
avid collector of whiskies.  You know I collect not to 
10 
consume but it is just you know once in awhile when for 
instance maybe there is a celebration or something you 
know then you open one bottle.  But it happen that you 
know you get some of this bottles that are pricey but 
otherwise on a normal day Chair on every other day I will 
have a glass of – or a bottle of wine that I buy from 
Woolworths for R90,00 or a R150,00 you know on a normal 
occasion.  But you do get you know certain types of 
alcohol where you pay a lot of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would there be certain types of liquor 
20 
that would, that are kind of popular with you that would 
have been included in those – I do not want to say 
deliveries because you have now said you took these 
yourself.   
MR SODI:   Ja. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 219 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But whenever you took them, I assume 
they would have been certain types that are common and 
would be found on each time you did those trips.   
MR SODI:   Ja, so Chair there would have been substantial 
amount of champagne.  There would have been whiskies 
such as your Johnny Walker and Bells from your red up to 
your blue.  And it is important that I illustrate this point 
Chair that you know I network a lot and I entertain a lot.  
So it often happens you know that when you entertaining 
someone comes, the Chair might come and say Mr Sodi I 
10 
prefer a Johnny Walker gold or a Johnny Walker blue that 
is what I prefer and I would have to cater for that you 
know.  Someone might come and say no, no I am happy 
with a Castle Lite or a Heineken you know so it is just to 
cater for different types of people.  Sometimes it does not 
mean that it should be consumed but it is there you know 
for occasions or days when someone is there and you know 
and they want it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just for the record Mr Zulu when 
20 
he gave evidence, he said there were times he delivered 
alcohol to you as well.  
MR SODI:   I do not recall that, that Sir I mean these as I 
said I do not want to sound evasive but these are things 
that happened in 2015 we are in 2020 now.  So you know 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 220 of 249 
 
memories fade over time but I can certainly say that I 
bought most of – I bought the alcohol myself.  You know 
there was probably one or two occasions where he would 
have visited me but you know maybe he would have his 
bottle, that he gets, that he comes to the house with and 
he will have that bottle, you know, because maybe he 
prefer that, you know what I’m saying, but I don’t recall 
him bringing a delivery, you know to the house. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It does seem that initially  you 
used the word delivery, you then said no every time it was 
10 
you taking it away from the premises, now you’re saying 
there might have been times when he did deliver.    
MR SODI:   No, no I am saying that I do not recall any 
deliveries Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MR SODI:   I recall taking the items myself and driving with 
in the boot of my car to my residence.  That is what I 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s deal – if I may go on Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Onto another topic? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, before you do that part of what 
strikes me as rather odd Mr Sodi in regard to this issue of 
the debt to Mr Zulu that the payment of this large amount 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 221 of 249 
 
of 600 000 is – is not paid into his account, is not paid into 
the business account, but it is paid to a third party so it 
would wind up here in his account, it wound up here in his 
business account, and then we are told that you were 
owing him R604 000, you paid R600 000 into a third party’s 
account and then when it comes to the payment of this 
R4 000 that remains outstanding after that it is also not 
paid into his account, it is paid to him in cash.  It is like all 
the time that nothing must go into his account. 
MR SODI:   Chair it was paid in cash because at that time 
10 
there were no credit card facilities, so the only other 
method of payment would have been either a transfer or 
cash but here we’re talking about R4 000 which was 
outstanding, which I had with me in cash and I thought 
instead of transferring R4 000 why don’t I just pay it in 
cash and that’s what happened, but if it was a large 
amount then I probably would have said look I don’t have 
the cash, you know let me transfer it, but it was a small 
amount, and I am saying it with the greatest of humility 
that you know we are in a country where there’s a lot of 
20 
poverty and so forth so someone sitting at home listening 
to me saying that R4 000 was a small amount might take 
an offence to that but I am saying in relation to carrying 
the cash with me it was not that substantial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what also seems – what would 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 222 of 249 
 
seem to be unusual to me is that – well I have never seen 
Mr Zulu’s business, TZ Lounge, I don’t know how it is, but 
is it the type of business where the owners can afford to 
allow such a large amount of money to be owed to it, 
without saying hey you must pay, we are not a big 
business, to us R20 000 is a lot of money, it ended up 
being owed R600 000 over six months. 
MR SODI:   Chair I certainly wouldn’t know the turnover of 
the business or how busy they are but I can certainly 
speak to the number of occasions that I was there.  It was 
10 
very busy and if the number of patrons or people that one 
would find in an establishment like that if one could make a 
correlation between that and the sort of revenue that you 
could 
make 
I 
would 
conclude 
that 
based 
on 
my 
observation, at least on the number of occasions that I was 
there, it was a very busy place, but I wouldn’t know how 
much they were making, but it was certainly quite busy you 
know, and I presume that it was a successful business 
based on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understood you to say that at the 
time you paid the R4 000 there were no credit card 
facilities at TZ Lounge?   I didn’t understand you to say 
that, you said that. 
MR SODI:   Look on the day that I paid, on a number of 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 223 of 249 
 
occasions when I was there credit card facilities were not 
functioning and that is what was confirmed to me.  The 
balance of R4 000 that I paid, I don’t remember if I asked 
are they now functioning, is your credit card facility now 
functioning or is it still not functioning.  I had the cash with 
me and I simply just paid, but I can’t say on that specific 
day that you know the facilities were working or not 
working, but I had the cash with me which as I said was 
not a substantial amount of money and I used that to settle 
the outstanding balance Chair that I had to pay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You said, and your statement was 
clear, you said there were no credit card facilities and you 
paid in cash. 
MR SODI:   Chair I am qualifying my statement, I say on 
the number of occasions that I was there, there were no 
credit card facilities, I am not changing that statement, but 
what I am saying as well is on the day that I paid the 
balance of the R4 000 I cannot recall if there were – I don’t 
remember if I asked them whether those credit card 
facilities were not there or not there, I don’t remember 
20 
that, but I had the cash with me and I paid the cash, the 
R4 000, and that is what I am saying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well all I am pointing out to you is 
that your evidence has changed in the last five minutes, 
but be that as it may ...[intervenes]  
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 224 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr Pretorius, please 
don’t forget the point you want to make. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understood Mr Pretorius earlier on to 
be saying your previous evidence, I don’t know whether in 
an affidavit or here, was that – or last time – was that you 
did not pay when you took the liquor on the days that you 
took it, because TZ Lounge did not have credit facilities 
and I understood you just a minute ago to be confirming 
that that actually was the position, what you don’t know is 
10 
whether on the day you paid the R4 000 whether that was 
still the case. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on all the days when you took liquor 
you know that there were no credit facilities, it is only in 
regard to the day you paid the R4 000 that you are not 
sure. 
MR SODI:   That is absolutely correct Chair, I mean on 
those days where I took the liquor, large quantities of 
liquor, I always carry my wallet with me, I always carry my 
20 
credit card with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:  And I can safely confirm that had they had 
those facilities, credit card facilities, I would not have run 
a deal at all, I would simply paid you know paid with my 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 225 of 249 
 
credit card, so we would not have had this scenario that we 
are dealing with now where there is a tab of over R600 000 
which ended up you know with me getting a nominated 
account to say pay, it would not have happened at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps this is not an issue to take 
up much more of our time Mr Sodi but do I understand you 
correctly now to say that had there been credit card 
facilities at the time that you visited TZ Lounge you would 
have paid by credit card? 
10 
MR SODI:   That is precisely what I am saying here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because as I understand Mr Zulu’s 
evidence he said there were credit card facilities there, he 
didn’t 
specify 
the 
time, 
but 
we 
can 
establish 
that 
independently. 
MR SODI:   That’s fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s just deal if we may with Mr 
Mokhesi and the arrangements entered into with him.  We 
know, and I do not believe it can be in dispute, that you 
paid an amount of 660 – was it, let me just get the exact 
20 
amount R660 000 to a trust.  
MR SODI:   It was R650 000 to – not to a trust but it was 
paid into the lawyers’ account that were registering the 
property that we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a law firm’s account. 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 226 of 249 
 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say it was paid into a law firm’s 
account? 
MR SODI:   Ja, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Those 
would 
have 
been 
the 
conveyancers? 
MR SODI:  I think those are the conveyancers ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In any event the money went 
towards the purchase of a property? 
10 
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The property was purchased as I 
understand your evidence, as an investment in property 
jointly between yourself and Mr Mokhesi through his trust? 
MR SODI:   Chair that is correct, I – let me just give 
context to this, I – when we started implementing the 
project I obviously got to know the HOD, we met on a few 
occasions and on one occasion I can remember particularly 
we spoke about, just about everything including business 
and our personal lives and what I do and so forth, so he 
20 
was aware that I apart from the consulting engineering 
space I mentioned that I am into property, I am a property 
investor, both commercial and 
residential but I also 
remember vividly that I mentioned to him that I was looking 
at acquiring a property, a smallholding, a small farm in 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 227 of 249 
 
Parys, in the town of Parys, so he was aware about my 
background when it come to that, and in around April or 
March somewhere between March and April of 2015 we had 
another chat and he said to me look I am – there is a new 
development in the State that is being launched and his 
question was is this something that you would look at from 
an investments point of view, because I am looking at 
investing, but I am also looking at a partner who can invest 
with me, and I asked him for the details of where this 
development was.  He gave me the details, I looked at it, I 
10 
mean I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable, to some 
extent when it comes to property, so I did my research, and 
I 
thought 
no 
this 
could 
be 
a 
potentially 
profitable 
investment, he is able to raise a portion towards the 
acquisition of that property, which was about a million 
Rand and I raised the balance of R650 000 and he said 
this would be done, so his investment will be through the 
trust, the Lekuma Family Trust, so he gave me those 
details because we subsequently had to get a contract 
signed between Blackhead Consulting as well as Lekuma 
20 
Family Trust. 
 
That was signed, the money from my side was paid 
into the account of the conveyancing attorneys and the 
property was acquired by the Lekuma Family Trust. The 
terms of the commercial transactions as I said were 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 228 of 249 
 
reduced in writing, I have got a copy of that, but this Chair 
is a perfectly legitimate and above-board transaction or 
commercial transactions that we entered into.  It was – it 
was done as I said immediately – not long after the project 
was completed and you know – so – but when the question 
was posed to me about this transaction and I could 
understand that when one looks at it from a distance but also 
for me in hindsight that it could be perceived to be you know 
– it could be perceived to be problematic.  But it was 
something that was documented it was recorded in our books 
10 
as an investment in our financial books it was recorded 
there.  The transfer was made from Blackhead Consulting so 
it was not concealed at all.  So – and that is what happened.  
If – if this was meant to be some kind of an underhanded 
payment Chair, we would not have done it the way we did it.  
We would not have recorded this in our financial records.  
We would not have paid and left any paper trail.  We would 
not have done these contracts that we did.  So it was a 
perfectly 
legitimate 
above-board 
commercial 
transaction 
which we entered into with the trust. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well we have the agreement between 
Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited and a Lekemo family trust 
which we know for all intents and purposes is Mr Mokhesi’s 
trust.  You quite correct it looks perfectly legitimate and 
proper but if there was an illegitimate payment this is a 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 229 of 249 
 
perfect disguise. 
MR SODI:  Well it could be a disguise but this was not the 
case in this particular transaction Chair it was not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is it again?  I… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is FS1, 189.  You see if I may just 
Chair while you doing that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may continue.  But … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I do not understand your logic.  If it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  It is 89 the page not 189? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja Free State 1 page 89. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I was going to page 189. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes just the logic of your last answer.  
If it was an illegitimate payment one would not want to make 
it look illegitimate.  One would want to make it look 
legitimate and this is the perfect way of making it look 
legitimate.  You create a trust and you enter into an 
agreement and it looks like a joint investment. 
MR SODI:  Chair if one had an intention of making an 
20 
illegitimate or corrupt payment, I would have done it 
differently.   
CHAIRPERSON:  How would you have done it? 
MR SODI:  About a week ago we had evidence being led in 
this commission about the famous place in Saxonwold and 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 230 of 249 
 
how those sort of transactions happen.  I would have done it 
in that manner Chair.  If it was – if it was illegitimate and 
improper that is how I would have done it.  It would have 
been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that evidence related to a situation 
where one the face of it at least the people who are 
implicated are yet to give evidence and bring their side of 
the story but on the face of it seems that there was an 
intention – there was an – there was no intention that it 
should be seen by anybody outside of the people involved.  
10 
If – so you have one way of concealing namely nobody must 
see what happened.  Another way of concealing is people 
must see what happened namely that some payment was 
made but they must not see – they must not recognise that it 
was an illegitimate payment therefore in order to do that put 
up an agreement that may seem legitimate.  That is another 
way of concealing. 
MR SODI:  Ja I – I take that Chair.  You know apart from and 
this is what I am saying.  Apart from the – the contract I 
would not have left a paper trail like that.  I would not have 
20 
done that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course… 
MR SODI:  Because – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you could say – you could allow 
paper trail to be there if you were confident that anybody 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 231 of 249 
 
who saw the paper trail would not be able to see that it was 
something illegitimate.  Everything would look legitimate. 
MR SODI:  So I am – I am saying in my case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR SODI:  You know if I had to do it I would be a little bit 
more creative and I would do it in such a manner that Chair 
it would not be found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  And it will never be picked up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR SODI:  That is what I would have done.  I would not have 
gone to an extent of even getting it recorded in our books or 
financial books to say there is an investment here you know.  
I would not have done that because it would not have been 
an investment it would have been an improper benefit due to 
someone for an improper relationship. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well Mr Sodi on your evidence you 
are not an expert in this field so… 
MR SODI:  I am not.  I am not ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I wanted to say you – you speak with 
20 
conviction that you would have done a better job. 
MR SODI:  I would have tried to do a much better job Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I have a while to go DCJ so if you 
have no other arrangements we can continue? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 232 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you – if we should stop now, I am – 
we can stop but if you want to … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps I should just deal with 
another two issues and then it would still be possible for the 
remainder to be dealt with in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So perhaps I should finish to avoid… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe if you go further let us not go 
beyond fifteen minutes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let me see how far I can get in 
10 
fifteen minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he is going to come back anyway.  
Ja.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine Mr Sodi? 
MR SODI:  Ja he must just keep his questions short Chair 
then we can deal with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not like his questions. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we add up the words Mr Sodi, I am 
not sure who would win. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – but were you moving to another 
topic Mr Pretorius? 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 233 of 249 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I want to ask Mr Sodi something 
about this.  Mr Sodi for me this transaction involving this 
property it looks very strange.  As I understand the position 
on your own version you and Mr Mokhesi agreed to go into a 
business venture involving a property as an investment as 
you see it and there is rent to be paid for I think what seven 
years – six years – seven years, is that right? 
MR SODI:  Ja.  So the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least initially. 
10 
MR SODI:  Ja so we agreed that we will – because these are 
long term properties really – a long time investments.  So we 
agree that it should be kept to seven years.  As I said it was 
a new development so my knowledge is that you know it is a 
new development give it a number of years.  When it is 
almost fully developed that is when you can sort of start 
realising the upside.  So it was the seven year was actually 
my suggestion to Mr Mokhesi.  And I said look I suggest we 
leave it for seven years because I anticipate that in year six 
or year seven this area would be developed and I think then 
20 
we stand a better chance of realising a better upside on the 
sale of the property.  But the management of the property 
itself in terms of rental and so forth was left to the – to the 
family trust.  But in the agreement, it was very specific how 
you know that was going to be deal with when it came to 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 234 of 249 
 
sharing the spoils if one – let me put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But the property is registered in the 
name of the family trust. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is therefore owned by the family trust. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not own it yourself? 
MR SODI:  I do not own it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not the joint owner in – legally. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair.  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have some agreement with – with Mr 
Mokhesi on your version. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is very strange to me.  If the two of 
you are embarking on a joint business why do you not create 
an entity in which you both have whether it is 50% share 
each or whatever you agree upon and that entity then owns 
the property.  Then you know you have the same rights into 
the property as he does.  Why do you not do that? 
MR SODI:  Chair how we looked at this transaction was I had 
20 
available R650 000.00 in my account.  He did not have the 
balance of the purchase price.  So he had to go raise a 
bond.  He said he had already spoken to his bankers and he 
qualifies or rather the – he will stand surety on the trust for 
that amount which is R1 million.  So for me it was – it was 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 235 of 249 
 
easy because and I did not want to complicate matters 
because then he would go raise the bond for that amount.  
He will stand surety.  I am not involved there but what covers 
me in the event of anything is the contract that we have, that 
we had signed.  But also, I did not see it as you know as 
something that for me, I would want to stay in for the longest 
of time.  The duration of seven years as I said was agreed 
upon because I thought that is a realistic period in which you 
can be able to realise the upside.  But I did not want to own 
that property at all. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is strange for me Mr Sodi.  You 
were looking at a property in which that would give you some 
returns in the future.  An investment which would give you 
some returns in the future.  You agree to an arrangement in 
terms of which the exclusive owner of this property is 
somebody else.  You are not there legally.   
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That property as I understand the position 
if the trust was sued by somebody and they have to attach 
property they could attach that property.  Is it not? 
20 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now a business person like you how does 
he agree to that kind of thing?  That is what I – I am 
struggling with.  You – you put your investment in the name 
of some entity you are not involved in terms of ownership 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 236 of 249 
 
some entity is fully exclusively the owner and you are fine 
with that.  That does not seem to be something I would 
expect from certainly a business person that you seem to be. 
MR SODI:  Chair I – this was not the only property where I 
had that kind of arrangement for instance.  But I have always 
relied on the fact that the contract had to be in place you 
know between the transacting parties so that if anything 
happens, I am able to produce the contract and say listen I 
am entitled to whatever share of this property.  So if anyone 
had to go there and attach it for whatever reason the 
10 
contract that I have signed and again you know I am not a 
legal person and you know but my view is that the contract 
that I have signed is enough for me to be able to recoup 
whatever that will be due to me.  And that was the basis on 
which this was done.  It was also not a size – it was not a 
sizeable property.  It was not a big property for me where I 
would have said listen there is too much expect – the risk is 
too much for me not to be involved.  You know so I did not 
see any sort of risk in that apart you know as I said apart 
from the fact that you know I had made sure that the contract 
20 
was in place.  So I did not see any risk in that at all.  It was 
very clear, very specific, we invested in this for a period of 
this amount and this is what is going to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  But certainly, with regard to you know some of 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 237 of 249 
 
the properties that I have invested in I would have taken a 
different approach because the amounts are substantial in 
some of those properties.  So I am sure I would have taken a 
different approach you know just to make sure that you know 
one is covered at all costs because of the exposure.  You 
know as business people always obviously weigh the risk, we 
look at exposure; we look at the upside and those kinds of 
things.  So certainly, in this case I did not have a problem at 
all and I just felt that the contract was enough for me to 
cover me in the event of anything happening. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So the picture that emerges is that at 
least with two government officials who had some important 
role to play in regard to the Asbestos Project namely Mr Zulu 
and Mr Mokhesi with each one of them you have some 
arrangement that has got some strange features at least for 
me.  With regard to Mr Zulu this large payment of 
R600 000.00 for liquor and then with regard to Mr Mokhesi 
an arrangement in terms of which the property is bought that 
you regard as property in which you are investing but it is 
completely in the name of Mr Mokhesi’s family trust.  And I 
20 
think you say in your affidavit the question of the rand was 
something you would see in seven years when the property 
has to be sold.  So those – with each one of them there 
seems to be something quite unusual to me.  You may wish 
to say something or you may be able to say you accept that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 238 of 249 
 
there 
are 
some 
unusual 
features 
but 
that 
is 
how 
it 
happened? 
MR SODI:  Chair if I had to be in your position, I would 
probably have the same views. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  And maybe look at it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
MR SODI:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand? 
MR SODI:  I understand where you are coming from. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well the – Chair asked you a 
question about the structure or the agreement between 
Blackhead and the family trust and perhaps it should be 
pointed out that your consideration that you were protected 
by this agreement is limited and must be qualified.  You only 
had rights against a family trust if something went wrong.  
You had no rights in the property in which you supposedly 
invented or invested rather. 
MR SODI:  Chair that could be the case.  As I said I am 
20 
fortunately not a legal person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  So I – and if I consult with someone to assist me 
with a contract who is trained in such matters, I would 
believe that if they say this is a… 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 239 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this agreement drawn up by a lawyer 
or just by yourselves? 
MR SODI:  It was drawn by ourselves but if I remember I 
think we – I specifically consulted – and I cannot remember 
with whom this is long time ago.  But I checked – I checked 
you know if the agreement was okay and I think the answer 
that I got was that it looks fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You recall whether it was done in your 
office? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who drafted it? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or in Mr Mokhesi’s office? 
MR SODI:  Chair I cannot remember where it was drafted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  But we would have shared it both of us looked at 
it before we signed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But from this arrangement it seems 
that you want to go into a joint investment in the property 
20 
with Mr Mokhesi.  You then enter into an agreement with the 
trust.  You have no rights in the property.  You only have 
rights against the trust not even against Mr Mokhesi.  The 
only person to have benefited from this arrangement and 
substantially benefitted was Mr Mokhesi.  He had the better 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 240 of 249 
 
part of the deal. 
MR SODI:  Well Chair that – as I said the – I was quite 
happy with the contract that we drafted.  I was quite happy 
with the upside that we anticipated to get from the property 
you know because like I said I saw it as a potentially good 
investment and in as far as the advice relating to what – how 
I would be covered in the event if anything happened I was 
confident that I was given proper advice.  So you know it 
could be that maybe upon interrogation when one looks at 
the contract you say well you know maybe it could have 
10 
included this clause or it could have been amended in this 
particular fashion.  But we are having right now the benefit 
of hindsight to look at things you know in the past to say this 
could have done, this could have been happened this way.  
You know and you know it is a benefit that we have now.  
You know that we could have done things differently 
perhaps.  Perhaps we could have specified in the contract as 
well that you know I have got something on the property as 
opposed to just the trust. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us look… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you contemplated that there would be 
rental paid. 
MR SODI:  Yes.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to it being sold in seven years’ time 
from that time as I understand one of your affidavits or the 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 241 of 249 
 
contract.  The property was going to be sold after some 
years, is that right? 
MR SODI:  Ja so we had planned to keep it for a period of 
seven years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  And we had planned that upon the sale of the 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In seven years’ time? 
MR SODI:  In seven years’ time we would look at the value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR SODI:  Obviously that would be shared proportionately 
whatever amount that we sell for it and then also we would 
take into account the rental income that would have been 
added.  So that will be taken into account in calculating 
ultimately what gets to be shared between the two parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Is there somebody occupying the 
property at the moment? 
MR SODI:  Mr Mokhesi is occupying the property as far as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is occupying it.  Has he been occupying 
the property since the property was acquired? 
20 
MR SODI:  Ever since correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is he paying rent? 
MR SODI:  He is – so there is rental which would be taken 
into account on the sale of the property not right now.  So 
that was the agreement that that would be taken into account 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 242 of 249 
 
after seven years when we sell the property.  So that – and 
there is – you will see that there is a clause there that says 
that 65 – 65 000 per annum which is what we specified in the 
contract which would be a portion of the rental income that 
would be payable to Blackhead Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the payment of any rental would 
happen annually or would only happen at the end of the 
seven years? 
MR SODI:  Upon the sale at the end of seven – upon the 
sale of the property. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So rent would be accumulated. 
MR SODI:  It would be accumulated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For – yes.  So it would not be paid into any 
account?  Is there… 
MR SODI:  No so it should be accumulated per annum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Per annum. 
MR SODI:  For a period of seven years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  And it will be taken into account when we do the 
split. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well we have the agreement here and 
it is easy to answer those questions.  Clause 2.5 says: 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 243 of 249 
 
“Lekemo shall be entitled to rent the property 
to whomever it so desires.” 
It does not have to rent the property but it may. 
MR SODI:  It may ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If it rents the property those rentals 
are taken into account upon disposal of the property in 
seven years’ time. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But in the meanwhile, Lekemo can 
keep the rent? 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if it is not rented out Mr Mokhesi 
himself can stay there? 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There is no provision for him to pay 
rent in the seven years. 
MR SODI:  That is correct, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Nor is there any notional rent that he 
must pay on disposal of the property.  So he benefits.  He is 
living rent free. 
20 
MR SODI:  It is – the rental as I said Chair would be taken 
into account.  We specify the amount that is due to 
Blackhead Consulting per annum.  But that will only be due 
upon the sale of the property which would be in seven years’ 
time as we stipulated.  So even if he lived in the property for 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 244 of 249 
 
those years and not paid rent at the end of the day in seven 
years’ time that would have been taken into account to say 
listen this is the amount that we agreed and it is specified in 
the contract, it is there.  But it is 65 000 per annum.  So it 
would be taken into account when we doing the calculations.  
So we – so we cannot say it was rent free because it was 
going to be taken into account in the end when we were 
doing the split. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am afraid Mr Sodi that is not what 
the agreement says.  The agreement says in paragraph 2.7: 
10 
“The 
property 
shall 
be 
sold 
by 
mutual 
agreement between the parties.  If the 
property is not sold within seven years from 
the date of signature of the agreement then 
Lekemo shall pay Blackhead 650 000 its 
initial investment, its proportion share of the 
rental income less any expenses incurred for 
the maintenance of the property and an 
amount equal to R65 000.00 per annum in 
respect of the notional capital appreciation of 
20 
the property.” 
 
So it was contemplated that the value of the property 
would increase over the seven years. 
MR SODI:  It was contemplated yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So Mr Mokhesi could quite happily 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 245 of 249 
 
live rent free for seven years and then at the end of the 
transaction at the end of the seven year period pay the 
amount specified in 2.7 out of the sale of the property – 
proceeds of the sale of the property.  That is a benefit. 
MR SODI:  Well the – Chair the – the split would have to be 
determined according to the formula that we agreed and 
what it means is that what should be payable to Blackhead 
Consulting will include what would have been the rent which 
we specific as being R65 000.00 per annum plus whatever 
upside.  So if we were to sell the property for say R2.5 
10 
million we would have minus the 16 – 1650 from 2.5 million 
and proportionally split that amount between the two entities 
plus the rental income that would have been derived. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sadly, that is not what the agreement 
says Mr Sodi.  It says the R65 000.00 is in respect of the 
notional capital appreciation of the property.  If the property 
is not sold the property stays in the trust then what happens 
is you get your R650 000.00 back, a proportionate share of 
the rental income if there is rental income and you get an 
amount of R65 000.00 to cover the capital increase of the 
20 
property.  But you do not have that because you are not 
selling it.  If you sell the property then you get your initial 
investment, you get the share –  
MR SODI:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then you get any rental income 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 246 of 249 
 
which is shared between the parties.  That is what this 
agreement says.  But it is not necessary to go into that fine 
detail. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  And our differing understanding of what the terms 
are Mr Sodi. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Save to say that Mr Mokhesi 
ultimately can live there rent free and account only in seven 
years’ time. 
10 
MR SODI:  Well he would live there Chair rent free for those 
years but ultimately, he is going to have to pay in retrospect 
after seven years.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And … 
MR SODI:  So for the first… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja sorry – I am sorry to interrupt and 
he could do that out of the capital appreciation. 
MR SODI:  He will do that – the capital appreciation Chair it 
is going to be split between the two entities.  So I would 
have received my capital appreciation in proportionate – in 
20 
proportion to what I would have invested okay and then he 
would have had his own capital appreciation and he could 
have based on his appreciation then paid for whatever that is 
due to me.  But it does not mean that you know it would have 
been rent free because it would be taken into account at that 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 247 of 249 
 
point.  But for the first years yes you know one can look at it 
that way.  But ultimately when we exit the deal the 
transaction he would have had to pay for the – for the rental.  
So it would not have been rent free in that sense. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For seven years it would have been 
rent free. 
MR SODI:  For seven years. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you would have to pay… 
MR SODI:  But ultimately – yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Out of the profits of the deal.  He 
10 
benefitted.  Obviously, it was a beneficial contract.  You 
saying you did not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you do not really normally get 
that do you? 
MR SODI:  You do not normally get? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get that kind of arrangement with – if you 
are leasing a property. 
MR SODI:  Ja I think in this case it would be different Chair 
because like I said he – there is a bond that he had raised 
so he is serving the bond with the financial institution.  As 
20 
far as I am concerned, he is still serving that bond.  So – so 
it is – so I cannot say that he is staying there rent free 
because there is bond that he is servicing.  And of course, 
that was taken into account you know that you know.  He is 
going to have to service that bond and only after seven 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 248 of 249 
 
years that is how we are going to be doing the split it is on 
the basis of the – of the agreement that we have signed.  So 
there are monies that are payable by Mr Mokhesi on a 
monthly basis towards the servicing of the bonds and the 
maintenance of the property and the rates and taxes and so 
forth.  So that is why I am finding it difficult to admit that he 
is staying there rent free in that context. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
of 
course 
you 
are 
having 
this 
arrangement with this person who made it possible for 
Blackhead to get this project because he approved the 
10 
adjustment of the business plan, is that right? 
MR SODI:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is almost half past six I do 
have some questions but perhaps they are better left for 
another day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is fine.  We have ended up 
staying much longer than we had agreed but I think that we – 
we – this will be helpful because next time you come back Mr 
Sodi it will be possible to take a much shorter time to keep 
20 
you in that – on that seat for a shorter time than otherwise 
would have been the case.  So we are going to adjourn now 
Mr Sodi but arrangements will still be made after the 
investigation that must still happen in which you have 
unequivocally given your undertaking to cooperate.  After 
19 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 252 
 
Page 249 of 249 
 
that has been done an arrangement will be made for – 
another date will be determined for you to come back to 
finish your evidence.  You understand? 
MR SODI:  I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And thank you to – for 
everyone’s cooperation, your legal team also for staying until 
this time.  Mr Pretorius and your team.  We are then going to 
adjourn for the day.  Tomorrow we will have a sitting 
involving other witnesses and we will start at normal time 
namely ten o’clock.  We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 20 AUGUST 2020
