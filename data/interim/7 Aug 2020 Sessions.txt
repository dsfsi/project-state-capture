Page 4 of 223 
 
Manyike. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Mr Manyike you have 
before you a bundle; it is Bundle FS and can I ask you to 
look at FS1 page 122. The numbers that we will refer to 
are the black numbers in the top left-hand corner of each 
page.  So if you look at FS1; 122, do you have that? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That appears to be an affidavit 
attested to by yourself. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you would go please to page 140.  
Whose signature is that? 
MR MANYIKE:  The bottom it is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Your signature? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it appears to have been 
commissioned on the 18 October 2019. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that your affidavit? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes it is. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And are the contents of that 
affidavit as far as you are aware true and correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair may we admit as Exhibit TT4 
the affidavit at page 122 and following of FS1? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 5 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Abel Kgotso Manyike 
appearing at page 121 of Bundle FS1 is admitted as 
Exhibit TT4. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Manyike you 
are according to your affidavit a director of the ORI Group 
Pty Limited as well as a company called ORI Services Pty 
Limited? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you speak up please 
because the stenographer is – has difficulty. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you very much. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You attended an interview with the 
commission investigators on the 27 August 2019.  That 
interview was recorded and transcribed? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And after the interview it was you 
perhaps 
with 
legal 
representation 
who 
prepared 
this 
affidavit? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes it was me who prepared the affidavit 
that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  According to your statements we 
could go to page 124 paragraph 11.  During 2013/2014 the 
Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and Gauteng 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 6 of 223 
 
Province conducted an asbestos audit and at that time a 
number of professional resource teams were appointed for 
that purpose.  Do you know of that? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I know of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you have anything to do with 
that audit just very briefly? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I did.  I was part of the – the team that 
audited Soshanguve that is one area Pretoria. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  During that time did you 
come to know a Mr Radebe and the entity MasterTrade 232 
10 
Pty Limited? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes we met there but Mr Radebe we met 
before – before that audit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go then to paragraph 23 
of your affidavit at page 126.  Radebe communicated 
something to you in relation to a potential project in the 
Free State.  What did he tell you? 
MR MANYIKE:  Paragraph 26 Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  23. 
MR MANYIKE:  23. He mentioned there was something in 
20 
the pipeline but his exact words – he used the word 
‘cooking’.  He told me there was something cooking.  By 
that I interpreted that as meaning there was a potential of 
something happening or there could have been submission.  
So it – it gave one a feeling of expectation. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 7 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right so do I understand you 
correctly Radebe said to you that there was something 
cooking in the Free State and that – did he say anything 
about your potential participation in that groove? 
MR MANYIKE:  He in passing but he did not go into much 
details but it is someone from time to time we would 
engage and talk about projects you know to catch up. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.   
MR MANYIKE:  But he was not specific but I knew in Free 
State there was a potential of business but from who and it 
10 
was going to be issued to who I did not know at that time. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And this project I understand it is 
now known to the commission was the Asbestos Project. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, yes that is the Asbestos Project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now we know from previous 
evidence that the Joint Venture that obtained the contract 
from the Free State Department of Human Settlements 
comprised on an entity called Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Limited and Diamond Hill.  But for the purposes of our 
evidence it is easier if we refer to the directors and 
20 
shareholders of those entities namely Mr Sodi of Blackhead 
and Mr Mpambani of Diamond Hill.  Correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Before this project was launched – 
in other words before any contract was awarded to the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 8 of 223 
 
Joint Venture did you meet Mr Mpambani? 
MR MANYIKE:  I notice during the litigation process that 
the contract was awarded somewhere in I think December.  
So to answer your question yes we did meet before that.  I 
did meet Mr Mpambani before the contract was signed with 
the department. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Did you in accordance with 
paragraph 24 have a discussion with Mr Mpambani? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes we did have a discussion at that time 
but it was more like a – I would not want to call it an 
10 
interview somehow I sensed that he – Mr Mpambani in that 
meeting he was – he wanted to know about my capabilities 
and what I have been involved with previously.  So yes the 
meeting sat but it was more of an interview wanting to 
know my professional background and so forth. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right and did he make any 
enquiries in relation to your relationship with MasterTrade?  
Now we know from certainly your evidence that we will give 
in due course that the Joint Venture that was appointed by 
the 
Gauteng 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
sub-
20 
contracted the work to MasterTrade and MasterTrade 
according to your evidence sub-contracted the work to you. 
MR MANYIKE:  Please rephrase that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The contract in relation to the 
Asbestos Project. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 9 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was awarded by the Gauteng 
Department of Human Settlements – sorry not the Gauteng 
Department 
the 
Free 
State 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements to the Joint Venture. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is Mpambani and Sodi. 
MR MANYIKE:  Mr Sodi yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  That work – part of that 
work the detail will become apparent in due course was 
10 
then sub-contracted to MasterTrade, correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then MasterTrade’s contract 
was sub-contracted to you as ORI? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Radebe of MasterTrade has a 
different version but we can deal with that in due course.  
What he says is you were appointed in your personal 
capacity as a consultant for R5 million. 
MR MANYIKE:  That is not correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I understand that.  According to 
your version that is not correct and that issue is the 
subject of litigation at the moment. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is true. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
What 
is 
interesting 
about 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 10 of 223 
 
MasterTrade’s version of course is that you were employed 
as a consultant for R5 million virtually to do all the work. 
MR MANYIKE:  That is not correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I know that is not correct but 
that is his version. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is correct that that is his version. 
MR MANYIKE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is his version. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  For a R255 million contract. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is – that is his version. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but let us go on.  You say 
you had a discussion with Mpambani who was it appears 
sounding you out in relation to your potential involvement 
in this project. Is that correct?  Is that a summary of your 
evidence so far? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, yes it was more like an interview. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And did he come to any 
conclusion?  Did he advise you as to what he Mpambani 
20 
would like in relation to the use of your services? 
MR MANYIKE:  He did not go into much detail at that time 
but I – from the questions he asked I figured it could be 
something related to what I did in Soshanguve. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes alright. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 11 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then – and that Soshanguve 
work was done in Gauteng? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As part of arrangements in Gauteng 
between 
contractors 
and 
the 
Gauteng 
Department 
of 
Human Settlements. 
MR 
MANYIKE: 
 
It 
was 
not 
arrangements 
between 
contractors and the department it was an arrangement 
between the department and the professional resource 
10 
teams. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that that was the 
National Department?  Are you saying… 
MR MANYIKE:  It was the Gauteng – Gauteng – Gauteng 
province that … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but that is what I am saying. I 
am putting to you that the work in Soshanguve that you did 
that Mpambani came to know about was done pursuant to 
20 
contracts in Gauteng between the Gauteng Department of 
Human Settlements and certain contractors. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you were a sub-contractor in 
that arrangement? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 12 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  I was not a sub-contractor I was – I was 
one of the entities that was awarded such contracts was 
Gibb. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but you worked for Gibbs. 
MR MANYIKE:  No I did not work for Gibb. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who did – well then who did you 
work for? 
MR MANYIKE:  Okay I worked – at that time Gibb sub-
contracted a portion of the work to other consultants of 
which one of them was a company called Imendo. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  I do not want to get too 
involved in the details. 
MR MANYIKE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But you worked for a sub-contractor 
in Gauteng? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did Mpambani and I am referring to 
paragraph 25 of your statement revert to you with a 
decision about whether he would like to make use of your 
services? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, yes he did.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What did he tell you?  Well firstly 
did he say he would like to make use of your services? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes he did highlight that.  That he would 
like to make use of my services.   
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 13 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To do what? 
MR MANYIKE:  I would not say it was in that meeting.  
Maybe other meetings that followed that.  It was about the 
audit to do a similar work I did in Soshanguve. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Would you look at paragraph 
25 of your statement. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say here in your affidavit. 
“Mpambani advised me that they would like to make use of 
my services because I come highly recommended.” 
10 
Is that correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He continues or you continue. 
“The idea was that I would be responsible or the whole 
asbestos audit on behalf of MasterTrade.” 
Is that also correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So did Mpambani tell you that they 
would 
like 
to 
make 
use 
of 
your 
services? 
 
That 
MasterTrade would be a sub-contractor to the Joint Venture 
20 
and that you in turn 
would be a sub-contractor to 
MasterTrade and you would do all the work? 
MR MANYIKE:  At that time, it was not put out like that.  
All I knew was that I was going to be involved on the 
project on behalf of MasterTrade.  The – as in terms of how 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 14 of 223 
 
the agreement was going to be outlaid it was not clear that 
time.  But later when it – as things transpired, I became 
the sub-contractor to MasterTrade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, no. 
MR MANYIKE:  Whether I was going to be directly 
contracted to Blackhead, JV or to MasterTrade at that time 
it was not something that was discussed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  No we know your version 
through other evidence and the court papers that the JV 
sub-contracted work and it will appear later – the whole of 
10 
the work to MasterTrade. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  MasterTrade then sub-contracted to 
you. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In your capacity as Director of ORI? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What I am interested in is 
your statement in paragraph 25 where you say: 
“The idea was that I would be responsible for the whole 
20 
asbestos audit on behalf of MasterTrade.” 
Is that correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say then in paragraph 26 that: 
“That a few meetings later Mpambani mentioned to me that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 15 of 223 
 
a Joint Venture constituting Diamond Hill Trading and 
Blackhead may conceivably be appointed to perform the 
service.” 
So the arrangement with Mpambani of the Joint Venture 
with MasterTrade that you would be a sub-contractor to a 
sub-contractor to do the whole of the work was discussed it 
appears and agreed in principle before the contract with 
the Joint Venture and the Gauteng Department of Human 
Settlements was finalised.  That is how I understand your 
affidavit. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, yes that is correct.  Yes that is 
correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And was it during these 
meetings that Mr Mpambani said that Mr Sodi’s right hand 
man Mr Zwane would be also working on the project? 
MR MANYIKE:  Say again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Look at paragraph 27 please. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was it during the course of these 
meetings with Mr Mpambani to which you have just referred 
20 
that you were informed that a Mr Martin Zwane would be 
working on the project as well? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Under the direction of Mr Sodi? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 16 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As Mr Sodi’s right hand man as you 
put it? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I was told that Mr Sodi’s right hand 
man is Mr Zwane. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes now we will come in a moment 
to what Mr Zwane did and what he was apparently paid but 
for the moment let us move on.  As a result of your 
potential contractual involvement and as a result of the 
approaches made to you by Mr Mpambani to become 
involved as a sub-contractor to a sub-contractor did you 
10 
firstly agree in principle to become involved? 
MR MANYIKE:  Say again Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you become involved? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you agree to become involved? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I agreed to become involved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And you became involved and 
according to you a contract was signed between yourself 
and MasterTrade. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we will come to that in a 
moment.  Did you make a presentation in relation to – well 
what were you asked to do in relation to the nature and 
organisation of the work to be conducted? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a much better formulation Mr 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 17 of 223 
 
Pretorius than the one you nearly used for that question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is that?  I am sorry I cannot 
hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am saying that is a better 
formulation of that question the way you have put it than 
the one that you nearly used.  I think you started and on 
the way you changed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it – the latest formulation of the 
question enables him to just tell the story. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes well all this is introductory.  We 
are coming to the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Matters on which he will tell his 
story in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But I am grateful that I retain the 
ability to self-correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  I was asked to prepare a presentation for 
Mr Sodi. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MANYIKE:  That – that presentation it was required 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 18 of 223 
 
from me to demonstrate more or less what technology was 
used on projects that I have worked before in particular the 
Soshanguve Project.  That is what I was asked. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To whom did – did you make a 
presentation? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I did.  Presentation was very short.  It 
did not even last more than fifteen minutes.  I did the 
presentation to Mr Sodi, Mr Mpambani was there and Mr 
Radebe. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And what was the outcome 
10 
of that presentation? 
MR MANYIKE:  It was verbal.  It was something that could 
be used by them in – in this case in the Free State. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Right.  And you say Mr Sodi 
was present at that presentation. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes Mr Sodi was present. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who else was present? 
MR MANYIKE:  Mr Mpambani, Mr Radebe was there.  That 
they recalled.  Mr Sodi’s right hand man Martin Zwane I 
think he came late that day.  So those gentlemen they were 
20 
there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right so the main contractor, the 
sub-contractor and the sub-contractor to the sub-contractor 
were all there at that presentation? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes if you wish to put it like that ja they 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 19 of 223 
 
were.  They were all there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what was the arrangement then 
made in relation to your status or ORI status in relation to 
the contracting and sub-contracting arrangements? 
MR MANYIKE:  What was the what? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was the arrangement? 
MR MANYIKE:  The arrangement? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What was the agreement?  What 
role would ORI or you play? 
MR MANYIKE:  At that time to Mr Sodi we – the 
10 
presentation – we did not touch on issues of contracts as 
to who is going to be sub-contracted to who. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MANYIKE:  For him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  At that time, it was about the presentation 
if we will be able to do the work.  I – I only noticed later 
that he thought that I as working for MasterTrade.  At that 
– on that level it was inappropriate to discuss contracts.  
So we were just there to demonstrate the software to him. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but what was the agreement 
or arrangement between the Joint Venture representatives, 
the representatives of MasterTrade whom we learnt is the 
first sub-contractor and yourself as the second contractor.  
What – what was the arrangement agreed to between these 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 20 of 223 
 
parties? 
MR MANYIKE:  The – between the parties JV – the JV 
agreement understood that the work was going to be sub-
contracted to MasterTrade and MasterTrade sub-contract to 
me.  From the JV I am referring to the two that I just now 
Mr Mpambani, Mr Sodi.  Mr Sodi him I never engaged that 
much but Mr Mpambani was above board.  He knew exactly 
what 
was 
happening 
that 
I 
had 
a 
contract 
with 
MasterTrade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Again, if I can ask you to 
10 
look at another document.  There is a bundle FS8 which 
will be given to you at page 200.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say FS8 Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS8 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At page 200.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you give Mr Manyike the right one?  
FS8.  This is FS1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The document at page 200 is a 
document… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Pretorius.  Mr Pretorius it 
looks like my staff did not bring the particular bundle but 
you might be able to just read aloud the relevant portions.  
Somebody will go back and fetch it in the meantime. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We could provide you with a copy in 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 21 of 223 
 
the meanwhile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Ja that is fine if you are 
able to.  Ja.  I think they brought some and they seem to 
have left either that one or two bundles.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You have that document in front of 
you Mr Manyike? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes I have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The document is a six page 
document 
or 
a 
five 
page 
document. 
 
What 
is 
that 
document? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  It is my contract between ORI Group and 
MasterTrade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is a contract you say between  
MR MANYIKE:  ORI Group and MasterTrade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes ORI Group is your company. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And MasterTrade is the first sub-
contractor which has been represented by Mr Radebe? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The heading is ‘Appoint’ – it 
20 
is dated 31 October 2014. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And its heading is ‘Appointment for 
Professional Services’ self you say relating to what we now 
know as the Asbestos Project? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 22 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well what were you appointed if you 
could just place on record paragraph 1? 
MR 
MANYIKE: 
 
The 
assessment 
audit 
for 
300 000 
residential units in the Free State province. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The whole audit or just part of it? 
MR MANYIKE:  The whole audit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Under paragraph 2, we see the scope 
of work.  It reads... if I may read it?  Free state 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MANYIKE:  The whole project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And the proposed fee 
structure... well, before we get there.  Under the heading 
“Existing Consulting Team, there of Blackhead Consulting 
and Diamond Hill known as the Blackhead Consulting JV”. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps we should put it on record.  
You...  
“Due to the nature, for the benefit of the project, we 
would therefore like to bring it to your attention that 
20 
Diamond Hill and Blackhead Consulting, known as 
Blackhead Consulting JV, has been appointed by the 
Free State Department of Human Settlements and in 
turn has appointed...” 
 
Was understood by you to mean the whole project? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 23 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then we see... right.  Blackhead as 
the first sub-contractor, the charges, we know and there will 
be direct evidence to this effect, R 44 million.  Correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  R 44 million and some further rands 
and cents.  You, to do the whole work, contract with 
MasterTrade for a fee of R 21 391 489,00.  Am I correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go on to the next page at page 
10 
202.  R 8 509,30.  Am I correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  That is not correct.  I did not enjoy it.  I am 
still not paid.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, I apologise.  A project 
management fee. 
MR MANYIKE:  That was the intention.  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So, and you are quite correct 
to point that out.  The project management fee which the 
contract between yourself and MasterTrade 232 Holdings 
provided for was eleven and a half million. 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And your expense budget, in 
other words, the actual disbursement costs, as I understand 
it, is stated in the agreement to be an expense budget in the 
region of R 9 982 000,00. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 24 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And what is listed below in 
that schedule under the head of paragraph 4.1.2, appears to 
be the expense budget in some detail.  Perhaps you could 
tell us what this schedule represents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Are you still at 
202? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Zero two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is a schedule of a table 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see it, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...of what appears to be the makeup 
of the expense budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I would just like the witness to 
explain that in a little bit more detail, please. 
MR MANYIKE:  This was a schedule of quantities.  What 
happened.  For us to get to that, to this, me and 
MasterTrade, we sat down.   
20 
 
We said:  “AK, do not give me price per house but rather 
show me.  Let us put it in the context so that I can see what 
it is that I pay for”. 
 
So, you see, that is how... that is what transpired.  So 
from Item 1 until Item 23, these are all the services that I 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 25 of 223 
 
rendered to MasterTrade. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There will be some discussion later 
about the involvement of Mr Zwane and what he was paid but 
let us leave that aside for the moment.  These expenses 
here, were they the expenses for part of the project, the 
whole project for all the work you would do?  What was the 
case? 
MR MANYIKE:  This... no, that was sufficient for the project, 
10 
for the scope that was... for the... for this contract that was 
awarded to me.  So it was sufficient.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, for the project? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the whole scope of work, which 
you have already told the Chair was the whole of the 
Asbestos Project. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, Mr Manyike.  You had done this type 
of work before your company, had you not? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  Sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had done this type of work before? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, I had done it before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before this project? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 26 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long had your company been involved 
in this type of work?  How many years, more or less? 
MR MANYIKE:  This type of work Chair is fairly new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja.  A lot of people that started doing this 
work, would have been exposed from the year 2013/2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MANYIKE:  So this is fairly new... I do not know if I can 
call it industry, but line of work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  So when it started, I was part of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to indicate whether it was 
the second project you were involved in, involved in this type 
of work, or third or fourth project? 
MR MANYIKE:  I would say it was the fourth if not third. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in terms of this scope of work and 
20 
what you charged, you said that was... I think you said that 
was enough for this kind of work.  Is that consistent with the 
prices that you have charged in other projects, the pricing?  
Was it consistent in terms of the prices? 
MR MANYIKE:  It is ...[intervenes]  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 27 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are you not able to say? 
MR MANYIKE:  It is hard to say Chair because this... it 
depends on the outcome. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  And the outcome is always different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Like for the... the way I can compare apples 
with apples is the Shoshanguve Project.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  But I know it was... they are charging more 
10 
single rate.  I am aware of how much consultants charge to 
get this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Those who are contracted to the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the main contractors. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  So what I will do, I will always charge 
ten percent of their amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, of their amount. 
MR MANYIKE:  For me it is fair and then it is profitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So you consider it reasonable? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So if I understand it correctly that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 28 of 223 
 
your practice in relation to the Asbestos Project was to 
charge ten percent of the overall contract fee charged to the 
department, the relevant department? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, my charge to this was informed by a 
number of factors.  Number one, I am aware of the rate 
which was offered by Gauteng to those that did this project 
before.  So I was aware of that.   
 
Number two is the number of times spent and the 
professionals.  So it was also... it was time-based versus 
value-base.   
10 
 
So one, when you pass for such jobs, you will look at 
such factors and you also consider the competition in that 
province to say, “How many of you are doing this?”  I will call 
it specialised work.  So that informs you will... how much you 
charge. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The charge of ten percent of the 
overall charge to the department, I understand your evidence 
is for that to conduct the whole project on the ground? 
MR MANYIKE:  This project... what I am saying to you Chair.  
The rates that were used in Gauteng and in Free State or 
20 
wherever at a certain point of this nature has been used.  I 
can use... I can do that job at ten to twenty percent of what 
the municipality ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The contractors charge. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  Simply because this is our bread and 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 29 of 223 
 
butter.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you say that in this case, 
you were informed by a benchmark percentage of the overall 
project to do all the work for approximately ten percent of 
the overall fee charged by the main contractor to the 
department? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Is this a common practice in 
Gauteng? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is this a common practice in 
Gauteng? 
MR MANYIKE:  It is not a common practice.  Hence, I am 
saying to you this is a fairly new thing.  This really started in 
2013 late, around June/July somewhere there.  And people 
are no longer involved in type... in this type of work.  Are 
few, are limited.  So there is nothing cast in stone but one 
will try at least to be competitive, like in my case I will do 
that 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But this idea of charging a sub-
20 
contractor doing the work and charging ten percent of the 
overall fee, did this happen only in this case or did it happen 
in other Asbestos Projects in Gauteng? 
MR MANYIKE:  Okay, in other Asbestos Projects in Gauteng, 
what I have seen, you will find the main PRT they would sub-
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 30 of 223 
 
contract some other companies.   
 
It... well, where I was post... exposed in Pretoria.  That 
is what happened.  There were about four, five sub-
contractors under the main contractor on the team, Zwane.   
 
So it is not as if... I would say... I would not say it is an 
extraordinary thing what happened in the Free State because 
of the number of resources and expertise that is required to 
deal in such projects.  To answer your question.  That is 
what I also saw in Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would it be correct to say?  The bottom 
10 
line is, if the Free State Department of Human Settlements 
had invited bids openly, you could have put in a bid to do the 
job and that what you would have charged may well have 
been exactly what you charged to do this job?  Would it be 
correct to say that?   
MR MANYIKE:  Chair, I would ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is the position that if you had been the 
main 
contractor you 
would 
also 
have 
charged maybe 
R 250 million? 
MR MANYIKE:  Well, I would have done that Chair but I 
20 
would have partnered with someone with financial muscle.  
Let me put it that way.  Simple because government, before 
they award jobs of this nature, they look at your financial 
position.  So I would have been disadvantaged.   
 
I know this type of projects.  They are going to millions 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 31 of 223 
 
of rands.  I would have partnered with someone like Gibob(?) 
[00:43:51] or Blackhead or... but someone that I know.   
 
They have got the financial muscle and... not so much 
the resource because I can do that.  But the financial muscle 
and the credibility in the industry, I would have partnered 
with someone like that.  But there is something Chair that I 
would like to highlight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR MANYIKE:  Gauteng did set a president for this type... 
for value of works for Gauteng or Free State or wherever 
10 
such projects would be done.   
 
So we know that if a tender was to come, let us say in 
the Western Province, is regarding this particular work, it will 
run in those ranges.   
 
The requirements for one to participate would be high.  
So you will find medium-size companies like us, we somehow 
get squeezed out.   
 
So, but I would have tendered for that but maybe went 
with someone with financial muscle for such a project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, from what you say.  You would have 
20 
the resources other than the, what you referred to as 
financial muscle, to do the job, you would have the 
resources.  Is that correct?  What you would not have is 
what you call the financial muscle. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 32 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of other resources, you would 
have what would be needed to do the project? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, I would have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  ...to pull up a team.  The manpower.  I would 
able to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  But the down payment... to start a project of 
this nature, we are looking at ten, eight million upfront.  Not 
mentioning the guarantees from government.  So it is very 
10 
expensive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that... that is what... is that what... 
would that be the kind of money that the government would 
say you must put down to ensure ...[intervenes]  
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, the guarantees.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But that would be money that will 
come back to you when everything is finalised? 
MR MANYIKE:  It will come back.  The problem is giving it 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it is just giving it. 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But apart from that, that requirement, 
you would have... you would meet every requirement to do 
the job? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 33 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you know? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, I will... I will meet the requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Now if they did not require that 
down payment of millions of rands of if you had a way of 
getting somebody that would partner with you and you are 
bidding for this, exactly this job with the scope of work, what 
do you think your price would have been, bearing in mind 
what you charged for the whole work, bearing in mind what 
the main contractor charged the department? 
MR MANYIKE:  I will have two answers for you Chair on that 
10 
one.  I do not know which one will be... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  As a businessman, I am informed by the 
market and see how the market is functioning.  I know that 
six hundred-and-fifty is a rate that has been reasonable to 
government elsewhere but I will maybe come slightly to go 
fifty percent lower.  I will still make a profit.   
 
But in a case whereby the work is not under my name, I 
will be extremely competitive as I was.  I am saying to you, I 
can most... I can charge between ten to fifty percent of what 
20 
Gauteng paid or Free State.   
 
But that will be on the condition that I am a sub-
contractor like I was.  But if I was the main contractor going 
for such jobs, the six-fifty in Gauteng will inform how much I 
price for that.   
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 34 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would then be up to the Free State 
Department whether it accepts that ...[intervenes]  
MR MANYIKE:  To make that decision, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but if effectively the... since, I think 
you said, there are not too many of these jobs.  If the 
department said that was in Gauteng, this is Free State.  We 
think you got away with murder in Gauteng.  You have got to 
go down on your price here.  You will be able to go down 
quite considerable, is it not, and still make a good profit? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, that is true Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not want to lose that job when 
you know that you can do the job for much less and still 
make a good profit. 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct Chair.  If I may add on that?  
The only difference is that you will never be given that 
chance to go down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR MANYIKE:  The only difference is that you will never be 
given a chance to say reduce your price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the department... by the government 
20 
department? 
MR MANYIKE:  By any department where you are tendering 
but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 35 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  So the price you put, that is your final price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  But I will go fifty percent or even sixty 
percent less ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  ...to get the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you... if your company... if a number 
of companies had put in the bids and your company 
provided... gave the cheapest price, okay? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go back to the others.  But your cheapest 
price, they thought it was still quite high because you 
businesspeople robbed Gauteng.  You all [laughs] conspired 
and put your prices up, you know.   
 
Now you want to use that as a base to rob everybody 
else.  They say, “Look, Mr Manyike, you are the cheapest of 
this, so that is why we will talk to you.   
 
But even your price is unrealistic because if you charge 
us half of what you have put in here, you still make a good 
20 
profit.  We do not want to give you this job if you stick to this 
amount.  We want you to go lower.  The economic times are 
difficult”.   
 
When you know you can still go down and still make a 
good profit, would you not take the job, would you not reduce 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 36 of 223 
 
it? 
MR MANYIKE:  I will reduce Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will reduce it, ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes.  I will reduce. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because where else are you going to 
get another job?   
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long must you wait? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Manyike, if you 
go back to the schedule of expenses at paragraph 4.1.2 on 
page 202 of FS8, you will see there what appears to be, and 
you 
can 
help 
us, 
a 
comprehensive 
list 
of 
expenses 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANYIKE:  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...that were involved in the executed 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MANYIKE:  If I can just come in a minute? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  [No audible reply]  
MR MANYIKE:  Just to remind you, this matter is still under 
litigation, né?  So I would just like to appeal to the 
Commission ...[intervenes]  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 37 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  ...that I am not being represented by any 
attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  I am presenting myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  So take it easy with the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. [laughs] 
MR MANYIKE:  Especially when it comes to my project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I... [laughs]  I think you are right to 
10 
remind us about your sensitivities Mr Manyike. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, I am aware of the difficulties you 
face or may face in litigation but I am only going to ask you 
what is your version. 
MR MANYIKE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I may put others to you for your 
comment but those... that comment would be based on your 
expert knowledge as a contractor.   
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But let us go back to 4.1.2.  Who 
paid these expenses? 
MR MANYIKE:  These expenses, they were paid by ORI 
Group of which we have the proof of payments.  The bank 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 38 of 223 
 
statements, that will reflect.  We have also attached them in 
our court papers.  They are there.   
 
But should there be a need... should the Commission 
need this, we can submit.  We can issue it to the 
Commission.   
 
But it is ORI Group that paid for all these expenses.  
The only expense which we were supposed to pay for that 
we did not pay for of which it was not contractual is when it 
involved the purchasing of the programme.   
 
That money we had allowed.  We had allowed on the 
10 
contract.  So that is the only money that we did not pay.  It 
was in the region of six hundred thousand, somewhere there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you had the financial 
muscle to pay the working expenses or the operating 
expenses of the project.  Do I understand you correctly? 
MR MANYIKE:  No, I do not have that financial muscle.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  How did you know? 
MR MANYIKE:  The expected cost was R 9 million. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja.  So where payments were coming in 
20 
stages to me as the work progressed.  Ja.  Not... towards the 
end, payments stopped coming.  As I am talking to you know, 
I am indebted to those people that served ORI Group, other 
professionals because of this project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of course, the questions that have 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 39 of 223 
 
just been put to you by the Chair about the financial muscle, 
talk about the characteristics of entities seeking contracts.  
The questions still remains.  What is a cost-effective charge 
for the work done?   
 
As I understand this contract and your evidence, for the 
whole of the contract, borrowing one or two items like Mr 
Zwane’s involvement and the software that needed to be 
purchased, 
you 
could 
do 
the 
work 
for 
expenses 
of 
approximately 
R 10 million 
which 
would 
give 
you 
a 
management fee of approximately R 11 500,00.  Correct? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The Chair will decide in those 
circumstances of all the charges we have heard what is the 
cost effect of that one.  We do not need to go there. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we can go over the page, please, 
to page 203?   
MR MANYIKE:  [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 5, staff component.  You 
are expected to provide the dedicated staff component.  
20 
What is meant by that?  Is that the whole staff component for 
the field work? 
MR MANYIKE:  The entire workforce. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then under project programme: 
“Kindly provide us with a project programme up to 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 40 of 223 
 
submission of the final report...” 
MR MANYIKE:  I did provide that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So was your involvement 
required right until the final report? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go back to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Did 
you say you did provide that or did you say you did not 
provide that? 
MR MANYIKE:  I did provide that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go back, please, to 4.1.2.  
I do not want to read through this whole schedule. 
MR MANYIKE:  Four point one...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Point 2. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On page 202. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But on the face of it, and you can 
comment if you need to, this schedule involved preparatory 
work, the purchase of gadgets, the provision of transport and 
other items such as airtime required for the operation of the 
electronic gadgets.  Is that correct?  What does this 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 41 of 223 
 
comprise? 
MR MANYIKE:  This comprises goods and services that will 
be needed to execute a project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And I see ...[intervenes]  
MR MANYIKE:  ...and to give the desired outcome. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  What is Item 13? 
MR MANYIKE:  Field workers salary. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For all the field workers or for some 
of them? 
MR MANYIKE:  For all. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For all of them? 
MR MANYIKE:  Two point... R 2 250 000,00.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  What is Item 14? 
MR MANYIKE:  Printing. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, 14.  One four. 
MR MANYIKE:  Office technicians. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And is there any provision 
here for payment to project managers? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, there is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where is that? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  We used different jargons internally.  But my 
project managers, they would fall under Item 18 team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja.  So they will be... I will be the project 
manager under ORI Group. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 42 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  And they will be assistant project managers.  
Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On page 204, we see the signature of 
Mr Radebe, Director of MasterTrade 232 (Pty) Ltd? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And on page 205, what is that 
document? 
MR MANYIKE:  This was an acknowledgement letter to him 
that we... we were thanking him.  That, thank you for the 
10 
project.  And this was sent to him via email. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thanking him for what opportunity?  
The... was this... did it have any relationship to the contract? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, we are acknowledging... it was a letter, 
in fact, that said there was a condition in the contract that 
we must accept. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and is that the acceptance? 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja, this was the acceptance letter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that at the top, the document says, 
“letter of commitment”.  Is that the letter ...[intervenes]  
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, and also to give our commitment. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
ORI 
Group 
committed 
itself 
to 
performing the work in terms of this appointment? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 43 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you go to paragraph 32 
please?  You have told us that currently the ORI Group is 
in …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Pretorius, are you taking us 
back to his affidavit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry, yes, please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in bundle FS1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS1, page 128, paragraph 32. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Can I have some water, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, they did not – they should have 
provided you with water there.  Well, maybe we should take 
the tea break but somebody must make sure there is 
always water available to the witness.  Oh, is there bottle 
of water available?  They will bring you water just now.  
Thank you.  Maybe let us use the five minutes before we 
take the tea break. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bundle 1, page 128, bundle FS1, 
128, paragraph 32.  You informed the Commission that the 
20 
ORI Group and MasterTrade are currently involved in 
litigation for monies that you say MasterTrade owes you, 
the ORI Group. 
MR MANYIKE:   That is correct.  Chair, if I can say 
something in relation to that case? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 44 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   Case number 69173/18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is the one referred to in 
paragraph 32. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes.  During the investigations, I came 
across the SI and something I observed there is like they 
went to the court to get the statements, the affidavits, and 
it appeared as if certain affidavits in that file grew feet.  So 
I do not know how to put – what needs to be done but I 
saw that being a limitation to them being able to execute 
10 
their investigation.  From the documents they were holding, 
I could see that there was alleged deliberate intent to 
withdraw certain statements from that file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you said – you referred to SI? 
MR MANYIKE:   Ja, the SIU. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the SIU? 
MR MANYIKE:   SIU, Special Investigative Unit, yes, when 
they came to interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, when they came to interview. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say they had certain affidavits from 
this case? 
MR MANYIKE:   They were looking for affidavits and 
statements that were made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 45 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   But it was within that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   But I could see that what they were 
looking for they did not find in that file so it is like 
somebody touched a file in the wrong way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MANYIKE:   I just wanted to put that out there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  You suspect that certain 
affidavits that should have been in the file may no longer 
be there? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, they were taken out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is that something that you 
discussed with SIU or you did not discuss? 
MR MANYIKE:   I did not discuss with them, it just came 
across my mind now, as I am sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Okay and you have a 
feeling 
that 
those 
affidavits 
may 
well 
assist 
the 
Commission in understanding certain things? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes because the – I have seen bold 
statements of people saying they have paid so and so but 
20 
the proof of payments are there.  You know, a person 
would think twice before writing a statement like something 
that could be easily proven.  That is why I could see that 
there is a strong hand messing with things.  I do not 
know… 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 46 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission are here, they will look into that and we will be 
informed.  Thank you for bringing that to our attention. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I would presume that you would 
have documentation in relation to the case? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you would be willing to share 
that with the investigators. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And point out what you think the 
10 
investigators might be interested in. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Thank you for that, we 
will take it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should take the adjournment 
the? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea adjournment now 
and resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Manyike, we 
were still dealing with your affidavit in bundle FS1 and we 
are at page 129, if you would go to paragraph 35 please? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 47 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:       I am on 35. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I think – are you speaking to 
Mr Manyike? 
MR MANYIKE:   I am on 35. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you are saying you have found the 
page.  Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   From paragraph 35 onwards you 
described 
the 
work 
that 
you 
began 
to 
do 
as 
the 
subcontractor to the subcontractor.  What work was that? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   It was the viewing of the paragraphs, the 
share files, the view of the houses, the areas where we 
worked. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was the purpose of viewing 
the aerial photographs of the areas in the Free State? 
MR MANYIKE:   The purpose, Chair, is – in the Free State 
you have over 600 000 stands so I, in my view, I will see 
the department to ask anyone to come and audit, they will 
not monies to do that, it will be – the scope will be too 
much, so what would be advisable and what would be 
20 
proper and what I deem as the only way is to look at the 
aerial maps first of these areas where asbestos could be 
concentrated, then from thereon it is about training.  One 
can see if it is as asbestos from a shape file that is recent, 
you can see it more or less.  Then after we have done that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 48 of 223 
 
then we are able to somehow get to a point to say this is 
how much work we are looking at.  So that was the whole 
purpose of that exercise, for us not to waste resources 
going to areas where we are not supposed to go because if 
you looked at the aerial photographs you will notice from 
the aerial view that the asbestos houses and those that are 
done with corrugated iron, over 50 years they look the 
same from the aerial view, so – but historically, we are 
aware of places where black people were allocated and 
people of colour, the coloureds and other smallholdings, so 
10 
we are able to see that on the aerial photographs so that it 
helps us not to waste resources going to areas that we 
should not be going to.   
 
So it is cost-effective way of doing things other than 
what was done in other areas, that exercise was never 
done, people were just told to go and audit.  So we took 
the precautionary measures to make sure that we limit 
movement on the ground, seeing how big and vast the Free 
State is compared to other provinces.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What is it, Mr Pretorius? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, there is some interference 
coming from one of the computers, Chair, I just wanted to 
alert a certain person to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do I understand you correctly then 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 49 of 223 
 
that 
the 
initial 
exercise 
involved 
looking 
at 
aerial 
photographs in order to identify houses which might have 
asbestos roofs? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We had an expert here, Mr Roets, who 
said that that is not really a reliable way of finally 
determining whether a house has an asbestos roof or not. 
MR MANYIKE:   I saw that, I think it was televised this 
past Tuesday and me, just watching TV, there was a 
revelation as to say why we had a delay on Tuesday and 
10 
the 
Wednesday, 
is 
something 
I 
would 
leave 
to 
the 
Commission, also to the Free State as a given, to say – 
that is what I can see, if this can be fixed, will have 
attendance here.  But I will touch on that but I want to 
come to issue of the expert.   
As I was preparing for this presentation at my 
house, I was with the kids, watching TV, I heard my – I am 
the author of the four files that were submitted to Free 
State and other …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you are author of…? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:   I am the author of the four reports that 
were submitted to the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   So I know how they look, so I – just to go 
the relevant attachments and packaged everything.  So my 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 50 of 223 
 
file at home was looking like this and as I watched TV, the 
expert, the file was looking like this.  So immediately I 
could see there was a problem and even the things that he 
touched on, he said – to the asbestos project, to remove 
the roof it is about 6’, 7 000, the house -  I said but that 
thing is there in the report I wrote, it is there.  He spoke 
about the bill of quantities but I think also us speakers that 
comes here, Chair, it is our responsibility also just to 
educate to say people will talk about phase 1, phase 2, 
phase 2, before you know it, people are confused and I 
10 
was somehow concerned to say was the expert really 
relevant or not on two primary issues. 
 
The expert came clear to say he is accredited by 
SANAS. 
 
SANAS 
reports 
to 
DTI 
together 
with 
the 
companies – the companies and the soft engineering part 
of things but though you find the panel of Public Works 
whereby the built environment reports to that.   
So when I talk about the build department I am 
talking about the architect, the engineer, the structural 
engineer, the electrical, the mechanical.   
20 
 I 
would 
have 
expected 
-the 
environmental 
specialist, I would have expected that person to come and 
say they are specialists because of two fundamental 
issues.   
 
What the expert was talking about, he was narrating 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 51 of 223 
 
what happens in phase two of the project.  What is phase 
two?  Phase two is the implementation.  Phase one is the 
inception, conceptualisation, detailed preliminary.  That is 
phase one and the Department of Labour is silent, what 
happens before phase two.  There is no legislature that 
talks to that.  
So you find someone who is specialising on a small 
thing within the bigger scheme of things coming here to 
say they were expert and I am saying that with all due 
respect.  You are wasting the Commission’s time.  He was 
10 
talking to his experiences under implementation.  We know 
this project not a single asbestos roof has been removed.  
So what was he doing here?  I wanted to give that out. 
But on the issue of the reports, I would see there 
was something wrong with the report because what he 
making reference …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you go there, Manyike. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He certainly gave evidence about 
auditing and assessment.  Auditing is certainly, as I 
20 
understand it, or is certainly what was included in the 
mandate in this project, is it not?  The assessment, we can 
talk about because certainly auditing was auditing of the 
houses for asbestos. 
MR MANYIKE:   It is different, Chair. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 52 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANYIKE:   There is auditing during the construction 
phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes.  This type of work, the environmental 
part will be handled by an environmental specialist during 
planning 
stage 
when 
you 
are 
doing 
the 
project 
conceptualisation, inception and so forth.  This is way 
before the expert comes. 
 
The expert comes, for him to be absorbed into the 
10 
building environment is when he comes in as a contractor.  
That is phase two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no, let us – we will get to 
know when an expert comes but let us take it step by step.  
You agree with me that auditing the houses for asbestos 
was one – was part of a mandate given to the main 
contractor by the Human Settlements Department in the 
Free State . 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and you also agree that the auditing, 
that part of the job, auditing houses for asbestos meant 
actually establishing how many houses had asbestos, is 
that correct? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 53 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  On assessment, what is your 
understanding with regard to whether assessment was part 
of the mandate given to the main contractor by the Human 
Settlements Department in this project?  Was it part of it or 
was it not part of it, as you understood it? 
MR MANYIKE:   It was part of it but the extent of the 
scope, how the expert put it, he – I think he went too much 
into details. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   That is – there is two assessments that 
you do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   There is one before construction, there is 
one given at planning stage, that is the one we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   But now when the department says we are 
ready to now – let say remove the roof of this building, that 
is 
where 
such 
specialists 
they 
come 
because 
now 
sometimes you can maintain the asbestos or you remove a 
20 
portion, you can do this – but in Free State, the intention 
was not to – whether to maintain rooms or do this, it was to 
completely remove the roof and replace it.  So, by me 
saying 
that, 
there 
was 
no 
need 
for 
anyone 
to 
go 
underneath, inside the houses and check this, the roofs 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 54 of 223 
 
had to be removed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, we will come to that, I just 
want to establish that we are all on the same page on 
certain things.  With regard to the assessment, what is 
your understanding of what assessment entails in this 
context? 
MR MANYIKE:   When you assess in the context of a new 
contract …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or this kind of project of finding 
asbestos. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, when you assess it is referring too 
much to the structure integrity of the loading bearing walls.  
The roof, it is a given, it has to go.  So when you say 
assess, the expert in this context, it could be maybe 
maintain this or paint it there or do this, so it would be 
more detailed to that extent.   
 
So but our assessment, as I understand it, is about 
the – looking at the house to say was there a crack on the 
house, can this house still stand with the – if they lift the 
roof?  If the answer is no, then the whole house must be 
20 
removed.  If the answer is yes …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry just repeat that, I think it is 
important, the answer is …[intervenes] 
MR MANYIKE:   The assessment was heavily on the entire 
structure of the house which is something that falls outside 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 55 of 223 
 
the expertise of the expert, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   That is number one.  So the decision that 
asbestos must be taken away, it is a given.  It was – we 
are not assessing the asbestos, we are purely identify the 
asbestos and you reference it as to where it is, how many 
are there, asbestos, where are they, what size and so forth 
and how far are they from the landfill sites where they 
must be disposed of.  That was the importance of the 
assessment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me tell you what my understanding 
was of what he said assessment entails and I just want to 
check whether it coincides with your understanding or not. 
 
My understanding of what he said assessment 
entails is that you cannot just do it standing outside the 
house or standing on the road looking at the house in order 
to do it properly you have got to get into the house, see 
where exactly you see asbestos, that is my understanding, 
it might be wrong, so where you can pick up where 
asbestos is and, as I understand what you are saying, 
20 
some houses that have got asbestos might be – their 
condition might be such that they need to be given priority 
in terms of removing the roof or even demolishing the 
house because as a result of the asbestos in the house 
there is danger of the occupants of the house, there is 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 56 of 223 
 
greater danger in regard to some houses than in regard to 
other houses. 
 
So I got the impression that part of the assessment 
is to see which houses must government give priority 
because already people live in that house are in danger, 
they could be injured and he said – and it is not just in the 
roof, I think it is elsewhere as well in the house.  That was 
my understanding.  If that is my understanding and if that 
is what he said, does it accord with your understanding of 
assessment? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   No, it does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does not? 
MR MANYIKE:   No, it is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your understanding of assessment does 
not entail – does not make it necessary that you should go 
into the house, is that right? 
MR MANYIKE:   No, you do not have to – yes, that is 
correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does not, ja. 
MR 
MANYIKE: 
 
 You 
do 
not 
go 
inside 
the 
house 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever you want to see you can see 
from outside the house? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, you do not test the asbestos, you 
identify it. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 57 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what are the potential things you look 
for standing outside the house when you are assessing on 
your understanding? 
MR MANYIKE:   We train people on how to identify 
asbestos.  From outside, first of all you look at the shape 
and the colour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that the roof or …[intervenes] 
MR MANYIKE:   Ja, the roof outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The roof, ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   Ja, if you cannot see the colour, if it is 
10 
painted, you look at the shape.  So we train our people 
what to look at and mostly on houses with asbestos you 
will find they will not put in gutters and so forth.  So these 
are things that people look at and we even encourage them 
to say if you can, go inside the yard, look underneath and 
then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now inside the house? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, yes, Chair, and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So sometimes you can do it without 
going into the house, sometimes you have to go into the 
20 
house. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANYIKE:   And to my amazement, I will say 95% of 
people that were trained, they knew what was asbestos. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 58 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but let me just go back from the 
assessment part, is it simply to see whether this house has 
got asbestos on your understanding of assessment.  So 
when the person – when you send your fieldworker or 
someone there, is it to look for indications where there is 
asbestos? 
MR MANYIKE:   Ja, the audit part is the asbestos. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is the audit part. 
MR MANYIKE:   The assessment part is the structure, the 
integrity of the house.  We put other questionnaires there 
10 
for us to have an indication as to what exactly.  But the 
bulk of the works was done by the programme, things like 
your geophysical and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   So I will say maybe on the assessment, 40 
percent was done by the fieldworker to say when you get to 
a house, we look for these things when you assess this, 
the structure integrity of the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   You look at the cracks, you must be 
20 
certain and then you record it like this, is the house 
plastered which is very, very – an issue if the house is 
plastered a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the situation, what is the impact 
of a house that is plastered on your assessment? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 59 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   The house …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   does it mean it is difficult to assess or is 
it easy or…? 
MR MANYIKE:   No, it is going to inform the bill of 
quantities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   The bill of quantities will inform the 
budget.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   Alright.  What is happening now in 
10 
Mamelodi, I think the past two years, when they were doing 
these houses, also I so somewhere being removed in 
Soshanguve. 
If the house is not – is plastered and it had 
asbestos, when you remove the asbestos, the wooden 
posts must also go away, you find some of them – they are 
no longer in good condition, so you put this steam and then 
on top you will have to plaster, you will have to fix, so it is 
important that you match these things.  Where there is a 
geyser on the roof it adds to the cost, someone must 
20 
remove that geyser and put it there.  So these are some of 
the things …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you talk about remove the geyser, 
you are not talking about the person who is coming to 
make the assessment, you talk about later. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 60 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   No, the person who is making the 
assessment, you make that allowance, that record if there 
is a geyser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   Because we know and later on when 
should the department appoint whoever to come and do 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whoever… 
MR MANYIKE:   …these houses, that thing will be an 
issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANYIKE:   To say that there was a geyser here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it adds to the cost. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, it adds to the cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but just to go back, you said the 
assessment relates to – I think did you say physical 
integrity of the house? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I understand that to mean whether 
the house looks like it might collapse anytime or in due 
20 
course.  Is that what it means, the physical integrity of the 
house? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you – for purposes of an 
assessment done in the context of this project, does it 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 61 of 223 
 
matter whether the cause or the house to be like that, 
namely, it looks like it might be collapse anytime or it might 
collapse in six months, does it matter whether that might 
have been caused by asbestos or it does not matter what 
has caused that condition to happen for purposes of the 
assessment?   
 
So, in other words, are you only looking for what 
damage the asbestos has done to the physical integrity of 
the house or are you just looking at the physical integrity 
of the house irrespective of what has caused this? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   We – there are number of things which can 
cause structural problems.  One of them could be the 
foundation also but on this project, it was agreed that we 
will not be doing geotechnical studies, visual inspection 
would be sufficient.   
I want to come there, Chair, just to show you that 
asbestos here is not the thing, it was about the structural 
integrity and they are even comments about more people 
could have been appointed, the councillors could have 
chosen so and so and said then count these houses and 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must confess that thought came 
to my mind. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 62 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
may 
be 
ignorance 
to 
say 
…[intervenes] 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes.  No, it is not ignorance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why can you not just get councillors who 
are paid to look after the interests of the community to 
…[intervenes] 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, it is not ignorance, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   That is what I am saying, some of us will 
come on these platforms, we fail from our respective fields, 
10 
we somehow, we need to inform.  To count and to audit are 
two different things.  We know of projects in Gauteng 
whereby they were committing that, people were asked to 
go and count the potholes, to go and measure them 
physically but they did that in the houses.  We know, we 
know, we see these things.  So to give a task like this to 
locals without training, without due referencing, without all 
this equipment… 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not… 
MR MANYIKE:   It would have been done in 1994 but it was 
20 
not because this is an exercise that needs people that are 
competent to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they must be trained to do it, ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 63 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am correct then to understand that 
what you are saying is that the assessment part of the job 
required or requires a contractor such as yourself to have 
somebody who goes to the house but does not need to 
enter the house but must see the house and in seeing the 
house, must look at what the state of the condition of the 
physical integrity of the house is. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then make a note of what they 
observed. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that the condition of the physical 
integrity of the house does not have to be connected to 
damage caused by asbestos. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is simply the condition of the house, 
the physical integrity of the house irrespective of what has 
caused it. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And that sums up the gist of your 
20 
understanding of what assessment in this context means.  
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could assist us on this side 
of the room just by way of summary.  You mentioned in you 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 64 of 223 
 
answer to the Chair that sometimes you encourage them to 
go into the yard.  Do I understand that correctly, not into 
the house, is that correct? 
MR MANYIKE:   That is correct, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The audit that you were required to 
do, I understand it, was to identify houses with asbestos 
roofs, correct? 
MR MANYIKE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not to identify houses that inside 
might contain asbestos in the ceiling in the water pipes or 
10 
in fascia boards and the like. 
MR MANYIKE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The visual – sorry, you wanted to 
add something? 
MR MANYIKE:   There is a distinction between what 
Human Settlements does and what the municipality does.  I 
accept that – I do agree that there are asbestos pipes that 
you do find but one needs to understand how government 
works and what government is responsible for.    
Those 
pipes, 
you 
would 
address 
it 
with 
the 
20 
municipality but in this case, you address it with Human 
Settlements.  So the asbestos is there but what we are 
looking at was on the houses, not the pipes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so you were not looking at 
the internal part of that house which might contain 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 65 of 223 
 
asbestos in a window sill, for example, or in a pipe or in a 
ceiling, you were looking at the roof of the house because, 
as I understand what you say, government works this way, 
there can be asbestos in the house, that is for one sphere 
of government but if there is asbestos on the roof that is a 
provincial responsibility? 
MR MANYIKE:   I am saying the pipes that were being 
referred to, normally those will be about pipes which are 
on the street, the municipality is taking care of that but 
from there on, if you come into the house – but I have 
10 
never seen a pipe of asbestos so there was no need for us 
to go to that extent.  Your focus on the house is the fascia 
boards, we looked into that.   
The roofs, we looked into that.  The windows, I 
have never seen – some of the houses you will find 
hundred percent, even the walls is asbestos, that is the 
situation in Pieter Steyn.   So we look at such things.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We understand that a house inside 
may contain asbestos products, inside the house. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What I understand your evidence 
to be is that your job was to identify houses with asbestos 
roofs. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not to go inside the house and to 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 66 of 223 
 
inspect whether there was asbestos damaged or otherwise 
inside the house. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you did the assessment or the 
audit, rather, let us stick with the audit for the moment, 
firstly by looking at aerial photographs and then where you 
identify 
it 
from 
the 
aerial 
photographs 
areas 
which 
contained 
or 
might 
contain 
asbestos 
roof, 
you 
sent 
fieldworkers to look at the house. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those fieldworkers were armed 
with tablets, similar to an iPad, and they were then asked 
to go to the house, look at it and take photographs. 
MR MANYIKE:   And assess, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And assess.  Now the assessment, 
as I understand it from your evidence, certainly now, was 
in order to look and understand the structural integrity of 
the house. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this work was done by people 
20 
who had had days training from the community. 
MR MANYIKE:   Matriculants that could read, write and 
that would demonstrate understanding.  During the training 
they were allowed to go and assess. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, one would have thought that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 67 of 223 
 
an accurate report on structural integrity could only be 
done by an expert. 
MR MANYIKE:   Can be approved by an expert, can be 
endorsed, 
but 
anyone 
with 
competency 
can 
do 
an 
assessment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So – but what the expert would do, 
perhaps 
in 
compiling 
the 
report, 
would 
look 
at 
the 
photograph presented by the fieldworker. 
MR MANYIKE:   And go on site. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did your experts go on site? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes we had people that were going on 
site, looking at the houses randomly.  A project of this 
nature an engineer cannot physically go to each and every 
house, no province would – it would be unaffordable that 
project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think somebody of the Commission 
staff must give Mr Manyike another bottle of water, I think 
he is running out of water.  Yes, okay, let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well let us go then to page 131 of 
your affidavit, if we may.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   131 of FS1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say the desktop analysis, 
which was the first step, took about two weeks to 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 68 of 223 
 
complete, 
with 
about 
six 
or 
seven 
people 
and 
that 
happened before 30 October 2014? 
MR MANYIKE:   That is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then in paragraph 42 you 
described how MasterTrade arranged its quote.  Please tell 
the Chair about that please? 
MR MANYIKE:   MasterTrade approached me regarding 
now the quotations and say can you draft a quotation that 
can be submitted to Blackhead and I drafted the quotation, 
this 
was 
an 
all-inclusive 
quotation. 
My 
fees 
and 
10 
MasterTrade fees also in excel and I emailed it to him 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did that quote amount to? 
MR MANYIKE:   It amounted to R44 208 567,90 that was 
excluding vat for him to submit to Blackhead.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What would MasterTrade’s profit be 
in all this? 
MR MANYIKE:   At that time, I did another spreadsheet for 
MasterTrade whereby I was showing him the profit margins.  
The profit for him would be around R50million that was 
supposed to be his profit.  There is a similar spreadsheet I 
20 
did for him but I would not want the idea that one looks at 
the R44million and say minus my fees and say that was his 
profit, no.   
          It was a joint effort I sent him, I say the profit there 
is a spreadsheet that I did for him that showed him.  The 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 69 of 223 
 
profit joined between myself and him it will be R33million, 
around 33 mil, then we will split it in half ways.  He will 
take half, I will take half.  That was the nature of the 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So anything outside the R33million was 
expenses that you were going to incur in order to carry out 
the order? 
MR MANYIKE:   The expenses is what I reflected on my 
contract but first of all I sent him a draft I think around the 
8 t h of October by email following my discussions with him 
10 
sort of like an agreement we had but now transacting that 
to paper by email.  And on that email, I specifically asked 
him to edit and read and sign the draft and he did do that, 
he came to me it was signed but before he printed it out, 
he called me on the phone and we negotiated further.  But 
he did not tell the truth initial this was a proposal I sent to 
him and say send it to Blackhead and he sent to 
Blackhead.   
          Then he came back and he said Blackhead wanted a 
discount they were not happy they say they feel the 
20 
amount is too high and by then I had sent him the draft.  
So after eight to nine days sitting with the draft he edited 
and produced the contract that we now have in front of us, 
that is how the figure went down.  So initially we were 
supposed to go fifty, fifty but there were stories that were 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 70 of 223 
 
told that brought my fees down.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We know from your evidence and 
your contract that your fee in MasterTrade amounted to 
R21million 
approximately. 
 
R11million 
would 
be 
your 
professional fee and the remainder 9 to R10million would 
be for expenses.  Am I correct? 
MR MANYIKE:   That is correct.      
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that was to do barring one or 
two exceptions which we can mention in due course for the 
whole of the work including writing of the reports. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Please say this again. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The expenses of 9 to R10million 
that we referred to in the contract which we showed to the 
Chair was for the whole of the work barring one or two 
items.  Mr Zwane’s fees for example software.  
MR MANYIKE:   The expenses of R9million. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you remember t the expenses 
and the contract between you and MasterTrade. 
20 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That was for the whole of the work. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Barring one or two items that we 
can talk about later. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 71 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you mentioned one being the 
cost of the software for R600,000.  
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   MasterTrade was going to charge 
the joint venture R44million in terms of the quote that you 
prepared.  
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What expenses for its share of the 
R44million would MasterTrade bare? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   For MasterTrade historic, oh let me not 
rather say historically - from my experience with the 
projects I have worked with here.  I do not know how - 
what is his engagement with other people but to me 
MasterTrade is – I see as a broker, as a middle man that is 
his function.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So its fee for being a middle man 
was half of R44million. 
MR MANYIKE:   That is my view.     
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of expertise and experience and 
20 
knowledge of doing this kind of work, do you know whether 
MasterTrade had that? 
MR MANYIKE:   In my…[intervenes]    
CHAIRPERSON:   I can put it differently and say why did 
they need you?  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 72 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Why did MasterTrade need me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   Because he would not have been able to 
render that service to Blackhead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would they not been able to render 
that service? 
MR MANYIKE:   It is the expertise, the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They do not have that expertise? 
MR MANYIKE:   On other projects MasterTrade he has 
been working as a social facilitator.  When I say social 
10 
facilitator, I mean when there is a project, he will be 
someone that will go to the ward councillors, the politicians 
and the people and speak social issues and taking care of 
the politics.  That is what he has been doing.  Even on the 
– he made some mention about the politics he did in 
Pretoria 
saying 
there 
- 
 
giving 
an 
impression 
that 
Blackhead was aware.  Maybe he lied to Blackhead I do not 
want to say he lied.  That is maybe that is the information 
he gave Blackhead to say I did this, I did but he did not do 
it.  He was a social facilitator taking care of the politics on 
20 
projects.  So I thought maybe on the Free State Project he 
will do that but I found myself doing that in Free State he 
never did it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And how long have you known them or 
have you had interactions with them MasterTrade? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 73 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Sorry Chair I closed the file on this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I am sorry, for how long have you 
known them MasterTrade, how long have you known them 
or interacted with them in projects? 
MR MANYIKE:   We met when he needed assistance with a 
set of a project in Tembisa they were doing beneficiary 
administration there.  I gave him a quote, he paid, there is 
a proof of payment and I gave him an invoice.  And then 
there was another project in Komissiza they were doing 
regulisation there.  I think with Mochota Nation LTE 
10 
(11;27), Tembisa was also, it was also LTE.  So he was 
working under those people.   
          So he would approach me and say brother help me 
but he would approach me in my capacity as the sole 
Director of ORI Group and I will give him a quotation it 
would be followed by an invoice and there will be a proof 
of payment.  All this things I am saying now they are 
discovered in the court papers everything is filled there. 
Our relationship with MasterTrade from the word go has 
always been formal.  I have never dealt with him like I will 
20 
you know dealing with my brother there with my brother 
there on top and say, ja.  I am not referred as a friend.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it has been a business relationship? 
MR MANYIKE:   It has always been formal in business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 74 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So but you say you have dealt with them 
with for this kind of job they did not have the expertise and 
that is why they needed you. 
MR MANYIKE:   And they did not have the expertise but I 
do not know if Blackhead was aware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   But I saw some papers where he wrote as 
if - taking all glory and the credit but he never did the 
work. He has always been and I will repeat that he has 
10 
always been a social facilitator when I met him.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But tell me about this role of social 
facilitator.  Do you know - are there quite a few of people 
who play that role in regard to government work tenders 
and so on of people who play that role and get paid 
money? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, you know this term social facilitation 
is even recognised by Gauteng with regards to a tariff to 
PRT’s.  I think there is an item for social facilitation you do 
get paid to perform that task and I have seen it also with 
20 
mega projects.  I remember when we were doing the King 
Shaka International Airport I was doing the model for that 
for the airports there.  There was a company that was 
taking care of the politics so this is a trend I can see when 
it comes to this mega projects. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 75 of 223 
 
          There is a need to have someone who will make 
sure that - when I say they are taking care of the politics I 
am not referring to bribery or anything.  To make sure that 
the message reaches your councillors, your locals, your 
MEC and there is unity within the wards there is no 
competition.  So that will be a function of a social 
facilitator that is what he will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it is very – it sounds very strange 
to me I mean if there is a bridge to be built there is a road 
to be built it might be other things other than asbestos 
10 
projects.  The politicians you know the government officials 
should be the ones telling the public what is happening.  
Why should there be people who add millions of rand’s or 
playing this social role but who are not actually doing the 
work.  
MR MANYIKE:   That is a good position Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:   If you think of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes…[intervenes]    
MR MANYIKE:   Why must we… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we need an engineer, we need 
whoever to build a bridge or build a road those are the 
people we need and then government must appoint those 
people and they do that.  Why do you need anybody else if 
you need to tell the committee what is happening the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 76 of 223 
 
government department, the officials in the government 
departments and the politicians can tell the community. 
MR MANYIKE:   I would say from experience Chair I have 
noticed that the moment the project when it is a road it 
goes through five or seven or eight wards I am talking 
about the roads now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MANYIKE:   And the skills required maybe is ten 
people or seven people that is where fights starts now to 
say who must work there.  So you do need someone like 
10 
that on the project to you know to engage the councillors 
and the people on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To stop fighting about this project. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, normally with mega projects – and 
then you will find this informal structures erupting they call 
them business forums…[intervenes]    
CHAIRPERSON:   Who make demands… 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, they don’t account to anyone and 
then the councillor cannot control those people so that is 
where these social people they are able to relate to them.  
20 
But this is the reality of what is happening on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is some people may be making all 
kinds of demands which have got no basis and they should 
be dealt with by government but now government must 
appoint other people and pay them millions to sort out that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 77 of 223 
 
problem.  Okay I guess Mr Manyike some of the things I am 
asking you are things that you know you might not be able 
to answer you know nothing about.  You just telling me 
what your experience is and what you have observed. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what is instructive is that for 
and not unreasonable profit margin or professional fee you 
could do this work for R21million.  The social facilitator 
facilitates for a 100% of it to take it up to R44million, so it 
10 
is now double the cost for social facilitation.   
          Something which the Chair quite rightly points out 
would be done by the ward councillors and provincial 
representatives.  But then we have a situation where this 
project quite apart from social facilitation and the work 
cost R225million.  What role did Mr Mpambani and Mr Sodi 
play? High level social facilitator. 
MR MANYIKE:   The role of Mr Mpambani I think that one 
Mr Sodi is best equipped to explain to the Chair because 
Mr Mpambani was part of the JV I was reporting to them.  
20 
They were my seniors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But on the ground in terms of the work 
being done you are not able to say you know what he did, 
whatever he did would not have been on the ground.  
MR MANYIKE:   On the ground Mr Mpambani did not do 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 78 of 223 
 
anything.       
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, okay. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on then to you just 
mentioned so that your evidence is complete. 
MR MANYIKE:   I just want to establish something which 
maybe I forgot to establish, to explain.  In terms of the 
hierarchy of things it was the two Directors Blackhead JV 
and then under it, it was MasterTrade and then underneath 
it, it was myself.  And then across there was a man 
10 
heading Zenawe, Martin Zwane it was a company on his 
own but also doing with the management and looking after 
the interest of I would say Blackhead or the JV.   
          But I also know there were other professionals that 
worked parallel to what I was doing because every time I 
do a report I will be required to send it through to Martin 
Zwane who was a project manager on there of the JV to 
review it and maybe and advise if I need to do one, two, 
three, four.  There are four reports which I submitted or 
those four reports…[intervenes]    
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will get to them 
MR MANYIKE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Unless you want to say something 
briefly about them. 
MR MANYIKE:   Look I want to say partly there was work 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 79 of 223 
 
which was done by a man by the name of Steve. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Steve Matao? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, Steve. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we will get to him.  But we 
know from evidence that perhaps you do not have that 
Martin Zwane of Zenawe was apparently a third sub-
contractor to the joint venture and we know that he was 
paid R10million.  
MR MANYIKE:   Martin Zwane? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, but that is apparent from the 
10 
papers but we will ask Mr Sodi about it.  But was there 
anyone else working for the joint venture that you know of 
besides Mr Matao and Mr Zwane that was involved in the 
production of the reports? 
MR MANYIKE:   It was only Martin Zwane and Steve and 
when we get to there the issue of the reports, I will 
indicate which ones where I was given, where we worked 
jointly.  But the person that I was – I worked throughout 
with him was Martin Zwane but I am the author of all those 
reports, yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If one looks at paragraph 48 on 
page 132 of FS1 one will see their how the R44million 
quotation was made up by yourself and that was at the rate 
of a R147,36 to inspect the house.  
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct, R147.00.     
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 80 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   R147,36. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that is a substantial discount 
from R850,00 which is the fee that the joint venture 
charged.  
MR MANYIKE:   I will not say it is a discount, no I think… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it is substantially less. 
MR MANYIKE:   Ja, I was comfortable with what I was 
being paid.  I was comfortable with that R21million.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no what Mr Pretorius means is 
10 
simply that the R147,00 is substantially much less than the 
R800,00 and something a house that had been quoted by 
the joint venture to the department. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In the event the ORI Group put into 
the paragraph 55 of your statement on page 133 was only 
paid R6 133 716,00. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 56 could you give the 
20 
Commission an idea of what you actually did.  In paragraph 
58.1 the numbering is incorrect Chair but…[intervenes]    
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I missed that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 81 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The sub-paragraphs are numbered 
58. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But if you could - and perhaps I 
should leave you just so that we can get through this 
quickly.  How many fieldworkers or foot soldiers as you 
describe them did you hire to do the field work, the 
physical inspections of the houses?  
MR MANYIKE:   184.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did you train them? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, through my nine assistant project 
managers, nine or ten.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How long did that training take? 
MR MANYIKE:   It was progressive but we could train 28 
people with four hours would be enough to train them and 
then what would happen the next day we would follow them 
for the whole week and see how they are performing.  And 
even on the system I was able to see if mistakes are being 
made and we correct it right there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the initial training in order to 
20 
identify the roof material and in order to do the structural 
assessment was four hours. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, four hours. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then you say it was ongoing 
through monitoring? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 82 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But in paragraph 58.2 you say you 
hired a number of other people.  Who were they? 
MR MANYIKE:   I had the quality assures, assistant project 
managers, district managers.  District managers these 
were, they were reporting directly to me, taking care of 
different districts.  GI special needs I was – ORI Group 
hired a senior project manager which is me, HOD for ORI 
Group.  We bought food, we hired cars, accommodation, 
training all these expenses were paid by ORI Group. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now apart from those persons 
mentioned in paragraph 58.1 and 58.2 and apart from 
Matao and Zwane was anyone else necessary to do the 
work? 
MR MANYIKE:    
MR MANYIKE:   Was anyone necessary to…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do the work. 
MR MANYIKE:   To do the work. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  
MR MANYIKE:   Not in my view.  
20 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then you mentioned that the field 
workers received four hours of training and ongoing 
monitoring to improve their skills.  You deal with their work 
in paragraph 58.3.  How much were they paid per house? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 83 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:   Each field worker I paid R6,50 per house.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And your second sentence in 
paragraph 58.3 is also interesting.  How long would it take 
as you put it the most inefficient field worker who ordered 
one house? 
MR MANYIKE:   Which paragraph is that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   58.3 on page 134 of FS1.  
MR MANYIKE:   The most ja ineffective will take five 
minutes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the most effective? 
10 
MR MANYIKE:   They can do it in three, four minutes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then if we go onto – and by the 
way this is to identify the asbestos roof and to do a 
structural 
assessment 
sufficient 
enough 
to 
allow 
the 
compilation of a report later.  Correct? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry you must… 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We go to paragraph 58.4 you say 
you supplied the field worker with all the necessary 
20 
equipment and you trained them you have dealt with all 
those things previously.  In paragraph 57 you talk about 
the technology used in the execution of the Free State 
Project that is the software that was required to capture 
and process all the information that you put in through that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 84 of 223 
 
software.  Do I understand you correctly? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that would facilitate the 
production of a report? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in paragraph 68 page 140 you 
summarise in paragraph 68 you say as such the houses 
containing asbestos with clear reference in that GPS 
coordinates for houses containing or suspected to contain 
asbestos were logged.  Now when you say containing 
10 
asbestos, I presume what you really mean – or let me ask 
you an open question.  Do you mean a house with an 
asbestos roof? 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes I mean a house with an asbestos roof.  
I think I have lost you but I agree with what you have just 
asked me now.  Where are in terms of the… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 68 where you say in 
summary what was done. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, I agree with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then paragraph 70 you say we 
20 
took photographs of the houses containing asbestos and 
looked at the structural nature of the houses and recorded 
any structural damage as a defect.  How was that done by 
photograph? 
MR MANYIKE:   By also doing assessments so if you had 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 85 of 223 
 
on that gadget there was a questionnaire that the field 
workers would fill in needing them as per our training to 
say when you do assessments document all these things 
also.   
          So yes a photograph was important and it was not 
required by the way but it was something which we felt you 
know we needed proof also ourselves from the field 
workers and there would be that questionnaire that they 
would fill it in as they are doing their assessment.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 58 on page 137 you 
10 
mentioned that the joint venture had other professionals 
and, in that context, you told the Chair of Mr Zwane and Mr 
Matao, Steve Matao. 
MR MANYIKE:   Can you please say again. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 58 on 137…[intervenes]    
MR MANYIKE:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You mentioned that you are aware 
that the joint venture had other professionals that were 
working in tandem with you. 
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did they actually do, did they 
work with you in preparing the report as I understand it? 
MR MANYIKE:   Steve Matao when we doing the critical 
scope report.  He assisted in terms of contributing towards 
the remedial work that was needed and there were other 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 86 of 223 
 
like beyond that the work he did I never saw it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Mr Pretorius that we do actually 
have two paragraphs 58 with two paragraphs 58.  The one 
you were referring to is the second one the other one was 
supposed to have been 57 ne, the one that had sub-
paragraphs?  Ja, so any reference in the transcript to the 
earlier paragraph 58.1 on one or whatever that is the first 
58, the second 58 is at page 137 that is the one where Mr 
Manyike says I am aware that the joint venture had other 
professional’s blah, blah. 
10 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Yes 
unfortunately, 
I 
am…[intervenes]    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I just want to…[intervenes]    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a third paragraph 58 at 
the bottom of page 137. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we would not hold Mr 
Manyike…[intervenes]    
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that there is paragraph 57 coming 
after the second paragraph 58. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes the numbering unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh there is actually a third oh ja you, 
okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But let us clarify the paragraph 
that I am referring to is the paragraph on page 137 the first 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 87 of 223 
 
paragraph 58.   
MR MANYIKE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say there that I am aware that 
the joint venture had other professionals you mentioned Mr 
Zwane and Matao.  And what contribution did they make to 
the compilation of the final product that is the reports that 
you prepared and authored? 
MR MANYIKE:   Mr Zwane from the preliminary reports to 
the final report to the houses to be prioritised reports and I 
think that is all the reports and with the implementation 
10 
plan.  All those reports he would view them and make 
comments on the reports.  As a project manager on behalf 
of the JV.  That was his task he would make sure that the 
project is on track we not slacking behind and that the 
quality of documents were produced and other functions as 
project manager would perform in line with the agreement 
with Blackhead.   
          As for Steve – so Martin Zwane he was there 
throughout.  As for Steve he came later when it was 
required of him to do so to look for – what I did with him I 
20 
do not want to speculate.  I sat with Steve and Martin we 
look at the remedial work on this houses and jointly we 
compile that document together.  Beyond that it is only 
Martin Zwane and Blackhead that can give an indication as 
to what Steve did but it is correct of me to say I was aware 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 88 of 223 
 
that I was not the only person working on the project.  
There were other people like Martin Zwane and Steve, I 
was aware.  Those two I did work with them with the 
project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will learn what they were paid 
in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe in the meantime while Mr 
Pretorius is preparing his next question can you just tell 
me again, I think I asked you this question but I am not 
sure that I remember what your answer was.  What the 
10 
significance was of the field workers noting whether the 
house was done or not.  What is the significance of 
whether a house is plastered or not in this context? 
MR MANYIKE:   Chair if – let us say for arguments sake if 
the house is not plastered, this house is plastered, this 
house is plastered, this one is not plastered.  So if you 
were to remove the roof and replace it the house that was 
not plastered will just put back the bricks.  There is no 
additional cost of trying to repair the plaster but this house 
that was plastered if you remove the roof you will damage 
20 
the plaster.  So to some extent you will have to chip maybe 
300,00 from the roof chip it, clean it and put back the 
plasters.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANYIKE:   So that is why it is good to document it 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 89 of 223 
 
because we know it will be a cost, it will come with cost 
implications later on.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I would like to show you a report 
that was addressed by Mr Roets who gave evidence this 
week.  A document which appears in bundle 8 at page 270. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is bundle FS8? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS8 page 270 the report dated 2 
February 2015 is marked final audit report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the page number Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  270. 
CHAIRPERSON:  270. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of FS8.  Now if I could ask you 
please I know it is difficult because your space is limited.  If 
you could just look at Free State 9 FS9 as well.  And open 
that at page 2 just to tell you what that document is.  Page 2 
of FS9 and we will look at page 3 when we get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page on Bundle FS9? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS9 page 2 is the cover page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And page 3 is the page that I would 
ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Manyike to comment on.  Let us 
start with the document at page 270 of FS8.  This is – is it 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 90 of 223 
 
correct one of the report prepared by you and authored by 
you? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes, yes it is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  In relation to a particular 
house as opposed to general observations that you might 
make regarding the quantity of houses in a particular area 
what information did the report contain? 
MR MANYIKE:  Please put your question again. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to a particular house that 
was identified through the desktop exercise.  We know that 
10 
36 000 houses approximately were identified as a result of 
the exercise.  What information was given in the report in 
relation to any single house? 
MR MANYIKE:  Okay.  Every single house what we will do 
we came up with a template to say the Department when we 
give a report on a particular house, we would want all the 
information to be contained on one page.  We give a design 
and we also give a questionnaire on what the Department 
would want to see.  So an example of that of what transpired 
is as per page number 3. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of FS9? 
MR MANYIKE:  Page… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That – that document you looking at. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is page number 3 you are correct. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 91 of 223 
 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja it is page number 3. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But it is contained in – just for record 
purposes Bundle FS9. 
MR MANYIKE:  Ja FS9.  Yes.  That would be the outcome. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So in relation to a particular house 
one would present to the provincial authorities information 
as 
to 
its 
location 
particularly 
by 
reference 
to 
GPS 
coordinates. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There would be beneficiary details.  
10 
Would that be the owner of the house? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which in this case is blank.  I 
presume that is because nobody went into the house. 
MR MANYIKE:  No it was not required.  It was a given from 
us. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright okay. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Then 
you 
had 
the 
structural 
assessment report. 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And the structural assessment 
report contains the following information.  The roof material, 
right?  The roof type.  I must say I do not know much about 
the terminology used in building but you describe this as a 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 92 of 223 
 
pitch roof.  Is that a pitch roof in the photograph or a flat 
roof? 
MR MANYIKE:  It is mono-pitch.  It could be also pitch.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it is not clear from the 
photograph you say.  To me it is just one – a one 
dimensional roof.  It looks flat to me but I am not the expert 
you are. 
MR MANYIKE:  No it is mono-pitch and I must add it to you 
that to say to take those off these houses was not a 
requirement.  This is something we did extra.  But that is 
10 
why it was important to go on the ground and physically look 
at these things. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so the picture that is here behind 
the bush is a bonus? 
MR MANYIKE:  No it is not.  It is not a bonus. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But you say it was not required. 
MR MANYIKE:  No I am saying it was a control measure on 
our side to enforce quality and to make sure that things are 
done accordingly.  So on this page you – on this report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well if it was a control measure – 
20 
sorry to interrupt you then it was necessary. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say yes? 
MR MANYIKE:  No I am saying this is not something that we 
were paid to do but we did it for Free State. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 93 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us leave the photograph 
and let us look at the report. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It says:  Roof material asbestos. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It then says Roof Type: Pitch.  In 
there says House Type:  Single.  But there says Finishes on 
the wall:  Plastered.  It says Visible Wall Cracks:  No.  It 
says:   House Extended:  Yes.  And it says:  Solar Geyser:  
No.  Is that the structural assessment report that was 
10 
provided in respect of each house? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that was the structural. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If I may just ask?  You cannot see 
any cracks in the photograph but you say that was not 
something that was required.  Simply this – the broad 
statement visible wall cracks yes or no how does that help 
any assessment in regard to what needs to be done?  
Whether the roof can be replaced or whether anybody could 
quote on any remedial action. 
MR MANYIKE:  What we will qualify as a crack to be noted 
20 
here it will be a crack that is more than 3 millimetres.  So 
once it has been noted here it is something that the assessor 
is indicated that we need to look at – we need to look at.  So 
there was a need for a warm body to go into the house to go 
into the yard and physically look at the houses.  So the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 94 of 223 
 
people were trained as to how to assess this.  These are the 
cracks that you must note not just any crack.  If it is a minor 
crack it is left alone.  It will be recorded as no crack. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You see the report that you give to 
the province just says visible wall cracks yes or no.  It does 
not say well 3 millimetres – lots of cracks – 10 millimetres – 
one crack. 
MR MANYIKE:  That is true Advocate hence there was a 
need.  If you can look at after the final audit report there was 
a need by province to say, guys elaborate further.  That is 
10 
why we came with the critical scope report whereby we 
indicated when we talk about the crack what is it meant by 
that?  What must be paid attention to?  So there is that 
document that said it was a joint effort that we did with Steve 
and Martin. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Do I understand you 
correctly I am not sure I do understand you but do I 
understand you correctly if I say to you what you said to the 
province is you are going to have to do more work to 
establish the detail in relation to the structural condition of 
20 
the house. 
MR MANYIKE:  To do more work in terms of assessment? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You are going to have to go and 
inspect and… 
MR MANYIKE:  No.  What we did was final.  One from the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 95 of 223 
 
document we produced that is why I was saying Chair I 
would like to go back to my observation I made on Tuesday.  
As I was sitting at home watching the commission from the 
file the expert had because that is a similar file, I saw also 
the investigators were having I could see there were serious 
documents missing from that file.  I did not want to put it out 
there to say the department somehow, they need help, they 
need to go back to the author and say, help us put this thing 
together.  Because there were issues that were mentioned 
even by the experts of bills of quantities.  He even 
10 
mentioned to a particular rate of removing the roof.  All those 
rates were there.  To some extent he gave even the value of 
how much the project would be.  But he never mentioned a 
single word about replacing the roof or putting it back.  But 
that is a discussion for another day.  I just wanted to give 
that to you Chair that the work we did one needs to 
understand the processes that projects follow.  From 
inception to conceptualisation to preliminary to detail.  So it 
is 
not 
all 
projects 
whereby 
you 
do 
everything 
until 
construction 
drawings. 
 
Some 
projects 
you 
do 
until 
20 
preliminary.  Others you do like until detail.  But a document 
that was produced here is sufficient for any contractor to 
tender and start working.  Well there will be other things 
maybe there and there that might be required but this is 
sufficient.  And this was discussed and agreed upon with the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 96 of 223 
 
department to say, this is what we are going to give you and 
the answer was, yes go ahead and we did just that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Mr Manyike for the moment 
there is – let me put it this way.  For the moment the 
questions that you are being asked to answer do not go to 
whether you did what you were required to do or whether you 
did not do what you were required to do that the provincial 
department can answer to what they instructed you to do.  
Let us assume for the moment you did what you were 
instructed to do I would like to know for the benefit of the 
10 
commission and the Chair in order to assess what the 
province mandated and paid R230 million for what the 
outcome of that was?  Now in respect of a particular house 
you have seen the document at Free State 9 page 3 and you 
have told the commission, you have told the Chair that this 
was the outcome of the report in relation to any particular 
house. Do I have that correct? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By reason of the fact that generally 
speaking your field workers would not enter the house but 
20 
you did say that sometimes they would.  But by reason of the 
fact that generally they would not would you agree that as 
far as the physical integrity of structural integrity of the 
house is concerned if there were serious cracks inside the 
house on the walls for example that would therefore mean 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 97 of 223 
 
that as long as they were – they did not show outside they 
would not be picked up by the field workers? 
MR MANYIKE:  Chair a crack that is worth noting will either 
be caused by the foundation or the roof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MANYIKE:  And it is not every crack that you would 
register as a crack that is worth to be repaired.  It has to be 
within certain millimetres.  So as a – as a rule we gave it to 
them and fill in the millimetres.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  So sometimes if you find a crack that is 
inside the house to answer your question now it does not – it 
is not visible on the outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MANYIKE:  Hey there could be a lot of debates to say is 
this worth noting or not?  But a crack that is worth noting is 
a crack that goes throughout. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MANYIKE:  Because it shows that there is a structure – 
there is a serious structural problems that is what the field 
20 
worker knows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  One last question and then we do 
want to give you an opportunity and I will address the Chair 
in a moment to make any final comment you want to do.  The 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 98 of 223 
 
inspection of the house to ascertain whether it had an 
asbestos roof or not was a visual inspection as I understand 
it. 
MR MANYIKE:  It was a visual yes, yes it was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair in fairness to Mr Manyike he 
should have an opportunity to make any further comments he 
wishes to and to consider whether he wants to do so.  We 
will make available the documents we have so that he can go 
through them.  So would this be a convenient time if Mr 
Manyike does not wish to make further comment we will 
10 
begin with the next witness. 
MR MANYIKE:  I wish to make a comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do wish? 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright before you do so let me say 
that there might need to be a further exercise to be done in 
terms of which Mr Manyike maybe has full access to what Mr 
Roets said so that – and what he was basing his evidence on 
so that Mr Manyike may look at that properly and maybe be 
able to – to comment properly.  Because I heard that he 
20 
seems to think that the report or the documents he was 
referring to they might – there might be something wrong 
with them or whatever or they might not have been adequate 
to enable him to express any opinion, that kind of thing and 
then maybe it is fair that that should happen because  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 99 of 223 
 
1. Effectively Mr Roets was critical of the work that was 
done and 
2. Mr Manyike also is critical of at least certain aspects of 
the evidence of Mr Roets so that in due course we can 
reach a point where we know exactly what each one of 
them has to say about the relevant issues. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair and perhaps then rather 
than do it piecemeal. 
MR MANYIKE:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We can… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it might be… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Consult with Mr Manyike over the 
long adjournment.  It may be preferable and he may consider 
collating all the information, getting a transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of Mr Roets’ evidence and then 
coming back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So that he can give a considered and 
complete answer rather than rushing the matter over one 
20 
adjournment with perhaps incomplete documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Manyike you have heard what I 
have said.  Another opportunity may be given to you after 
you have had an opportunity to look at his evidence – Mr 
Roets’ evidence properly.  Look at exactly what documents 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 100 of 223 
 
he was basing his evidence on and then comment properly 
on it maybe by way of an affidavit initially and if necessary, 
you come back and comment on it properly.  When Mr Roets 
finished his evidence also earlier this week I did say to him 
he needed to identify what documents he might not have 
been given which would be important for – for his use and it 
was contemplated that possibly later on he would provide 
another affidavit where he would be able to say, I have now 
been given everything that I think I should have been given 
to be able to give an opinion and I stay with your opinion 
10 
that I expressed earlier on or I am qualifying it because of – 
of what I have now seen.  Or I give a completely different 
opinion in the light of what I have seen.  So that process will 
happen with him as well.  And it may well be that he might be 
asked to come back as well.  In the light of whatever 
criticism of his evidence you might have so that all of – that 
may be tested.  So – so in the light of that would you still 
like to say something now or would you prefer to have 
another chance to say something after you have looked at 
everything? 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  We can still have another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MANYIKE:  I can still – yes I can still participate Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  Of which the staff will guide me as to what 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 101 of 223 
 
needs to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  In terms of the protocols and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  But the statement I wanted to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  Was to – was to say – was also to help the 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bring your microphone closer to you so I 
can hear. 
10 
MR MANYIKE:  Was to help the commission so that you 
know people that must account when they have to come here 
and they know that things are not in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANYIKE:  It might be hard for them to account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  So I am appealing to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  To say go to the author. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MANYIKE:  Get all the documents so that when you 
come to the commission you can speak about what you 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MANYIKE:  That is all I am saying. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 102 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  That is in closing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think that is a fair point.  Purely 
from the point that I said to Mr Roets because I saw in his 
own statement that he indicated this is what I am basing this 
on what I have been given.  And I got the impression that he 
might have wished to have been given more.  So that is why 
I said he should identify what is that he was not given that 
10 
he would like to have.  And I think based on what you are 
saying you yourself are saying if the commission wishes to 
have any documents from you that he wishes to look at you 
are – you are open to make that available so that you can all 
speak from – on the same page. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I was going to ask Mr Manyike 
20 
over the long adjournment whilst he was doing the other 
exercise to just look at a list of expenses that those 
contained in the affidavit of Mr Radebe of MasterTrade if. 
MR MANYIKE:  I have looked at those expenses.  I have 
seen his expenses. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 103 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  May I do that now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It will not take long.  Let me just take 
you there please to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which bundle? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  FS1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle FS1 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Page 349 is the affidavit of Mr 
Radebe and the list of expenses appears at paragraph 16 on 
page 359.  So for example, you record airtime on your 
10 
expense list which you said was the total cost for airtime 
when you did that work.  On your expenses was R600 000.00 
here we see it is R3 million.  Would you comment please just 
briefly on the expenses in paragraph 16 of Mr Radebe’s 
affidavit please?  Page 359 you got it? 
MR MANYIKE:  What page is it? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  359 paragraph 16.  Mr Radebe says: 
“These were the expenses of MasterTrade.” 
This is his version.  Clearly it is different from your version 
but the – for example 16.4 he says: 
20 
“MasterTrade expenses for airtime and data for everybody 
involved a total cost of more or less R3 million.” 
Differs 
substantially 
from 
yours 
which 
talks 
about 
an 
expense much less than a R1 million. 
MR MANYIKE:  Hey Chair. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 104 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But let me not put words in your 
mouth just would you comment on the contents of paragraph 
16? 
MR MANYIKE:  Chair this is the question I have been waiting 
for the whole day.  This question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you have got it. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MANYIKE:  What is written about these costs cannot 
stand in any court or anywhere because it does not exist. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  These costs? 
MR MANYIKE:  And they do not be even proven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANYIKE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So these costs were not incurred. 
MR MANYIKE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By MasterTrade it is not true? 
MR MANYIKE:  It is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Are you done Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Can I release Mr Manyike? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are done. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We will be in contact with Mr 
Manyike. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 105 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To give him all the information he 
requires to enable him to make full comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you very much Mr 
Manyike 
for 
coming 
to 
the 
commission 
to 
assist 
the 
commission. 
 
We 
appreciate 
it 
very 
much 
and 
the 
commission will be in touch with you to do the further 
exercise and maybe there would be a need for you to come 
back but then you will be contacted.  Okay thank you.  We 
are going to take the lunch adjournment now and we will 
10 
resume at – it is now eight minutes past one we will resume 
at ten past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi is the 
next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  His counsel wishes to address you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  I shall not 
be long and I can assure you Mr Chairperson that Mr Sodi is 
here to cooperate fully, there is no issue whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I am sorry.  They did not sanitise for 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 106 of 223 
 
you. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you.  What ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think they will sanitise.  Otherwise, you 
can address me from where you were if that is more 
convenient but I think they sanitise immediately.   
 
Oh, okay.  Or even from where you were seated.  Where 
is the sanitiser and everything now? 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Mr Chair, it is set up for Mr 
Pretorius.  It is unnecessary to move everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  It is part of our spirit of 
cooperation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  What I would like to just put on 
record, if I may is that Mr Sodi has tendered his full 
cooperation and respect to this Commission.  There is no 
issue about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  He does, however, as you in your 
life as the Deputy Chief Justice would appreciate have 
20 
certain constitutional rights, not before this Commission 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I think from where you are, I 
am struggling to hear.  Maybe because of the noise.  Let 
them finish sanitising there.  Then I think I will hear then 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 107 of 223 
 
better from there. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  What I was saying is, Mr Sodi 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I can hear you quite well. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Mr Sodi tenders his full 
cooperation.  We are working in the spirit of absolute 
cooperation in respect for the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  The only thing that we wish to 
record is to contextualise his evidence and to explain that he 
has, as you would appreciate in your other capacities as the 
Deputy Chief Justice’s rights.  Not in this Commission.  He is 
aware of the regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Which I will refer to.  But he just 
wants... wanted me to record on his behalf how it came 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  And to contextualise his 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  So just to give you a brief 
chronology, so you... which does also appear from his 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 108 of 223 
 
statement but I just want to highlight a few dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Put a few things on record and 
then he... then we may commence with his testimony.  So the 
first notice that he received in terms of Rule 3.3 to appear 
here was in relation to the evidence of Mr Dukwana on the 
19t h of August 2019. 
 
He 
then 
received 
an 
email 
from 
the 
investigator 
requesting an interview on the 7t h of October 2019.  That 
interview was attended by him and... at the offices of the 
10 
investigators on the 22 nd of October 2019. 
 
There were then certain arrangements made and it was 
anticipated that he will be attending and testify on the 
9t h of December 2019.  There were problems then but not on 
the account of Mr Sodi.  It was caused by the legal team who 
were not available.   
 
So it was then decided that on the 11t h of December 
2019, he would receive a summons which he did.  That 
summons requested a date and no dates have been set in 
stone but we then discussed the dates. 
20 
 
We were cooperating.  There was a request for a 
statement 
from 
him 
on 
the 
12t h 
of 
February 
2020.  
Unfortunately, we then went into the National Lockdown 
whilst we were in the midst of preparing that statement which 
commenced from the 27t h of March 2020. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 109 of 223 
 
 
We worked through the lockdown Mr Chairperson and we 
have provided his statement that was his first statement on 
the 3r d of April 2020.08.07 
 
We were, subsequently, faced with a request for further 
additional information on the 12 t h of May 2020 which we then 
undertook to provide. 
 
It was difficult because of the lockdown and at the same 
time, and this is the major issue that I wish to place on 
record, was that on the 14t h and the 15t h of May 2020, we 
were informed that there was a criminal docket opened and 
10 
that the Free State HAWKS were investigating Mr Sodi which 
is the purpose of this address. 
 
We then explained that we had the difficulty obtaining 
certain banking records.  We were declined the records but 
then there was a process of negotiation and the Commission 
made some banking records available to us that would take 
us to the 15t h of June 2020 when we have received that. 
 
Subsequent to that, we have received several Rule 3.3 
notices enable to prepare together with a request for further 
information. 
20 
 
We were then told Mr Chairperson that we will be 
testifying 
at... 
sometime 
between 
the 
1 s t 
to 
the 
4t h of September 2020 and we agreed dates and cleared our 
diaries for that. 
 
We then had a meeting our attorneys’ offices at 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 110 of 223 
 
Fluxmans 
Attorneys 
with 
the 
investigators 
on 
the 
10t h of July 2020, and we... even at that meeting confirmed 
that it would fit in with the dates of the 4 t h to the... the 1s t to 
the 4t h of September 2020. 
 
However, subsequent to that, the dates were brought 
forward as I am quite certain that you will be aware Mr 
Chairperson.  So it was moved on the 14t h of July 2020 to 
this week, the 3rd to the 7t h of August.  We agreed to the 7t h 
of August and had to clear our diaries which we then did. 
 
And the problem that we had, which does appear from 
10 
the second statement which was provided, is not all of the 
information has been available or been made available to us 
in a short time because it was expedited. 
 
But Mr Sodi will and you will hear it from him as well 
under oath, provide the further information as and when he 
is in a position to do so once he has those documents to 
hand. 
 
Summons was served on the 20t h of July 2020.  What 
then happened is, I have no doubt that are aware, is that the 
Regulation 11 of the Regulations pertaining to Proclamation 
20 
4 of 2020 were amended to make that evidence now 
applicable. 
 
Subsequent to that, on the 30t h of July we received 
further Rule 3. 3 notices that the people were attending.  
And then on the 4 t h of August 2020, which is Tuesday of this 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 111 of 223 
 
week, we have provided Mr Sodi’s additional affidavit where 
there are. 
 
And I need to put on record, certain information and 
documents are still missing but we will make them available.  
What we wish to refer to, as clearly as you Mr Chairperson 
you would be aware, his rights in a criminal trial. 
 
This is not a criminal trial.  He has been made aware of 
the provisions of the regulations and most specifically 6, 8 
and 11.   
 
Six being his right to presentation, eight being his 
10 
obligation to answer and eleven being that previously all this 
information was regarded a secret but now a provision is 
made for the sharing of information. 
 
I need to record, unless to be criticised later on Mr 
Chairperson that should any criminal trial be instituted 
against Mr Sodi in due course, it is our instructions and it is 
his right to then rely on his constitutional rights as embodies 
in Section 35 of the Constitution which protects an accused, 
arrested and detained persons.   
 
He will then fit into that category that here you can be 
20 
rest assured and we have been assured in similar terms, Mr 
Sodi is here to fully cooperate and answer every question to 
the best of his ability on the information available and in the 
time available to prepare. 
 
I thank you Mr Commissioner.  May I ask one question 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 112 of 223 
 
unrelated to that?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  And it is more and I... please, do 
not see it as an impertinence.  There was a talk of either 
running late today or running on another date and the 
election was that we would run late today if possible, with 
the view to finalise and getting as far as we can.  Until what 
time would that be just so that everyone can make necessary 
arrangements?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I have flexibility on my side.  If we go 
10 
beyond four o’clock, five o’clock, I am quite happy to go to 
see... I can go to seven but also it depends if we are not 
going to finish and even with those additional hours, then it 
will be necessary to come back.  Then we could look at that 
at four o’clock or five o’clock 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And... but if there is preference that we try 
and finish today, from my side I certainly can go even up to 
seven.  Ja. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  No, we are in a similar position.  
20 
Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay.   
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, before you go.  I just want to mention 
something.  I certainly have not heard or I do not remember 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 113 of 223 
 
that I have had any complaint of no cooperation from Mr Sodi 
or his lawyers recently.   
 
But last year, in the second half of the year, I have had 
some complaints and the complaints were along the lines 
that 
while 
there 
had 
been 
cooperation 
in 
arranging 
interviews and so on. 
 
And there were delays in the furnishing of his affidavits 
or statements despite certain undertaking having been made 
in terms of deadlines.  I do recall that. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  I concede that.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  We had difficulty obtaining the 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  And there were delays in 
December and similarly caused by the lockdown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  That is submitted on his part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  So I just 
wanted to say ...[intervenes]  
20 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Yes, it is fair.  It has been put on 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...that there was some but I have not heard 
of any difficulty in cooperation recently. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 114 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you very much. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you.  Thank you very 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We should have the oath 
administered now, hey? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please, state your full names for the record. 
MR SODI:  Peane Edwin Sodi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
10 
prescribed oath? 
MR SODI:  No objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear then that the evidence you will 
give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MR SODI:  So help me God. 
20 
PEANE EDWIN SODI:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I hope the transcribers heard 
the last part from Mr Sodi “so help me God”.  It was quite 
soft.   
STENOGRAPHER:  [Indistinct]

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So that the stenographers can pick 
up what you say.  Mr Sodi, you have made two affidavits for 
the purposes of the Commission’s work.  The first is in

contents of this affidavit, are they true and correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The second affidavit appears at page 
152. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the same bundle? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, I am incorrect.  It is the same 
bundle.

CHAIRPERSON:  You did explain to him the black numbers 
and red numbers Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I have not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am wondering whether ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  No, I got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, you are looking at the numbers 
at the top left-hand corner. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ignore the red numbers in the top 
right-hand corner if you will. 
MR SODI:  That is fine.  Which page are you going to? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry.  Are you at page 520? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five zero two.  I think you just said five 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 117 of 223 
 
zero two. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, five zero two.  It is the 
beginning of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Five two zero is the page to which I 
am referring Mr Sodi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR SODI:  Okay I am there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that your signature? 
MR SODI:  That is my signature Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That affidavit appears to have been 
attested to on the 4t h of August 2020. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As far as you are concerned that the 
contents of that affidavit is true and correct? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, that second affidavit should be 
marked Exhibit TT8.2.  We will fix that up.  But may I ask 
that the first affidavit at page...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, do you want me to finish with this 
20 
one first?  The second one or do you want us start with the 
first one? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, I have not asked for either to 
be admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is what I want to do formally first. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 118 of 223

ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  No, I am incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is 8.2.  You are correct.

that you are a Director of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) 
Limited. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On the following pages you list your 
qualifications and your various business interest but unless

purposes, they are matter of record.  If we could go to page 
20

MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You go on to say, however, there is 
however a need to be registered to handle and dispose of 
asbestos. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then you say in the third sentence: 
“Blackhead has not been appointed to, nor has it 
removed asbestos and/or disposed of it...” 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That needs a qualification or a 
10 
correction as far as we are concerned, at least, because in 
terms of the SAL of the Joint Venture, the Joint Venture was 
appointed to remove asbestos. 
MR SODI:  If I can just explain that Chair?  The whole 
intention was to first of all to do Phase 1 which was the Audit 
and Assessment.  The next phase after that would have been 
the Implementation Phase.   
 
So our plan was, should we be successful and get 
appointed for the Eradication Phase, we would have to work 
with an entity that is accredited to handle asbestos. 
20 
 
So that was the plan.  It is an arrangement that was 
happening in the past where if a particular entity is 
appointed to do something but they are not accredited, they 
can sub-contract someone who can actually do that work on 
that on that deal.  So this is... this was the understanding.  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 121 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, let us just clarify that.  If you go 
to page 458, please.  It is a letter addressed to the Joint 
Venture dated 28 May 2014. 
MR SODI:  Okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In fact, it is not a letter addressed to 
the Joint Venture.  It is a letter addressed by the Joint 
Venture to the Department of Human Settlements dated 
28 May 2014. 
MR SODI:  Ja, I am there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Where your request is to be 
10 
appointed on a risk basis for assessment and audit, as well 
as, handling and disposal of asbestos sheets. 
MR SODI:  That is correct.  I am aware of it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And is it correct that at some stage in 
the Service Level Agreement, you undertook that you had the 
skills and the capacity to do the work for which you were 
later contracted? 
MR SODI:  Chair, the... I admit that we had the necessary 
skills and expertise to conduct the audit and assessment but 
not to handle asbestos.  For that, as I have indicated Chair, 
20 
you need to be accredited.   
 
Not anyone can handle asbestos.  So the answer, the 
quickest answer to that is that we would not even have, you 
know, gone to that stage because we know we cannot handle 
asbestos due to the fact that we are not accredited. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 122 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, the SLA ultimately entered into 
the... between the Department of Human Settlements, Free 
State and the Joint Venture.  It appears at page 92.  Sorry, 
page 466 of Bundle FS1. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Is that the Service Level Agreement? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, if I may refer you to for the 
moment, at least, to page 468 of FS1 paragraph 4.2? 
MR SODI:  I am there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That reads and I will ask you to 
comment on it, please. 
10 
“The service provider undertakes (that is 4.2.1) they 
have the capacity to and are able to enter into this 
agreement...” 
MR SODI:  H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  4.2.2: 
“They have all the necessary experience skill and 
capability to render the service in accordance with 
the 
requirements 
and 
expectations 
of 
the 
department...” 
 
We will come to the appointment of sub-contractors in 
20 
the light of this clause here in due course but for the moment 
Mr Sodi. 
 
Despite that undertaking and its interpretation may be a 
matter for debate and I invite you to comment on it, you were 
not licensed or certified to do the work for which you were 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 123 of 223 
 
appointed at least insofar as it concerns the removal and 
disposal of asbestos.  
MR SODI:  Chair, unless it is a matter of perhaps, you know, 
misunderstanding but my interpretation of this particular 
clause that Mr Pretorius is referring to does not say anything 
with regard to being accredited.   
 
It talks about the entity or the service provider having 
the necessary experience and skill to render the service.  So 
service in this context would have been the first phase of the 
project which is the Audit and Assessment. 
10 
 
Certainly Chair, with regards to the second phase, as I 
have indicated, which is the actual eradication of asbestos, 
we do not have the necessary skill experience simple 
because, as I have indicated, we are not accredited to 
handle asbestos. 
 
So it could be that maybe you are reading it differently 
Chair but my understanding of what this clause is saying. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 4.2 also refers to 
capacity and capability but let us leave the wording aside. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If necessary, the lawyers can argue 
that in due course.   
MR SODI:  That is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just look at the practical 
implications of Clause 4.2. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 124 of 223 
 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The department, the contracting 
department would surely want to know when it appoints a 
service provider that they are able to do all the word, not 
only form a skills and capacity and experience point of view, 
but they are permitted in terms of the law to do the work.  
Surely that is the purpose of that clause.  Would you agree? 
MR SODI:  Well, I agree Chair that the client in this case, 
the department, wants law but we are talking two different 
phases of the project.  And even if Chair, the department had 
10 
to say ...[indistinct] [coughing]... 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Mr Sodi. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The noise of the heater or aircon makes it 
really a bit difficult to... I do not know if it is making warm... 
making it warm but ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is making it very cold Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  [laughs]  Then they must switch if off 
if it makes it cold.  But you could speak closer to the mic as 
well. 
20 
MR SODI:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please just ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  I am saying the department, obviously, in making 
the appointment would have made sure that whoever they 
are appointing as a service provider has the necessary skill 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 125 of 223 
 
and capability to execute the project. 
 
Chair, you would recall I mentioned but even if you had 
to be appointed for the eradication of asbestos, that is us in 
this case, we would not have done that ourselves. 
 
So we would have had to find someone who is 
accredited and entered into some... whether some kind of a 
JV or a partnership and tell them to actually do the 
eradication. 
 
But we certainly would not have gone ahead with the 
eradication as it is because we are not accredited to do that.  
10 
That is the point I am trying to pass across Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ja.  But the other point that I think 
becomes relevant in another course in due course.  If the 
department knows that you have to sub-contract the word 
because you are not legally entitled to do the work then, 
surely, it would be better for it to go directly to that party 
rather 
than 
bear 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
sub-contractor 
arrangements? 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Look, you are absolutely correct Mr 
Pretorius.  Chair, as it turned out in this case, as much as 
20 
we signed the SLA, the IPW, which is an instruction to 
proceed with work, was issued subsequent to the SLA.   
 
And that IPW is the actual contract.  So and it was very 
specific that our appointment was limited to just the auditing 
and assessment.  It never said anything about eradication. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 126 of 223 
 
 
So the IPW in this case, takes precedence over the SLA.  
So it becomes the binding document the service provider and 
the client. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  No, let us go back to page 458.  
To your letter to the department. 
MR SODI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it? 
MR SODI:  I have got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The subject of that letter is the request for 
appointment on Risk, Audit and Assessment, handling of 
10 
hazardous materials, removal and deposal of asbestos, 
contaminated rubble in the Free State Province. 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you agree that even before you read 
the letter, reading that subject, tells you that the writer of 
this letter is requesting to be appointed to do all the things 
that are mentioned there? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree with that? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Then you begin the letter.  You say: 
“We have pleasure in submitting our request to be 
appointed on risk basis for the following: 
1. Assessment/auditing houses roofed using asbestos 
material. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 127 of 223 
 
2. Handling and disposal of asbestos sheets to an 
approved designated disposal site...” 
 
You agree that that reinforces the idea that you wanted 
to be appointed by the department to, amongst other things, 
handle and dispose of asbestos sheets to an approved or 
designed disposal.  You agree with that? 
MR SODI:  Yes, correct.  I agree with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, how... now you have said that your 
10 
company did not have the accreditation and, in fact, I think 
you went further to say even the skills, the skill or expertise 
to do the handling and disposal of asbestos sheets to an 
approved or designated disposal site.  Alright. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright now why do you ask the 
department to appoint you to do something that you know 
you do not have the expertise to do and that you know you 
do not have the accreditation to do and you know that you 
would need accreditation to do? 
20 
MR SODI:   Chair, the quick answer to that question, as I 
said, was we had anticipated, we made an application or 
request to be appointed for the two phases which is phase 
one and phase two, phase two being the eradication.  Even 
if we did get appointed for phase two, we would have had to 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 128 of 223 
 
find an accredited service provider to perform that service.  
That is what would have happened.  
 
You know, the question from what I am hearing from 
Mr Pretorius, why would the department not go directly to 
someone who is accredited? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is a later question. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first question is you are asking the 
department to appoint you to do something that you yourself 
admit you have no expertise to do. 
10 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you yourself admit you need 
accreditation to do. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you yourself admit you do not have 
accreditation.  My question is, why do you ask the 
department to appoint you to do something that you do not 
have the expertise to do, you know requires accreditation, 
you know you do not have accreditation formally. 
MR SODI:   Okay.  Chair, look, I will acknowledge that.  In 
20 
retrospect perhaps we should not have asked for the 
department to appoint us for phase two.  And, like I said, as 
a tenderer, we were never appointed for phase two.   
Let 
me 
perhaps 
just 
explain 
what 
happened 
previously.  I think it was in Gauteng, with the same concept 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 129 of 223 
 
where you have service providers who appear on the PRT 
panel and this is the panel where the department would go, 
you know, when there is a need for a service  to be 
provided.   
And what happened previously, in this instance was 
that they needed in Gauteng, specifically, they needed to 
appoint entities to do the eradication of asbestos. 
However, on that panel there was not a single 
company that was accredited to handle asbestos.  So what 
they then did was to say look, because we have got no 
10 
company that is accredited, we are going to have to appoint 
one of the – make some PRTs, okay, to do that but those 
PRTs would have then to go out to the market and find 
companies that are accredited, so that they can do the job 
and the reason for that, as I said, was because the whole 
PRT system all the panel system is to shorten the 
procurement process.   
So 
what 
happened 
was 
they 
said 
look, 
we 
acknowledge that we have got no one on our panel who is 
accredited but we will appoint some companies that will 
20 
then have to subcontract and this was the thinking as well, 
from our side, you know, when we drafted this letter.  It was 
the same thinking.   
You know, it could be criticised and I understand 
where the criticism, Chair, is coming from and I admit to 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 130 of 223 
 
that, you know, that, you know, it would be improper for 
anyone to be, you know, to be asked to be appointed to do 
something when you do not have the necessary, you know, 
skill or experience of capacity.  I take that point, sir, and I 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   I concede to that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is misrepresentation, is it not? 
MR SODI:   Yes, I concede to that, Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did, as far as you know, do you know 
whether the department knew that for a service provider to 
handle and dispose of asbestos sheets they needed a 
service provider that would need to be accredited and so 
on, 
is 
that 
something 
you 
know 
whether 
they 
know 
themselves or whether they got to know? 
MR SODI:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know. 
MR SODI:   I would not have, ja.  I – no, I do not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But you obviously must see the 
seriousness of this kind of misrepresentation. 
MR SODI:   Correct, correct, I admit, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Particularly because you would know that 
quite often in the country there are complaints that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 131 of 223 
 
government departments give work to entities that have no 
experience, have got no knowledge. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of how to do the job. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The next thing, they just take the money 
and go away, the job has not been done. 
MR SODI:   You are absolute correctly, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And for that reason, it is critical that no 
service provider should misrepresent what it can do and 
10 
what it can do in terms of its skills, its capacity and its 
accreditation.   
MR SODI:   That point is taken, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   I admit to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and then, of course, the point that 
you alluded to earlier on then arises, you know, why should 
a government department appoint a service provider who 
does not have the skills, the experience and knowledge of 
how to do the job. 
20 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the basis that they go and find 
somebody else. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rather than appoint the entity that has 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 132 of 223 
 
got all of that. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, if they say in order to transfer 
skills, in order to promote transformation, we would like you 
to work with another service provider. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That I can understand but where the 
service provider that is appointed is the one that does not 
have any skills, does not have any knowledge of the job and 
they are required to go and find  - I have difficulty with that. 
10 
MR SODI:   No, Chair, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you might be able to assist me. 
MR SODI:   No, no, I perfectly understand your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SODI:   I admit to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SODI:   Perhaps what I can just add and I do not want 
to labour on this or take too much time on this point but the 
Chair would probably be aware this whole asbestos thing 
really 
started 
around 
late 
2013/2014. 
 
I 
remember 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is what Mr Manyike said, ja. 
MR SODI:   Ja.  I am talking about the actual eradication.  
Now I remember very well, around 2013 or 2014 there were 
about – Chair, about three companies in the whole country 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 133 of 223 
 
that were accredited to handle asbestos.  There were about 
I think four sites, landfill sites, if I am not mistaken, in the 
whole country that had the necessary permit to accept 
asbestos.   
 
So it was a new thing and I can understand and I am 
not speaking on behalf of, you know, government official 
that, you know, we do not really have capacity in terms of 
service providers that are accredited, you know, to deal with 
this matter.   
So I suppose then that is why there was, you know, 
10 
a way of being creative, if you want to – for the lack of a 
better to say we have a crisis we need to deal with, there is 
probably 
about three, as I said about three service 
providers in the whole country that can do this.  They are 
not going to be able to do this on their own, so you know, 
let us find a way that we can be able to assist.  
But I do remember vividly then that that was one of 
the challenges that government had.  I do not know about 
now, that number may very well have increased but about 
six, seven years ago it was – you would struggle to find 
20 
one, actually.  But I take the point, Chair, and I admit that, 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course the proper way to do this is 
that you should have disclosed to the department that the 
skills or experience that you have relates to assessment 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 134 of 223 
 
and audit but that as for – as the handling and disposal of 
asbestos sheets is concerned you had a plan how to deal 
with that, namely …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   I take it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …we do not have the skills but this is 
what we will do in order to carry out the job properly.  That 
would have been the proper way. 
MR SODI:   No, absolutely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   And I do not want to talk about what could have 
10 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   But had we arrived at that stage after the 
assessment we would have disclosed to the department.  I 
know we should have done it at the beginning but we would 
have told them that guys, we do not have the credentials, 
you know, we are not accredited to handle asbestos.  So we 
would have to go and, you know, find a partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   But I am sure that would have happened, Chair, 
20 
I mean, you know… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, what I also note is that you 
letter is date 28 May 2014. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the service agreement is dated 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 135 of 223 
 
…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   It is later in the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Towards the end of the year. 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which suggests to me that would have 
given you time to reflect and say you know what, what we 
said to the department is not true, maybe we should correct 
it.  Well, I am just mentioning that that is what is my mind 
as I see this. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say there was enough time to reflect 
on it. 
MR SODI:   Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And correct it but it seems it was 
repeated in the service agreement. 
MR SODI:   I take the point, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, of 
course certification in this case is particularly important 
because we are dealing with a life threatening substance 
20 
and therefore the particular skills required of someone who 
is handling that material and removing it and disposing of it 
of utmost importance. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then, if we may go on, to page 466 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 136 of 223 
 
of FS1, just to complete this topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   466. 
CHAIRPERSON:   466. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is the service level agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I want to the draw the attention 
of Mr Sodi to page 467. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For a project for which you were 
10 
appointed as defined in paragraph 1.1 as being: 
“To 
assess/audit 
houses 
roofed 
using 
asbestos 
material, handling and disposal of asbestos sheets 
to an approved designated disposal site.” 
That is the project which is the subject matter of the SLA. 
MR SODI:   Did you say page 467? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   467, paragraph 1.1, definition of 
project. 
MR SODI:   Definitions and interpretations, okay.  I do not 
see where you …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Definition of project at the end of 
definitions, 1.1 at the end of it, there is the definition of 
projects there.  Can you see it?  Below payment of services. 
MR SODI:   Ah yes, okay.  I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat the question, Mr Pretorius. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 137 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The project includes in its 
definition: 
“The handling and disposal of asbestos sheets to an 
approved designated disposal site.” 
MR SODI:   That is correct.  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in paragraph 2, under the head: 
Working Relationship at the bottom of page 467 of FS1 the 
working relationship is defined as follows: 
“The department appoints the service provider to 
assess/audit houses roofed using asbestos material, 
10 
handling and disposal of asbestos sheets to an 
approved designated disposal site.” 
MR SODI:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now you in fact quoted a figure and 
that figures appears somewhere in your proposal for the 
removal and disposal of asbestos and I think it was in the 
region of R36 000 per house.  So you in fact went so far as 
to quote yourself. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The point that we have been 
20 
discussing, Mr Sodi, is relevant in another context.  If one 
goes back to paragraph 4.2 on page 468 of FS1. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The undertakings that we have 
placed on record.  At the time the contract was entered into 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 138 of 223 
 
and when the terms and conditions of the contract were 
being discussed particularly the price, did you disclose to 
the 
department 
that 
you 
were 
intending 
to 
employ 
subcontractors? 
MR SODI:   Chair, I have to mention here that I never 
discussed or have any discussions with the department with 
regard to the contract.  My late partner is the one who was 
having this kind of negotiations.   
 
It may very well be that at some stage he may have 
disclosed to the department that we are not accredited for 
10 
asbestos and maybe that is why it will explain the reason 
that we only got an IPW – sorry, we got an IPW for the 
assessment and all that.   
So with regard to the, you know, the discussions 
with the client, I have never had discussions with them.  
The only time that I got to interact with the client and 
specifically one individual, who is the HOD, was when the 
project was already being implemented and my interaction 
really was more to find out if the deliverables are indeed 
what they are looking for and if we are, you know, meeting 
20 
the level of standard that they are expecting. 
So, Chair, to answer the question, I do not know if 
that discussion ever took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One, it certainly did not happen with you 
but you do not know whether your late partner had such a 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 139 of 223 
 
discussion. 
MR SODI:   Ja, I do not, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you concede then – well, this is 
not really a concession, would you agree, Mr Sodi, that had 
your partner disclosed the fact that you intended appointing 
subcontractors which was known quite early on and in fact 
before the project was entered into, project agreement was 
entered into.  That would have given the department an 
opportunity to interrogate what the project was costing them 
and what the project was costing in relation to the 
10 
appointment 
of 
subcontractors 
and 
to 
make 
its 
own 
calculations and decisions in that regard.   
 
Had Mr Mpambani made full disclosure to the 
department 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
were 
appointing 
subcontractors and the cost of those subcontractors, had 
that been disclosed it would put the department in a 
position to assess whether this contract was a contract was 
cost-efficient or cost-effective. 
MR SODI:   Chair, I would not know if, you know, it would 
have given the department the opportunity to interrogate the 
20 
price, I unfortunately cannot speak on behalf of the 
department certainly with regard to that aspect. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well perhaps as a partner one 
should have ensured that there was full disclosure to the 
department so that they could conduct that exercise. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 140 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   Like I said, I was not party to the discussions, 
Chair, and I cannot confirm if discussions every took place 
or never took place as I was never involved with, you know, 
discussing the contractual matters with the department.  I 
would not know if that actually happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know whether the joint 
venture provided a full breakdown of its costs before the 
SLA was entered into? 
MR SODI:   Ja, look, we, Chair, we submitted – we 
proposed at least in as far as phase one of the project is 
10 
concerned, we proposed a fee, whatever it.  In the initial – I 
think the initial letter or proposal that we submitted to the 
department – and I can speak to that because certainly I 
was involved, with the drafting of the proposal.   
The initial figure that we proposed for the actual 
assessment was about 1 350.  That is what we submitted to 
the department and it was submitted as a hard copy by my 
late partner. 
 
Subsequent to that, he came back and said the 
department has mentioned they cannot afford that rate and 
20 
they settled on R850 per stand and that is what we 
eventually were appointed on, for phase one.   
 
So ja, the discussion with regard to the fees was 
handled, as I said, by Mr Mpambani. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before Mr Pretorius asks the next 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 141 of 223 
 
question what was the initial amount based on, that of 
1 350,  what was it based on?  There seems to be quite a 
big difference …[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   It is a big difference, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   and 800 and something. 
MR SODI:   Ja.  And maybe, Chair, if you can allow me 
maybe two or three minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Just to give a context to this thing, maybe to 
assist us with some of those questions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I will be very brief, I do not want to 
waste anyone’s time on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is fine, ja. 
MR SODI:   So in late 2013, there was a huge storm in 
Gauteng which destroyed a lot of houses.  This was around 
December of 2013.  The department of human settlements 
appointed contractors to go and fix these houses. 
 
What was discovered was that a lot of these houses 
that were damaged were actually roofed with asbestos.  
Because it was roofs that were blown away and, you know, 
20 
and so forth.  So that is what led to the department say hold 
on, why do we not take stock and understand the nature of 
the problem that we are dealing with because most of these 
houses are asbestos roofed houses and this would be 
houses that would have been constructed pre-1994.  This is 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 142 of 223 
 
now what led to the actual, you know, assessment to say we 
need to plan, we want to plan, and we also want to 
eradicate and the only way that we can be able to 
understand what is on the ground, what the problem is, is to 
actually get people to go literally door to door, street by 
street and verify and come back and tell us, say Department 
of Human Settlements, you have got so many houses in 
Gauteng that are roofed with asbestos.   
That would have enabled them obviously to then 
plan, you know, to make sure that they put the necessary, 
10 
you know, budgets in place and start with the eradication 
because they would not have able to put a budget without 
knowing what sort of quantities they are talking about.  So 
that is what led to this assessment and audit project which 
started in late – sorry, I think it started in 2014.   
Now 
what 
happened 
then 
was 
the 
department 
appointed eight contractors from their panel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think I have heard that part of the 
background. 
MR SODI:   So it is taking me to – and it is important that I 
20 
mention this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Because it is taking me to the question that you 
asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 143 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   Now that appointment – those appointments 
were very specific.  Department said listen guys, we are 
appointing you to go out there and do an audit and come 
back and tell us what we are sitting with or what we are 
dealing with.   You are going to be appointed at this rate, all 
of you.  Okay, you either take it or you leave it and also, do 
not come back and tell us that you need variation, this is a 
price that we are giving. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:   All of you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   They said do not come back and say you 
need what? 
MR SODI:   Like a variation, you cannot come back and say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, amend, ja okay. 
MR SODI:   Ja.  For instance, this then audit 50 houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   And you find 100 houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:   You cannot come back and say guys, I found an 
additional 50 houses, please pay me for those houses. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MR SODI:   So that is what is what I am referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR SODI:   So that was very clear to say this is the rate, it 
has been predetermined and we – there is a way that they 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 144 of 223 
 
said we determine this rate which obviously we would not 
have 
known 
but, 
I 
mean, 
they 
would 
have 
used 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they determined it unilaterally, as it 
were, is that correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
was 
that 
rate 
1 300 
and 
…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   No, no, it was R650. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much? 
10 
MR SODI:   It was R650. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MR SODI:   Per house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   So that is the rate that was given to all of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SODI:   I mean, at that point in time, I mean – so we get 
disappointments, I do not know whether I am going to make 
money or lose money and we accept - you know, we take 
the rate and we – obviously this is the first time, so this has 
20 
never been done at least in government.  So it is really trial 
and error but we know what needs to be done, so we 
acquire the necessary gadgets, the necessary software, we 
employ, you know, the fieldworkers, we do what needs to be 
done and that is what happened. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 145 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I do not want you to take too long. 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you quote a rate that is about 
double in the Free State, what is – why did you make it 
double to the – double the rate of Gauteng? 
MR SODI:   Okay, so now – and this is the point that I want 
to make to you, Chair.  Two things.  One is, in Gauteng we 
were appointed for certain parts of Soweto and it is easier 
to get in and out.  Logistically it is not a problem, you know, 
there is not much travelling, you know, that is going to 
10 
happen, you do not need to be booking accommodation for 
people that are going to be working there, especially your 
technical people because we are in the province, you know, 
so we are working here so it makes it easy. 
 
The Free State, on the other hand, we are now 
appointed for the entire province and as you may know, 
Chair, you can travel from one township to the next, you 
know, it can take you up to three hours.  Those are the 
dynamics that we did not have in Gauteng.  There were a lot 
of unknowns that we factored in.   
20 
 
Give you another example, in Gauteng we were 
appointed to – I think it was about 250 000 units.  We ended 
up auditing about 200 000 more but we were only paid for 
the 250 000 and now here we are talking the Free State and 
we are told that you are going to audit 300 000 structures, 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 146 of 223 
 
the whole province.   
Knowing what we knew already, we anticipated that 
the chances are that we are going to find more, that is what 
we thought, we thought if just in one township we did 
200 000 more, now we are talking the entire province.  So 
there is a bigger chance based on that experience but we 
could end up maybe doing double that number or even triple 
that number.  So this is sort of what influenced that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So basically, it was the experience you 
have had in Gauteng and bearing in mind the scope or the 
10 
area you had to cover in the Free State. 
MR SODI:   Absolutely, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the record, because it may 
become relevant later, if you would go to bundle 8 please, it 
is behind you, marked on the side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle FS8. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   FS8 at page 163. 
MR SODI:   What page is that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   163.  this appears to be the 
20 
proposal of the joint venture dated 28 May 2014 which later 
gave rise to the conclusion of the service level agreement, 
am I correct? 
MR SODI:   Correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go please to page 166, 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 147 of 223 
 
it is in that document that you say that your rates are as 
follows for the door to door assessment, R1 350 per house 
excluding VAT and then you say removal and disposal to an 
approved designated site and you actually quote not 
R35 000 but R32 760 excluding VAT. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must say, Mr Sodi, each time I see 
where you refer to the removal and disposal of the asbestos 
I keep on saying but why are you saying this when you know 
you cannot do it. 
10 
MR SODI:   Yes, it is the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know we have dealt with it but I am just 
letting you know each time I see it because I see here you 
have made it clear the door to door assessment will be 
R1 350 per house excluding VAT.   So that you know you 
can do. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you say removal and disposal to an 
approved designated site R32 760 excluding VAT.  So as I 
read it I say but he knows that they cannot do that, why is 
20 
he saying [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR SODI:   I conceded to that one, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius 
continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To return to the point we were at a 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 148 of 223 
 
few minutes ago, Mr Sodi, the service level agreement 
undertaking in paragraph 4 regarding your skills, capacity 
and experience is important in another context too and that 
is insofar as subcontractors are concerned.   
 
We agreed that the purpose of that clause, which we 
were discussing, is that the department can be assured that 
you can do the work and presumably that you will do the 
work.  
MR SODI:   You are referring to the first bundle, am I right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am also trying to follow, are 
10 
you on another bundle now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am back at the service level 
agreement. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is FS1?  That is the bundle we had 
earlier. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja, we are back at bundle FS!, I 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Okay, is it page 468? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is where 4.2 is. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had asked a question, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am getting there, Chair.  Give me 
a moment Chair, I need to find that document. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 149 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to share with me what 
document you are looking for, I might have seen it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am looking for that clause that we 
were discussing earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which says what? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 4, 4.1.2 that paragraph 
that contains the undertaking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is at 468, page 468, black numbers.  
Mr Sodi and I have found the page. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, there is another SLA but let 
10 
us just go with 468, paragraph 4.2.  That is the clause 
where you undertake that you have the capacity to and are 
able to enter into this agreement, and that you have all the 
necessary experience, skill and capability to render the 
service. I thought we were agreed, Mr Sodi, from your 
previous answer that the purpose of that clause, the 
intention behind that clause is to assure the Department 
that you, the joint venture can do the work. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And are prepared to do the work. 
20 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what happened in this case is 
that all or certainly the material portion of the work was 
sub-contracted, not once but twice, we know that. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 150 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now for the present, the question 
is, did you ensure or take any steps to ensure that full 
disclosure was made to the Department that you would 
sub-contract the work, not once but twice? 
MR SODI:   Chair, I certainly did not inform the Department 
that we were going to sub-contract the work.  I, Chair, was 
more concerned about being able to deliver on the project, 
that was my primary focus.  Again, like I said, I wouldn’t 
know, if my partner, who was instrumental in engagement 
with the officials on contractual matters, would have 
10 
disclosed but from my point of view, personally, I did not 
have that discussion with anyone in terms of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The related question is, did you 
ever give the Department a breakdown of the costs that 
you would incur as a joint venture in executing the project? 
MR SODI:   No, we did not give the department a 
breakdown of the costs.  What happened, Chair, was, we 
agreed with the Department on the rate payable per house 
and that is where it ended with the Department but we 
didn’t say, to them, you know, this is how the 850, for 
20 
instance is broken down, no we didn’t go that far. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And just to complete something that you 
said earlier on, the rate that was ultimately agreed upon, 
per house, did you say that came from the Department 
because you had quoted a higher amount? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 151 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   So the feedback, Chair, that I got from Mr 
Mpambani was that he came back and he said that the 
Department had indicated that they will not afford the rate 
that 
we 
proposed, 
which 
was 
R1350, 
he 
said 
they 
negotiated and agreed and settled on R850. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It would have been one of the 
duties of the Department in relation to this contract to 
ensure that it was cost effective. Now, I would understand 
that the appointment of sub-contractors, the breakdown of 
10 
costs and expenses contemplated in the project would be 
the type of information that would be contained in a 
competitive bid process so that there can be a fair 
assessment of whether there’s value for money or cost 
effectiveness in the project.  Full disclosure of the costing 
would be required, wouldn’t it? 
MR SODI:   Chair, I’m not sure if I understand this 
question, do you want to… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It would seem that in a competitive 
bidding process, there would certainly be substantial 
20 
information that would have to be provided in regard to the 
costing of the project, you agree with me, and here there 
was no competitive bidding process. 
MR SODI:   There was no competitive bidding process yes, 
I agree with that. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 152 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright we needn’t take that any 
further unless you want to answer it. 
MR SODI:   No, no,  I agree with – that there was no 
competitive bidding at least when it comes to the Free 
State appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it that the department, as far as 
you know, never asked the joint venture, before appointing 
it to produce documentation to show that they have the 
expertise and the skills necessary to do the handling and 
disposal of the asbestos, as far as you know? 
10 
MR SODI:   Ja, Chair, certainly with – as far as I know that 
was never requested or – because that is a scope that fall 
in phase 2 but they were certainly comfortable that we had 
the necessary skill and expertise to execute phase 1 of the 
project, which is the whole reason why the Treasury 
Regulation 16(A) 6.6 was utilised because they were aware 
that we had done a similar project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I haven’t checked throughout, 
but it doesn’t look like the Service Level Agreement talks 
about phase 1 and phase 2, is that right or does it?  This 
20 
Service Level Agreement I haven’t checked whether it does 
talk about phase and phase 2 of the project…[intervenes]. 
MR SODI:   I’m not sure, it may…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may, it may not? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 153 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I may just, again for the record 
Chair, simply say that the project is defined as including 
both aspects of the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so probably – well certainly there’s 
no definition of phase 1 and phase 2. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the project for which the joint 
venture was appointed was the entire project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As was the proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that the project for which you 
were appointed as the joint venture was the entire project? 
MR SODI:   No, I…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t accept it? 
MR SODI:   I don’t accept that sir. I accept that the Service 
Level Agreement that was signed between the two parties 
referred to both phase 1 and phase 2 but the instruction to 
do work was only phase 1, which is what I said is the 
20 
actual contractual document between the Department and 
the service provider which supersedes the SLA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, no that’s fine.  Let’s take it 
step by step.  As far as the Service Level Agreement, do 
you accept that your appointment was in respect of the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 154 of 223 
 
whole project? 
MR SODI:   Yes, correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes 
but 
you 
are 
saying 
there’s 
something else which suggests otherwise? 
MR SODI:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well I understand your answer but 
it needs clarification. The Service Level Agreement is an 
actual contract, it’s a binding agreement between the 
parties and in its own terms is the whole agreement 
10 
between the parties. 
MR SODI:   Well, Chair, I probably have a different 
understanding and I’m certainly not disagreeing with Mr 
Pretorius or…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
SODI: 
 
 
But, 
you 
know, 
that’s 
my 
layman’s 
understanding that the actual binding document between 
us and the Department, which was very specific, in terms 
of how much was going to be paid, what services were 
expected to be performed, what sort of deliverables were 
20 
expected by the client, you know, and how the payment 
was going to be structured, all those were contained in the 
IPW, 
that’s 
why 
I’m 
saying 
from 
my 
own 
layman’s 
understanding, the IPW would supersede SLA because it is 
very specific in terms of what ought to happen and how it’s 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 155 of 223 
 
suppose to happen but I certainly take Mr Pretorius’ point 
as well, I’m not saying that I’m…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you are giving your understanding? 
MR SODI:   Yes, ja, that’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I don’t want to be technical with 
you, I’m sure you’re sick and tired of lawyers who argue 
legal or find legal points with you but I must put it to you, 
that the service legal agreement is a binding agreement, it 
must be read together with the instructions to perform work 
10 
which gives more detail as to what you must do for what 
cost. 
MR SODI:   Thank you for the education. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You agree with that? 
MR SODI:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s go to what happened in 
Gauteng please.  You deal with that in your affidavit and 
the relevance of what happened in Gauteng has already 
become apparent but will become more apparent in due 
course.  At paragraph 9.1 on page 377…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR SODI:   This is the first Bundle? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, I missed that, is 
it another Bundle we are looking at? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ja we are back in Bundle 1, FS1 at 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 156 of 223 
 
page 377. 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We’re going to paragraph 9.1, 
there you tell us…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, 377? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   3-7-7 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There you tell us, Mr Sodi, what 
happened in 2009.  What happened in 2009? 
MR SODI:   So, Chair, in 2009 the Department of Local 
10 
Government and Housing…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is Gauteng? 
MR SODI:   That is Gauteng, issued out an invitation to bid 
for Engineering firms to be on their panel for professional 
resources. We, Chair, it was a bid that was out in the 
newspapers, we responded to the bid and we submitted our 
bid.  It was, obviously, you know, evaluated and we were 
appointed on the panel.  I think that appointment happened 
about 2010 and the duration of that panel was three years, 
effective from around 2010 but I do know that it was 
20 
extended from time to time right up to, I think, about 2014 
or so, that’s my understanding. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then let’s look please at that 
particular Service Level Agreement which is at ES1, that’s 
red tab 1 page 406 of FS1. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 157 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, I don’t want to take the 
Commission through the whole of this document but this 
Service Level Agreement doesn’t contain any provision as 
to which particular work should be done and at what 
particular rates it should be done, correct, it’s a general 
Service Level Agreement which contemplates, as you said 
earlier, further agreements which would then incorporate 
terms and conditions of contract such as price and scope 
of work and the like? 
10 
MR SODI:   This is exactly, Chair, in line with what I said 
was my understanding with Service Level Agreement was 
that, often, like in this case it is broad, it’s not specific in 
terms of what kind of service must be offered.  Those kind 
of details will then be produced in an instruction to 
proceed with work.  So, I admit that this Service Level 
Agreement which was signed in 2010 is very broad, it 
doesn’t talk to what ought to happen, that gets to be 
produced elsewhere. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this Service Level Agreement 
20 
would have been entered into by all the members of the 
panel, the professional resource team panel.  Several 
would have been appointed and each one would have been 
issued with an SLA and signed the SLA and then later on, 
particular contracts would have been entered into for 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 158 of 223 
 
particular work, particular scopes of work and at particular 
rates, do I understand it correctly? 
MR SODI:   That’s absolutely correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So just by way of example, if one 
looks at page 433, paragraph 18.1, 
“The consultant shall receive remuneration in terms 
of the various stages in which the consultant is 
engaged 
in 
by 
the 
Department 
through 
an 
authorised IPW”, 
 
That’s an instruction to perform work, that’s for 
10 
later. 
MR SODI:   Right. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say that during the period 
2010, I understand now, onwards, you performed various 
services 
for 
the 
Department 
including, 
for 
example, 
construction supervision and monitoring services.  Do I 
understand it correctly that the 2009/2010 Service Level 
Agreement was for general construction work, not asbestos 
in particular? 
MR SODI:   These – let me explain it this way. So, Chair, 
20 
we are talking here about a panel for the Department of 
Human Settlements. So, essentially, what that means is 
that if the Department choose to create a panel, they are 
saying, anything that has to do with Human Settlement will 
be contained in broad terms in the SLA.  The specifics of 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 159 of 223 
 
what needs, or ought to happen will then be produced 
through an IPW but anything else related to Human 
Settlement will then be covered in the SLA, as I said, in 
broad terms.  So, you would find that the composition of 
your PRT, for instance, to give you an example, would be 
Civil Engineers, would be Structural Engineers, Town 
Planners, which would be Environmentalists, it would be 
Geo Technical Engineers. So that would typically, what 
would consist a professional resource team.  So if you look 
at, Chair, a lot of the PRT’s you’ll find that, not one 
10 
company, in most cases – very few companies that go on 
their own and say we are a PRT on our own.  You’d find 
that in most cases you would have to then, you know, get 
into a partnership with other entities that can provide 
services within Human Settlement.   
To give you an example, when we submitted this bid 
in 2009, we wouldn’t have met the requirements if we went 
in purely as Blackhead Consulting because at that point in 
time, 
we 
only 
had 
Civil 
Engineers, 
we 
had 
Project 
Managers and I think we had Structural Engineers.  The bid 
20 
was very specific in terms of the requirements that you 
need to have a full suite of all those services.  So, when 
they do their adjudication when the client does the 
adjudication, Chair, they will say, okay fine we see there is 
a Blackhead Consulting PRT and if you are the leading 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 160 of 223 
 
PRT you can just use your name. For instance, we were 
the leading member of the consortium if you want to call it 
that but the thing with consortium there were other 
companies that formed part of our bid which provided 
services that we did not have in-house. So when you then 
get to be appointed, the adjudication will be based on 
whether or not you meet that criteria and you are able to 
demonstrate that you have all those other services that are 
required. 
So this SLA, Chair, would not have been specific 
10 
that one of the things that you do, for instance is asbestos 
eradication.  It also wouldn’t have been specific but one of 
the things that you would do is, maybe, Geo Technical 
Investigation, that will come along should there be a need 
for such a service and the only reason why the Department 
of Human Settlement would have dealt with this asbestos 
matter, is because it is within Human Settlements, the 
roofs are on houses which is Human Settlement. So this 
SLA would not have been specific to that extent Chair to 
specify that you know you need to have, for instance, 
20 
expertise 
in 
handling 
asbestos 
or 
at 
least 
in 
the 
assessment of it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well again, your answer needs to 
be qualified to this extent, that the SLA about which we are 
talking now, the 2010 Gauteng SLA expressly incorporates 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 161 of 223 
 
the 
provisions 
for 
the 
services 
of 
others 
such 
as 
consultants and specialists and if I can refer you to page 
415 of FS1 para 5.2. 
MR SODI:   I’m there Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You look at 5.2 it says, 
“The consultant, shall, at its cost engage and be 
responsible 
for 
such 
other 
consultants 
and 
specialists as may be necessary for the proper 
completion of the project. The Department shall 
cooperate with such consultants and specialists but 
10 
shall not be responsible for them or for their 
performance”, 
 
There’s another clause, clause 5.5 which deals, in 
detail, with the right of the Department to appoint other 
additional consultants to perform the services through the 
project.  What is instructive, however, is that the SLA in 
the Free State contained no such provision. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct, that’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right then we go back, then to 
page 378 now of FS1…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I can say this Mr Sodi, it’s 
correct, I guess you admit, that the Free State SLA 
Agreement didn’t contain anything else like this but when 
you answer the way you have answered you are also 
admitting that, I think Mr Pretorius said, it’s strange or 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 162 of 223 
 
something like that.  So, I just want you to appreciate that 
you are also accepting that, what he said. So, if your 
intention is to admit that it doesn’t contain but you don’t 
think it’s strange or something like that, you need to make 
that clear.  I just thought that I must highlight that to you 
but if your intention was to say, I admit it’s not the same 
and I accept that it’s strange, I don’t think he used strange 
but he used some – he said something about the fact that, 
in the SLA applicable to Free State that this kind of 
provision wasn’t there.  So, I’m just mentioning, you can 
10 
stay with your answer it’s fine, I just want to be sure that 
you appreciate what you are admitting. 
MR SODI:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s then deal with the hailstorm 
that you spoke about, earlier in your evidence Mr Sodi.  
You deal with that in your statement at page 378 of FS1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   3-7-8? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, before we get there, the panel 
that you refer to in paragraph 9.1, this panel of service 
20 
providers who were then employed to do particular work at 
particular rates in terms of other contractual arrangements, 
how many service providers constituted that panel? 
MR SODI:   Gee, Chair, this was like ten years ago, so I 
wouldn’t…[intervenes]. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 163 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just a – you don’t have to be 
accurate. 
MR SODI:   I think it was – I won’t be accurate but it was 
anywhere between 50 and 100. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, fairly described as plenty. 
MR SODI:   Ja they usually are. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Then 
in 
paragraph 
9.3…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius I’m sorry to interrupt you, 
don’t lose your point, I forgot this question earlier and I 
10 
don’t want to forget it again. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether your late partner 
had any expertise or knowledge or experience or his 
company even in regard to the door – the audit and 
assessment part of the job? 
MR SODI:   Chair, as far as I know, no, he didn’t have 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not have, yes.  Do you know 
whether he knew that for purposes of the handling and 
20 
disposal of asbestos there needed to be accreditation, do 
you know whether he knew that or no? 
MR SODI:   Chair, his – I mean I can safely say that his 
knowledge of the asbestos matter was very limited. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 164 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   But I’m certain…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s not something that you shared with 
him? 
MR SODI:   Ja but I certainly can’t rule out the fact that he 
may have known he was a very smart, intelligent man so 
it’s possible that he may have known. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you don’t remember that you 
shared that with him, to say…[intervenes]. 
MR SODI:   I don’t remember that discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR SODI:   It may, very well have happened Chair, but I 
don’t seem to remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SODI:   Events that, you’d appreciate Chair, happened 
many years ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I accept that. 
MR SODI:   So some of the things we may recall some – ja, 
so I don’t want you – make a conclusive…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no I understand.  Okay Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, let’s get back to the 
20 
hailstorm Mr Sodi.  You say in December 2013 a hailstorm 
ravaged certain parts of Gauteng and this required certain 
work to be done for the Department of Human Settlements 
and then 9.8 you say what occurred from an appointment of 
service provider point of view, would you tell the Chair 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 165 of 223 
 
about that please? 
MR SODI:   Are you referring to 9.8, do you want me to 
comment on 9.8? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes please just tell the Chair what 
that says and any comment you may wish to add. 
MR SODI:   I’ve – Chair I think…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mentioned it already. 
MR SODI:   I mentioned it already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja he did, he did Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well you say in the second 
10 
sentence, 
“The 
Department 
of 
Human 
Settlements 
then 
appointed a number of entities to conduct an 
assessment of the houses in Gauteng to determine 
whether they had asbestos in their roofs”, 
 
Correct, so the hailstorm gave rise to damage to 
certain houses, it was discovered they had asbestos roofs 
when the damage was inspected and then the Department 
of Human Settlements decided, well, we’re going to appoint 
entities to conduct an assessment of the houses in 
20 
Gauteng to determine whether they had asbestos in their 
roofs, how did that happen? 
MR SODI:   Chair, I remember this period very well 
because I had never seen anything like that, I mean, the 
storm that happened in December of 2013 was hectic and a 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 166 of 223 
 
lot of the houses, a lot of the roofs were blown away and 
this was during the festive period and it continued raining 
and people had nowhere, because now the roofs are blown 
away and it was a disaster for a lot of the residents.    
 
I mean I remember visiting one township I think it 
was in Kagiso something like that.  It was – it was too painful 
to watch you know.  And it continued raining and obviously 
people could not stay in those houses.  Now this is what led 
to – as I said this is what led to the department to say, if we 
look – if we do an assessment of most of the houses that are 
10 
damaged here probably about 90% of them were roofed with 
asbestos.  So you would find that if you walk street by street 
you would find a house with a roof blown away that was used 
– you know that was asbestos roof.  But next door for 
instance it is a house which is tiled and nothing has 
happened to it.  And this is why they said, look clearly 
because of I suppose the age of some of the houses and the 
asbestos roofs this is a problem and we do not want to be 
caught off guard again you know and expose our residents to 
things like this.  So we need to be proactive.  Obviously, 
20 
there were reactive as a result of what happened you know 
but then they decided, listen instead of being reactive in 
future let us plan properly okay?  Apart from the fact that – 
like I said some of these houses are very old I mean the 
majority of them if not all were built prior to 1994.  There 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 167 of 223 
 
was a health problem you know that you actually exposing 
people that are living in those properties to health – to you 
know health issues.  And I think it was – it was a cautious 
decision which in my view was the right decision to make to 
say, guys let us deal with this problem once and for all.  I do 
not know if Chair if they have been able to eradicate 
asbestos in all the houses but I do know that certainly there 
was an effort from the department’s point of view to say, let 
us deal with this issue and deal with it once and for all.  
Obviously there would be budgetary constraints so – but I 
10 
think the idea was that for – if we can afford it or depending 
on the resources that you know the amount of resources that 
we put let us deal with it and make sure that this problem is 
sorted once and for all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do those events lead to the 
appointment of I think it was eight? 
MR SODI:  Correct, correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Service providers to do an audit and 
assessment of houses at the rate of R650.00 per house? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair that is what led to that 
20 
process.  As I have indicated it was obviously preceded by 
the contractors who were then appointed to fix the roofs as a 
matter of urgency.  And then said, look now that this is done 
now that we – our people are okay, they have gone back to 
their houses, the roof – you know the roofs are sorted let us 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 168 of 223 
 
now do this thing properly.  And that is what led Chair to the 
appointment of these eight contractors to say, guys please 
go out there in all the townships and come back – come back 
and tell us what we sitting with or what we dealing with?  So 
that we will then be able to plan and budget properly based 
on the information that we have got.  And that was the whole 
idea for the exercise to conduct the audit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And did that appointment of the eight 
service providers take place during 2014 – the early months 
of 2014? 
10 
MR SODI:  If my memory serves me well Chair it was around 
that ja – around 2014 ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what process was involved in the 
appointment? 
MR SODI:  Well Chair what I do know was that I certainly 
speak for – for ourselves at Blackhead but I think this is 
what happened with all the other eight contractors we were 
basically called to a meeting and said, guys you have been 
selected from the panel okay.  Here are the IPW’s you go out 
and do what you need to do.  So that is – that is the process 
20 
that was followed Chair. 
MR SODI:  The process as I understand it was by reference 
to an existing panel. 
MR SODI:  Ja. So… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That was the panel of between fifty 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 169 of 223 
 
and 100. 
MR SODI:  Absolutely, absolutely Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Certain service providers were 
summonsed and you were told you were going to be 
appointed and you are going to do the work at R650.00 per 
house and this is what you are going to do. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright just to confirm that would you 
go to Bundle 8 again please at page 88?  You might not have 
seen this document before but it does seem to reflect a 
10 
process similar to that which you are describing and in fact 
by all accounts is the same process. 
MR SODI:  I am seeing this document for the first time Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I am sure.  But this is a 
memorandum which gave rise to the appointments which I 
will show you in a moment.  But if you go to page 90. 
MR SODI:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It says and this is to do with 
asbestos.  If you look at the third paragraph on that page. 
“The objective of the assessment phase is to undertake a 
20 
structural assessment and quantify the entire stock of house 
accommodation roofed with asbestos in Gauteng.” 
That is the project we speaking about. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The second last paragraph on that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 170 of 223 
 
page says: 
“The assessment phase is envisaged and will be carried out 
in March and April 2014.  The expiration of the PRT 
contracts at the end of March should not have an effect on 
the assessment and is to be viewed as work in progress.” 
And then if you go over the page financial implications at 
page 91 of FS8 third last paragraph reads: 
“Professional rates for assessment will be applied in line 
with the department’s IPW fee structure at R650.00 per 
house.  This will be a fixed rate and the department will not 
10 
accept any variations from this.” 
That aptly describes or you aptly describe that as the take it 
and leave it approach – take it or leave it approach. 
MR SODI:  Ja Chair unfortunately my file does not have that 
page but I appreciate that you read it out I do not have it 
here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and then over the page, page 92. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why does your file not have the… 
MR SODI:  It does not have page 91 but I think I am fine 
Inkosi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but we need to make sure we have the 
same thing otherwise there might be -  we might be – there 
might be confusion.  Is it a page missing or? 
MR SODI:  Ja there is a page missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 171 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  My apologies Mr Sodi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You now have page 91. 
MR SODI:  Ja I have got it now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC: There at the bottom of the page is the 
R650.00 per house.  This will be a fixed rate and the 
department will not accept any variations from this. 
MR SODI:  I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You say that is consistent with your 
view of that price being a take it or leave it price? 
10 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if you go over the page to page 
92 the recommendations were to approve attached terms of 
reference and approve the appointment of eight PRT’s for 
the assessment.  And as I understand your evidence you 
were one of the eight or Blackhead was one of the eight 
appointees. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then if one goes over the page 
one looks at the Terms of Reference which are referred to in 
20 
the document we have just discussed.  That is at page 94 
which motivates the establishment of the project.  And if you 
go to page 98 paragraph 5.1 do you have that? 
MR SODI:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  5.1 says: 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 172 of 223 
 
“The scope of the assessments as follows: 
a. The identification and quantification of affected houses. 
b. Assessment of structural integrity or load bearing walls 
in each house via a competent person or possible 
added loads with new roof cover. 
c. Measurement of the size of affected houses by a 
competent person or new roof designs.” 
Why do you think the requirement was for the appointment of 
a competent person to assess structural integrity of load 
bearing walls? 
10 
MR SODI:  Well Chair you would need someone competent 
and qualified I may add to make a conclusive opinion on the 
structural integrity of the house.  And that would typically be 
an engineer.  And so I would agree with that that we need a 
competent to do that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and the explanation is contained 
at least in part in sub-paragraph B because you are going to 
take off quite a light roof made of asbestos – it is not a 
heavy material and you are going to replace it with a new 
roof cover presumably heavier, am I correct? 
20 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And so you need to look very 
carefully at what the walls can bear. 
MR SODI:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Otherwise there is a risk of you doing 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 173 of 223 
 
quite a lot of damage when the house collapses. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Sir.  So you need to get a 
competent person to make a determination that if you 
removing asbestos and perhaps replacing that with a tiled 
roof that the you know the load bearing walls would be – you 
know adequate enough to be able to carry that structure 
because otherwise you might just be creating another 
problem if you have not made that assessment.  And that 
cannot just be made by anyone.  It has got to be – and this 
is why it qualified here but it has got to be a competent 
10 
person. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if one looks at 5.1.c. – 5.1 sub c.  
The measurement of the size of the affected house in order 
for a roof to be designed for that house must also be done 
by a competent person. 
MR SODI:  I am – yes and no.  I am saying perhaps no 
because we pretty much know the standard or the sizes of 
these houses.  You know a lot of them are exactly the same 
size.  If you look at for instance the RDP houses maybe 90% 
of them are all 40 square meter houses.  So if you know the 
20 
size of the house already it would be pointless to go and get 
someone to still come and measure it because it is already 
given.  The plan will tell you that these are 40 square meters 
so you do not really need someone to come and verify.  You 
can verify but you know it is – if the plan is there and it tells 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 174 of 223 
 
you the size that is sufficient and therefore an engineer can 
then based on the size that can be able to design the roof of 
that particular house. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The document goes on to describe in 
fact two more phases with what I wanted to ask you for the 
present purposes Mr Sodi you recall this as being the scope 
of work which applied in Gauteng when you did the work? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you could go back to your 
statement please.  Paragraph 9.10 you confirm what you 
10 
have just told the Chair that when the asbestos audit came 
up in Gauteng at the beginning of 2014 Blackhead was one 
of the six entities, we now know it was eight entities 
appointed from the panel to conduct the asbestos audit in 
Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry 379 of Free State 1 – FS1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  379?  FS1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  379. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes okay.  You may proceed. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Paragraph 11 we have 
covered and unless there is anything you wish to add or 
comment on Mr Sodi we can move on? 
MR SODI:  We can move on Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 11.4 you say you audited 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 175 of 223 
 
200 000 more houses than the estimated 300 000 that you 
were contracted to audit. 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And that you were paid for 300 000 
not 500 000?  That is what you told the Chair earlier. 
MR SODI:  Ja that is what I mentioned to the Chair earlier 
and again I do not want to re-emphasise this point but I just 
want you – again coming back to the issue that the question 
that you raised and it has been raised many times about the 
rate that we charged specifically in the Free State.  Was 
10 
because we knew we had the experience of what we 
encountered in Gauteng we had to put that in mind when we 
approached the Free State.  And this was one of them.  
Because like I said it was very – it was made very clear and 
very specific in no uncertain terms by Gauteng but guys you 
are – your appointment is for x number of houses.  If you 
come back and you have done more – it does not matter how 
much more or how many more it is neither here nor there you 
will still be paid for the original scope that we paid.  It was 
an experience that we had and we said, look because now 
20 
you have an experience you are applied for future which is 
what you know you would normally do in any circumstances.  
You learn – you learn from the past so that you can be able 
to apply lessons for the future.  So – so we had to factor that 
in Chair because of this – of this discrepancy here. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 176 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Was not one of the differences 
between the project in the Free State and the project in 
Gauteng that in the Free State there was – you knew in 
advance how many houses needed to be audited and 
assessed namely 300 000. 
MR SODI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure whether in Gauteng you had 
but I seem to think that if you had the same arrangement you 
would not get into this problem of doing 250 houses but or 
doing 300 or 400 or 500 houses but only being paid for 250. 
10 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you knew these are the houses it is 
300 then you would say this is what we will charge you to do 
these and you would know where they are therefore even 
how much travelling would be involved you would be able to 
factor that in. 
MR SODI:  Ja.  Chair it is an exercise that had to be done in 
the Free State but even then, it was inaccurate.  Because 
what ended up happening was that the number of houses 
that were audited actually exceeded that 300 000.  I cannot 
20 
remember the exact number.  So one had to be careful there 
to say, what we have is the minimum number of houses that 
they know these ones are definitely there.  But you may very 
well find that there is more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you find more. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 177 of 223 
 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have no contractual obligation to 
do the new ones that you find you do not do them until there 
is an agreement that you may do them and you – there is an 
agreement on what you would charge. 
MR SODI:  Chair we would have preferred that because – 
because then otherwise you know you just focus on your 
scope.  But as we had learnt in Gauteng it was not the case.  
It was – if they say go to this particular township.  According 
to our records we have 100 000 houses okay and that is 
10 
what we are appointing you for.  So you go there and do the 
audit.  If you find 200 000 houses for instance and because 
maybe their records might be old or inaccurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  So if you find more, they made it very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must do it. 
MR SODI:  That is your problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  But you must still audit them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR SODI:  But you are not going to be paid for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SODI:  You understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SODI:  So that was the whole thing. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 178 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius.  I see we are at to 
four? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I was going to say Chair there is 
simply no possibility of us finishing today at whatever hour 
we finish and so if we are going to go on for any time you 
could let us know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But then we would like a break now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We are not going to finish Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am quite happy even if we are not 
going to finish for us to do as much as we can up to a 
certain point.  Maybe we can agree up to what point then we 
can take a break now.  I appreciate that Mr Pretorius you 
have been standing the whole day. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The whole week Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe what we should do we should 
take a break now and then you and the legal or counsel for 
Mr Sodi can see me in my temporary chambers we talk about 
how much more time we can add today and then take it from 
20 
there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we see you at what time Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter past? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Quarter past four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter past four. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 179 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We will come to see you in chambers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right.  We will adjourn now Mr Sodi 
and then we will return soon after I finished with them.  They 
will see me at quarter past four.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have agreed that we will go on up until 
10 
six o’clock this evening, and we know that we are not going 
to finish and another date will be determined.  That is the 
one point. 
 
The second is that it has been brought to my attention 
that the recording might not have captured the oath properly.  
So for the record, I just want to say that the oath was 
administered for this witness.  Okay.  So we will not repeat it 
but the record will reflect ...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Insofar as necessary, we confirm 
the oath.  We were present and we confirm that it took place.  
20 
We have no issue with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you. 
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  We proceed.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, we are at 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 180 of 223 
 
page 381 of FS1.  And we had completed matters related to 
Gauteng and the Asbestos Projects there, at least for the 
moment.  Do you have page 381 there? 
MR SODI:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At the bottom of the page, you 
described in your affidavit your first meeting with Mpambani.  
For the record, we know that you and Mr Mpambani together 
through your respective entities formed a Joint Venture for 
the execution of the Free State Project.  Where did you meet 
Mr Mpambani? 
10 
MR SODI:  Chair, it must have been around 2010/2011.  
Somewhere around there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And was that at a function in 
Welkom? 
MR SODI:  Ja, it was at a function.  So Mr Mpambani and his 
ex-partner... I cannot remember his name Chair.  But they... 
at an event, it was an annual event which happened every 
December.  It was quite popular.   
 
There is one December, I cannot recall exactly which 
December it was, but I got tempted to go and check it out 
20 
and I drove there and that is where I met him.  We 
exchanged numbers and kept in touch, you know, on the odd 
occasion right up to 2014 when we now officially met. 
 
I cannot describe that kind of relationship as being 
friendship because it is someone that I just knew as a 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 181 of 223 
 
businessperson who have this... what at the time seemed to 
be quite a successful event taking place.  Ja, that is... 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Was he a well-connected 
person in the Free State? 
MR SODI:  That is how it came across.  He came across 
because I recall that at that event Chair when I was there, I 
saw a few couple of faces.  You know, I cannot recall exactly 
who they were but the people... the faces that I saw there 
and I concluded that he is highly-network based on my 
observations there.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened at the beginning of 
2014 between you and Mr Mpambani? 
MR SODI:  Sorry, what was the question again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry? 
MR SODI:  Can you just repeat the question Mr Pretorius? 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
2014 
...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Ja? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  ...and in relation to the Asbestos 
Audit in the Free State, what happened between you and Mr 
20 
Mpambani? 
MR SODI:  Chair, I received a call.  I think it was around 
February 2014.  I received a call from Mr Mpambani and he 
asked if he could come and see me.  And of course, I knew 
him and I said, “Ja, sure.  Come and see me”.   
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 182 of 223 
 
 
I was at my house.  He came to my house.  And he said, 
“Look, I am aware that you are busy with this Asbestos 
Auditing in Gauteng.  I would want to go and pitch the idea 
for a similar exercise in the Free State”. 
 
And this was someone that I could see that he knew 
what he was talking about because he said to me that I am 
aware that this eventually... this is supposed to be a national 
project.  It is supposed to be done in all the provinces where 
there are houses that have roof asbestos.  And I knew that 
myself. 
10 
 
And he said, “Look, because you are already doing it 
here, you have got experience.  Do you mind if we partner 
together for the Free State?” 
 
My answer was I do not have a problem with that 
because I also knew that at some stage the provinces were 
going to follow suit. 
 
Gauteng happened to be the pioneer.  It had not been 
done by any other province.  So Gauteng was the pioneer.  
But I knew that eventually it was going to... it is going to be 
rolled out in other provinces because there was...  
20 
 
I also knew about a cabinet decision that was taken 
many 
years 
ago 
pertaining 
the 
use 
of 
asbestos 
and 
eradicating asbestos. 
 
So I was aware about these things and being a 
businessperson, I thought this is an excellent opportunity.  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 183 of 223 
 
Here is this person who comes to me.  I never thought of 
going to the Free State. 
 
But he says, “Look, I am from there.  I grew up there.  I 
know for a fact that there are so many houses that are 
roofed with asbestos.  So I think there is opportunity.  Do 
you mind if I, you know, go and pitch the idea and see if the 
Free State government is keen or interested”. 
 
Of course, my answer Chair was “go ahead”.  And that is 
what happened.  He told me that he went to the Free State.  
In his own words he spoke to the relevant officials.  I did not 
10 
want to ask the names because I could see that he was 
keeping that to himself that these, you know, relevant 
officials. 
 
“Do not worry about who they are but I have spoken to 
relevant officials”.  And he came back and he said, “Look, 
the suggestion is that we must submit a report”.  Okay. 
 
And that is what led to the initial letter, I think that we 
wrote Chair.  It could have been February.  Sorry, my dates 
might be mixed there but there was... subsequent to that 
meeting when he came back, we wrote a proposal and 
20 
submitted it. 
 
He took it and hand delivered in the Free State.  And 
that was the beginning stage of the Free State Project.  It 
started there.  And he, obviously, engaged with whoever that 
he was engaging with. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 184 of 223 
 
 
So from February, when we first wrote the letter Chair, 
the process, the entire process really leading to our 
appointment and the signing of the SLA was taking about ten 
months, give or take because it was only around, I think, 
around October, somewhere around there when the SLA was 
signed. 
 
But there were to-and-from letters and so forth and so 
on.  So I was under the impression that this process that is 
being followed is the right process, you know, and hence it is 
taking so long. 
10 
 
And of course, I was aware about the letters that we 
have written for instance the Free State, addressing the 
letter to Gauteng, to... I was aware.  I saw some of those 
correspondence. 
 
So in my mind, that was a process and they had to make 
sure that it is followed properly.  Hence, it took so long for 
the JV to be ultimately appointed. 
 
But during that process, it was him, Mr Mpambani who 
was, you know, running around and meeting with whoever he 
was meeting to make sure that things happen. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  I understand from your 
answer that the arrangement, at that stage, between yourself 
and Mr Mpambani was that he would speak to officials and 
that he would, together with those officials, make the 
necessary arrangements for the project to proceed in due 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 185 of 223 
 
course. 
MR SODI:  That is correct, sir.  He did mention that he is 
speaking to relevant officials in the Free State and that is 
where it ended.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You use the word in your affidavit in 
paragraph 17 on page 382 of FS1 that he told you he may be 
in a position to... and I quote “unlock the opportunity”.  What 
does that mean? 
MR SODI:  Chair, I actually used his exact words here.  You 
know, he said, “I will try and unlock this opportunity in the 
10 
Free State”.  My understanding of what he meant was that he 
was going to engage and pitch the idea, you know, so that it 
... that could then lead our appointment.  That was my 
understanding. 
 
But as I say, I use his exact words which is what he said 
to me.  But my understanding was that he was going to pitch 
the idea, engage with them and which is what I believed 
what happened Chair ultimately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words, he would convince them of 
the need that you get appointed? 
20 
MR SODI:  Ja, because... absolutely Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  Because he said in one meeting that he engaged 
them and they appreciated that he did.  There is a problem 
with asbestos.  He also mentioned, if I recall correctly Chair, 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 186 of 223 
 
that their concern was that, as much as they want to 
implement this programme, it was not in their budget for that 
financial year. 
 
He mentioned that and he said that there is a process 
which they mentioned will be undertaking but it is going to 
be a lengthy process. 
 
I did not mind whether it is was going to be ten months 
or twelve months because I was busy in Gauteng.  I was 
busy with another project.  So I allowed him to do what he 
was supposed to do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So is it fair to say, in summary then, 
that not only would Mr Mpambani speak to people to 
persuade them to take on the project but also to remove any 
obstacles that may be in the way of the project going ahead? 
MR SODI:  Chair, I do not know about removing the 
obstacles but what he said to me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But he would unlock locked doors? 
MR SODI:  [laughs]  This unlock... 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
20 
MR SODI:  I do not want to entertain that much.  But this is 
the interesting thing.  So what he said when he came, he 
said, “Look, when I brought this topic, when I mentioned this 
thing, immediately they said we know, we are aware”. 
 
So it does not look like there was any convincing that 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 187 of 223 
 
happened there Chair because already they knew.  And I 
think they would have known, I would assume, that for 
instance a province like Gauteng is busy with a similar 
project. 
 
I mean, these are all, you know, sort of departments 
reporting to the same ministry and I know that they have got 
this quarterly meetings, you know. 
 
They call them... I think it is called Min-MEC.  So 
ministers and MEC’s.  So they will meet, I think, every 
quarter.   
10 
 
And a minister for a particular department would meet 
with the MEC’s for those departments from the various 
provinces and that is where information would be shared, 
exchanged, you know, seeing what other provinces are doing 
and so forth. 
 
So I would imagine that the Free State would have 
known that there are other provinces that are... there is 
another project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, just the one thing that is clear if you 
are right that that is the phrase he used “unlock the 
20 
opportunity” or opportunities or whatever he said.  It was, at 
least, 
that 
is 
how 
he 
perceived 
it 
that 
there 
were 
opportunities that were difficult to access because they were 
locked.  He wanted to unlock those opportunities.  What do 
you say to that understanding? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 188 of 223 
 
MR SODI:  Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  If I say that is my understanding? 
MR SODI:  It... you could.... ja, it... you could very well be 
right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR SODI:  You could very well be right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What it would translate to at a practical 
level might be a different thing. 
10 
MR SODI:  Yes, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SODI:  Exactly.  And just adding onto that Chair.  I know 
that he not only went to Free State.  He went to other 
provinces.  I know he went to Mpumalanga.  He went to the 
Northern Cape because he came and told me.  You know, I 
have got meetings there.   
 
Like I said, this was... he was a smart guy and like I said 
he was highly-networked.  So he was able to criss-cross the 
country and... 
20 
 
And I found that that is one thing that I admired about 
him because it was like, you know, there is something that I 
can learn from this guy, you know? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR SODI:  And I took a liking to him, you know.  That is why 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 189 of 223 
 
for me it was not a difficult thing Chair to just work because I 
could that he see that he possessed something that I did not 
have. 
 
So the unlocking this aspect for me was to say, “Listen, I 
am able to jump certain hurdles for instance and go to the 
decision-makers”.   
 
I, you know, I would not have to go and speak to a junior 
official who has to speak to his boss and speak to a boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  I can go speak to someone. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the real decision-makers. 
MR SODI:  That is how I understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SODI:  That I can go and speak to someone who has got 
authority to say yay or nay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Okay. 
MR SODI:  You know, that is how I understood it Chair., 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I would understand that you being a 
businessperson 
and 
Mr 
Mpambani 
also 
being 
a 
20 
businessperson that the object of the exercise at that stage 
in unlocking the opportunity was not only to pursue the 
department in the Free State to take on the Asbestos Project 
but also to secure your appointment as the service provider. 
MR SODI:  Chair, that was the intended objective.  Like I 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 190 of 223 
 
have indicated, the other provinces where you... you were 
not appointed.   
 
At least three or four provinces that he went to, only one 
province was a success.  Let me put it that way.  So that 
would have been the intended goal Chair, you know, to get 
appointed eventually, you know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And insofar as obstacles might exist 
which might have to be removed, you yourself mentioned 
that if there was no budget reallocation for that money that 
would have to dealt with. 
10 
MR SODI:  So again Chair, what I understood by that was 
that because he has got access to the key decision makers, 
he is able to get quicker answers.  You know, if something 
was going to, I am sure they will be able to tell them straight 
away but this is going to work or this is not going to work. 
 
You know, if perhaps the obstacle in this case may be 
related to budget, then they would have told him:  “Listen, 
for this financial year maybe we did not budget for this”.  You 
know.   
 
Yes, we acknowledge that there is a need for this to be 
20 
done.  However, we do not have the funds.  Maybe we can 
look into the next financial year.  So that is the context in 
which I understood it. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 You 
then, 
according 
to 
your 
statement on the 10t h of August 2014, concluded a Joint 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 191 of 223 
 
Venture Agreement.  Who represented who in that Joint 
Venture Agreement? 
MR SODI:  Sorry, who represented who? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Who represented who?  In other 
words, who were the parties to the agreement? 
MR SODI:  Oh, okay.  Chair, it was myself as a director of 
Blackhead Consulting and Mr Ignatius Mpambani as the 
Director of Diamond Hill. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  There is a copy of the Joint 
Venture Agreement which appears as Annexure ES2.  It is at 
10 
page 453 of FS1.  And the terms and conditions applicable to 
the  Joint Venture Agreement appear at pages 455 and 456 
of FS1.  That is the Joint Venture Agreement, is it? 
MR SODI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I want to draw Chair’s attention to 
paragraph 2 of the Joint Venture Agreement.  It reads: 
“The consulting/construction works, if awarded, will be 
split between the parties on a fifty-fifty basis...” 
 
And then it goes on to say: 
“Each party will complete their own part of the work 
20 
separately at its own risk or if both parties agree, will 
be outsourced to sub-contractors, contractors that 
are jointly agreed...” 
 
Correct? 
MR SODI:  Correct. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 192 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What would Blackhead do for its 50% 
of the fruits of the contract and what would Diamond Hill 
Trading do for its 50%? 
MR SODI:  Chair, this is what I envisaged right at the 
beginning when we started having this discussion.  With 
regard to the contract, Blackhead executed... when I say 
Blackhead, I mean Blackhead employees executed that 
problem. 
 
We 
only 
appointed 
one 
person 
from 
outside 
the 
company, Mr Zwane to, you know, to lead the technical team, 
10 
you know, based on his technical experience but we used 
our own internal resources to execute the project. 
 
We acquired the gadgets that we need, the software and 
so forth.  When I had the discussion with Mr Mpambani, I 
already knew... because it was not something that he hid 
from me. 
 
I knew that he had never done this before and he was 
upfront about it and he did not have the expertise to do it.  
And that is, I would imagine sir, the only reason why he 
would have come to me.  He could have gone to anyone else 
20 
but he came to me because he knew that we already doing 
this project in Gauteng. 
 
What... and this again illustrates my point which I will 
come to later but this MasterTrade thing came much later.  In 
actual fact, I was very reluctant even go that route. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 193 of 223 
 
 
You know, he came to me and said to me, “Look, I have 
got this friend.  He has done this kind of work before.  His 
business is slow at the moment and he needs some kind of 
work to keep him going”.  You know. 
 
This was probably Chair in the last quarter.  Probably 
maybe around October or so when he came with this idea.  It 
was all along. 
 
The plan was that we would execute this project.  I 
would still do it the same way that we have done in Gauteng.  
But what would happen, maybe to answer this question 
10 
quickly and come to the MasterTrade thing, was that we 
would... we would obviously factor in all the costs associated 
with the implementation. 
 
So if I was going to use all my resources for instance, 
we would charge time and... you know, on the expenses and 
whatever costs that are associated ultimately on the project. 
 
And whatever then remains after having taken out all the 
costs, whatever then remains will then be shared equally 
between the two parties. 
 
That was the intention.  It was that we will do... 
20 
remember, he came and presented the opportunity to me and 
I was quite happy to go on a fifty... on an equal, you know, 
sharing of the project with him. 
 
But I knew that we were going to do most of the work, 
and like I have said, ultimately the intention was that we 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 194 of 223 
 
would then the draw out the costs or take out all of the costs 
and whatever remains and then share with him. 
 
I did not anticipate that he was going to bring any 
meaningful resources to the project really, except that we 
could have said for instance, you know, where we need... as 
an example Chair but if we go to one particular township and 
we say that we must employee field workers. 
 
Let us say we employee fifty.  We could have got into an 
arrangement where we say, you know, if it is fifty, thirty-five 
is, you know, it is from... it is your cost and the other twenty-
10 
five is my cost.  You know, we could have done it that way.  
But that was not... I did not want to complicate things that 
way.   
 
I was quite happy that we would do the work, we will 
draw the cost of doing business and whatever remains. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SODI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Pretorius. 
MR SODI:  Do you mind Chair if I just finish on that point, 
the point that I touched on MasterTrade? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius ...[intervenes]  
MR SODI:  Or is it maybe... is it premature? 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...it depends on whether it relates to Mr 
Pretorius’ question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, he must be able to answer 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 195 of 223 
 
completely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR SODI:  Okay.  So I was saying, just to finish it off, if you 
do not mind.  That... so ultimately what happened was 
towards 
just 
before 
we 
could 
actually 
start 
with 
the 
implementation of the project in the Free State, he then 
comes to me and convince me to listen to this MasterTrade.  
To listen to the presentation and be there.  And I said, “Well, 
it is okay.  Let me go and listen to the presentation”.  And 
the presentation happened from MasterTrade represented 
10 
by Mr Radebe and Mr Manyike who was here and they 
certainly at that point in time represented themselves to be 
both coming from MasterTrade so it was never disclosed to 
me but actually these are two different contracts.  They 
said we are from MasterTrade, we have done this work 
before, we can demonstrate what we have done and you 
make 
your 
decision 
and 
they 
presented 
and 
I 
was 
convinced that they could do the work. 
 
The one thing that was a big concern for me and 
this is what I said to Ignatius after the meeting because I 
20 
did not want to raise it during that meeting.  After the 
meeting I said to him I am worried that these guys will not 
be able to execute this project on that cost proposal that 
they presented, which was R44 million.  I said to him, I 
said I do not think – I have my doubts and I am talking 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 196 of 223 
 
from experience, so I want you because Sidi is your friend, 
I want you to go speak to him and verify that and just make 
hundred percent sure that they will be able to execute the 
project. 
 
And that is what happened, he went to him and he 
came back, he said this guy says they can do the job and I 
then said well, look, we already, you know, given our – 
agreed on a rate with the department I think at that time 
and here these guys are saying they can do this thing for 
44.  Look, as a businessman I said to them like, you know, 
10 
what do we do, do I go back to the department and say 
hey, that rate is too high, reduce it because we have got 
someone who can do it here for, you know, far much less?  
I will be honest, I did not do that.  But what I did, I brought 
in Martin who was the late in the project that we did in 
Gauteng.  I said Martin, I want you to be my eyes and ears, 
I want you to oversee this project.   
 
Yes, we are appointing a subcontractor but I want to 
be comfortable that we will still be - I am convinced I can 
do the job but I want you to be there and monitor, so 
20 
everything else that happens they must be accountable to 
you, they must report to you and nothing should go out 
without you verifying.  
 
And this is where this whole, you know, thing, this 
is how it happened.  It was only much later, Chair, some 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 197 of 223 
 
months down the line, when I was told that there is a 
dispute between ORI and MasterTrade.   
I am like but who is ORI?  You know?  Who is ORI?  
And they said ORI is – it is Kgotso and MasterTrade is 
Sidney, I said but hold on, I am under the impression these 
people work for the same entity.  Said no, it is not the case 
and I took issue with my late partner.  I took issue with 
him, I said but why were you not honest with me about this 
arrangement?  You will see later on as well, Chair, that 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you confronting Mr Mpambani 
about that? 
MR SODI:   I confronted Mr Mpambani about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, about that. 
MR SODI:   Ja and asked him why were you not honest 
about this arrangement, surely, I mean, Sidney is your best 
friend. 
 
They 
were 
best 
friends 
with 
Sidney 
from 
MasterTrade.  I am sure you knew all along that these 
people are from different entities and his answer was like, 
well, I did not think it was necessary to disclose that 
20 
information and that is where I started picking up the 
dishonesty coming from my partner but as you will see 
later on as well, Chair, that I discovered even, you know, 
worse, that this guy was the wrong person to even start 
working with and that is why, you know, we went into civil 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 198 of 223 
 
action with this company, details of which, you know, are 
before court as we speak. 
 
But I just wanted to paint that scenario, Chair, so 
that you understand because I was concerned.  First of all, 
I was concerned about the cost proposal from MasterTrade 
and I raised it because I just did not – I did not think that 
they were going to be able to execute the project 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Sodi, I am going to for the sake 
of progress try and ask questions that are capable of a 
10 
more brief answer.  I will do my best. 
MR SODI:   I know you are tired, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You say that the whole issue of 
subcontractors and particularly MasterTrade came much 
later.  You heard the evidence this morning of Mr Manyike 
who said that there were discussions between himself, Mr 
Mpambani and Mr Radebe long before the joint venture was 
…[intervenes] 
MR SODI:   Correct, I heard those today for the first time, 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And we are dealing here with a 
20 
partnership 
and 
partners 
decisions 
and 
actions 
are 
attributable to the partnership but that is nothing that we 
need to deal with now.  I just seems that there was a 
situation between the partners where there was no full 
disclosure. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 199 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   I would say so, certainly so, Chair, that from 
my side I was as honest as I could be with Mr Mpambani.  I 
mean, even when he approached me, if I was not an honest 
person I could have simply said to him listen, you do not 
have the skill or the experience to do this project, you 
know, maybe for your efforts take 20 percent of the – I 
could have done that, you know?  But I am a fair person 
and I consider myself to be a fair person and most 
partnerships that I get into, I – it is mostly equal basis, 
50/50 or 49/51.  So but I realised much later that I was in 
10 
partnership with someone who was not honourable. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, you are in litigation with Mr 
Mpambani’s estate at the moment, I understand. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It seems though for his 50% share, 
however that was expressed ultimately in the joint venture 
agreement, that his job was to do two things.  Well, three 
things, in summary.  The first was to speak to the officials 
and persuade them or arrange that the outcome of those 
engagements at least was that the Free State Department 
20 
of Human Settlements take on the asbestos project, firstly.  
You have said it now. 
MR SODI:   That was his initial role to pitch the idea and 
sell, you know …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second one, obviously as a 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 200 of 223 
 
businessman representing in a partnership, interested in 
business and doing business with the Free State was to 
secure the – insofar as possible to secure the work for the 
joint venture. 
MR SODI:   As I said earlier on, Chair, that was the 
intended objective. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And insofar as there were any 
obstacles in the way those would also have to be dealt with 
and it would be, amongst other things, his job to do so. 
MR SODI:   That is – again, it talks to the second point 
10 
that if there were issues in between, you know, if maybe 
there are - for instance, if there is more than maybe one 
decision-maker – let us say there is two or three, that he 
would make sure that maybe he goes to all of them, you 
know, and get the buy-in, you know, that is how I 
understood it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And as said in paragraph 19 on 
page 383 Mr Mpambani did not disclose to you the names 
of the particular officials with whom he met. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You must have come to know of 
those names in due course surely? 
MR SODI:   I came to know of people in the department 
who were looking after the project, so this project manager 
and the chief engineer.  I never met them but I knew from 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 201 of 223 
 
Martin that the reports are presented to the chief engineer, 
who was – I think he said he is Mr Makeba, but I never met 
these officials even to this day.  I have never met them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You were in correspondence with 
some of the officials.   
MR SODI:   Chair, I think I was in – the correspondence 
was with one official, it was just the HOD. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Who was that? 
MR SODI:   Mr Tim Mokhesi and I never met Mr Mokhesi up 
until the project started running.  So the correspondence 
10 
was – it was letters, I think it was – you know, it was a few 
letters that were exchanged between I think Mr Mokhesi 
and myself but physically we had never met, right up until 
the project started, that is when I got to meet him.  But 
beyond Mr Mokhesi, I have never met any other official 
from the department from the Free State. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 384 in paragraph 20.1 after 
your meeting with Mr Mpambani did, he come back to you 
with any report?  What did he say to you? 
MR SODI:   So, I have – Chair, I have alluded to this point 
20 
that after our meeting, you know, he indicated that he was 
going to meet the relevant officials in the Free State and 
then he came back and he said that we should submit a 
proposal, that is what he was advised, that we should 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 202 of 223 
 
submit a proposal and that started the whole chain of 
events for the next ten months almost. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So he is tasked, according to the 
understanding between yourself and himself, Mr Mpambani 
is tasked with approaching the officials in order to in 
general terms unlock the opportunity in particular to 
persuade the officials to embark upon the Free State 
project and to secure your appointment and he comes back 
to you and he says in the words of – in your words at 20.1, 
he reports to you that he had engaged with the government 
10 
officials in the Department of Human Settlements in the 
Free State and that they had requested that the JV submit 
a proposal.  Success on two counts. 
MR SODI:   That is what he said, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was a proposal prepared? 
MR SODI:   It was prepared, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And was that submitted to the 
Department of Human Settlements in the Free State? 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair, he took a hard copy and 
delivered it himself 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right is that the proposal at 
annexure ES3 of the attachments to your statement and it 
appears at page 457 of the first one.  You know this 
document. 
MR SODI:   I know this document, Chair. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 203 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you would have looked at it at 
the time, I presume. 
MR SODI:   Ja, I know it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you know it now particularly 
because you are involved in litigation. 
MR SODI:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   About these issues, I take it. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But if you look at page 457, this is 
the proposal submitted to the Department of Human 
10 
Settlements Free State Province and there it is dated the 
28 May 2014 for attention of Mr Mokhesi, Mr Tim Mokhesi. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it is submitted by the joint 
venture. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So on the 28 May 2014 Mr Mokhesi 
knew that the joint venture was the instance which was 
20 
presenting the proposal. 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that is the proposal we 
referred to earlier in your evidence today dated the 28 May 
2014, it appears at page 458 and following.  That is the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 204 of 223 
 
document in which you request to be appointed to do the 
assessment and audit and the handling and disposal of 
asbestos.  That is confirmed in several places including at 
page 461 under the heading Objective and under the rate 
per house consistently throughout.  The proposal at least 
is that you would be appointed for the assessment and 
audit as well as the handling and disposal and in fact you 
go so far as to say, in fairness to you, Mr Sodi, that the 
scope of work describes the asbestos removal and disposal 
as being undertaken in accordance with the Occupational 
10 
Health and Safety Act and Regulations 85 of 1993.  That 
appears on page 462, correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was some three weeks later that 
Mr Mokhesi then addressed a letter to you confirming the 
appointment or making the appointment. 
MR SODI:   Are you on page 464? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am on page 384 now and if you 
look at paragraph 20.4.  What happened on the 19 June 
2014? 
20 
MR SODI:   Page 384? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it refers to the letter that is on the 
page you were mentioning, Mr Sodi.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   464, we will get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter from Mr Mokhesi. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 205 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   Okay, okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Pretorius wants you to say what 
you say in that paragraph, page 24. 
MR SODI:   No, I think I am lost, which page are we at 
now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us go back to page 384, 
paragraph 20.4. 
MR SODI:   Okay, I am there. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What happened on the 19 June 
2014? 
MR SODI:   Okay, we received a letter from the Free State  
appointing Blackhead as PRT to the department. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let us go the letter and see 
what it says. 
MR SODI:   Okay, which page is the letter …[intervenes] 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
We 
will 
deal 
with 
other 
correspondence both before and after this time in due 
course, perhaps not today because it is quite  cumbersome 
20 
process but what is interesting is that three weeks after 
the joint venture proposal Mr Mokhesi appoints Blackhead 
Consulting as a PRT to the department.  I would like to 
understand what that means and we can do that by 
reference to bundle FS1 at page 463.  Take a moment to 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 206 of 223 
 
look at that document. 
MR SODI:   Okay, I have gone through it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, let us go to the addressee, 
that is yourself, the CEO of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) 
Ltd, not the joint venture. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.  And the subject matter of 
the letter reads: 
“Appointment of professional resource team to a 
departmental panel and municipal planning and 
10 
implementation support to the Human Settlements 
Departments 
and 
municipalities 
with 
specific 
regional areas.” 
Now we have not heard of and I doubt that there was any 
panel appointed.  You were appointed. 
MR SODI:   Chair, what I understand this letter – this is my 
understanding of what this letter is all about, is if you look 
at the heading.  This heading is similar to the appointment 
that we got from the National Department of Human 
Settlements, appointing was onto their panel.  So my 
20 
understanding is that what this letter seeks to do is to 
extend thereupon and it says there in bullet point number 
one that” 
“The department wishes to extend your current 
contract secured by National Department of Human 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 207 of 223 
 
Settlements in line with Treasury regulations.” 
So this is what the Free State department had done secure 
but our contract must be extended from national to the 
provincial Department of Human Settlements. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Proposition I put to you and it was 
so worded as to be capable of a brief answer, Mr Sodi. 
MR SODI:   I will try and be brief. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do not worry, please do not take 
that personally.  No panel was appointed in the Free State, 
correct? 
10 
MR SODI:   Not as far as I know, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  You whether in the guise 
of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd or the joint venture, let 
us leave that confusion aside for the moment, but a single 
appointment was made in the Free State, correct? 
MR SODI:   Exactly, that is my understanding, Chair, that, 
you know, our contract from national was extended to the 
province. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Mr Mpambani would have 
spoken to Mr Mokhesi to say listen, facilitate this and what 
20 
transpires, quite frankly, is a great deal of confusion and 
we will go each step of that confusing process in due 
course but paragraph 1 says – and I am not talking about 
numbered point one, I am talking about the first paragraph 
under the heading: 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 208 of 223 
 
“The 
above 
has 
reference 
to 
your 
proposal 
submitted to this department.” 
That is the proposal of three weeks earlier, presumably, 
there was no other proposal at that time, correct? 
MR SODI:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Where you say we, as a joint 
venture seek appointment, correct?  And your appointment 
by the National Department of Human Settlements, that 
would appear to be some other appointment, correct? 
MR SODI:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it there it says: 
“Note has been taking of the above and we wish to 
request your approval as follows: 
1.  That the department wishes to extend your 
current 
contract 
secured 
by 
the 
National 
Department of Human Settlements in line with 
Treasury Regulation 16A 6.6 of 2005.” 
Now you understandably say, and these are complex 
Treasury regulations. 
MR SODI:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To some are complex, that you are 
not an expert in this and I do not expect nor will the Chair 
expect any detailed legal analysis of the provisions of 16 A 
6.6, that is for another time and maybe to be dealt with 
with the account officer in the Free State, but for the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 209 of 223 
 
present what contract is being talked about here, in 
practical terms? 
MR SODI:   Chair we - at a contract we are appointed onto 
the panel at National Department of Human Settlements, so 
the contract would refer in this instance to us as Blackhead 
Consulting together with the department.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The National Department? 
MR SODI:    The National Department, to be on the panel. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, so that “contract” that is being 
talked about there is an appointment to a National Panel of 
10 
service providers? 
MR SODI:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is not a service level agreement 
or 
an 
instruction 
to 
perform 
work 
which 
comprises 
particular terms and conditions, prices, scope of work and 
the like? 
MR SODI:    That is correct 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When was that panel arrangement 
entered into with the National Department? 
MR SODI:    Chair my memory is probably going to fail me 
20 
here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   More or less. 
MR SODI:    I think it was around 2013, I could be wrong, 
but that letter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But more or less the year before? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 210 of 223 
 
MR SODI:    Ja, I think it would have, ja I think it was the 
year before, if my memory serves me well I think it was the 
year before, but it will be easy to find that appointment 
letter, so that at least we are sure about the actual date. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would you have that appointment 
letter? 
MR SODI:    I would have it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And perhaps the investigators can 
obtain that for you so we can get some clarity in this 
matter. 
10 
MR SODI:    Chair I think, I could be wrong, but I think you 
dealt with this letter yesterday when Mr ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, there was a letter from National 
from the National DG. 
MR SODI:   Yes, that’s the letter.  That is the one, you 
dealt with it yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we – that is when we looked at this 
one as well Mr Pretorius because you compared both. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and you had quite some discussion 
20 
with Mr Zulu about and he was quite adamant that you 
know an appointment to a panel is not an appointment on 
the basis of which you can ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps I should follow my own 
advice in regard to clarity and brevity Chair.  What I was 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 211 of 223 
 
intending to secure amongst the documentation were – was 
the 
content 
of 
that 
appointment, 
what 
was 
that 
appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The actual contract as opposed to the 
letter? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because we were looking at the letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was there a contract other than a 
letter? 
10 
MR SODI:   Chair there would have been an SLA I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There would have been an agreement. 
MR SODI:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Was the SLA similar to the 
Provincial one with general terms?   
MR SODI:    I cannot say for sure, you know but 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But there was some agreement of sorts? 
MR SODI:   No definitely, there definitely would have been 
an SLA, because typically what happens is when you get 
20 
appointed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To a panel? 
MR SODI:   To a panel you will sign a service level 
agreement, so I am sure that a service level agreement can 
be found. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 212 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes.   Do you think you might have 
it in the office or at home somewhere? 
MR SODI:   I will look for it, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But what is clear that that would 
have been a service level agreement similar to the panel 
appointment in Gauteng where general provisions are made 
but the sale terms and conditions of work and payment and 
rates would be in a later document. 
MR SODI:    That is correct, that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So just to get some clarity on that kind 
of broad agreement, is my understanding correct that what 
you are saying is you when you have been appointed to a 
panel and there is in existence that kind of broad 
agreement you don’t perform any services and claim any 
payment on the basis of that broad agreement, there would 
need to be another instrument. 
MR SODI:    You are absolutely correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph reads: 
20 
“Your appointment will await a concurrent approval 
of the National Department of Human Settlements.” 
So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 That’s 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
letter 
...[intervenes]  
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 213 of 223 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    From 464, Free State 1464, the 
letter from Mr Mokhesi to the CEO Blackhead Consulting 
Pty Limited, Mr Sodi.  So that person is Mr Zulu we know.   
His approval was required, at least in terms of what is 
going on here. 
MR SODI:    No absolutely yes, that is correct.  That is 
correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then 4, that your appointment 
will be subject to your company securing funds to roll out 
the project in line with your proposal.  Now the meaning of 
10 
that sentence you deal with later, correct? 
MR SODI:    Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have to say yes because the 
stenographer needs it. 
MR SODI:    Yes, yes, sorry about that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is signed by Mr M Mokhesi but 
that is the person you have referred to as Tim Mokhesi is 
that right? 
MR SODI:   That is correct Chair.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then over the page, page 465, is 
20 
the accompanying letter that requires to be sent in terms of 
the Treasury Regulation 16(a) 6.1, it is addressed to Mr 
Zulu, also from Mr Mokhesi. 
MR SODI:    I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Free State Department of 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 214 of 223 
 
Human Settlements in terms of paragraph 3 or 2 of that 
letter says hereby requests your department, the National 
Department, to extent – it should read extend – the 
services of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited in line with 
Treasury Regulation 16(a) 6 of March 2005.   
 
Now what is instructed apart from anything else that 
we might or might not deal with, but what is being dealt 
with here is a contract with Blackhead Consulting Pty 
Limited, contemplated on the one hand, and a panel 
arrangement between Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited 
10 
and the National Department of Human Settlements, is that 
a fair assessment of what’s going on here?   
MR SODI:    Chair maybe I should try and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you like him to repeat the 
question? 
MR SODI:   Exactly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And again I was trying to put it 
briefly.   
MR SODI:   Ja, it is late in the afternoon.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The document at page 464 is 
20 
addressed to Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited. 
MR SODI:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is the entity that was involved 
in the panel arrangement with the National Department of 
Human Settlements. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 215 of 223 
 
MR SODI:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not the joint venture? 
MR SODI:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Similarly, on page 465 mention is 
made of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited and not any 
joint venture? 
MR SODI:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As you describe it in paragraph 
20.4, and that is why we started with paragraph 20.4, what 
is being sought here it appears is the appointment of 
10 
Blackhead as a PRT, professional resource team, to the 
department. 
MR SODI:   Can you just assist me with the page where we 
are now?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I think he is still in the letter, on 
the 
page 
with 
the 
letter 
addressed 
to 
the 
CEO 
of 
Blackhead or the letter addressed to the DG of National? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well I am really going back to the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...the understanding in paragraph 
20.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is page 384. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your affidavit again. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 216 of 223 
 
MR SODI:    Okay, alright.  20.4 you said? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.   20.4 the whole objective, 
this correspondence and what’s going on here is for 
Blackhead’s appointment as a PRT to the department, 
correct?   In other words as a member of some panel in the 
department. 
MR SODI:   That’s correct Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But that’s not what happened?  The 
joint venture was appointed as the only contractor for 
asbestos removal and assessment in the province, correct? 
10 
MR SODI:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And we dealt with the 
statement in paragraph 20.5 so we can go to 20.6 because 
the next step that you refer to in your affidavit is the step 
that took place on 1 s t of October 2014.  What happened on 
that day?  Page 385 Mr Sodi. 
MR SODI:       Okay, so we got on the 1 s t of October 
received a letter appointing the JV as a service provider 
for the asbestos eradication. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As you say appointing it, that is the 
20 
JV, as the service provider, there is  no question of any 
panel being appointed? 
MR SODI:    I take it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on then to 20.7, what 
happened as described in that paragraph? 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 217 of 223 
 
MR SODI:    So we are saying here that between the 1 s t of 
October Chair 2014 and the 2 n d December of 2014 the JV 
conclude an SLA with the Free State Department in terms 
of which the Free State Department appointed the JV to 
carry out the asbestos audit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then it is the appointment of a JV, 
a single entity? 
MR SODI:    Just repeat the question. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What the SLA provided for was the 
appointment of a single entity, the joint venture? 
10 
MR SODI:    That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have been through it earlier 
today but I would like to draw your attention and the 
Chair ’s attention for later, the paragraph 4.3.6 on page 469 
of FS1.  It reads, if I may: 
“The service provider ’s invoice shall be submitted 
together with a report by the service provider 
clearly evidencing the service rendered as per the 
approved instruction to perform work which invoice 
and report shall be to the satisfaction of the 
20 
department.” 
This is under the heading on the previous page setting out 
the provisions relating to payment for services, paragraph 
4.3.  It seems that payment, the provisions regarding 
payment 
and 
the 
rendition 
of 
invoices 
require 
the 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 218 of 223 
 
submission of a report, clearly evidencing service rendered 
as per the approved instruction to perform work, do you 
see that? 
MR SODI:   I see that.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    In other words you weren’t to be 
paid, well you weren’t even to invoice, let alone be paid, 
but you weren’t to invoice and you weren’t to be paid 
unless 
you 
provided 
a 
detailed 
report, 
telling 
the 
Department what you had done in terms of the instruction 
to perform work, correct?   
10 
MR SODI:    Ja, Chair can I just maybe explain the 
mechanics of you know IPW and how they’re structured, 
especially relating to the payments, so the – IPW’s are 
very specific in terms of how payment is supposed to 
happen, it says 40% of the total value of the project shall 
be paid to a service provider, up front, and the balance of 
the 60% shall be paid to the service provider upon the 
completion of the project and the reports and deliverables 
being submitted.   So that is how they structured, I am not 
sure about now, but I mean certainly having done you know 
20 
extensive work in Gauteng, which I got to later understand 
was the pioneer in terms of setting up this IPW structure.  
That is how it worked. 
 
The requirement usually upfront would be at least 
submit a programme implementation plan.   If there is an 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 219 of 223 
 
inception report on the project that you are doing you 
submit that and so forth, but the nature of it was that 40% 
would be up front and then the balance would be paid once 
the work is complete. 
 
So to give you an example, there are projects for 
instance, that we certainly did, which could take up to two 
years to be completed, and I think that is how it was 
conceptualised, to say look you know there are certain 
things that you have got to understand that it would take 
time, not because the service provider is slow, or maybe 
10 
they don’t know what they are doing, but because maybe 
these other inter-dependants, maybe there is another 
department that must approve, so there was a realisation 
that it was structured in such a way that to ease the cash 
flow of the service providers we assist them with the 
payment for the 40% upfront, and then only once they have 
done with the work or the project they can claim for the 
balance. 
 
To give you another example if you had to let’s say 
establishing a township, you know a lot of things require 
20 
EIA, the environmental impact assessment, that process to 
get you now a report finalised on average takes anything 
between 12 an 24 months, so for instance you could be 
appointed now, they say go to an EIA on this project, and 
you do whatever you have to do, the investigations, and 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 220 of 223 
 
you get specialists to come and assist you, but you only 
get paid once the report comes out, and that process can 
take very long, and I think that’s why this model was put in 
place to say we want to be fair to the service providers and 
assist them with the cash flow.  And that is the whole idea 
Chair for the payments to be structured in that way. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The payments as I understand it 
would allow a contractor without financial muscle to bid 
and receive work and do work to facilitate the engagement 
of a contractor without much capital. 
10 
MR SODI:    Well that could very well be Chair, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We could go please to page 386, 
we have dealt with the preceding paragraphs already, 
paragraph 22.1. 
MR SODI:    Okay, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you recall we spoke earlier of 
the budgetary issues? 
MR SODI:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And here you explain the provision 
in the joint venture proposal that you would be appointed 
20 
on a risk basis and that you would be obliged in terms of 
the Service Level Agreement to sort out the finances.  If 
you – I am happy that, or I am sure the Chair would not 
mind, it being late in the day, you read the contents of this 
paragraph. 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 221 of 223 
 
MR SODI:   Ja, I understand what the paragraph means 
and I can explain it Chair.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SODI:    Ja, so when Mr Mpambani came back to give 
me feedback about these engagements that he has been 
having he said look the feedback is that we could be 
appointed, 
or 
we 
will 
be 
appointed, 
however 
the 
department at that point in time had not made provision 
budget-wise for these particular aspects.  He went on 
10 
further to say they had impressed upon him to say that 
look we will start the process, okay, of making sure that 
the item is in the business plan, so you can start working 
on risk using your own files but bearing in mind that there 
is a possibility that the business plan might not be 
approved, and if you had gone ahead and rendered 
services and used your own funds, and the business plan 
is not approved don’t come back and say you are going to 
sue us, you are doing it on a risk basis, so if you spend 
money and we don’t succeed in getting the business plan 
20 
approved that is your own baby, it is your own problem and 
you deal with it. 
 
That is my – that is exactly what the understanding 
was, and it so happened that when we started, actually 
started with the project, at that point in time, I think it was 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 222 of 223 
 
October, you know we can always check the dates, the 
business 
plan 
had 
not 
been 
approved, 
and 
I 
can 
demonstrate with evidential proof that we injected funds, I 
think it was about, just over R4million, into the project but 
we knew, and I knew specifically, I was – this was 
emphasized to me that if they come back and say look 
sorry guys we didn’t get the approval you would have lost 
your money and that was my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius I know that we said six 
o’clock, but you do look tired. 
10 
MR SODI:   He is asking me long questions Chair, he 
expects me to give him short answers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am trying my best to look tired 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Sodi on the other side seems to 
have more energy.   So no I just wanted to say we can go 
to six o’clock but if you feel too tired 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair I would appreciate 20 
minutes off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, no I think it is fine. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us stop here, we will arrange 
another date Mr Sodi your counsel and Mr Pretorius have 
discussed with me you will be notified of another date, we 
are going to try and make sure that it does not take too 
07 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 247 
 
Page 223 of 223 
 
long before you come back, but early next week we should 
be able to fix another date for you to come back.. 
MR SODI:    As long as it is any day except Monday to 
Friday Chair, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I suspect that you are challenging Mr 
Pretorius to continuing tomorrow and Saturday.   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We get on well, but not that well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much to everybody that 
10 
we – everybody cooperated for us to go beyond normal 
time to try and make use of the time.  We are going to 
adjourn for the day and another date will be determined 
early next week. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
