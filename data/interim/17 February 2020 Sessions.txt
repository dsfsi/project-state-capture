PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 17 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I – I propose this morning to do a few 
things in anticipation of starting with the first witness.  And the first is 
just to give an introduction to where we are in the evidence and then to 
deal with an application and certain procedural matters.   
10 
If I may begin then with where we are in the course of the 
evidence because I indicated at the outset of this session that my 
proposal was to do a short introduction at the beginning of each new 
investigation area.   
Chair today we take a slight detour from aviation matters and 
we focus the attention of the commission to Richards Bay in fact and 
the Mhlathuze Water Board.  Chair we will be exploring the conduct of 
the Water Board particularly during the period 2015 and 2016.  During 
this period Ms Duduzile Myeni was the Chairperson both of the 
Mhlathuze Water Board and South African Airways.  The investigation 
20 
has revealed Chair what appears to be an elaborate scheme of looting 
designed to siphon monies out of the Water Board for the benefit of 
employees and officials within the Water Board.  And there will be 
evidence over the next two days testifying to those features of the 
investigation.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 3 of 156 
 
Chair also during the period that we will be focusing on the 
Mhlathuze Water Board there was an RDP housing project that was 
underway in Vrede in the Free State.  Chair some of the monies for that 
project had been paid from the state’s coffers to the Free State – the 
Free State Development Corporation which is a corporation we have 
heard about previously in the evidence in this commission particularly 
in the aviation stream.   
Again in 2015 it was at a point in time going to be securing 
funding of R15 billion for SAA.  Those acts on the part of the Free 
State Development Corporation you have previously heard evidence 
10 
was stopped in its tracks when National Treasury intervened.  But it is 
again a place where Free State Development Corporation appears in 
the investigations of the commission.  Because what happened with the 
RDP housing project was that the Free State Development Corporation 
received certain funds and paid certain contractors from those funds 
who were appointed to the housing project.  And amongst those 
contractors Chair was an entity trading as VNA Consulting.   
Now part of what the commission’s investigations have sought 
to explore is whether there is any link between, on the one hand an 
alleged R2 million that was supposed to have been paid so the 
20 
allegation goes as a thank you fee to former President Zuma for his 
role in facilitating the appointment of certain of these contractors to the 
RDP housing project.  And the question is whether there is a link 
between that allegation and in that period the activities of the 
Mhlathuze Water Board, Ms Myeni and those connected with her.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 4 of 156 
 
Chair the evidence will commence with testimony from Mr 
Thalente Myeni who is the sole member of a Closed Corporation called 
Premier Attraction 1016.  Premier Attraction is the entity to which VNA 
Consulting paid R2 million in June of 2015.   
Chair the evidence will also include that of Mr Mboniseni 
Majola. Mr Majola was the Program Manager of Mhlathuze Water during 
the period that we are focusing on the investigation.  Mr Myeni has 
been summoned to give evidence today and Mr Majola tomorrow.   
Chair between their evidence the legal team intends to present 
the evidence of another witness.  This witness brings an application to 
10 
give his evidence in a manner that sill protect his name and his 
appearance from being publicly disclosed.  His evidence will be heard 
by the public if his application is granted and heard by everyone in this 
room but if he succeeds in his application he will not have his name or 
his appearance publicly revealed.   
Chair the witness is unrepresented.  He was represented at a 
point of the commission’s engagements with him but not for some 
period of time and it is for that reason that the legal team of the 
commission will move his application.  I am going to refer broadly to 
the application as his in-camera application but it is important that I 
20 
emphasis up front there are only two respects in which the witness 
seeks not to have his identity publicly disclosed.  He does not want to 
give – he does not seek to give the content of his evidence purely in 
camera.   
Chair there is a challenge with quite how to refer to a witness 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 5 of 156 
 
who brings such an application.  The witness is currently deposing to 
an affidavit seeking to clarify this.  What he seeks is that he be 
referred to as Mr X in his evidence.  Any reporting about his evidence 
similarly refer to him in that manner and that affidavit as I understand it 
is currently being deposed to as a supplement to the application that he 
finalised and seeks to move this morning.  He finalised that application 
only yesterday.   
Chair just a bit of background to the processes followed in 
relation to that application and why it was only available yesterday.  
Finalising the witness’ evidence has not been an easy feat Chair and 
10 
the reason for that is that quite simply he fears for his life in giving this 
evidence. 
The threat to him and his family in giving this evidence has 
been assessed by the Security Protection Services of the Commission 
and has been found to be real and credible.  As with Saturday he was 
placed in the custody of those services and he was only able to meet 
with the legal team for the first time yesterday. 
After that meeting his main affidavit was finalised and his 
application to bring this evidence in camera was also finalised.   
Chair within minutes of that finalisation and an appropriate 
20 
redaction of the affidavit notice was given to the persons who will be 
implicated in his evidence.  That was done by way of email 
communication yesterday and the notice was given to Mr Thalente 
Myeni who will be appearing to give evidence today.  Ms Duduzile 
Myeni, Mr Majola who will give evidence tomorrow and to former 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 6 of 156 
 
President Zuma.  All of that notification went to their lawyers because 
they are on record as being represented by lawyers with the 
commission at this stage. 
They were alerted to the fact that the application would be 
made this morning and they were provided with a copy of the 
application.  In a further effort to ensure that that application was 
received Chair this morning the Secretariat of the Commission made 
telephonic contact with all of those lawyers and they have all indicated 
receipt of the application. 
Insofar as Mr Thalente Myeni is concerned he is present and 
10 
his lawyers are present here with him.  I have not been advised that 
they have any response to the application but I am sure if they are 
afforded an opportunity they will make that clear.   
Chair with your leave then I would like to move that application 
if I may at the outset today because depending on the ruling certain 
arrangement will need to be put in place for the remainder of the 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supplementary affidavit are you able to place on 
record what it is going to deal with? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed I can do so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Insofar as you are able to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand it is currently being deposed to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 7 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But an investigator of the commission has 
confirmed with the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That he is happy with its contents and that it is 
underway to be deposed to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The essence of it is that he explains that he 
filed an application yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To give his evidence in camera in the respects 
10 
that I have described.  He indicates that his name was disclosed in that 
affidavit prior to it being redacted.  He then indicates that in order to 
navigate the evidence today and in order for it to be clear who brings 
the application he requests that he be referred to as Ms X in these 
proceedings and going forward in any publication in relation to this 
matter. 
 
And he makes it clear that he will sign this supplementary 
affidavit but that he – he trusts that steps will be taken again to redact 
it before there is any publication of the affidavit by the commission on 
its website or otherwise.   
20 
 
And I will be updated in the course of the morning as soon as 
a copy of that has been secured and we will hand it up to you Chair at 
the appropriate point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will – do we need to finalise this application before 
your first witness gives evidence or can it be dealt with later when we 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 8 of 156 
 
have got that supplementary affidavit with us? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We could certainly do it later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do it when the supplementary affidavit is 
available. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I have looked at the prayers sought in the application 
maybe I can say this, if I am satisfied that I should grant an order 
essentially protecting his identity and his name being disclosed I think 
10 
we could formulate a much shorter order. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Roughly something along these lines. 
1. The applicant’s non-compliance with – then you can specify the 
rules as hereby condoned. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
2. The applicant, - the applicant is to be referred to during his 
evidence and after his evidence insofar as the commission is 
concerned as Mr X. 
3. The applicant’s name shall not be disclosed or published in any 
20 
way. 
4. Nobody may take pictures of the applicant nor have his pictures 
or image or appearance published in any way.  The applicant 
need not be present at the venue of the hearing of the 
commission when giving his evidence and may give his evidence 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 9 of 156 
 
from a secret location.  Nobody other than the Chairperson or 
members of the commission’s legal team or the security advice of 
the commission may approach the secret – secret location from 
which the witness will give evidence without prior written 
permission of the Chairperson. 
I think more or less something along those lines it can be – when it is 
drafted it can be dealt with more elegantly than I have been doing.  Ja I 
think that may cover everything but… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do go back to the Notice of Motion if there are things 
10 
that I have not covered which you think are important then you can just 
retain them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the formulation should… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less be along the lines that I have indicated. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that the arrangement of the various orders 
or prayers may also be realigned. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can include the audio link part. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  What we will do in 
preparation for moving that application later once we are in receipt of 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 10 of 156 
 
the supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is we may just put this in the form of a draft 
order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For your consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Following the guidance you have given in 
relation to the formulation of the prayers.  But we will check if there is 
anything that in our view is still necessary to be included. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I had some concerns about 4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prayer 4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Seems to me unnecessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if the applicant’s concern is more about – I mean 
prayer 4 would allow that an implicated person gets to know him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on – must understand that he understands 
20 
that – that may have to be done. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that that – that he understands that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there may be no problem.  You can just… 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 11 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have a look at it again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed we are indebted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise we can deal with it at a later stage. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may then just deal with two procedural 
matters before we commence with Mr Myeni’s evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  The first is in relation to 
10 
another witness who was in fact scheduled to give oral evidence today.  
That was Mr Khan who was one of the engineers appointed on an 
engineering project for Mhlathuze in 2015.   
 
Chair during Mr Khan’s evidence it was the intention of the 
legal team of the commission to refer to another affidavit of one of the 
Closed Corporations who was doing construction work on one of these 
projects for Mhlathuze Water.  That was an affidavit deposed to by Mr 
Shange who is the managing member of Mdima Civils.  Now Mr 
Shange’s affidavit implicated or may have implicated certain persons in 
acts of wrongdoing and so notice was given on the 31 January to those 
20 
person to alert them to the fact that reference would be made to Mr 
Shange’s affidavit.   
 
Chair amongst the persons to whom notice was sent was 
Stefanutti Stocks which was also a company involved in some of the 
construction works for Mhlathuze at the time.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 12 of 156 
 
 
Stefanutti Stocks received notice on Friday the 31 January.  
That is more than 14 days prior to today.  But despite that Stefanutti 
Stocks responded to the notice through a letter sent to the commission 
on Friday afternoon and it claims to, in that letter to have been 
prejudiced despite the fact that it had been afforded the full 14 days in 
which to respond to Mr Shange’s affidavit and it seeks in essence more 
time to bring any application that it may wish to bring in terms of Rule 
3.3.6.   
 
The 
letter 
also 
notified 
the 
Secretariat 
that 
legal 
representatives for Stefanutti Stocks would be present today – they are 
10 
indeed here.  I have confirmed that.  And that they would watch the 
evidence, take note of it insofar as Stefanutti wanted to put before the 
commission any version of its own in the affidavit of Mr Shange and 
notification on the 31 January was the first time that it was disclosed to 
Stefanutti Stocks what allegations were being made against it and what 
the details of the affidavit contained.   
 
And the essence of their request is that they say they need 
more time to consider the affidavit – the allegations carefully, to 
identify people within Stefanutti who need to be consulted.  They raise 
the fact that some of those people may no longer be in the employ of 
20 
Stefanutti.  They say their lawyers need to take instructions and their 
client needs time to source documents. 
 
Chair the one thing that they do not say in their letter to the 
Secretariat on Friday is that the commission’s investigators have been 
engaged with Stefanutti Stocks since October of 2019.  They do not 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 13 of 156 
 
mention that there was a meeting with the commission’s investigator 
and Stefanutti Stocks and its lawyers on the 22 October 2019.  And 
they do not disclose that pursuant to that meeting and at that meeting 
the areas of investigation were disclosed to Stefanutti.  They do not 
disclose that after that meeting there have been numerous follow ups 
between October and January by the investigators of the commission 
seeking an affidavit from Stefanutti Stocks giving its version of the 
events that are going to revealed in the evidence over the next two 
days. 
 
Chair therefore to the extent that the request for this extension 
10 
seeks to paint a picture that Stefanutti was only alerted to these 
matters when it first received Mr Shange’s affidavit on the 31 January it 
is simply false.   
 
Stefanutti has been well aware of these matters and that they 
were being investigated since October of last year and has as a matter 
of fact missed every proposed deadline for submission of an affidavit to 
the commission. 
 
To that extent therefore the legal team does not support the 
request for an extension because it is not adequately motivated and it 
omits material facts.   
20 
 
Having said that though Chair the legal team sees no reason 
why Stefanutti Stocks should not give its version to this commission if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is our submission that it should.  We have 
been asking for it for some time.  And if all that they seek today is an 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 14 of 156 
 
opportunity to bear witness to this evidence and give an affidavit in due 
course certainly the legal team of the commission would have no 
difficulty with that.  But the notion that they get more than since 
October last year to present their version and make an application 
under Rule 3.3.6 the legal team of the commission certainly does not 
support that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course if they sought an extension of any period 
they would have had to bring a substantive application. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They have not brought any substantive application. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not ask for an extension by simply sending a 
letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not how things are done here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we do not propose to take it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Other than to record their efficient – their 
20 
position publicly as we always do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And furthermore to invite them in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If they wish to give a version to this 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 15 of 156 
 
commission to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair the final aspect of process is a matter 
related to Mr Khan’s evidence.  Since the finalisation of Mr X’s 
evidence yesterday the legal team has evaluated the proposed 
witnesses who would be – have been appearing for the course of this 
week’s evidence and it is our proposal Chair that it is not necessary in 
fact to receive oral testimony from Mr Khan. 
 
Let me just be clear and this will unfold in the next two days.  
Mr Khan’s evidence, Mr Shange’s evidence and the evidence of a Mr 
10 
Paton are all in a sense corroborative versions of the evidence that Mr 
X will give if he is permitted to give it in the terms that he has 
requested.  And in the interest of time and efficiencies in this 
commission the legal team does not believe it is necessary also to 
present Mr Khan’s evidence orally in the commission. 
 
Of course Chair that is done as it always is done provisionally.  
If an aspect of his affidavit’s evidence which will then be put to the 
witnesses who do testify becomes contentious there would always be 
an opportunity to revisit the need for him to come and give oral 
evidence.  But it is our proposal that it is unnecessary at this stage and 
20 
pursuant to that we would request that you release him from giving oral 
evidence today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mr Shange? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Khan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khan? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 16 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You propose to hand up his affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Khan is released from the 
proceedings today. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we can proceed with Mr Myeni’s 
10 
evidence if all is in order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us do that.  Will somebody call him? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I think he is present in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he will be coming forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Take a seat there Mr Myeni.  Please 
administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MYENI:  Thalente Cyril Myeni. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
20 
MR MYENI:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MYENI:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 17 of 156 
 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR MYENI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. As a matter of housekeeping 
Mr Myeni’s affidavit and documents related to his evidence have been 
put together in Bundle DD27.  May I request for the record that we 
enter it as Exhibit DD27? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Thalente Cyril Myeni’s affidavit together with 
annexures will be admitted as Exhibit DD27.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Myeni in front of you is a 
file containing what we will be referring to in this hearing as Exhibit 
DD27.  You will see at the top right hand corner of each page is page 
numbers printed in red.  So when I make reference to a particular page 
that is where you will look in order to follow in your own copy of the 
file.  And the other thing just to mention is just to make sure that that 
microphone is close enough to you so that your voice is sufficiently 
amplified in the course of the evidence.  Mr Myeni can you clarify for us 
your position in the Closed Corporation Premier Attraction 1016? 
MR MYENI:  I am the sole shareholder and managing member. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And how long has the Closed 
Corporation been in existence? 
MR MYENI:  It was registered in 2000 maybe 2007 somewhere there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what work does it do? 
MR MYENI:  Mostly consulting work in various fields. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 18 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you give us a sense of those fields? 
MR MYENI:  Property, property development, just various – it is – I 
mean it is – when I registered the entity really it was you know my first 
sort of entry into business so I have done a lot of things over the years 
using the same entity.  Hospitality, events etcetera.  Many things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what sort of annual turnover 
does the business have? 
MR MYENI:  Fluctuate – it has fluctuated over the years so it is difficult 
to give a number.  Some years have been better than others. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you give us a range? 
10 
MR MYENI:  It is difficult to say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How many staff are employed? 
MR MYENI:  At different points different staff was employed and again 
there is no constant standard amount of staff that is employed.  It will 
be – just depends.  And also in certain – some of the projects we do 
not need to employ full time staff so we sort of sub-contract or you 
know get consultants in or whatever it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In 2015 how many staff did it employ? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say for sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How would you be able to say for sure? 
20 
MR MYENI:  Maybe I would need to check SARS records for maybe Pay 
As You Earn or something like that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MYENI:  And maybe – ja that would be – I do not really have the 
records. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 19 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have a sense of 1, 2, 20, 30? 
MR MYENI:  No not 20, 30 maybe – I do not know.  I cannot – it is 
difficult to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the biggest number that the close corporation 
has had over the years in terms of staff?  The highest number that you 
remember that it reached. 
MR MYENI:  I - I cannot say Chair.  As I said you know we - we would 
employ people on a project by project basis.  Some would be 
permanent.  Some not.  So it is - and I mean it is 2015.  I - I really 
cannot recall what … (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No - no.  I am not talking about 2015.  I just talk 
about the entire period since it was registered.  What is the highest 
number that you can remember to say well the - the highest number of 
staff that I have ever had is 10 or 20 or … 
MR MYENI:  It is difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or seven? 
MR MYENI:  It is difficult to say Chair, because also I - you know I run 
a number of businesses.  So to - to pinpoint who is employed where at 
any given point is quite difficult.  So I do not want to say a number and 
then … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR MYENI:  That is not the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would your staff under this CC also help in other 
businesses that you have other than this … 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 20 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  This CC? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm … 
MR MYENI:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but - and what is the lowest number it has ever 
had in terms of …? 
MR MYENI:  It would always - it would always have one.  Which is 
myself? 
CHAIRPERSON:  One? 
MR MYENI:  Which is myself as a managing member and … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  So it will always have at least one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That - that is one other than yourself as a 
member of the CC? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I am saying it will always have me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay … 
MR MYENI:  In the employ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But sometimes you would have somebody else? 
20 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Sometimes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  There is other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Sometimes it would just be yourself? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MYENI:  Thanks Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And where are its offices? 
MR MYENI:  Okay.  Currently we are in Sandton.  Based in Sandton. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where were you previously? 
MR MYENI:  It has always been in Sandton, but we just moved various 
offices within the Sandton area. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you ever had offices at Design Quarter in 
Fourways? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And have you ever employed a Mr Mokotong? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to spell that name? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair.  Thank you for the reminder.  
That is M-O-K-O-T-O-N-G. 
MR MYENI:  Can you say the first name please? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Moeketsi. 
MR MYENI:  Oh yes.  No.  Never employed him.  No … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
MR MYENI:  But we were in a business relationship with them at some 
point. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will come to that. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Myeni you received a Regulation 106 
directive from the Chairperson of the Commission.  Requiring you to 
give the Commission on affidavit all the information that you had 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 22 of 156 
 
available to you.  Your knowledge of and your records of two sets of 
transactions.  Do you recall that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what I would like to do in your evidence is 
focus on those two sets of transactions … 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I talk about them as two sets, because 
there is a transaction.  The one that I referred to in the opening of the 
evidence where VNA Consulting paid R2 million to Premier Attraction. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That occurred in June 2015.  Are you aware of 
that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then the second set of 
transactions are payments made later in 2015 and early 2016 from 
Premier Attraction to an entity called Isibonelo.  Are you aware of those 
transactions? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  I am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So let us start with the first set.  
That is the payment from VNA Consulting to Premier Attraction.  Do you 
20 
recall the date on which that payment was made? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I - I know received the - but I do not recall what - 
what date it was now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have actually … 
MR MYENI:  Sometime in 2015 though. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 23 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  It was 19 June 2015. 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to refresh your memory. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now if we go to your affidavit that you provided 
to the Commission in response to the directive.  You will find that at 
page 1 of EXHIBIT DD27. 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to pick it up at paragraph 3 there.  
Could you please indicate to the Chair and the Commission what your - 
10 
you indicated in that paragraph is your best recollection about that 
payment? 
MR MYENI:  Sorry.  Please say that again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Could you please indicate to the Chairperson 
what you state in paragraph 3 is what your best … 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Recollection was … 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In relation to that payment? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  It is Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was that?  Why did you receive the 
payment? 
MR MYENI:  Must I read what I said or …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You can read it or you can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can read or you can just say it. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 24 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  So it - we were involved in a housing development in 
Mpumalanga - private housing development - and we were rendering 
some services - consulting services through Premier Attraction and we 
received that payment for work done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reference to Mpumalanga is a reference to 
the Mpumalanga Province? 
MR MYENI:  Province.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  No.  In KZN there is a township called 
10 
Mpumalanga. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we - we are talking about the province here.  
Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Could you tell us a little bit more?  What 
- what was the project about? 
MR MYENI:  Well it was a - a project specifically to build or 
design/build housing for - I do not know how you classify, but it was 
20 
workers - sort of Government workers for - like nurses and teachers 
etcetera.  That kind of level and they would then be assisted to secure 
bonds to buy those properties, but they were being developed with a 
specific purpose to looking at their affordability etcetera and I think in 
that area there - there was a shortage of - of properties of that nature.  
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 25 of 156 
 
So that - that is really what - what it was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What particular area? 
MR MYENI:  I forgot the name of the - the area now in Mpumalanga.  I 
do not want to guess the name.  It might have been Emzinoni.  Maybe.  
I have - I have forgot. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the name of the project? 
MR MYENI:  I do not think it had a specific name.  It could have been 
the name of the area.  Housing development.  So if it was Emzinoni.  It 
would be Emzinoni Housing development.  I would … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you remember what extension of Emzinoni? 
10 
MR MYENI:  No.  I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And where was it located?  Did you ever visit 
the site? 
MR MYENI:  In Mpumalanga.  No.  Our work did not require us to really 
visit the site. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just give us a little bit more insight.  What 
particular services did Premier render to VNA in relation to the project? 
MR MYENI:  Mostly design work for the actual structures.  The actual 
houses. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how many people did you have working on 
20 
the project? 
MR MYENI:  There was a lot of people working on the project.  A 
combination of people from VNA and Premier Attraction.  I cannot recall 
the number now, but there was a couple of people that were brought in. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was your role? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 26 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  I was managing the work from the Premier Attraction side. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who did you deal with at VNA? 
MR MYENI:  I dealt with Mr Naicker maybe - the surname.  Mr Vikash - 
I know his surname is Vikash.  Mr Vikash Naicker.  I - I suspect. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think his surname is Narsai. 
MR MYENI:  Oh Narsai. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the record that is spelt N-A-R-S-A-I. 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Apologies. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not at all and anyone else? 
MR MYENI:  Ja.  There were a couple of people that we worked with.  I 
cannot recall who they are now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how long had you known Mr Narsai? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot recall. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had you known him before this work? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For a number of years before that? 
MR MYENI:  I - I cannot recall.  I do not know if it was a number of 
years.  Maybe not years, but it had been some time prior. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And had you worked together before this 
project? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I do not - no.  I do not think so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now at paragraph 4 on page 11 of your affidavit 
you say: 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 27 of 156 
 
“VNA 
Consulting 
was 
the 
main 
independent 
contractor and/or consultant for the said project.” 
MR MYENI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at paragraph 5 you say: 
“Premier Attraction was subcontracted by VNA.” 
Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  That is correct.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you go on and you describe in paragraph 5 
what Premier Attraction was contracted to do.  You say there and I 
quote: 
10 
“It was subcontracted by VNA as consultants to 
“carry out some of VNA’s services or scope of work 
in respect to the above mentioned project.” 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I think the evidence you gave a moment 
ago was that the work that you were doing was design work on 
structures.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the arrangement insofar as fees 
were concerned for Premier’s work? 
MR MYENI:  Well we agreed on scope of work and I mean I assume - 
ja.  We would have agreed on scope of work and then he fee for that 
work.  There was no formula. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 28 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What - what was the arrangement? 
MR MYENI:  There was no formula.  When you say arrangement what 
do you mean? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the fees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what rate was your close corporation going to be 
paid … 
MR MYENI:  Oh.  So we … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on?  What was the - that is what she is talking 
about. 
MR MYENI:  Oh yes.  So - apologies.  So we did not have like an hourly 
10 
kind of - it was not like that arrangement.  So we had a set amount of 
money that we are going to receive and a set of services that we had to 
do and that was it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the amount that you were to receive? 
MR MYENI:  R2 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  R2 million and how were you going to account 
for that R2 million? 
MR MYENI:  Account in what … (intervenes)? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you going to …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were you going to do?  How much - how much 
20 
work were you required to do in order to earn the R2 million? 
MR MYENI:  Ja.  So it was the scope of services that we would have 
had at the time which I - I obviously cannot recall exactly now what it 
was, but that is - so that is how we are going to account.  We are going 
to deliver on the work that we had to do. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 29 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you have no recollection of precisely what 
that work was? 
MR MYENI:  Mainly it would have been around design, space planning, 
planning whether to have single storey, double storey house.  Ja.  It is 
- I cannot really recall exactly what it was, but it would around … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And over what …? 
MR MYENI:  That. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And over what period were you going to be 
doing this work that would earn you R2 million? 
MR MYENI:  Well it would have been as quickly as we could finish the 
10 
work I guess.  It was not - there was no really defined period, but I 
made sure the development itself as a whole had a period - defined 
period of when it needed to reset milestones, but for us and maybe at 
the time we did have a - I - I really cannot recall the exact details. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have a sense of when you started this 
work? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I - I do not have a sense of the times exactly, but it 
would have been at the beginning of the development. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When was that? 
MR MYENI:  I do not know.  I cannot recall. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the payment was in 2015.  Is it not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  June 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  June 2015. 
MR MYENI:  Yes, but Chair it could have been - it could have been 
even in 2014 that the development would have or the developer … 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 30 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MYENI:  Would have said to VNA here is a contract.  This is what 
we are looking for, because it is quite involved Chair.  This thing 
involves bulk works.  You have to figure out where the pipes are going 
to run and it is quite a lot of work.  So - ja.  I cannot really say when 
and how long and all of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do you - do you know whether at the time when 
you received the payment you completed your part of the work? 
MR MYENI:  I would have - I would assume yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MYENI:  We would have completed our work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you cannot remember when - when you may have 
completed - which month and so on? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I cannot - I cannot recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I - I have just been sent a 
note Mr Myeni.  If you would not mind raising a voice a bit when you 
speak. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is just not been recorded as well as it should 
20 
be. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you help then Mr Myeni with what the 
SACPCMP is? 
MR MYENI:  I am not sure what that is? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 31 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are not sure.  Do you know the South 
African 
Council 
for 
Project 
and 
Construction 
Management 
Professionals? 
MR MYENI:  Not really.  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No.  Do you know that they are a body that 
publishes guidelines for the scope of services on these types of 
housing projects? 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you do not know that? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you proceed Ms Hofmeyr.  Mr Myeni, 
from what you have said in your affidavit it appears that effectively you 
say you were subcontracted by VNA.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you subcontract the work further to somebody 
else or did - did you do it yourself? 
MR MYENI:  Ja.  So we would have brought in other consultants to 
come in and do certain aspects maybe of work that we could not do in 
house or whatever it would have been, but - ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but you would not have subcontracted it as such.  
You would have brought in people to … 
MR MYENI:  Ja.  So - so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To help you do the work? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  So similarly even with this subcontracting.  I do not 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 32 of 156 
 
think it is - you must define it as - as strongly as subcontracting per se, 
but we were brought in to provide certain skills and to do certain work 
towards the project.  So similarly if we needed to also bring in certain 
you know skills or expertise we would do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say your arrangement might not have been 
subcontracting in the true sense? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Ja.  I mean it - it is subcontracting in practice, 
because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MYENI:  They are the main contractor.  They receive the contract 
10 
and then they farm out work to whomever it is that they feel they want 
to bring on board to the project.  So in a sense it is subcontracting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Did you conclude any written 
agreements to capture the arrangement that you had with VNA? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot recall, but I would think that we would have 
captured something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MYENI:  Ja.  I think we should have.  We would have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There would have been a written record? 
20 
MR MYENI:  There - there would have maybe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have no records yourself though of that.  
Do you? 
MR MYENI:  No.  We actually have no records of you know the - the 
project.  I mean of - we have - we have looked.  We have tried to find 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 33 of 156 
 
documents.  We cannot find them.  We have moved offices etcetera.  
So I do not have and I mean it is from 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  We do not keep the records that long. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You do not?  Why - why do you not keep 
records that long? 
MR MYENI:  Well I guess one did not anticipate that it would be asked 
questions about it five years later.  I mean if I had to keep records of 
everything from 2017 that would be quite - quite a lot of records to 
keep. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is usually a statutory reference - 
certainly for companies.  That they keep records for five years.  Is that 
not a provision that you have put in place in your business? 
MR MYENI:  No.  Not necessarily, because mostly the line of work that 
we - we do.  We - I do not think it falls within that.  That the reason why 
we should keep them that long. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You also said in your affidavit that you have no 
email communications either.  You will see at page 2.  You say at 
paragraph 7: 
“I do not have any email communication relating to 
20 
these payments as I did not keep any records in 
respect thereof.” 
MR MYENI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you just help me with what that means?  
That you did not keep any records of email communications. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 34 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  I think maybe that is not capturing what we were trying to 
say correctly … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  But I was answering to a question around “do you have 
any emails?” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR MYENI:  “Do you have any records?” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR MYENI:  Etcetera.  So I think we just sort of grouped it into one but 
basically what I was saying is that I went through my emails.  I have 
10 
since changed laptops and computers multiple times.  I do not have 
those emails and I do not have any physical records of - of any of the 
documents whether it would be the agreement I just spoke of etcetera 
… (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand. 
MR MYENI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you just help me with another acronym?  
Do you know who PROCSA is? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you would - it would be new to you to learn 
20 
that they are the Professional Consultants Services Agreement 
Committee.  Would it? 
MR MYENI:  Sure.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would be news to you if you had signed an 
agreement that had been designed by PROCSA if you did not know 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 35 of 156 
 
PROCSA? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And again just to try and get the chronology a 
bit clearer here.  The payment was in June 2015.  Right.  Can you give 
us some idea of when VNA first engaged you to supply services for the 
project? 
MR MYENI:  I do not know what to say except it would have been for 
the payment. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well that would certainly be the case.  Would it 
not? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I assume from your evidence you identified 
VNA was the main contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well I am not sure about that Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  May we not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have had lots of evidence comes before work is 
done. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is true.  It is true, but I understand 
20 
Mr Myeni’s - he - he cannot be more specific than to say the agreement 
would have been concluded prior to the payment.  Are you - are you 
comfortable with that evidence? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the other thing I want to do just to try and 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 36 of 156 
 
help with the chronology is.  If VNA was the main contractor and you 
were brought in by them. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I assume their relationship with the client 
would have been established first.  Then they would have brought you 
in and at some later point you would have received the payment.  Is 
that a fair description of the chronology? 
MR MYENI:  Sorry.  Please say that again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we have already established in your 
evidence your agreement with VNA would have preceded the payment 
10 
on 19 June 2015. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I said your evidence before the 
Commission has been that VNA was the main contractor … 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Appointed to the client … 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that you were then brought in by VNA.  Is 
20 
that correct? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  Explain why. 
MR MYENI:  Because I know the client. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Sorry.  I thought that your evidence 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 37 of 156 
 
earlier was that VNA had contracted you. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not want to use the formal term of … 
MR MYENI:  Subcontractor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Subcontractor. 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that led me to conclude that their 
arrangement with the client would have preceded your being involved … 
MR MYENI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But is that not the case? 
10 
MR MYENI:  No, because I knew the client. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So how did you become involved? 
MR MYENI:  Involved in what exactly? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To provide the services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the project.  In the project. 
MR MYENI:  In - okay.  To provide … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  How did you …? 
MR MYENI:  There are two things Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  Two provide the services and then project are two different 
20 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  So in terms of the project I know the client.  I know the 
project owner and through a series of conversations and discussions 
which I do not remember how they really went and maybe as - as you 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 38 of 156 
 
have said Ms Hofmeyr.  These bodies that you talk of that would have 
been why VNA would have been the contractor to the client - to the 
project. 
To fulfil all those things which I assume they had.  Then they 
brought us in separately. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They being VNA? 
MR MYENI:  VNA, brought us in separately, but … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  I have always - I knew the project owner - the developer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  That is fine, but that is a separate matter. 
10 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am trying to deal with chronology … 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because your consistent testimony has been 
VNA is the main contractor and then they bring you in.  Right.  So in 
terms of chronology I want to clarify with you.  They would have been 
appointed as the main contractor.  Then they brought you in and those 
two events must have happened before 19 June 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, but it does not mean that it will follow that.  I know 
the client.  So it - it - V … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So could you have been brought in before VNA 
was the main contractor? 
MR MYENI:  So - so when I say brought in.  VNA brought us in to 
subcontract us or to contract with us.  Whatever we will call it, but it 
does not mean I did not know the client prior. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 39 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have any involvement in the project other 
than your involvement at the request of VNA? 
MR MYENI:  No other involvement in the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your only involvement in the project was via your 
arrangement with VNA? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is correct to say VNA brought you into the 
project.  Is that right? 
MR MYENI:  Not into the project, because I already knew of the project 
and I knew the developer of the project.  I just did not have a - a role in 
10 
terms of services to play at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no when - when we - when I say brought you 
in.  Firstly you were the one who used that terminology that VNA 
brought you in.  I mean for purposes of doing the work that you - we 
are talking about. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  They - they brought you in for purpose of doing 
that work? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who was the client? 
MR MYENI:  I forgot the company name, but Moeketsi would have been 
one of them. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 40 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mokotong? 
MR MYENI:  Mr … yes.  Moeketsi Mokotong. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mokotong. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
MR MYENI:  Yes and he had a partner at the time as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when do you recall your first interactions 
with him about the project? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say, but I have definitely known them longer than 
I knew VNA Consulting, but I cannot recall when I would have started 
10 
talking to them about the project.  I cannot recall. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Myeni, the Commission has also engaged 
Mr Narsai … 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And VNA Consulting about this payment. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Narsai’s recollection of the events 
around the project is different to yours. 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does that surprise you? 
20 
MR MYENI:  It will definitely surprises me, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see what Mr Narsai says is he says 
Premier was initially the development manager to Optics and he says 
you appointed various consultants.  You being Premier.  Appointed 
various consultants to do work on the private housing development and 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 41 of 156 
 
that in early 2015 you approached VNA to take over management of the 
project and Mr Narsai has provided the Commission with a pack of 
documents that make up the file in front of you. 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which he says is all of the reports that you as 
Premier had arranged through the people that you had brought into 
assist you.  Remember you said earlier you would sometimes bring 
people in for skills.  So he says when VNA was going to be taking over 
from Premier you provided to him this wad of documents which are 
reports on all sorts of scoping aspects for the housing development. 
10 
There is electricity plans.  There is water and sanitation and 
he says - I am summarising now - the essence is.  It is you first there 
as Premier as the development manager.  Right.  It is you getting all 
these contractors to do this work and to prepare these reports, but then 
at a point in early 2015 you need VNA to take over the roll from you. 
So you in a sense give them - give VNA all the reports and it 
is becue you hand over that VNA owes you two million.  Do you accept 
that that is different to the version you have given this morning? 
MR MYENI:  It - it is very different yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is.  Yes.  Does it - he - he of course has a 
20 
wad of documents … 
MR MYENI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To support the version that he has provided. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does this becoming familiar with his version 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 42 of 156 
 
help to jog your memory at all? 
MR MYENI:  Ja.  I do not need my memory jogged per se, but you know 
it is difficult to say that Mr Narsai is being dishonest, but it - 
unfortunately that is what it is.  So those documents whichever they are 
must be signed off if they are reports.  If they are all of that.  So that 
should tell us who signed them off, one. 
Two, my recollection tells me that those documents actually 
came from the developer themselves, because they would have had to 
do preliminary work to see whether the project or the development 
would take off or would work and then we came in later.  So as to 
10 
whether you know they knew the client before me.  No.  That is not the 
case, but in terms of our involvement. 
Our involvement came in through VNA Consulting and there is 
no work that we did prior.  There is no work that we did prior to us 
being involved with VNA Consulting.  Again you can check those - those 
reports.  I can assure you.  My signature is not on them or any of the 
people that I have ever worked with or subcontracted or brought into 
consult.  That I … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How …? 
MR MYENI:  That I can be sure. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How do you know your signature is not on 
those documents? 
MR MYENI:  Because I did not do those reports. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But how do you know what reports I am 
referring to? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 43 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  You - you mentioned electricity something and whatever 
else that you mentioned.  So when it comes to those things that is what 
I am specifically responding to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you able to say that there was never any 
report that bore your name in relation to this project? 
MR MYENI:  No.  I cannot say there was never any report, because 
obviously we had to do work around the project, but I am saying 
electricity and whatever you would have mentioned.  That would not 
have been our - part of our scope. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you have no records at all of that work 
10 
that you did? 
MR MYENI:  No.  Unfortunately, I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And VNA’s version before the Commission is 
that all of these various plans that I will take you to now were provided 
by you to them.  Is that false? 
MR MYENI:  It would have been possible that the developer would have 
given me the information to pass on.  It - It is a possibility.  I do not 
want to deny that outright without really remembering, but - ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to some of those reports if we may.  
You will find the first set commencing at page 13 of DD27. 
20 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you just help us with what those are? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  Okay.  I have seen what I 
was not seeing.  So it is fine.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 44 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page are we on to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are on page 13 of DD27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what - what are these - 13 runs to about 
page 42 or so.  Well let us start before that to 38.  They appear to be 
diagrams and plans.  Can you help us with what they are? 
MR MYENI:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say at page 38? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes it runs from 13 to 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the page you want us to look at right is? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is 13 indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is 13? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   One three Chair.   What are these? 
MR MYENI:    I don’t know, I can’t see what it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You can’t see what it is. 
MR MYENI:    Ja, it’s not clear  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that copy is quite bad, it’s very poor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That was the copy that the Commission 
20 
received from, there is a better copy of the same but I am worried you 
may have the same answer Mr Myeni but maybe just assist us if you 
may, go to page 273 in the same bundle, DD27 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you say 273 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   273 indeed Chair. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 45 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So what is that? 
MR MYENI:    It says the sewer layout. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is this a document you have seen before? 
MR MYENI:    I don’t recall I have seen this one, but yes I have seen a 
similar document before. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   For the development? 
MR MYENI:    Ja, I would have seen something like this yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you can’t recall seeing this one? 
MR MYENI:    This one exactly no. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   This is one of the ones that Mr Narsai said you 
provided to him when VNA took over the work from you as development 
manager, what’s your response to that? 
MR MYENI:    Well they didn’t take over from me, I was never 
development manager, and as I said it is possible I would have sent 
him information from the developer or from the client, it is possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you don’t recall this document? 
MR MYENI:   No, not specifically.   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that it is possible that you did provide 
this document to him after you had obtained it from the developer?  
20 
MR MYENI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is it also possible that other documents that he 
may be referring to may be documents that you did provide to him after 
obtaining them from the developer?  
MR MYENI:   Yes Chair 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 46 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who was the developer? 
MR MYENI:   Mr Mokotong, I just forgot the ...[intervenes]   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Octex? 
MR MYENI:   Oh yes, Octex I remember now yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Was it Octex?   So just explain to me why 
would the developer Octex give you documents to give to VNA? 
MR MYENI:   Depending on when they would have given it to me it is 
because we were working together.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It sounds like you would be receiving them if 
10 
you were the manager, doesn’t it?  Why else would you receive them to 
give them on to a main contractor? 
MR MYENI:   Well because I knew the developer prior, I think we had a 
long-standing relationship or better relationship that VNA, so it is not a 
surprising thing and also although VNA are obviously in Johannesburg, 
they 
are 
based 
in 
Durban, 
so 
the 
developer 
was 
based 
in 
Johannesburg, I am based in Johannesburg, so I think it would be 
easier to share information and sometimes information is quite thick to 
be emailed etcetera, so it is – I don’t see ... 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Myeni I understand that if you and Octex 
20 
are located in Johannesburg it might be easier save for the advances of 
email 
technology 
for 
Octex 
to share 
documents 
with you 
in 
Johannesburg, but we are talking about why you would have been the 
one to give documents to VNA in Durban in circumstances where the 
main relationship is between Octex and VNA. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 47 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   We were part of the project ma’am, I don’t see what would 
be wrong with sharing of information?  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am probing the logic of it Mr Myeni, your 
evidence is that VNA was the main contractor to Octex.    
MR MYENI:   Yes.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   On what possible basis would Octex give you 
documents relevant to the project when you played a subordinate role 
to VNA? 
MR MYENI:   As I said I can’t answer that question but maybe to say 
because the documents are thick, as I think we can see, to email them 
10 
is a bit difficult so maybe they would have said send it to me and I 
would have then met with VNA at their offices whenever they were in 
Johannesburg and to discuss them or to work through them, I have no 
idea, I cannot tell you why but there is nothing about to say why did 
they send the documents to me, I was part of the project and as I said I 
had an established relationship with the developer prior and even 
outside of this development, so I don’t see an issue.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr Myeni I need to put it to you that it is highly 
improbable that the client in this arrangement would have had difficulty 
emailing reports to their main contractor and as a consequence of that 
20 
gave them to you to give to the main contractor when the main 
contractor happened to travel up to Johannesburg for a meeting to look 
at the reports, do you have a response to that? 
MR MYENI:   So as an example with document like that, so this 
document has been reduced to A4 size, normally these documents you 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 48 of 156 
 
lay out on a table, so maybe that’s the reason why I would have 
received some of the documents because you couldn’t email them, as I 
am trying to say, but ja, other than that I can’t say why they would have 
sent it to me except for the fact that I was part of the project and I 
would have had to be privy to some of these documents.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why?   You said you had nothing to do with 
sewer works or electricity? 
MR MYENI:   Ja, I never ...[intervenes]   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So would you have to have seen these 
documents? 
10 
MR MYENI:   But you have to be privy to documents – well okay okay, 
so when you have to design a development or you put together your 
structures etcetera, as I have mentioned that you have to decide what 
the structures must look like etcetera, etcetera, you have to understand 
where your sewer lines run, you have to understand where they’re 
planning the roads to be, so you have to be, you have to at least see 
the documents.  All I said I did not compile these reports and 
documents, it doesn’t mean I never saw them.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you worked with them? 
MR MYENI:   It is possible yes that I worked with them.  
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you recall working with these documents? 
MR MYENI:   I recall working with a lot of documents yes, with a lot of 
documents on the table that we would look at and decide certain things.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to be clear again you still, you have 
absolutely no records of your design work on these structures? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 49 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   Maybe Mr Narsai has but I don’t.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I beg your pardon, maybe? 
MR MYENI:   Maybe VNA Consulting has, because we would have sort 
of sent everything to them, they would have then compiled the final sort 
of document and so maybe they have, but I don’t have any records on 
hand.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to go back to what VNA has said to 
the Commission and Mr Narsai, so you recall the one bone of 
contention or conflict is you say they were the main contractor and you 
were brought in by them, they say the reverse was the case, you were 
10 
initially appointed as the development manager but handed over to 
them at a point in 2015. 
MR MYENI:   Sure.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can I just be clear your testimony today is 
VNA is incorrect in its description of the events? 
MR MYENI:   Yes and I would urge anyone to bring a document to 
reflect that I was the main contractor and passed it on to them.  
Anybody who has that information please ...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you will do recall an agreement being 
concluded, is that right? 
20 
MR MYENI:   I said I am not 100% sure whether we concluded an actual 
agreement and what it would have looked like, I just know that we 
would have received a scope of services and we would have agreed an 
amount to be paid, but between the developer, Octex and Premier 
Attraction there is no agreement appointing us as a main contractor. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 50 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So what agreement was there between Octex 
and Premier? 
MR MYENI:  I don’t know, I don’t recall what agreement there would 
have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I – Ms Hofmeyr may be meaning agreement 
reaching or oral, in other words what were the terms of the agreement 
as you remember them, whether it was original agreement or an oral 
agreement, what is your recollection of the main terms and conditions 
of your engagement by VNA?  
MR MYENI:   There would have been a scope of services Chair and 
10 
there would have been an amount agreed, I can’t say exactly 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It would have been here is the scope of the work that 
you must perform and if you do that maybe if you finish it within a 
certain time then you will be paid R2million. 
MR MYENI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the period of time you had to 
complete the works?  
MR MYENI:   I can’t recall. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And this is the agreement between yourselves 
and the developer, Octex is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   No, with VNA Consulting, as per the Chair’s question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I was talking about VNA and his close 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 51 of 156 
 
corporation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, and your relationship with Octex how 
was that agreed? 
MR MYENI:   Agreed in what sense? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well did you have an agreement about the role 
you would play directly to Octex? 
MR MYENI:   I don’t think I would have had an agreement with Octex. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Despite the fact that them using you to get 
documents to VNA? 
MR MYENI:   They were not using me to get documents to anybody 
10 
ma’am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I thought your testimony a moment ago had 
been that the reason why Octex didn’t just give these documents 
directly to its main contractor VNA, was because you were utilised to 
give the documents to VNA.  Did I have that evidence incorrect? 
MR MYENI:   I was simply just trying to give you a picture of the 
possibilities.  As I said I don’t recall, all I said to you though is that – 
because I know what I would or would not have done in terms of work, I 
know my limitations, skill level, expertise etcetera, so I would have 
never been a main developer or development manager, because I have 
20 
never provided that service as a company in my entire sort of career. 
 
Similarly the reports that you referred to about the electricity 
etcetera, etcetera, we wouldn’t have done that, so that’s what I was 
simply saying, and then in terms of them using me to get documents I 
don’t think that is putting it correctly.  I was simply saying a possibility 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 52 of 156 
 
would be because they are based in Durban documents will be sent to 
us because we are all working together.  Also some of these documents 
as actually not A4 as you see them that’s why it’s difficult to even see 
and read them because they are actually much bigger than this. 
 
So ja, that is why. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Octex just as I understand it from your 
evidence was the client in this arrangement, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why then was your arrangement not directly 
with the client? 
10 
MR MYENI:   In what way must it be direct with the client? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well you have explained that pursuant to the 
question that I asked that there was no agreement between yourself 
and Octex, so I want to understand why that was not the case. 
MR MYENI:   Maybe there were some services that just didn’t have the 
expertise to provide and if there was certain experience they wouldn’t 
have so that’s why we would have gone, or they would have gone with 
VNA, who has got, who has done projects of this scale, so we were a 
small emerging black company just being given an opportunity really, 
so you know we didn’t have years and years of experience in this. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No I am not suggesting Mr Myeni that you 
contrary to VNA’s case were the development manager, because I 
understand you to say you reject Mr Nasai’s version that you played 
that role. 
MR MYENI:   Ja, definitely. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 53 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am interested in why for your specific scope 
of services there wasn’t an agreement between yourself and Octex? 
MR MYENI:   Because our work was based on the scope that would 
have been given to VNA, so VNA would have given us a portion of their 
scope of work, so there would have not been a need per se to have an 
arrangement with Octex, I don’t know.   Maybe we might have, you 
know I really can’t recall what we would have had and not had with 
Octex because as I said I have known Mr Mokotong and his partner for 
some time so we have had many dealings and discussions and I mean 
you start companies and they don’t work out, and so there could be a 
10 
lot of information floating around out there, that I cannot recall today, 
but specifically in regards to this project, that is what I’m answering, 
but I don’t want to answer generally and broadly and then 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No I am certainly not requesting a general 
answer, I am requesting a very specific answer about whether there 
was an agreement between yourself and Octex. 
MR MYENI:   It is possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is possible, you don’t recall. 
MR MYENI:   I can’t say. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You were doing work to earn a fee of 
R2million, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Does it not, is that not something you would 
want to have committed to writing, the terms on which you would be 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 54 of 156 
 
paid etcetera. 
MR MYENI:   Ja, sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes.  But you didn’t commit it to writing. 
MR MYENI:   As I am saying it is possible we did, but I cannot recall 
and I don’t have that document with me, but it is very possible that we 
did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right.  Let us then go, if we may to a few more 
of these reports.   You will find at page 47 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe this is the right time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes., we will take the tea adjournment and we will 
resume at half past eleven. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Myeni just before the break 
I was going to take you to another of the reports that Mr Narsai and V and 
A have indicated to the Commission you provided to them, because of 
20 
sub-contractors you had secured to do various works on the project.  
Before I take you there can I just clarify, your evidence today is that you 
did not sub-contract these various entities who provided reports.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MYENI:   Which various entities? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 55 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The ones that we, I thought you said previously 
you did your own work as Premier, you did not sub-contract to any people 
doing sewer or electricity or quantity surveying on the project.  Is that 
right? 
MR MYENI:   Sewer, electricity, quantity surveying?  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, okay, let us go through each of them so we 
can be absolutely clear about your evidence, right?  Let us go to Exhibit 
DD(27) at page 47, four, seven.  Forty-seven.  Do you see that? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It appears to be a budget report prepared by 
10 
QS Consult Africa, do you see that? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that an entity known to you? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And can you help us with what this document is? 
MR MYENI:   It says it is the budget report. 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is this a document you had seen previously? 
MR MYENI:   It is possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But then let us just clarify, your relationship with 
20 
QS Consult Africa, did you have any relationship with them?   
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, they were not brought into the project at 
your behest?  
MR MYENI:   No. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 56 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you may have seen this budget report 
before, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us go to the next one at page 50, five zero.  
What is that document? 
MR MYENI:   It says The Professional Services Contract.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is this a document you have seen before?   
MR MYENI:   It is possible, I do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you recall having provided it to V and A  
Consulting? 
10 
MR MYENI:   Us providing it to them? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR MYENI:   No, we would not have provided them because we are not 
the employer, so I do not think so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And then if we go to page 148 there 
is a further report.  This is still in Exhibit DD(27).  What is that 
document? 
MR MYENI:   It says Scope of Work for Project Works. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is Project Works an entity known to you? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No.  So, did you procure Project Works to 
prepare this report? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is it a report you had seen prior to today? 
MR MYENI:   It is possible. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 57 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But again, your evidence is you did not get 
Project Works involved on this project, correct?   
MR MYENI:   Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you did not submit this report then to 
V and A as evidence of the work that you had done on the project, 
correct? 
MR MYENI:   Sorry please repeat that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You did not provide this report to V and A as 
evidence of the work that you had done on the project? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No.  And as evidence of work that you had 
arranged to have done on the project? 
MR MYENI:   Arranged? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am drawing a distinction between Premier itself 
doing the work and you organising for Project Works to do the work.  Did 
you organise for Project Works to do this scope of works? 
MR MYENI:   No, I do not think so.  I do not think so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well until this point you have been very clear 
that the previous reports you were not responsible for procuring.  Is the 
situation different in relation to Project Works? 
20 
MR MYENI:   So, what I am clear about is in relation to Premier 
Attraction, but any other work that would have been outsourced I am not 
clear about that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But Premier Attraction did not outsource that 
work, is that correct? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 58 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   Which work? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The work of Project Works that we see in this 
report. 
MR MYENI:   No, I do not, that is why I am saying I do not think so.  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You do not think so? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Your evidence is not right.  Let us go to the next 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Miss Hofmeyr wanted to establish whether you 
are as categorical in regard to this work, this report as you have been 
10 
with regard to the others.  I notice that you say you do not think you did, 
is that because you are not sure or are you quite clear that you did not 
provide such work? 
MR MYENI:   Yes - yes Sir, so I do not know what this report is for.  I do 
not know what the work that was done here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR MYENI:   So, I, when she listed sewer, direct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were clear about that. 
MR MYENI:   Yes, so I do not know what Project Works did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, yes okay. 
20 
MR MYENI:   So, I cannot say for sure whether we would have or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fair enough.   
MR MYENI:   Sometimes you ...[intervenes].  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well, does it not follow though if you do not know 
what Project Works did, that you then did not provide this as evidence of 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 59 of 156 
 
the work that you arranged be done on the project by Project Works. 
MR MYENI:   Please repeat that Ma’am? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies.  I am just trying to get a sense as the 
Chair is following up on, precisely what you are certain about and what 
you are not certain about, okay?  I understand you to be certain that 
Sewer Works, Premier Attraction was not responsible for getting 
contractors to do that work, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then we looked at the budget that was 
prepared by QS Consulting and again you were quite clear in your 
10 
evidence.  Premier Attraction did not engage QS Consult Africa to do that 
work, correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  You must give the answer, so the 
record reflects it. 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now we move to another set of the documents 
that V and A says you provided to them as evidence of all the many 
contractors, Premier was engaging to do work on the project, right?  You 
have already given evidence that that account by V and A is false, is that 
20 
correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes.  It is – it is false. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right.  So now let us go to this one which is the 
Project Works report.  What is your evidence in relation to the Project 
Works report?  Did Premier sub-contract to projects works, to prepare this 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 60 of 156 
 
report? 
MR MYENI:   No, I do not think we would have sub-contracted to projects 
works, because the entity is not coming to me.  So, I do not think so.  I 
could say it is highly unlikely let me put it that way but it does not mean 
that I would not have handed the document over to V and A from the 
client. That is two different things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   They are indeed.  So, I understand your 
evidence to be it might have been that you handed over these 
documents? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But is it your evidence in doing so it was not 
because you had sub-contracted Project Works to do this work for the 
project.  Is that correct Mr Myeni? 
MR MYENI:   Yes- yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you that does clarify matters.  Let us go to 
the next report it is at page [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am sorry.  So if you did hand over this document 
to V and A is the position that you would have done so simply because 
you would have been asked by the developer to hand it over? 
MR MYENI:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not because your Close Corporation was involved 
in giving Project Works any work to do? 
MR MYENI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and let us go to the next report that is 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 61 of 156 
 
on page 153 of DD(27).  What is this document? 
MR MYENI:   It says Water and Sewer Infrastructure, it is a scoping 
report. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who prepared it? 
MR MYENI:   Safargo Capital Investments. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that entity know to you? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you bring them into the project to do this 
work? 
MR MYENI:   Bring them into the project to do the work?  No.  I do not.  
10 
No, this they would have been brought in by Optics because this a 
separate, as I said we were not involved in sewer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
MR MYENI:   So, it would have been an Optics. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then let us deal with the last one which 
relates to electricity.  You will find that at page 199.  What is that 
document?  Apologies Mr Myeni. 
MR MYENI:   Okay.  Yes- yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Page 199.  Can you assist us with what 
document that is? 
20 
MR MYENI:   Scope of Services, okay.  It is a bulk electricity.  Something 
about bulk electricity.  It is not quite clear. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who has on the face of this document 
[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well It appears to be a letter from a Mr Robert 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 62 of 156 
 
Zietzman addressed to Octics (Pty) Limited, and the subject matter is 
Proposed Scope Of Our Services For Township Developments Projects, is 
that right? 
MR MYENI:   Yes- yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you know Mr Zietzman? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you know the entity Geo-Power? 
MR MYENI:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And again, was Geo Power a company that 
10 
Premier was responsible for bringing into the Housing Development 
Project? 
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have you seen this document before? 
MR MYENI:   I cannot recall now, it is possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And again I take it you will give the same answer 
it may have been that you have provided this document to V and A, is that 
correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you would be doing so on behalf of Octics, is 
20 
that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes, it is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and then can I just clarify, so we are 
on the same page about your previous testimony.  Your evidence was 
there was no agreement directly between Premier and Octics is that 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 63 of 156 
 
correct? 
MR MYENI:   No, I said there was no agreement between Premier and 
Octics relating to us being or managing the development or being the lead 
whatever it would have been but I am not saying there is no agreement 
between Premier and Octics because I said the Directors and 
shareholders are known to be and who have engaged in many or tried to 
do many business opportunities together, so there could very well be an 
agreement somewhere floating around but in relation to this project no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, in regard to this project there was no agreement 
between the two? 
10 
MR MYENI:   Between us and Octics as the lead [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As the lead to this project 
MR MYENI:   Yes, with being the lead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or would there have been any other any agreement 
between you and them in regard to any role at all in the project 
MR MYENI:   It is possible Chair, but I cannot recall and[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot recall, okay. 
MR MYENI:   I do not think there would have been a need.  There would 
not have been a need [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MYENI:   Because our roles and services were specifically coming 
V and A Consulting, so I do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Were 
you 
ever 
appointed 
as 
Octics 
Representative? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 64 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to be clear you were contracted by 
V and A? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay, I would like to take you to the version that 
V and A has provided to the Commission.  For that you need to go to, in 
the same bundle to DD(27) and it commences at page 8.   
MR MYENI:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 8? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Eight of Exhibit DD(27) Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair just to give the background to this 
document.  There was a summons issued to V and A in relation, seeking 
documents related to this payment and the response that you see at 
page 8 is the response from V and A ‘s attorneys.  Pursuant to receiving 
the response the Commission was in contact with V and A’s attorneys and 
requested that the facts set out in this letter be deposed to in an affidavit 
by Mr Narsai and we requested that that be provided by at the latest 
20 
Friday of last week.  We received communication on Friday to indicate 
that that would not be possible as Mr Narsai was travelling and on 
business and the undertaking has been that he will provide it, I think it 
was by the latest Thursday this week.  So that is where we are.  That is 
why I am not referring Mr Myeni to an affidavit. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 65 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But we are in the process of securing one that 
will attest to the facts set out in this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now Mr Myeni what happened in response to the 
summons is that this letter was furnished with V and A’s account of the 
way in which this payment came about, and then all of those documents 
that I have taken you to are what V and A provided to the Commission, as 
evidence of the reports.  It says it received from Femier. 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   As the basis for the payment made to Premier.  
Okay, so I would like to take you to what V and A says about its 
understanding of this arrangement and you will find that over the page at 
page 9.  So, at page 9 what is recorded here, and I am going to read it 
into the record and then I am going to ask for your comment at various 
points.  What is stated at the top of paginated page 9 is: 
“In order to give context to the above-mentioned documents we 
are instructed to advised the following: 
a) V and A consulting was approached by Premier Attraction 
1016 (Pty) Limited”  
20 
I think that is an error because you are not (Pty0 Limited are you? 
MR MYENI:   CC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You are a CC.  During the early course – during 
the course of early 2015 wherein it advised and then there is a series of 
things that V and A says Premier said to it.  The first is that Premier was 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 66 of 156 
 
the project, was the Development manager and representative of Octics 
Holdings in respect of a privately owned project described as Mzinoni 
Extension eleven Bethal Mpumalanga, do you see that? 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now your previous evidence as I have it 
Mr Myeni is that you were neither the Development Manager nor the 
representative of Octics, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, this statement is false in those two respects, 
is that correct? 
10 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   V and A goes on and says, 
“That it understood from Premier that in it’s a forced 
mentioned capacity, Premier had already attended to 
the initial phases of the project including the 
establishment of the township.  The work that had 
been done and disbursements incurred was two 
million Rand.”   
That I take it from your previous testimony is also false, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:   Yes, well and the reports shows there is no Premier 
20 
Attraction report prior. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then they go on and 
V and A records that “Premier indicated to it that the 
project had reached a stage where it required 
V and A to take over the management of the project 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 67 of 156 
 
and to provide professional services including that of 
architecture, quantity surveying, engineering and 
project management.”  
Is that also false?  
MR MYENI:   Ja, I mean, it does not even make sense.  If we had the 
project and we had already done all these reports, why would we hand it 
over to somebody else?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, your answer is it is false? 
MR MYENI:   Yes.  False.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And at four on that page,  
10 
“(iv).  That the client Octics was prepared to appoint 
V and A consulting to provide the aforementioned 
services.” 
hose ones we have just referred to with Premier continuing to act as the 
client’s representative.  Is that also false? 
MR MYENI:   Which part? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well, you tell me any part of it that is false.   
MR MYENI:   Well, Octics clearly was prepared to appoint V and A 
because they did and to provide the services above which, without seeing 
the Scope of Service, I assume that is what it included, but as Premier we 
20 
never acted as the representative.  [Intervenes] 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The client’s representative.    
MR MYENI:   Of the client.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And.  And.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 68 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At last.  [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  And you did not tell V and A that Octics 
wanted you to continue to act as their representative? 
MR MYENI:   I definitely did not tell them that.  Maybe the owner of Oct, I 
mean, V and A assumed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MYENI:   As I am sure we can assume if I am getting documents and 
passing them, you might think I am a representative, but, no, that was 
never the case.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay.  I would then like to leave this page.  We 
10 
will return to it in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sure.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Because amongst the documents that V and A 
provided to the Commission is an agreement that was concluded between 
itself and Octics, and I would like to take us there if we may.  You will 
find it in the same Exhibit DD(27) and you will find it at page 213.   
MR MYENI:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Feel free to page through the agreement if it will 
assist in refreshing your memory.  My question is whether you have seen 
this agreement before? 
20 
MR MYENI:   It is possible, but I do not think so because there would 
have been no need for me to.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to page through a little bit and see if 
anything reminds you or not, or you are quite clear?  
MR MYENI:   I am quite clear, Chair I do not. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 69 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR MYENI:   I do not think I would have had any part in this agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   See, this is the agreement that V and A provides 
to the Commission as evidence of the basis for its two million Rand 
payment to Premier.  Okay?  The first thing that is noteworthy about the 
agreement at page 213, but before I get there could you just tell us who 
the parties are to this agreement on the face of it Mr Myeni? 
MR MYENI:   Okay.  The parties.  Client, Octics Holdings Consultant, 
V and A Consulting.   
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what services was V and A Consulting going 
to provide in accordance with this agreement? 
MR MYENI:   Professional services.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then there is a, a sort of summary in 
brackets there.  Can you help us decipher that?   
MR MYENI:   It is not quite clear.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So, what seems to be written is PM, Architect, QS and 
then C#Eng? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Civil Engineering? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think so.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then S/Eng, may be Sewer Engineering.  
E/Eng, Electrical Engineering, M/Eng, Mechanical Engineering, W/Eng, 
may be Waste Engineering.  Chair, we are speculating.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 70 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I understand from Mr Myeni, you do not have 
knowledge of this agreement? 
MR MYENI:   No, I do not.  I do not.  I do not I do not.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Tell.  Could you just assist us with what is 
recorded on the front page as the agreement date? 
MR MYENI:   24/07/2015.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That was after V and A had paid you the two 
million, was it not?  
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Does that strike you as odd?   
MR MYENI:   No.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No?  Why would it not be odd that the agreement 
in terms of which V and A was appointed to this project only occurred 
after it had made payment to you? 
MR MYENI:   I cannot answer for V and A and Octics so I do not know.  
Maybe this was a second agreement that they had signed.  Who knows?  I 
do not know.  So, we cannot rely on it being the only one.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I think Miss Hofmeyr expected you to say you 
find it odd that they come up with an agreement that was signed after you 
20 
had been paid because you would have expected, and I think 
Miss Hofmeyr canvassed  that with you earlier on that their agreement, 
V and A’s agreement on your version with the developer would have 
preceded your being brought in.  So, if now they come up with an 
agreement that happened after the payment, one would have expected 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 71 of 156 
 
your answer to be, “yes, I find this odd.” But you said no, you do not find 
it odd.  [Intervenes] 
MR MYENI:   Well, Chair if you, follow the logic as per the documents that 
are here, yes, I find it odd. But I do not find it odd because of my 
understanding of the project. [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, is it a question of your answer is yes and no?  
MR MYENI:   My answer is yes. [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the face of it, it is odd. 
MR MYENI:   Yes, it is not odd.  At the face of it, it is odd, but my 
understanding of the project and where the project came from with the 
10 
little limited information that I have, for instance, my understanding is 
that Octics actually had a different consulting company prior to V and A 
even coming in.  A lot of reports as you can see, they are 2014 et cetera.  
So, a lot of work would have been done prior so to rely on an agreement 
started the 24th, this agreement could have been making amendments to 
the original agreement.  I do not know, but what I do know is that as of 
2014 there was already work being done here, so I would have assumed 
that there would have been an agreement, whether written or verbal, but 
at the very least there would have been a Scope of Services and 
everybody would know exactly what they would make out of it.  So, I do 
20 
not want to rely on a document that I do not have context, I cannot say. 
[Intervenes] 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Except that V and A puts this up as the 
agreement that brought it into the project.   
MR MYENI:   That is what they are saying.  They also say I was a lead. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 72 of 156 
 
[Intervenes] 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And 
a 
representative 
and 
you 
were 
not.  
[intervenes].  
MR MYENI:   But they cannot.  But they cannot provide an agreement to 
that.  So at least if they were providing agreements, I would say fine, 
they are correct.  But I am actually, was even saying to you that some of 
these reports that you have mentioned, I was quite clear.  I was not 
involved.  So, you know.  People can, people will say what they have to 
say.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure I understand why you say you do not find 
10 
it odd.  I would understand, I understand when you say you find it odd 
that they put up an agreement that they say brought them into the project.  
That agreement having been signed after payment had been made to you.  
When you find that odd, I understand.  I do not understand why you do 
not find it odd because you say you find it both odd and not odd.   
MR MYENI:   So, all I am saying, Chair is that this may not be the only 
agreement that was signed.  Unfortunately, I just do not have the records 
so in that sense, because, yes, it is odd that I would be paid prior to an 
agreement being signed, but I am saying that never happened.  That is 
not how I conduct myself so  [Intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but if this is, if they are correct  [Intervenes] 
MR MYENI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That this is the agreement that brought them into the 
project [Intervenes] 
MR MYENI:   And then it will be odd.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 73 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it would be odd. 
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MYENI:   It would be very odd.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Your evidence a moment ago was you do not 
receive payments prior to agreements being in place.  You do not conduct 
your business that way.  Is that correct?  
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, where was the agreement?  [Intervenes] 
MR MYENI:   Sorry, I do not.  Sorry you said I do not receive payments 
10 
prior to? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The agreements being in place. 
MR MYENI:   No.  I never said, “agreements being in place.”  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies.  What was your evidence?  
MR MYENI:   But there had to be a reason for a payment, so I do not just 
receive payment for no reason.  So, the reason could have been, for 
instance, we have a verbal agreement and an arrangement, we have a 
scope of service that is sent to us which is not necessarily an agreement.  
We execute then we get paid.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that the basis for your receiving the two 
20 
million Rand payment from V and A?   
MR MYENI:   What do you mean? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The evidence you have just given.  A verbal 
agreement in terms of which you got a Scope of Services at some point.  
You delivered work on it and you got paid two million Rand by V and A.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 74 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   So, I am not saying it is a verbal agreement because I 
cannot recall, but I am saying there would have been an agreement of 
sorts whether verbal or written.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So, it could… [Intervenes] 
MR MYENI:   Number two, there would have been a Scope of Services, 
and there would have been an agreement prior of the amount of money 
that will be paid for those works.  So, you know, at that point then we 
would have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Okay, let us unpack that a little bit.  I understood 
your previous evidence to be there was no written agreement between 
10 
yourselves and V and A? 
MR MYENI:   I said I cannot recall whether there is a written agreement 
or not.  It is possible that it could have been, or it could not have been.  
Possible that it was verbal, possible that it was written.  I cannot say for 
sure right now.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But there is a legally binding agreement in terms 
of which you were to be paid two million Rand for the work that you did on 
design for the structures.  Is that correct, Mr Myeni?   
MR MYENI:   Yes.  Legally binding.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, exactly, you might not know about legally binding, 
20 
but as far as you are concerned there was an agreement.  
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why you did the work.   
MR MYENI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not do the work if there was no agreement.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 75 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What you do not know is whether it was written. 
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Or it was verbal.   
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And as far as you are concerned, you did the work.  
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And you got paid.   
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and to go back to the scope of the work, I do not 
10 
think you can be in doubt that there was scope of work for you because 
what would you be doing. 
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not know where your limits are.   
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you.  So, you are able to say there would have 
been an agreement on the scope of work.  
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   There would have been an agreement on the payment. 
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The amount.   
MR MYENI:   Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are saying that by the time you got paid you 
would have done the work and you would have finished the work.  Am I 
right?   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 76 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you have no records of any of that, correct?  
MR MYENI:    Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you think Octics might have records? 
MR MYENI:   I am hoping someone does so that they can sort of clarify 
this, but I do not know.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, that would be helpful.  Let us go to 
page 216.  We are still in the agreement there.   
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would like to look at that page at Clause 1.1.4.  
Could you read into the record what is defined there, please?   
MR MYENI:    
“Client’s 
representative 
means 
a representative 
designated by the client and so named in the 
schedule to act with complete authority on his behalf 
and who shall be available at all reasonable times.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I would then like to go to the 
schedule that is referred to there and let us see who is indicated as the 
client representative in this agreement.  You will find that at page 227.   
20 
MR MYENI:   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Who is indicated at the top of the page as the 
client representative under this agreement?   
MR MYENI:   It says,  
“Name: Premier Attraction.”   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 77 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But you deny that you were the representative 
under this agreement, correct? 
MR MYENI:  Maybe there was an error ma’am because the address is 
not our address.  That can be verified at CIPC it has never been.  The 
number- cell phone number, it is not my number, it has never been.  
The email moeketsimokotong@yahoo.co.uk that is obviously not me.  
So, I do not know who would have done this and put this together but 
we cannot just rely on Premier Attraction when everything else is not 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: So, in other words you are saying that you know- you 
10 
can see that on this page your close corporation is recorded as having 
been the client’s representative.  But you are saying that that was not 
done with your permission or consent. 
MR MYENI:  No Chair, I am saying I am not sure what happened.  So 
Premier Attraction was a shelf company just maybe to give you 
background as well.  So, the reason why mine is 1016 is because there 
is a Premier Attraction 123- all the way, right.  So, this just says 
Premier Attraction, it does not say 1016 which you have to be specific 
to be talking about my entity, number one.  Number two, I am then 
saying the address, the email, the cell phone number, all of that 
20 
information 
has never 
been 
my 
information 
or 
my company’s 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  So, we might be confusing Premier Attraction with Premier 
Attraction 1016.  That can be verified with CIPC, there are many of 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 78 of 156 
 
them.  So, without the 1016 I think it becomes difficult to attribute it to 
my company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, is this a fabricated page of the agreement, 
do you think? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say whether it is fabricated ma’am.  I have never- 
I do not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you played no role as the client 
representative 
under 
the 
agreement 
between 
Octics 
and 
VNA 
Consulting.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think the answer is yes if you agree with me. 
MR MYENI:  Sorry if? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you agree with me your answer have to be 
yes for the record ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you agree with her. 
MR MYENI:  Yes, I agree with you yes.  I agree with you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Let us go over to where else you are 
referred to in this agreement.  You will find that at page 229. 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At page 229 there is a clause there A5 about a 
20 
third of the way down headed documents.  Do you see that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it lists the documents that comprise the 
agreement.  It is the Agreement, there is Annexure A The schedule, 
there is Annexure B Scope of Services and then there is Annexure C 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 79 of 156 
 
and what has been written there in hand is as per the brief and 
document submitted by Thalente Myeni.  Do you see that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then under that it says; signed original 
documents held by and then what has been written in there VNA 
Consulting - as handed over by T Myeni. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you have any involvement in these 
recordals in this agreement? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I have your previous evidence to be, it is 
false that you handed over these documents to VNA Consulting in so 
far as that was the basis for the payment you received from VNA.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  So, are you suggesting ... (intervenes)? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do I have to unpack it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let me clarify that. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what she said Ms Hofmeyr is he may have 
handed over to VNA various documents. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On behalf of the developer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Octics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 80 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But not- sorry it was a composite question so I 
do apologise.  I understand your evidence Mr Myeni and you must 
correct me if I am wrong, to be at some point you may have handed 
over documents to VNA. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But not as the basis upon which you were to be 
paid the 2 million rand. 
MR MYENI:  No. 
MR MYENI:  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, who would have been putting these 
recordals into this agreement without your knowledge and based on 
false facts? 
MR MYENI:  I am not sure whether when you say false facts but I am 
not sure we would have also done the agreement.  I would assume that 
the parties listed would have done the agreement.  But I do not see 
false facts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well we have already established one which is 
that you were not the client’s representative and that is ... (intervenes) 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Reflected at page 227, correct? 
MR MYENI:  As I have pointed out that is Premier Attraction, it does not 
refer to 1016 so legally in fact that does not even talk to my entity.  It 
was a different entity all together if it just says Premier Attraction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would you agree that if you have a close 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 81 of 156 
 
corporation whose name includes Premier Attraction. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if that is not officially the complete name. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are the sole member of that close 
corporation. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that reference to Premier Attraction and the 
document says the client’s representative is Premier Attraction and 
later in the same document there is a reference- let me try- there is a 
10 
reference- what does it say here?  There is a reference to Thalente 
Myeni. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One may be forgiven to think that the Premier 
Attraction they are talking about is your one. 
MR MYENI:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree?  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And sorry, you paused on my description of 
some of the facts recorded in this agreement as being false.  I would 
like to draw your attention at 229 to the recordal against Annexure C 
20 
just before the middle of the page.  It says there; As per brief and 
documents submitted by Thalente Myeni.  Right. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am interested in there is “brief” because 
the reference to brief ties in with the VNA account of how it came into 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 82 of 156 
 
this arrangement, the account that you say is false.  And let me explain 
why that is. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  VNAs version before the Commission is that 
you, Premier Attraction were originally playing the development 
manager role.  You wanted out but by that stage you had incurred 
certain expenses.  You had contracted a certain sub-contractor and so 
you needed to be paid out effectively by VNA when they came into you 
position.  So, it is in that context that the brief is the briefing from you, 
previous project manager to VNA new project manager.  But I 
10 
understand your evidence to be that that did not take place.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MYENI:  Ja I think maybe you are referring to brief maybe in the 
legal sense of when you client briefs but this maybe could have just 
been a document to say ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but it says; and documents.  So, it is 
something other than the documents. 
MR MYENI:  Yes, so I am saying it could have- so the documents you 
refer to was a sewer report etcetera, etcetera.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your understanding of brief in this context? 
20 
MR MYENI:  Ja that is what I am trying to explain Chair.  I am saying a 
brief could have just been a two-pager from the developer to say; this 
is what we want to be done etcetera, etcetera.  Now me passing that 
document on does not mean I authored that document.  So I ... 
(intervenes) 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 83 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but is it correct that your understanding of brief 
in this context ... (intervenes)   
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that it refers to the mandate being given by the 
client for the work to be done by VNA. 
MR MYENI:  I do not understand that Chair.  Mandate ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not understand it that way? 
MR MYENI:  Can you please repeat it please Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MYENI:  I do not think I ... (intervenes) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What- remember I asked you what your 
understanding of the meaning of brief in this context. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now my understanding of it and I want to check with 
you if you have the same understanding. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that it refers to the mandate that VNA was being 
given by the client that this brief came via you that VNA got the brief or 
the document or that contained the mandate or they were told- maybe it 
was verbal the brief ... (intervenes) 
20 
MR MYENI:  Ja so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By you what they were required to do. 
MR MYENI:  Ja so Chair I do not have an understanding because I do 
not have context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, you do not ... (intervenes) 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 84 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  I do not know this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  It is difficult to say what he was referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  And you will see the other 
place where there is a reference made to Premier Attraction is at the 
bottom of that page 229 where the professional fees that are being 
agreed between VNA and Octics are set out.  You will see there, 
10 
professional fees for this project shall be 20.31% inclusive of 25% 
discount on tariff and the amount of 2 million paid to Premier Attraction.  
Do you see that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you have any knowledge prior to today that 
this is how the payment of your 2 million rand was recorded between 
Octics and VNA? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you read this in the same way as I do which 
is to suggest that VNA is going to have a claim against Octics for the 2 
20 
million rand that it paid to you? 
MR MYENI:  A claim? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm. 
MR MYENI:  I would assume so yes because we were all providing 
services to Octics so Octics would have had to pay everybody involved. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 85 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm. 
MR MYENI:  Including Premier Attraction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well it did not pay Premier Attraction.  The 
arrangement was VNA would pay it and then VNA would be reimbursed 
by Octics.  Is that as you understand this recordal? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just tell me ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Looking at the reference to Premier 
Attraction at the bottom of that page namely 229, the one we were 
looking at just now.  Looking at the fact that there is reference to 
10 
Premier Attraction on that page same reference namely Premier 
Attraction on page 227.  It seems to me that one can now accept that 
when whoever wrote Premier Attraction and I think the handwriting is 
the same at page 227 as client’s representative, must have been 
meaning your Premier Attraction. 
MR MYENI:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would accept that? 
MR MYENI:  Agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Myeni, I would like to go back to page 9 of 
20 
Exhibit DD27 because I said I would return there.  That is where VNA 
sets out its account of these facts for the Commission.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I pick it up there Mr Myeni at paragraph 2 
B because it is here that VNA after setting out the background explains 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 86 of 156 
 
... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.  Did you deliberately leave 
our V? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did- well you did ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For my purposes ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not refer to it ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did not refer to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to know that it is not oversight. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was not oversight. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was not pertinent at the time but I am happy 
to include it for completeness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe we should just read it into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe to completeness ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because se got to IV Mr Myeni before we 
moved to the agreement. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But what VNA also records at V on page 9 of 
20 
Exhibit DD27 is amongst the things that it alleges Premier told it is 
that;  
It was expected of VNA to provide the aforesaid services and that VNA 
would start receiving payment for the said services once funding for the 
development had been secured as is the norm in projects of this nature.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 87 of 156 
 
And then at B is where VNA records ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe for the sake of completeness again.  I take it 
you deny that you told VNA what is reflected in V?  There they say you 
... (intervenes) 
MR MYENI:  Oh yes, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you deny that ja. 
MR MYENI:  I would not have ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If we go to 2 B, that is were 
VNA explains the basis for it paying Premier 2 million rand.  It says; 
10 
VNA accepted the aforementioned appointment on an understanding 
that it VNA would pay Premier the aforementioned 2 million rand for all 
the reports, documentation and work completed that hat been furnished 
to Premier by the various consultants that it had appointed. 
Do you see that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your evidence before this Commission is that 
you did not appoint those consultants, correct? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you did not procure the rendering of those 
20 
reports, correct? 
MR MYENI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So VNA paid you 2 million rand for work on 
your version that you did not do, correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us put it this way.  To the extend that VNA says it 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 88 of 156 
 
paid you the 2 million rand because you had provided certain reports 
and documentation, that is not true as far as you are concerned? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair, but for work completed yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For work completed, that you say that was true. 
MR MYENI:  And also Chair if I may just point out I think something that 
... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  Is quite obvious.  It says that VNA Consulting then 
10 
commenced work on the project during or about March 2015.  So ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  But they have given us a contract for July of that year.  
They are saying they started the work and that is why I was saying it 
was not odd that an agreement could be showing another date whereas 
our payment- because we did start work prior to us getting paid and I 
think that line there just confirmed what I was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying that elsewhere on this document ... 
(intervenes) 
20 
MR MYENI:  Just on C Chair, just below where you are reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  Same page but C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 89 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MYENI:  So, we commenced work on March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, the point you are making is that on their version it 
appears that they say they started the work in March 2015. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we do know that if the agreement that they have 
put up as the agreement between themselves and the developer, that 
agreement was not concluded in ... (intervenes) 
MR MYENI:  July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  July 2015. 
10 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MYENI:  So, they can come explain that why that is the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, I just want to be clear about this.  VNA as 
recorded in 2 B on page 9 of Exhibit 27 paid Premier Attraction 2 
million rand for work that it believed Premier had done but Premier had 
not done.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
MR MYENI:  Or Maybe he was mistaken.  Maybe his memory also ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure if you in turn saying what you have 
just said because you qualified your answer earlier on in relation to 2 B 
by saying that it is not true that they paid- they made that payment for 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 90 of 156 
 
reports that you had prepared.  But what you did say is that they paid 
you for work that you had completed. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair, I think you said the same thing.  You said report 
that were prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  So yes, so the work that we would have prepared yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  But the reports here- are actually indicate who prepared 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MYENI:  So those ones, we would not be paid for work that we 
would not have done.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  We would have been paid for work that we would have 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  But I was saying that I may have passed the documents on 
to them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the challenge Mr Myeni with that is, is that 
those are not the reports that VNA said it was paying 2 million for.  
20 
These reports that you have no records of that you say dealt with the 
structural design of the houses. 
MR MYENI:  Ja, I cannot answer for VNA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  VNAs version is they paid 2 million because 
they received a whole lot of reports that you provided to them from sub-
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 91 of 156 
 
contractors who were owed monies because of the works that they have 
been doing for you as project developer.  And your evidence is that that 
is false. 
MR MYENI:  I am sure if you asked those companies, they do not even 
know me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have asked the companies and they do not 
know you.  You are absolutely correct about that. 
MR MYENI:  So? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But what I am interested in is that VNA says it 
paid you 2 million rand for a series of reports that it believed you had 
10 
procured and were owed for.  And your evidence says that is false, 
correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they also did not pay you for the reports 
that you have no records of that your evidence today indicates dealt 
with design of the structures of the houses.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  So, without the selling reports so for instance we 
would meet at their offices and we would work on those designs.  So, it 
is not necessarily that you are going to find an actual report but you 
might find drawings ... (intervenes) 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How many times ... (intervenes) 
MR MYENI:  You might find all types of things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How many times did you meet? 
MR MYENI:  I do not know, many times.  I cannot recall how many 
times. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 92 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Five or ten? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot recall, many times.  I cannot recall how many 
times. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  More than ten? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot recall ma’am.  Many times, though. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well I just need some indication of what many 
times is because you were paid 2 million rand for this work Mr Myeni.  
And I would like to understand what went into the work that produced 
the payment of 2 million rand.  So, can you give me an order of 
magnitude? 
10 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say how many times we met. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So, did you provide VNA with any report that related 
to work that your Premier Attraction had done in regards to this 
project? 
MR MYENI:  Okay so not the report maybe in the sense that you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A written report. 
MR MYENI:  Not a report in this sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  But we would have provided them work that we have done 
20 
which required us to meet or not to meet, it did not really matter.  We 
would have provided that to them and I indicated earlier that they would 
then compile all that information, put it together and finally submit to 
the client.  So, there may be not be a specific report saying this has 
been compiled etcetera but we would have done our services and 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 93 of 156 
 
handed over whatever it is that would have needed to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that answer mean one, Premier Attraction did 
not provide VNA with any report of the work that- any written report of 
the work that they had done.  Or does it mean that you are not sure 
whether somewhere there may be a report lying that relays to work that 
you did and a report that you may have provided to VNA.  You just do 
not know, you cannot remember. 
MR MYENI:  Yes, Chair so somewhere there could be a report lying but 
you know our services were support services to VNA and what they had 
to do.  So, we would not have compiled an actual report per se.  But we 
10 
would have done work and handed it over to them for them to then 
combine with whatever other aspects and then they would send that 
information to the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be something in writing whether you call it 
a report or an email or a letter that would have come from Premier 
Attraction to VNA that says; this is how far we are now with the work 
the we are supposed to do.  And maybe once you had completed the 
work maybe an email or a letter that you would have sent to them to 
say; we have now completed the work. 
MR MYENI:  It is possible Chair but also as I said we used to meet so 
20 
those were the status updates to meet ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  And to say this is where we are.  This is what we have 
done etcetera.  Although I cannot really recall exactly but that is what 
would happen and ... (intervenes) 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 94 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myeni, do you have a clear recollection that some 
of your progress reports would have been verbal others in writing by 
way of an email or letter or are you not sure? 
MR MYENI:  Oh yes, they would have been verbal because Mr Narsai 
was based in Durban so he would only come up for the bigger 
meetings.  There would have been maybe phone calls to his team that 
was based in Johannesburg and there may have been emails as well, I 
cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it there would have been invoices that 
Premier Attraction sent to VNA? 
10 
MR MYENI:  Yes, I would definitely have invoice for the 2 million rand, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you invoice along the way as you were 
doing this work and having the meetings? 
MR MYENI:  No, we would have invoiced probably at the end.  When it 
was time for us to be paid.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How did you know when it was time for you to 
be paid? 
MR MYENI:  When the work would have been completed. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you made a point earlier in your testimony 
in response to the Chair’s question that what you were paid for were 
the support services that you provided to VNA.  Did I have that correct? 
MR MYENI:  What I was saying is our services were supporting what 
VNA was doing. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 95 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  So not providing support services per se. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The challenge I have with that Mr Myeni is VNA 
does not believe it was paying you for that reason, correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm, it believed it was paying you for work you 
did not do, correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The work that you say VNA asked you to do, would it 
have been work that they did not have capacity to do?  In other words, 
why did they bring you in? 
MR MYENI:  Yes.  So yes, capacity broadly Chair could have been at 
the time skill, expertise, it could have been time, not enough 
consultants.  It could have been a range of things depending on what 
they needed to deliver at that time so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would have been capacity or skills or expertise 
that Premier Attraction had? 
20 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair, had or could source yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the last part. 
MR MYENI:  Had or could source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 96 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I do have a follow up 
question on that.  I understood you previously to say your testimony- in 
your testimony that the scope of services that Premier was required to 
fulfil related to design work for structures.  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Ja so what I was explaining is that it would not have 
related to the work that you have spoke about sewer for instance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  Because that is below the ground. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
MR MYENI:  So, I was talking about that he would have spoken directly 
to the actual structure that ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Anything else in your scope of services? 
MR MYENI:  Are you asking me? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  Oh, I cannot recall what the scope of service was that I 
mentioned but it would have been around the top structure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Myeni, I have to indicate to you that I have 
20 
a concern with a situation in which your company was paid 2 million 
rand for a scope of services that you cannot now recall what it 
included.  How did you compile your invoice for 2 million rand if you as 
you sit here today do not know what the scope of services was for that 
work? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 97 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  Ma’am we compiled our invoice after work done in 2015, it 
is five years ago.  I conduct my- I conduct a lot of businesses Chair 
and I do a lot of transactions.  I cannot recall a 2-million-rand 
transaction.  It is- I just simply cannot recall the details of what was 
happening at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, as you sit here today you have no certainty 
as to what work you did to merit the payment of 2 million rand? 
MR MYENI:  It would have been consulting work around the top 
structure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The top structure. 
10 
MR MYENI:  The housing, the actual housing design etcetera.  That is 
what it would have been around.  I cannot say for certain what it was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then I want to put it to you Mr Myeni that it is 
highly unlikely that that type of work would have been done without 
there being a single written record of the work you performed on the 
top structures.  Do you accept that? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, I accept it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we were to go back to Octics and VNA, 
we have already gone to yourself for records and no one has a single 
shred of paper referring to this work that you did. 
20 
MR MYENI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Entitling you to 2 million rand on the top 
structures.  Do you accept that that would be concerning? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, it will be concerning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mm.  I would then like to move to the second 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 98 of 156 
 
set of payments that we were going to look at today.  And that is the 
payments that Premier makes to an entity called Isibonelo. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to get us right in the chronology Mr Myeni, 
you received the 2 million rand from VNA on the 19 t h of June 2015.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And thereafter Premier made three payments to 
Isibonelo.  Do you recall the dates of those payments? 
MR MYENI:  No not- I know you send them to us but ... (intervenes) 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We did send them to you. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not think it is contentious so I will just 
refresh your memory then.  On the 24 t h of October 2015 Premier paid 1 
million ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what page are you reading? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I am reading from my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is it your notes? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it is in fact recorded.  I can give it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is recorded in the regulation 10 (6) that was 
issued to Mr Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so, both of you can follow.  You can find it 
at Exhibit DD27 at page 234. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 99 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see there Mr Myeni under paragraph 
1.1 B we start to record there the payments ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I sometimes hear like you are saying Ms Myeni. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, I do apologise.  I must be very clear that it 
is Mr Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myeni, am I hearing right?  Do you hear the same 
thing? 
MR MYENI:  I was not really listening Chair.  I am not sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do apologise Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will be very clear.  And just for the 
transcribers, today’s evidence is given by Mr Myeni so if I ever make an 
error in my pronunciation the transcript will reflect correctly.   
Right so we pick it up at paragraph 1.1B on page 234 because 
that is where we deal with the three payments made out from Premier 
to Isibonelo? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The first of those it is recorded at B occurred 
on the 24 October 2015 and that was a R1 million paid to Isibonelo.  
20 
The second payment was an amount of R1 150 000.00 and that was 
paid on the 11 December 2015 to Isibonelo.  And the third payment was 
a payment made on the 2 February 2016 and that was an amount of R1 
million to Isibonelo.  Now you responded in your affidavit answering the 
directive received that we have just looked at about these payments 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 100 of 156 
 
and I would like to take you there.  It is at page 2 of the bundle in front 
of you Exhibit DD27.  Could you please read into the record what you 
say at paragraph 8 on that page of your affidavit? 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
“In 
respect 
of 
– 
or 
in 
respect 
to 
Isibonelo 
Construction the transactions made by Premier 
Attraction 1016 were business transaction carried out 
in the normal course of Premier Attractions business 
activities. However I do not have any recollection of 
the nature of the said business transactions due to 
10 
the fact that a significant period of time has passed 
since doing business with the said company.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at paragraph 9? 
MR MYENI:   
“I do not have any form of documentation relating to 
the business transactions made with the said 
company due to the significant period of time that 
has passed.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Myeni given the significant period of time 
why can you be sure that these transactions related to the business of 
20 
Premier Attraction 1016? 
MR MYENI:  To business – to company and I was conducting it that 
way.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And… 
MR MYENI:  So I would assume that it is a business related 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 101 of 156 
 
transactions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What else can you assist us with in relation to 
the payment to Isibonelo Construction?  What could it have related to in 
the course of Premier’s business? 
MR MYENI:  Well nothing but business related transactions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understood your evidence earlier to be 
the business related to property.  I did not get many other specifics so 
what part of Premier’s business would this payment have related to? 
MR MYENI:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he said earlier that Premier Attraction does a 
10 
lot of things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  It has over the years.  Over the years Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh over the years ja. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in 2015… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2016 what part of Premier’s business would 
have associated it with Isibonelo? 
20 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say for sure because as I said we have done 
many things.  I mean an opportunity can come today in energy I will go 
for it.  So I cannot say what it was at that time.  All I know is that 
Isibonelo was construction – as construction company or is a 
construction company so I would assume it would be around that I do 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 102 of 156 
 
not know.  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does Premier Attraction – or did Premier Attraction 
over the years at some stage or another do construction as well? 
MR MYENI:  Yes we have done and attempted construction projects, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I understood your evidence earlier to be, it 
must have had to do with Premier’s business activities because Premier 
does not make payments other than payments associated with its 
business.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR MYENI:  Ja I guess. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Mr Myeni the witness who seeks to give 
evidence in camera later today will say in his evidence that there has 
never been a business relationship between Premier and Isibonelo and 
that these payments had nothing to do with any services rendered to 
Premier.  Do you have a response to that? 
MR MYENI:  I cannot comment on what the witness will be saying or 
has said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Ms Hofmeyr tells you what the witness will say 
she is giving you’re an opportunity to say what the witness will be 
20 
saying will be true or what the witness will be saying is not – will not be 
true. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it is not probable because of this and that.  He is 
giving you a chance to deal with that. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 103 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Witness’ evidence because that evidence may be 
implicating you or your close Closed Corporation in some wrong doing. 
MR MYENI:  Oh.  No it – thank you for clarifying Chair.  It is just that it 
is a bit difficult to speak the way of some of these people because I 
have a lot of respect for them but what the witness will be saying is not 
truthful.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have any evidence or documents to 
support that his version is false and yours is true? 
MR MYENI:  Which version? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The version that – your version is I paid these 
three tranches of R1 million and a bit more in relation to the business 
activities of Premier, correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He will come and say there is and has never 
been a business relationship between Isibonelo and Premier and what 
you have indicated to the Chair is you say his version is false and so 
my follow up is, do you have a single document available to you to 
support your version that these amounts were paid pursuant to the 
business activities of Premier? 
20 
MR MYENI:  No I do not have a document Chair but you know it is quite 
difficult because he is not being truthful in saying what he is saying.  
And in actual fact to prove that there was a business relationship a 
more recent transaction which I have recollection of actually was a 
development and construction project in Esikhawini and although I have 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 104 of 156 
 
not – I mean I had not thought about it so I had not been able to look 
for documents which could be there, could not be there but it went as 
far as him sending us quotations, designs and all of these things.  So it 
is untrue that we have never had a business relationship.  It is 
completely untrue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is not his evidence.  Let me be clear.  His 
evidence is at the time of these transactions there was no business 
relationship. 
MR MYENI:  Oh.  Okay that is fine.  It is untrue but that is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would Isibonelo have sent Premier Attractions some 
invoice before Premier Attraction paid these amounts to them? 
MR MYENI:  They should have, they would have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  I assume so Chair but you know unfortunately I do not 
have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Especially if it was business? 
MR MYENI:  Yes, yes.  They would have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But you say you – you cannot remember what it 
is exactly that Isibonelo would have done for Premier Attraction to be 
20 
entitled to payment of at least one the payments is about a million or 
more. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be paid such a lot of money. 
MR MYENI:  Ja Chair I – you know specifically with those payments I 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 105 of 156 
 
cannot recall.  As I said though what I can recall is that there was that 
Esikhawini project which we engaged on.  How much or how far that 
went but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that is much later, is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  It would – ja I think that would have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Much later? 
MR MYENI:  Ja because it is something that I have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can remember. 
MR MYENI:  There is a bit of a memory on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MYENI:  But ja I do not know. I do not want to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would Premier Attraction not be a relatively small 
entity so that if it paid anybody a million rand it would be something to 
remember or is it not so small? 
MR MYENI:  I am not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just think you told me that in terms of staff 
sometimes it is just you only. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometimes you and one person. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That gave me the impression it is a small entity. 
MR MYENI:  So what I was explaining. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would have thought that if a small entity pays 
anybody R1 million that would be something to remember. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 106 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What it was about? 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair.  So what I was explaining in regards to the staff 
issue.  For instance if you go to my offices now you will find people 
there.  They work.  Some people are employed by Company X, other 
through Company Y etcetera depending on what they are there to do.  
So what I was specifically talking about was not that I do not have 
employees or I have never had employees.  I was simply saying on the 
books of Premier Attraction you know I cannot recall how many there 
would have been or – but at the time there would have been just me as 
a sole member which is the case now if I am – ja if I am correct.   And 
10 
then specifically relating to the payment of R1 million we have 
submitted some bank statements that were requested on these 
transactions and the amounts do go a bit higher than the R1 million in 
the – in those statements so I would not say it was a big company Chair 
but the amounts did go a bit higher than R1 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you protest if it was described as a small 
entity? 
MR MYENI:  No it is definitely a small entity Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
MR MYENI:  Definitely a small entity. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MYENI:  Ja but –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  The amounts do go a bit higher than R1 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does – it does – it does handle larger 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 107 of 156 
 
transactions than … 
MR MYENI:  Than just R1 million ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R1 million. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni – Mr Myeni apologies it was not just 
R1 million.  It was in excess of R3 million between October of 2015 and 
February of 2016.  I just want to be clear as to your evidence today.  Is 
it that despite the fact that Premier Attraction paid R3 million over that 
period to Isibonelo as you sit here today you cannot tell us what that 
10 
work was? 
MR MYENI:  Ja I cannot say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have no records of any invoices from 
Isibonelo or any other documentary evidence of the work that you 
allege was done by Isibonelo to merit those payments. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MR MYENI:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to just ask what your rela… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just wanted to say that that comes across to 
20 
me as quite extraordinary if an entity as – a small entity I think we 
agreed we can describe it as small entity. 
MR MYENI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pays to another company over a few months R3 
million but the owner of the business cannot remember what work they 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 108 of 156 
 
– was done for them to justify paying that amount. 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to say something about that? 
MR MYENI:  Chair it was 2015 and as I have said… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  Since then we have done a lot of transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MYENI:  I cannot specifically recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe with large amounts. 
MR MYENI:  Maybe if we are talking a very big amount then I would 
10 
maybe recall but I really Chair recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Okay. 
MR MYENI:  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so would it be correct to say that you are saying 
that payment of R3 million by Premier Attraction over those months at 
the time with everything that may have happened after which might 
have involved Premier Attraction being involved in large transactions – 
larger transactions is not something that you – you can remember what 
it was about? 
MR MYENI:  Well I cannot say whether it was involved in larger 
20 
transactions or not but I am saying Chair from the information that we 
submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MYENI:  You can clearly see that there were larger amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 109 of 156 
 
MR MYENI:  That – that were moving in the account.  So – I mean – 
and it is over five, six months or so these transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MYENI:  It is not like it is a once off lump sum of R3 million.  So it 
is very difficult to track back and say what it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Myeni you have drawn attention to the state 
of the business at the time that these transactions were made from a 
sort of turnover or cash flow perspective.  That is why I began the 
questioning today to ask you for an indication of the turnover of the 
10 
business but you were not able to give me an indication of that, is that 
correct? 
MR MYENI:  Ja I cannot say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know that before the R2 million was 
paid from VNA to Premier the balance in the account was R1 449.79? 
MR MYENI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that? 
MR MYENI:  I can accept it yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And then over the period where you paid 
the R3 million the higher amount in the account was R9 744 608.00. Do 
20 
you accept that? 
MR MYENI:  Sure.  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that R3 million is quite a 
substantial proportion of that? 
MR MYENI:  Ja but you – you are looking at three bank statements that 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 110 of 156 
 
are highlighting the specific transactions over a six month period.  We 
do not know where the account was in between. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I only have these documents to go with Mr 
Myeni because you will not tell this commission what your general 
turnover is in the business.   
MR MYENI:  It is not I will not.  It is – I am saying I cannot say.  I 
cannot really recall what we were making in 2015.  I cannot say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  I will leave that question there.  I would 
then like to know what your relationship is to Ms Duduzile Myeni. 
MR MYENI:  She is my mother. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  The witness who has applied to 
give evidence in camera later will say the following about the monies 
that were received into the account, the Isibonelo account which the 
witness says had nothing to do with any business relationship at the 
time with Premier. 
MR MYENI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I am going to tell you this because I do 
need to know if you have any knowledge about these facts. 
MR MYENI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The witness will say that your mother Ms Myeni 
20 
called him after those deposits were made and instructed him what to 
do with the money.  For the first tranche there were a series of 
instructions that cash be withdrawn and made available to her and in 
relation to the second two payments that there was an instruction that 
those monies be paid less a VAT portion to the Jacob Zuma Foundation.  
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 111 of 156 
 
Do you have any knowledge of those facts? 
MR MYENI:  No I do not have any knowledge.  It does not make sense. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then one more point that will come up in 
his evidence.  The commission first communicated with your lawyers on 
the 24 January this year, it was a Friday, do you recall that at all? 
MR MYENI:  It is possible, yes.  Yes, sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And pursuant to the commission making contact 
with your lawyers and asking you questions about these transactions 
the witness will indicate that his daughter received a phone call from 
your mother Ms Myeni.  My question to you is, after you were alerted to 
10 
the commission’s questions did you relay that to your mother? 
MR MYENI:  Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Myeni. 
MR MYENI:  Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair those are our questions.  I 
see that we have a few minutes before the tea break it may be 
appropriate subject to questions you may have for Mr Myeni that we 
move 
the 
application 
now 
formally. 
 
We 
have 
received 
the 
supplementary affidavit and then arrangements can be made over lunch 
depending on your ruling? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise you are done with Mr Myeni? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Myeni thank you very much. 
MR MYENI:  Oh thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For coming to give evidence.  You are excused. If a 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 112 of 156 
 
need arises for the commission to ask you to come back we will ask you 
to come back. 
MR MYENI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  You are – you are excused.  
Yes let us deal with the application. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I indicated this morning that 
that supplementary affidavit was being prepared by the witness.  I beg 
leave to hand that up if I may?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair before I move to the supplementary 
10 
affidavit if I may just highlight the essence of the basis upon which the 
person who I will now refer to as Mr X brings an application for his 
evidence to be given in such a way that neither his name nor his 
appearance be revealed.  Chair that is the application supported by the 
main affidavit and supplemented by the affidavit that I have just handed 
up to you.  Chair the essence of the application is as follows: 
MR MYENI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The witness indicates that he will give evidence 
that will implicate the persons to whom notice of today’s application 
has already been given.  I indicated this morning that those persons 
20 
included Mr Myeni who has just given evidence.  Ms Myeni, Mr Majola 
who will give evidence tomorrow and former President Zuma.  The 
witness explains in his application that on the afternoon of the 24 
January – this is the point I picked up with Mr Myeni at the end of his 
evidence.  The witness’s daughter received a telephone call from Ms 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 113 of 156 
 
Myeni and that occurred on the afternoon of that day and what Ms 
Myeni relayed to the witness’s daughter on that call was two questions.  
She asked why her father was telling everyone about the funds that 
were facilitated through his company.  And asked why her father was 
selling them out.  That was a few hours after the commission had first 
made contact with Mr Myeni about the matters being investigated.  
Chair this is not in the witness’s application but Mr Myeni has 
confirmed to us moments ago that he did relay to his mother Ms Myeni 
that he had been approached by the commission about these matters.  
Chair Mr X further supports his application on the basis that Ms Myeni 
10 
and Mr Majola whom he will implicate in serious wrong doing in his 
evidence are both influential members of their community.  He does 
accept that it is likely that they will know his identity when he gives this 
evidence because he quite simply cannot give the evidence but for 
making clear his relationship to various entities and his engagements 
with both Ms Myeni and Mr Majola. However he still motivates for some 
measure of his identity not to be revealed because he indicates in his 
affidavit that there are many people in the community in which he finds 
himself who are dependent on Ms Myeni and Mr Majola and have been 
assisted particularly by Ms Myeni economically over some period.  And 
20 
those people will not necessarily be able to identify him when he gives 
this evidence.  But he is concerned about acts of retaliation by those 
individuals within the community if he is identified and publicly 
associated with quote “selling out” these important and influential 
persons.  He therefore asks for a ruling that endeavours to be as 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 114 of 156 
 
faithful to the public inquiry nature of these procedures but also give 
him that measure of protection over which he has any control and that 
is to not have his name or his appearance revealed while he gives his 
evidence here today.  So Chair it is against that backdrop that the legal 
team of the commission moves the application on his behalf.  I 
explained the only reason we do that is because he is not legally 
represented.  We do however support the application and the basis 
given for it.  We have prepared the draft order Chair along the lines 
that you described this morning.  And I beg leave just to hand that up.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well his affidavit should ask for leave to be referred 
10 
to as Ms X. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It should indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is okay we – it is okay.  It is not – it is not a big 
thing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh I think – I think – it should be leave.  He 
says he requests that he is referred to in that manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He requests. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed but leave would have been 
20 
appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay I think what – what we should do is I will – 
I will deal with it when I come back – when we come back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think the order must reflect that the applicant is 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 115 of 156 
 
Mr. X. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Witness X. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the – the order must have a party.  So that is 
the – that is what should be there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will make that amendment certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the face of it the draft order appears to cover 
but I will look at it further during the lunch break. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just from a logistics point of view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The witness has requested that there be an 
interpreter for the purposes of his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Make all of those arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Over the lunch adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we can deal with the request for the 
in-camera proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 116 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then move straight into the evidence if that 
is convenient/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that – that is fine.  And arrangements must be 
made to obtain the correct certificate for the interpreter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I am encouraged by the fact that I am told 
the interpreter has previously interpreted in these proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we will make sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  All of the necessary documents are available. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think your junior has dealt with that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Reverend Stemela knows. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What format the certificate must take. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I am comfortable with. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  So I will deal with it when we 
resume. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise we adjourn for lunch and we will resume at 
two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213

MEETING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have an order with the name of the applicant? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We do indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I beg leave to hand that up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair other than the correction to accurately 
reflect that it is Mr X who brings the application the document before 
10 
you is the same as the prior draft order that we had handed up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And you have not picked up anything that is not 
covered? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We did go over the indication that you gave us 
this morning and there were one or two additions that we made just to 
draw your attention to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your paragraph 6. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The equivalent to paragraph 6 had not included 
persons necessary to assist or protect the witness when he gives the 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 118 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From the location.  We did add that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that persons in the room with him from the 
Protection Services who will just assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In orientating him with the files and that can be 
accommodated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And beyond that I do not recall there being – 
we did add the audio link, you will see at paragraph 7.  And then in 
10 
paragraph 8 we sought to capture all possible necessary amendments 
that may flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To this order irrespective of – from whom they 
come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whether it is necessary for the witness’s 
protection or indeed to ensure fairness to any implicated person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Those were the additions to what Chair you had 
20 
indicated this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  In respect of the application brought 
this morning by Mr X I grant the following order. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 119 of 156 
 
1. The Applicant’s non-compliance with a notice period provided for 
in terms of Rule 11.1 of the Rules governing proceedings of the

at any time if in his opinion that it is necessary to ensure the 
protection of the witness or any other person in connection with 
the witness’ evidence or to ensure fairness to any implicated

That is the order. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  We are now in a position 
subject to the interpreter being sworn in and subject to – I understand 
the oath needs to be administered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there was something that was missing in the 
10 
wording. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the certificate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I had been told two minutes would be enough to do 
that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that there was an issue with the printer.  
I had some message come to me of that order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we are hoping that that will be resolved 
20 
imminently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair before we return the one issue is the 
swearing of the witness.  My proposal is that takes places similarly 
before we return. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 121 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  You remember – well maybe you were not 
involved.  With regard to the other witness. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was taken care of in a certain way. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just need to recall how that was dealt with. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do need to adjourn for a few minutes to get the 
certificate sorted out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think we will adjourn and then once that has 
been taken care of then we will resume. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I think we are finally in a 
position to proceed with the evidence of Mr X. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I understand that he has been sworn in 
and the next matter for me is just to ask that his affidavit be entered 
into the record of the evidence as EXHIBIT DD31.  Chair, the file in 
front of you labelled DD31 comprises the witness’ affidavit and its 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 122 of 156 
 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr X and the annexures will be 
marked EXHIBIT DD31 and admitted into the proceedings. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there is going to be an interpreter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  For the record Ms Khumalo will be the 
interpreter.  She will interpret from isiZulu to English and from English 
to isiZulu and she has taken the required oath and she has previously 
interpreted in proceedings of this Commission.  Thank you Ms Khumalo. 
10 
INTERPRETER:  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may just begin with an audio check to 
the witness.  Can - Ms Khumalo, could you communicate with Mr X as 
to whether he can hear us at the moment? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I can hear you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Mr X, do you confirm that you have 
taken the prescribed oath? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  (Intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr X, when you met with the 
legal team and investigator of the Commission yesterday.  You said that 
it was not easy for you to give evidence today.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 123 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you please tell the Chair why it is not easy 
for you to give evidence today? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I can tell the Chairperson.  Is that 
myself and my family we are not safe.  I think my family and I we are 
not safe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you feel unsafe? 
MR X (through interpreter):  The truth that I am going to reveal today 
is not acceptable to the people who are implicated in it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why do you give the evidence today? 
MR X (through interpreter):  The manner in which I was approached 
10 
by the investigators in this matter.  There was no way I could change 
that.  Whatever was brought forward to me I could not change that 
which was brought by the investigators. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How will your evidence today affect your 
relationship with Ms Myeni, Mr X? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would say that the relationship between 
myself and her would be over, because her wish would be for me to say 
something that will favour her, but unfortunately what I have or what I 
am going to say is to the contrary of what she is expecting me to say. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, are you afraid about giving this evidence 
20 
today? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I will give the evidence, because it is 
about time I do.  Though it is not easy, but I will do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr, I forgot to raise with you the question of 
whether there is no previous witness we have referred to as Mr X.  So 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 124 of 156 
 
maybe your junior could check. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the - in the meantime we continue using Mr X. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will do that.  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just - because X is quite common. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Quite common.  When identities are not to be 
disclosed.  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We - we must make that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as soon as I have an answer if necessary 
we will change the reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr X, I would like you to please 
look in the file that is marked EXHIBIT DD31 and if you could go to 
page 1 in that file. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I have - I am on page 1. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if you can go to the last page of 
that affidavit.  You will find that at page 28.  Mr X, can you confirm that 
this is the affidavit that you deposed to yesterday? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  It is indeed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you confirm under oath today that all 
of the facts set out in this affidavit are true and correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to turn over to 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 125 of 156 
 
page 2 and I would like to begin at paragraph 6 on that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think before you do that Ms Hofmeyr.  You might 
wish to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with paragraph 5. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  I - I am indebted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he is - he is testifying in isiZulu, but his 
affidavit is in English. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then before you proceed let us make sure the 
interpreter has got the same pack … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when she interprets she might need to have 
a look at the pages. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will make that available to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, at paragraph 5 on page 2 of your affidavit 
you explain why the affidavit is in English, but your evidence in isiZulu.  
Can you please explain that to the Chair? 
MR X (through interpreter):  My explanation is Chair.  Is that I want to 
be comfortable in what I am going to say before this Commission.  So 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 126 of 156 
 
that I cannot think it twice in English, because I am not conversant in 
English. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You indicate in the affidavit that you can read 
and understand English.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms - Ms Interpreter, affidavit will be - statement is 
(isiZulu word). 
INTERPRETER:  Oh.  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In isiZulu.  Okay.  Alright.  Alright.  Let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr X, I would like to pick it 
10 
up at paragraph 6 then on page 2.  Can you please explain to the Chair 
what …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe - I am sorry.  Maybe before he - you go 
there.  Mr X, are you able to say - to confirm that although your 
affidavit is in English you understand everything that you - that is 
written in it? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  I can read and understand 
English.  The only problem is when I am supposed to speak English 
myself.  That is where the problem is, but reading and understanding 
and hearing English Chair.  I can understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr X, please can you tell us 
what Isibonelo Construction CC is? 
MR X (through interpreter):  May I clarify?  You mean what work or 
what is it that is done in that company or that CC? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 127 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR X (through interpreter):  It is a construction company that builds 
houses. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what role do you play in that company - 
that Isibonelo? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am not sure if I am right if I say I am 
the owner of the company and I further work on the site supplying skill 
- on the site. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Thank 
you 
and 
when 
was 
Isibonelo 
established? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  It was established in 1997. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your evidence has been it is involved in 
the construction industry and particularly in housing.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell us about work that Isibonelo has 
done previously for Mhlathuze Water Board? 
INTERPRETER:  Can I get …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Water Board. 
INTERPRETER:  Chair, I did not hear properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Ask him to start afresh. 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  At Mhlathuze Water Board I got the work 
to supply - I am not sure if I am correct if I call it tank - water tank … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is - it is … 
INTERPRETER:  But he referred to it as Jojo Tank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think they are referred to as Jojo Tanks, ja. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 128 of 156 
 
INTERPRETER:  Okay. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Jojo Tanks at Nkandla. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when was that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  If I am not mistaken 2007. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at paragraph 10 on page 2 of the 
affidavit you talk about a particular invoice dated 27 September 2014.  
What did that invoice relate to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In paragraph 10 of your affidavit.  Ms Interpreter you 
may well use paragraph … 
INTERPRETER:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I also do not know what the Zulu word is. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I was supplying water or Jojo Tanks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the value of that invoice - if you 
go over the page to page 3? 
MR X (through interpreter):  250 151 including VAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were - was Isibonelo paid for that invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Indeed so.  I was paid.  Isibonelo was 
paid. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we look at that invoice.  You will find it 
at page 30 of EXHIBIT DD27. 
20 
INTERPRETER:  Page 30? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  3-0. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the work that Isibonelo did related to 
this invoice? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 129 of 156 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  We supplied water tanks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And where were they supplied? 
MR X (through interpreter):  At Nkandla under the Chieftain Shange. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and how did you come to be 
appointed by Mhlathuze Water to provide these Jojo Tanks? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I went and spoke to Ms Myeni.  I told her 
that I do not have work that I was doing at that time.  They can help me 
by being able to quote for work that I can do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to be clear for the record is that 
Ms Duduzile Myeni? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what position did she hold at the time at 
the Water Board? 
MR X (through interpreter):  What I knew is that she was the 
Chairperson of the Water Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr.  Did we overlook to have some legal 
representatives placed on record or not really?ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  
Well the only … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not really. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, because in - they are in a watching 
capacity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Today as I understand it.  Only for Stefanutti 
Stock. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 130 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in that capacity… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have not generally put people on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If I can then move to 
paragraph 13 Mr X, because you talk in that paragraph about your 
relationship with Ms Myeni at that time.  Can you explain that to the 
Chair please? 
INTERPRETER:  Paragraph 13? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-3. 
INTERPRETER:  Okay. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I knew her for - from a very long time - 
for a while.  The reason why I know her or we met.  We met through 
working together. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is there a relationship between your families? 
MR X (through interpreter):  We got very close to an extent that we 
sort of became related.  Whenever there was an event or anything in 
her family I would go there and vice versa.  She would also come to my 
20 
family.  So our friendship grew very strong.  That we ended up like 
relatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is that the relationship between you and 
Ms Myeni as two people or is that the relationship between your family 
and Ms Myeni’s family? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 131 of 156 
 
INTERPRETER:  You mean between - sorry - Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two families. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Our relationship resulted in both our 
families getting close as if we were relatives.  So we bonded - both 
families bonded as relatives. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, if you go over the page to page 4 of your 
affidavit.  You will see at paragraph 15 you deal with the payment that 
you received from Mhlathuze and what you did with the proceeds of that 
payment.  Can you please explain that to the Chair? 
MR X (through interpreter):  What happened is I placed an order and 
10 
the money was paid into my account.  With that money I then paid for 
the Jojo Tanks and then the remaining money was then left for me, but I 
paid for the Jojo Tanks.  The little amount that was remaining was like 
remaining for me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you share any of those proceeds with 
Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  She did not ask for anything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then I would like to move to the 
next topic that appears in a heading on page 4.  The heading is the 
“Mhlathuze Water Funds”. 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At paragraph 16 on page 4 you talk about 
events that happened in early 15 - 2015.  Can you please describe 
those for us? 
INTERPRETER:  Chair, may I ask for clarity when he says (isiZulu 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 132 of 156 
 
word). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  2015 there is a friend of mine.  I 
know him all the way from - at Richards Bay.  He approached me and 
he requested to partner with me.  He mentioned that himself and his 
boss there are funds that they want to release. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who was this person. 
MR X (through interpreter):  His name is Mboniseni Majola. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat what he said to you.  No.  Just repeat 
what your friend said to you in - in early 2015 about monies or funds.  I 
think maybe (isiZulu word). 
MR X (through interpreter):  What he said to me is that he is looking 
for a company and a person that can be trusted so that he and his boss 
that - but he did not mention the name of the boss - that there are 
funds that they want to release or invest in a company. 
INTERPRETER:  I am not sure if I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am not sure about invest in. 
MR X:  (isiZulu). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
INTERPRETER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat what you - what … 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your friend said to you on that occasion. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 133 of 156 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  According to what he says in 
terms of the language that is used in the construction company.  Is that 
they have a construction company on site at Nsezi, but there are funds 
that they want to release through this company and then this company 
will pay those funds into my company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you - did you understand what your friend was 
saying to mean that some money was go - they were going to pay some 
money to their company and their company would then pay that money 
into your company? 
INTERPRETER:  Meaning did you understand what he meant by …? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  The company is not their company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr X.  Ms - Mr X, (isiZulu).  I have just asked 
Mr X to please explain to me what his friend said to him.  Okay.  Okay.  
Alright.  Stop there. 
MR X:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Stop there.  Are you able to translate that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  This gentleman approached me and he 
said he needs someone who is trustworthy.  There is money that they 
want to release into a company that will be paid into my company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did you understand was or where did you 
20 
understand that money to come from - was going to come from? 
MR X (through interpreter):  He works for Mhlathuze.  So my 
understanding was the company that was going to get work was going 
to work - get work at Mhlathuze.  So what will happen is this company 
that got work at Mhlatuze and I place it on record Chair that this friend 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 134 of 156 
 
of mine is an engineering – is an engineer at Mhlatuze, so this friend of 
mine is going to pay extra or more money to this company and then this 
company will give the money to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay did you understand that money would be paid 
by Mhlatuze Water Board to the company that he was talking to you 
about and that company would then pay the same money into your 
company or a portion of that money? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   From the way I understood him Your 
Worship I saw it that it was going to be easy because he was going to 
be the one who is doing the transaction or doing that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but the question is what you understood, did you 
understand that Mhlatuze Water Board would pay certain funds to that 
company and that company was going to pay over the same amount to 
your company or that, that company was going to pay a portion of what 
it would have been paid over to your company? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    He just put a statement to me as to 
how much was going to be – or what money was going to be put into my 
account, I didn’t know but he just made a statement that money will be 
paid into my account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Hofmeyr? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did Mr Majola – oh Chair, just for the record I 
did want to spell the names in, it’s Mbonisen Majola, Mr X when Mr 
Majola approached you about this, did he explain why he was 
approaching you…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has he told us it was Mr Majola? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 135 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I didn’t hear that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I asked who the friend was. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, so the question was, did he 
explain to you why he was approaching you? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   He is a respected man there in 
Richard’s Bay and so I did not ask him the reason why he approached 
me. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I understood your evidence previously, Mr X, 
to be that he did say that he trusted you, is that correct? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes that is true. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And Mr X how did this scheme that Mr Majola 
discussed with you, how did he explain it was going to work? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I did not ask him because he’s more 
educated than me and his position as well that he’s occupying at work, 
so I did not ask him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If we go over the page, we were at page 4 Mr 
X, if we go over the page – well let me pick it up first at paragraph 17 
20 
there, because you start to explain there how invoicing was going to be 
dealt with, what…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Maybe – just one sec Ms Hofmeyr, what was your 
understanding Mr X of why it was necessary that money paid to the 
particular company that Mr Majola talked to you about, should be paid 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 136 of 156 
 
to your company, what was your understanding as to why it was 
necessary to have this arrangement? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Honestly Chair I did not understand 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Please repeat your answer, ask him to repeat his 
answer? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    He was requesting me to receive this 
money for him but it was not easy for me to ask him why was it 
necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ask him or you did not ask him why some 
10 
money needed to be paid to your company from this other company with 
which you had nothing to do? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Well I did ask him as to whether they 
would give me documents to go and upgrade my standard at CIBB so 
what actually made me happy about this money was to get the 
opportunity to go and upgrade the stage at CIBB. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Were you going to use that money to upgrade the 
status of your company? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Not money as such but CIBB looked at 
the value of the work that you have done. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja but what I want to find out is, whether you had an 
understanding as to why Mr Majola was getting your company involved 
in this arrangement? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Well it did not cross my mind that I ask 
him as to why is he involving me or my company in this. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 137 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did he explain to you at that stage, when he spoke 
to you for the first time, about this arrangement what you were 
supposed to do with the money once it had been paid into your 
company? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I did ask him that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did he say? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    He then said to me he will give me 
another account number where I’m supposed to deposit this money to. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And was your understanding that you were going to 
pass the whole amount that your company received over into the 
10 
account that he would give you? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):  Well what I asked him was about, if 
there’s money deposited into a company’s account there’s VAT so I 
need to leave money for VAT in order to be able to pay for VAT.  So 
that’s the enquiry I made to him.   
CHAIRPERSON:    I think he said he asked him whether he knew 
that…[intervenes]. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   Oh he knew whether there should be 
money for VAT payment yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, thank you, Ms Hofmeyr I think at least there’s 
20 
been some clarification. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed I’m indebted Chair.  Mr X what was the 
arrangement about the VAT that you raised with Mr Majola? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   He did promise that as soon as the 
money is deposited into my account, we will then deduct the money for 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 138 of 156 
 
VAT payment.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And was it the understanding that Isibonelo 
would then retain the VAT amount and the remainder would be paid 
over? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did you know the companies from whom 
you were receiving the funds or the companies to whom you were 
paying the funds? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No he did not mention who are the 
owners of those companies. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did Isibonelo ever render services to the 
companies from whom it received these payments? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   No I’ve never done any work for them.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And when Isibonelo paid monies to the 
companies that Mr Majola gave the details of, had those companies 
ever rendered services to Isibonelo? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No they didn’t. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I’d then like to pick it up at page 4 
again, because at the bottom of page 4 in paragraph 17 you explain 
how the invoicing was going to work.  Can you tell us how invoicing was 
20 
handled? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):  When time comes for us to submit or – ja 
put in the invoice, he would come to my offices together with my 
secretary he would then assist my secretary to create the invoice.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Was the invoice fictitious? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 139 of 156 
 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Because I was not in the side I would 
not know what was happening there so he would bring the scope of 
work himself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Was the scope of work that was included on 
the invoice work that Isibonelo actually did? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No I’ve never done it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If we then go to page 5 Mr X, in the first 
paragraph on that page you set out the concern you raised in relation 
to VAT but you’ve already testified about that. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I’d like to ask about the discomfort that you 
describe in paragraph 19 that you conveyed to Mr Majola when he had 
this conversation with you, can you tell us about that concern you 
raised with him? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    You mean the issue that we are talking 
about right away…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Maybe let’s put it this way, at some stage you would 
have – did you begin to implement the scheme that Mr Majola 
introduced to you? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):  Would you please repeat the question?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you, at some stage, begin to implement the 
arrangement that Mr Majola introduced to you? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Meaning receiving the money on his 
behalf? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and paying it over to another company. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 140 of 156 
 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:    How did you feel about playing this role in regard to 
this arrangement? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    At that stage I wanted to see me as a 
person that can be trusted or can be trustworthy to him but it’s different 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From when to when did you participate in this 
arrangement? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):  Though I don’t remember the month and 
the dates precisely but the year is between 2013 he further said 2014 
10 
to 2016.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, throughout that period how did you feel about 
playing the role that Mr Majola had asked you to play in this 
arrangement? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    What happened is, when they were 
dealing with these monies it will be between my secretary and himself 
and it happened in my office and when there’s money coming in – the 
money would come in at the stage when I do not have money and I 
would not have money still when I even saw that there was money that 
came in. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you say you didn’t feel good about it when this 
money came at a time when you were broke? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes very much so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But were you comfortable playing this role throughout 
the period from around 2013/2014 to 2016?   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 141 of 156 
 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I did not get the first part Chair.  I 
decided to let it continue happening because should I raise any concern 
or discomfort about it to him it will be, like, I’m being jealous, like black 
people being jealous of each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay Ms Hofmeyr I was trying to make sure that we 
extract the information from him in relation to the first sentence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m not sure if I succeeded. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Well I’m certainly indebted to you for that.  Mr 
X, I know that the Chair has asked a few questions around this topic, I 
10 
would like, just, one final question in relation to it.  As I understand the 
arrangement that you’ve described, your company would be paid money 
for work it did not do and then it would pay out a portion of that money, 
less the VAT portion to companies with whom it did not have a 
relationship, is that correct? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I can hear him. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let’s start afresh, let Ms Hofmeyr start, I think he 
would like the question repeated. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Certainly, Mr X this arrangement with Mr 
Majola, as I understand it, involved your company being paid monies 
20 
for work it did not do and then your company being required to pay a 
portion of that monies to other companies that it had no relationship 
with, is that correct? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:    There is an important part that you left off Ms 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 142 of 156 
 
Interpreter, that is his company was being money for work it did not do. 
INTERPRETER:    I apologise sir. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    That is correct Chair it would be paid 
monies for the work that it did not do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you regard it as wrong to receive those 
monies for work you did not do? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Though I did not look at it the way you 
are putting it to me now, but to me I saw it as an opportunity to ask him 
to take me to the site for experience and he promised to take me there, 
he kept on promising to take me to the site to get experience. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did he ever do that? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   No he kept on postponing it that he will 
call me, he will call me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Was there anyone else present with you when 
you had this discussion with Mr Majola? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   No it was just the two of us.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did you tell anyone about it afterwards? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No, no-one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why not? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I’m a man who’s able to keep secrets. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was this arrangement a secret? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   It was just between the two of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was it a secret? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    At that stage yes, it was a secret that I 
should not tell anyone else about it. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 143 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    And are you able to say that Mr Majola also 
regarded this arrangement as a secret between the two of you? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   I think the two of us were involved in an 
activity that we did not know how it was going to end up. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No the question is, whether, as far as you know, Mr 
Majola also regarded it as a secret between the two of you, namely this 
arrangement? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I think so, I think he was also regarding 
it as a secret. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, I’d like to now go into the detail of one of 
these sets of transactions.  Chair what I propose to do in the evidence 
is go to one or two of the transactions for which there are records but I 
do so bearing in mind that Mr X has confirmed the full contents of the 
affidavit under oath today and he’s considered it prior to today. So it’s 
not my intention to take him to every one but to take him to a few that 
will highlight the process that was being followed but I do so with your 
leave, if there’s a need at any point to be more detailed I’m happy to do 
so.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we should mention all of them even if you 
20 
don’t elaborate.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because as I understand it, the basis of the 
transaction was the same. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 144 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    So it should go quite quick. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What I propose to do is spend quite a bit of 
time on the first one, then we can just record all of the remaining with 
your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes that will be in order but before you do that Mr X 
did you say that you didn’t see this arrangement between yourself and 
Mr Majola as wrong? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I did see it as something wrong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you see it as wrong?    
MR X  (through Interpreter):   It was scary, though I did not know 
exactly how the transaction were going to take – or how it was going to 
happen, the transactions, but by just thinking or hearing about it, it was 
scary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said that when Mr Majola spoke to you for the first 
time about this arrangement, he told you that this arrangement was 
something that he and his boss wanted, is that right? 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you started, before the arrangement was 
20 
implemented did you get to know who his boss was? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, I never got the opportunity to know 
who it was because there they would change, he referred to them as 
COO’s every now and then so you would not know who exactly it was, so I 
did not get the opportunity to know. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 145 of 156 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know the position that was occupied by the 
person that Mr Majola said was his boss? 
MR X (through interpreter):   He was not reporting directly to the COO.  
There was another person so there were two people that he was reporting 
to but not directly to the COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have referred to COO or CEO?  CEO or COO? 
MR X (through interpreter):   The one in the senior position, it is CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now did you understand that the boss that 
Mr Majola was talking about was somebody who was occupying the 
position of CEO?  Was that your understanding? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):   He did not specify exactly who was the 
boss.  I concluded that it was the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you at any stage after the commencement of 
the implementation of this arrangement come to know who the boss was 
that Mr Majola was talking about? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, I did not even bother to ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you testify today, do you know who that boss was 
that he was talking about? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Miss Hofmeyr. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Mr X at page 5 paragraph 19 
you deal in the second half of that paragraph about something that 
Mr Majola said regarding the trust that they put in you to do this.  Do you 
see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Miss Hofmeyr should just read the relevant 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 146 of 156 
 
sentence or sentences and then she can interpret? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, let me do that.  I am reading now from the 
sixth line of paragraph 19 and what is recorded there is, 
“He, that is a reference to Mr Majola, further 
indicated that I am the only person they can trust to 
pull this through.”   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see the paragraph. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you recall Mr Majola saying that specifically 
to you in your conversation? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I do. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you enquire at any point who the ‘they’ was 
who he was referring to? 
MR X (through interpreter):   From the way I understood him, he was not 
alone in this scheme, but he did not want to mention the other people’s 
names.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and at any point did you come to 
learn who they were? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Well, there was a time when things were 
getting like serious bad, then I was also like was insisting to get the 
documents to this whole project.  I was asking him to give me the 
20 
documents and at that stage I do believe that you were now involved in 
this because he was saying there are or there is a group or a gang that is 
talking to some White people about this, and I was also insisting that he 
gives me documents to this project, but he would then, at that stage he 
would mention names.   
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 147 of 156 
 
INTERPRETER:   Yes I interpreted correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can I just clarify for my own purposes?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is that a reference to engagements with the 
Commission? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – so when you say you were asking Mr Majola for 
documents and you say you were already involved you mean the 
Commission was involved in investigating this and you were aware of it? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is exactly what I am explaining Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I then like to move over to page 6 if 
we can, subject to any further questions from the Chair, but this is where 
we start to get into the detail of the invoicing and the process.  So Mr X if 
we go, first of all, to the invoice that the Commissions Investigator 
showed you on the 15 January, sorry he did not show it to you on the 
15 January 2015, it is an invoice dated 15 January 2015, and that you will 
find at page 32, three two of Exhibit DD (31). 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What is this document? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):   It is the invoice from my office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And who is it made out to? 
MR X 
(through 
interpreter):   It 
is 
an 
invoice 
from 
Isibonelo 
Construction, paid out to Clomax Engineering. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I – I think [intervenes].  
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213

CHAIRPERSON:   Clomack, made to ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and what is the amount of the 
invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):   R 294 000.00 [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Miss Hofmeyr you just have to say the amount. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I can see it is not particularly clear on this page.  
There appears to be an invoice amounts without VAT of 2.1 million rand.  
.  Then there is a taxes line which I read as R294 000.00 and then I think 
the total in the block at the bottom is reflected as R 2 394 000.00.  Is that 
correct Mr X? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. I see those amounts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And can you tell us what the description of the 
Works is on this invoice, what were you told to include?  What was the 
description of the Works, let us start there. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Like I said initially the scope of work he 
would bring the scope of work with him.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how would this invoice be generated? 
MR X (through interpreter):   He would come and fetch it from my office.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how would you be told what work to include 
in it? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):   He would come with a piece of paper with 
the description of what is to be contained on the and give it, and then 
give it to my Secretary, then my Secretary will just have to copy what is 
on the piece of paper and write it on the invoice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At the time of this invoice, which was the 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 149 of 156 
 
15 January 2015, had you ever met anyone from Clomac Engineering?  
MR X (through interpreter):   No, I have never met anyone I do not even 
know them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the description that appears on this invoice 
seems to indicate there is a line item for P’s and G’s, there is a line item 
for Crane inst.  And I think that is supposed to be short for installation 
and commission.  There is a line item for road surfacing.  A line item for 
Manholes and a line item for electrification.  Did Isibonelo conduct any of 
the work  
MR X (through interpreter):   No, none of them. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And there appears to be a stamp on this page 
reflecting Mhlatuse Water, is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see the stamp. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   How would that stamp be applied to the invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):   When this invoice left my office there was 
no stamp on it.  The first time I saw that there is now a stamp on this 
invoice it was when I was approached by the Commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you know Mr Majola’s signature? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there any of those two signatures that are on that 
stamp at page 32 that you are able to identify? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, none, I do not recognise any. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you obviously knew your Secretary’s signature, 
but I am saying obviously, maybe I should not say obviously.  Did you, do 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 150 of 156 
 
you, are you able to identify your Secretaries signature? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I do, I know it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Her signature is not one of these? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, it is none of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Mr X I would then like to understand 
precisely how this invoice would be generated.  You indicated previously 
in your testimony there would be some interaction between Mr Majola and 
your Secretary.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Would you please repeat the question? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, I am, it is a preface to understanding how 
the process worked and I understood from MR X’s previous testimony that 
there would be some interaction between Mr Majola and his Secretary.  Is 
that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how did that work? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Mr Majola would then interact with my 
Secretary like I have said.  He would come with a piece of paper with the 
amount and the scope of work, give it to my secretary and then my 
secretary would then give the invoice the next number and generate it 
20 
using the piece of paper that was given to her by Mr Majola, and Mr 
Majola will all the time stand next to my secretary as she is generating 
the invoice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what would happen after the invoice is 
generated? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 151 of 156 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   He will then leave with the invoice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what do you understand he would then do 
with the invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):   My understanding is that he was taking it 
to the people that he was working, the White people that he was working 
with from Clomac.  That was my understanding of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Did you understand that there were, some 
people that he was working with in regard to this project, in regard to this 
arrangement? 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is correct.  The arrangement was 
10 
according to the way I understood it, it was between himself and Clomac 
Engineering. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, are you saying that you understood that he was, he 
would take the invoice to Clomac? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before Miss Hofmeyr proceeds, if you look at 
the invoice at page 32 there is a breakdown of what the various amounts 
are for on that page, do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did you say that it would have been Mr Majola who 
20 
wrote the amounts that are claimed in that invoice, individual amounts as 
well as the different items of the work that was put in the invoice as work 
that Isibonelo Construction had done? 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 152 of 156 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and then I would like to take you next 
to your bank statement, well at least the bank statement of Isibonelo, 
Mr X, and you will find that at page 34, Exhibit DD(31). 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, can you confirm that this is a bank 
statement from the account of Isibonelo? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you will see there is a balance brought 
forward at the top line under the introductory part of that document that 
seems to reflect R 22 168.02, do you see that? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what is the next line indicating on that 
page? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Where there is a highlight? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, correct. 
MR X (through interpreter):   This is a very big number, amount so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, indeed, well first of all I am interested in the 
left hand side of the page, who it indicates there paid that amount into 
the account? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Clomac Enginering CC, ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then that amount appears to accord with the 
amount of the invoice that we looked at – at page 32 because the invoice 
amount at page 32 is R2 394 000.00 and it appears next to Clomac 
Engineering on the left of your bank statement, and amount of 
R2 394 000.00 was paid, is that correct? 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 153 of 156 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what happened after Isibonelo received 
these amounts, these payments, what did you do? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I then waited for his instruction on what is 
to be done. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Who is he? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Ibonisela Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We can return Mr X to your affidavit because at 
page 7 of that affidavit you detail what then transpired.  You say at 
paragraph 29 of that page that you informed Mr Majola that you have 
10 
received the funds from Clomac Engineering and he gave me a bank 
account through a hand written note through which I had to pay the funds, 
is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Okay I omitted to mention that I phoned 
him to inform him that the money is now into my bank account.  So that is 
the part Chair that I have omitted to mention, that I phoned him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean as a practice phone him once the amount 
had come in to Isibonelo’s account or do you mean you phoned him on 
this particular occasion? 
MR X (through interpreter):   It was a practice. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair I see we are close to the 4 o’clock break-
time.  There are a few remaining items on, well actually I need to go into 
the details of what then precisely happened.  So, it may be a convenient 
time to take the adjournement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I do not know whether you would like to, us to 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 154 of 156 
 
stop here or whether depending on how much time you need with him, if 
we needed an hour maybe we could cover, go up to five [intervenes].  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, we should cover quite some substantial 
ground if it is convenient for us to continue.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we can go up to five from my point of view but 
doing that is also convenient for everybody including Mr X but also we 
have to look at what difference that would make as for tomorrow because 
if in the end it will not make any difference we may as well adjourn and 
then continue tomorrow.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair my view is that it will make quite an impact 
10 
to be able to have a further hour.  I really do think I could get through 
quite abit of the detail of the transactions and it would be useful to get 
that out of the way even if we have to return for a short period tomorrow.  
Speaking for myself I – I might just request a short comfort break if we 
are going to go on for another hour, I will be indebted to that otherwise I 
think we could usefully use an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr X would you be able to continue until about 5 
o’clock? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, we can try. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Miss Interpreter are you able? Or have you got a 
20 
challenge? 
INTERPRETER:   Yes, because I did not have transport to get here, yes, I 
had a problem with my car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then we just have to adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We do, Indeed.  Chair I think we did discuss 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 155 of 156 
 
possibly starting early tomorrow, is that still convenient? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Witness for tomorrow how long do you think we will 
be with him?  How many Witnesses do you have? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We only have Mr Majola scheduled for tomorrow 
so the idea would be to conclude with MR X and then move to Mr Majola, 
and I do envisage the day with Mr Majola  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya, okay, okay, maybe if we and if Mr Majola will not be 
needing an interpreter, do you know? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No, we have not been alerted to any such need, 
no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we are going to, or we cannot go up to five tomorrow 
because of the other commitment.  So maybe we should then start early 
tomorrow, it is a pity we cannot continue and cover some more ground 
today. What time were you suggesting that we start tomorrow?  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   With hesitation I suggest nine, but even nine-
thirty would give us a bit more time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya – ya, shall we do nine thirty?  I was going to do 9 
o’clock but there is something else that I need to attend to.  Let us say 
9H30, let us say 9H30 and if need be, we will see where else we can 
make some more time.  I think maybe when we start tomorrow it would 
20 
help if you have a better picture in terms of how much time you need in 
order to finish Mr Majola’s evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Of course.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ya, No that is fine and then I do not know what was 
wrong today with the aircon, it is like a - it is hot, it is not making us cool 
17 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 213 
 
Page 156 of 156 
 
so somebody must please attend to that from tomorrow.  Okay Mr X we 
are going to adjourn the proceedings for today.  We are going to resume 
at 09h30 tomorrow morning. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 18 FEBRUARY 2020
