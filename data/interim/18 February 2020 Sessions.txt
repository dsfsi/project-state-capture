PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 18 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just confirm that Mr X can hear us 
clearly? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I can. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr X the oath you took yesterday continues to apply.  
You understand that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr X if you could please 
have in front of you your affidavit bundle which is Exhibit DD31 and if 
you turn to page 7 in that affidavit?   
MR X (through interpreter):  I am there. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr X we finished yesterday at the 
point at which you were going to tell us what you did with the funds 
after they were received from Klomac Engineering.  And you begin to 
describe that in your affidavit at paragraph 29.  What I would like to do 
first is understand from you how the payment of those funds worked 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 3 of 104 
 
generally and then we will go into the detail of each amount that was 
paid arising from the Klomac payment.  So if we start generally what 
was the general process that would be followed after you received the 
money insofar as you were engaging with Mr Majola? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I will call him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I think Ms Interpreter you may have 
missed something.  Ms Hofmeyr said she wants to know from him the 
general process that he would follow when he had received money from 
– or when the money had come into his account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is the process in general and then later on they 
will go into details of each one.  It is the process followed after he had 
received money before money would be paid over to the account 
designated by Mr Majola.  No, no, no.   
MR X (through interpreter):  I am not sure if my response will be what 
is required of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes go ahead. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  Immediately after the money is 
deposited into my account that will be indicated in my phone.  Notify 
me basically on my phone. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what would you do? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Then I will call him to inform him that the 
money has already been deposited into my account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is the him Mr Majola? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 4 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what would happen? 
MR X (through interpreter):  And then I will wait for further instruction 
from him as to how should I then use the money or what should I do 
with the money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair is there… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please repeat your answer Mr Majola and then Ms 
Interpreter you can just listen carefully. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay like I said initially the money will be 
deposited into my account.  My phone will notify me that there is money 
deposited into my account then I will call him and then wait for his 
10 
instructions as to what should I do after the money has been deposited 
into my account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say earlier on if he would tell you if he would 
be busy and then you would wait for him? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If he was busy would you phone him again 
later? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No because he is already aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then would he come back to you when he was 
able to do so? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like to then move over to 
page 8 to look at what specifically happened to the R2 million… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 5 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to complete the process.  What would he usually 
say when he did get a chance to come back to you?  Would he say he 
would be coming to the office so that an invoice – or would he tell you 
the account number where to pay the money into or would he come 
back to you and say something else? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Both.  It happened both of the scenarios 
that you have just put him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would he sometimes come – would he sometimes say 
he was going to see you and then he would come and see you and 
sometimes he would just call you and give you the account number? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  I – I cannot hear him properly Chair 
because he is speaking… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please raise your voice Mr X. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  It would happen that he would 
come to my office and give me the account – or drop off the account 
numbers or telephonically he will give me the account numbers.  Sorry.  
Oh the account number will be brought to my office written.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he would not tell you the account number over the 
phone? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay I do not remember him doing it – 
20 
telling me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as far as you can recall all the time he brought the 
account number to you and it would be written in a piece of paper? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then after that has happened – had 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 6 of 104 
 
happened what would you then do or what would your office do? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would then give out an instruction that 
the money be deposited on the account number that is reflected on the 
piece of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you give that instruction to your secretary? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct she is the one who is able 
to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be – would it be her all the time or did you 
sometimes give the instruction to somebody else? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would give this instruction to my – it is 
10 
two of them.  It is my daughter and my secretary so I will give the 
instruction to the two of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would give the instruction to any one of them, is 
that right? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was your daughter working in your office? 
MR X (through interpreter):  She does work sometimes she will be 
there in the office, sometimes not.  But she does have the authority – I 
am not sure the right to work in the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  How – how – do you know how long it would take 
20 
normally for the – for your secretary or your daughter to pay the money 
into the account designated by Mr Majola after you had given the 
instructions or after Mr Majola had dropped the information about the 
account?   
INTERPRETER:  How long Chair, is it how long? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 7 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Immediately after I have instructed them 
or her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is Mr X asking for confirmation whether we want to 
know the time between he had – after he had given instructions to the 
time of payment or is he confirming that the payment would be 
immediate after he had given instructions? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Oh I was asking for clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am – the question was, from the time when 
you gave – you would give instructions to your secretary or your 
10 
daughter to pay the money to the time when your secretary or your 
daughter paid the money, how much time would that take?  Would it be 
a day, would it be two day, would it be a week? 
MR X (through interpreter):   It would not be more than a day or two 
days Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR X (through interpreter):  The problem would be the challenge 
sometimes would be the network that will affect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And – and actually just one further 
20 
question to conclude the general procedure.  We have spoken about 
transfers to bank accounts but did Mr Majola ever ask for money to be 
given to him in cash? 
MR X (through interpreter):  He would sometimes request me that I 
give him cash but I will be limited by the limit – my bank limit because 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 8 of 104 
 
my bank will decline to give me the money that he is requesting.  So 
because of the bank limit I will be unable to do so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When he did request cash how did that 
happen? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Though this happened a long time but if I 
remember very well is that he would give me a call and ask me about 
my whereabouts to meet me and then he would come and request me 
that I withdraw money for him in cash that is.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to the 
specific transactions related to the R2 394 000.00 that was received 
10 
from Klomac Engineering on the 26 January.  And for this purpose if 
you can turn to page 8 of your affidavit in DD31 Mr X.   
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And paragraph 31. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at paragraph 31.1 you – let me just read the 
introduction.  You say there: 
“The amount of R2 349 000.00 save for the VAT 
portion.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  394? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R2 394 000.00. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry I might have said that incorrectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies.  R 394 000.00 Chair thank you. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 9 of 104 
 
“Save for the VAT portion was paid out in the 
following tranches as per Mr Majola’s instructions.  
The first amount there is R150 000.00 was paid to 
Safeza Kohnke Engineering PTY Limited on the 2 
February 2015.” 
Do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I do not suggest that we need to go every time 
to the bank statement Chair but all of the bank statements are 
attached. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For each of these transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I would like Mr X to clarify for us is, did 
you know what or who Safeza Kohnke Engineering was? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But can you confirm the amount of R150 000.00 
was paid to Safeza Kohnke’s account on the 2 February 2015? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That – that is correct.  Confirmed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – and can you confirm whether that was on 
20 
Mr Majola’s instruction? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did – did Isibonelo ever do any work with or 
receive services from Safeza Kohnke Engineering? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 10 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go to the second payment that 
appears from your affidavit to have been paid the next day.  That was 
an amount of R850 000.00 which you say was paid on the 3 February 
2015. Was that again in accordance with Mr Majola’s instruction? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go to paragraph 31.3.  Mr X 
what you describe there in the affidavit is that on the 11 February so 
that is just more than a week later after the second tranche was paid.   
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You explain that there was a transfer of that R1 
10 
million on the 11 February to a Money Market account of Isibonelo and 
then you later describe how that money came back into the Isibonelo 
account and was paid out.  Can you just describe for us how that would 
occur? 
CHAIRPERSON:  One – one second.  Ms Interpreter. 
INTERPRETER:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must feel free to stop him. 
INTERPRETER:  Yes okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that you can interpret because otherwise he might 
tell a long story and when you interpret you cannot remember 
20 
everything. 
INTERPRETER:  Thank you Chair I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe let us start afresh. 
MR X (through interpreter):  My business has another account which 
is a Money Market account.  If there is money to be deposited into the 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 11 of 104 
 
business account and it not our money it is from the suppliers we will 
then deposit it to the Money Market.  Would I please – may I repeat? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.   
INTERPRETER:  I am not sure if I am getting him right.  May I try and 
then Chair you would correct me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja, no. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  We have business account and 
then we also have a Money Market account.  In the business account I 
would like to place it on record that we also have our own income that 
10 
goes into the business account.  Then there will be monies from – for 
the suppliers that will also come into the business account.  So what 
we would do is in order to avoid not using the money which is not ours 
but the suppliers we will then move it to the side meaning to the Money 
Market account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
INTERPRETER:  I think he needs – sorry may I correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Do explain. 
MR X (through interpreter):  For an example the R2 million money that 
was deposit – R2.3 million which was deposited into my business 
20 
account if I have not removed it completely from the business account I 
will then transfer it into the Money account so that I can see my own 
income coming into my business account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then when would you bring it back into 
your business account? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 12 of 104 
 
INTERPRETER:  Meaning the money that he moved to the side? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
INTERPRETER:  Ja.  Would you please repeat and speak a little bit 
louder.  I was trying to make it clear what I am requesting from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes okay. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would wait for an instruction again that I 
should transfer it back to the business account so that once again to 
avoid my income as well as this money into the same account.  So I will 
wait for an instruction to take it back into the business account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think check – I think the instruction is for – is 
10 
where to pay that money but paying it into the – his business account is 
just for his convenience for his business purposes.  The instruction is 
where he should pay the amount – the money.  Mr X do you hear me? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  Ja you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The instruction you are talking about would that be an 
instruction to tell you where to pay the supplier’s money – into which 
account? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The instruction does not relate to you bringing your – 
the money from the Money Market account into your business account, 
20 
is that right? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It is according to my own accord to 
decide where I keep this money.  For instance if I have money which is 
about to come into the business account I will then instruct them to put 
this money aside on the Money account.  Then when time comes for me 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 13 of 104 
 
to pay this money into the instructed accounts then it would be my 
decision once again to move it back to the business account so that it 
would be convenient for me to be able to pay the monies into the said 
accounts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that.  And as you record at 
paragraph 31.3 and the bank statements reflect it appears that 
R1 002 000.00 was transferred back into Isibonelo’s business account 
on the 9 March 2015 and then R1 million was paid out to Safeza 
Kohnke again on the same date, do you confirm that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay sorry, sorry about that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think do – do interpret. 
INTERPRETER:  Okay. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The R1 million that was transferred out to Safeza 
Kohnke is part of the R1 002 000.00 that you had transferred from or 
had been transferred from Money Market into your business account, is 
that right? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr X.  I would then like to at this 
20 
point draw your attention to an affidavit of Mr Paton from Klomac 
Engineering.  Chair I indicated yesterday that we had received a series 
of further affidavits from the other entities involved in this arrangement.  
They have been collected in one file which we propose be entered into 
the record as Exhibit DD28.  That file comprises the affidavit of Mr 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 14 of 104 
 
Khan to whom I made reference yesterday.  The affidavit of Mr Shanga 
and the affidavit of Mr Paton.  So if I could request that we enter that 
into the record and then ask Mr X to get that file in front of him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It says only Mr Khan’s name on the spine, but it 
actually comprises Mr Khan, Mr Shange and Mr Paton’s affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what has misled me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ah.  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I have been wondering where … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Shange’s affidavit is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry.  That is an error  
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Simply on the spine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We - we will correct that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will that be corrected? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The file containing the affidavits - actually should 
we not have Mr Khan’s affidavit as - give it one exhibit maybe. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number 28A … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Mr Shange’s one … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 15 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  A different exhibit number. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, if I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there two of - of Mr Khan’s one? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is two of Mr Khan’s.  One of Mr Shange 
and one of Mr Paton and maybe what I can do is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With reference to the starting page of each of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Assist with the different exhibit numbers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if I could propose that Mr Khan’s affidavit 
and his supplementary be entered into the exhibit as DD28A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that suitable and then I indicate what pages 
it runs to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does the supplement only have annexures or it …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us do it as 28A and 28B. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Noffel Khan’s main affidavit, would that … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be correct which was deposed to … 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 16 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On 4 December 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On 4 December 2019 and its annexures will be 
admitted and marked as EXHIBIT DD28A and his supplementary 
affidavit deposed to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On 12 December 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On 12 December 2019 and annexures to it will be 
admitted and marked as EXHIBIT 28 - DD28B. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indebted Chair and then if we can then 
also proceed to Mr Shange’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That commences at paginated page 1-2-7 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I propose that be entered into the record 
as EXHIBIT DD28C and that is the affidavit deposed to by Mr Shange 
on 16 January 2020 and its annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Kolani Shange’s affidavit deposed to on 
16 January 2020 and annexures to it will be admitted and marked as 
EXHIBIT DD28C. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then finally in this file if we turn to page 
1-50 
- 
1-5-0. 
 
That 
is 
the 
first 
page 
of 
affidavit 
of 
20 
Mr Colin Gordon Paton.  That was deposed to on 11 November 2019 
and I propose that it and its annexures be entered into the record as 
EXHIBIT DD28D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Colin Gordon Paton and annexures 
will - will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT DD28D. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 17 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, what I would like to draw your attention 
to in the affidavit of Mr Paton is the following.  Mr Paton explains at 
page 1-5-0 of EXHIBIT DD28D at paragraph 1 that he is the Managing 
Director of Klomac Engineering.  Do you see that? 
INTERPRETER:  Is it paragraph 150? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is page 150 paragraph 1. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you ever met …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says he is the Managing Director of Klomac 
Engineering (Pty) Ltd.  Just translate that Ms Interpreter. 
INTERPRETER:  Is it possible that I can have …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not have …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  Apologies.  I thought you had been given 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I thought you … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The full set. 
INTERPRETER:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you have - you must be given that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course.  Sorry.  I think it was there 
yesterday.  We might have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Tidied it away.  If we can beg leave just to 
approach the interpreter … 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 18 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For that purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
INTERPRETER:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Ms Khumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And go to page 150 towards the end.  Right at the 
end actually. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will need page 1-5-0.  I think it is after the 
last divider. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the affidavit of Mr Colin Gordon Paton. 
INTERPRETER:  I have found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You found it.  Ja.  Okay.  What Ms Hofmeyr sought 
Mr X to confirm is what is in paragraph 1. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you ever met Mr Paton? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  I have never. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you ever met anyone associated with 
Klomac Engineering? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I know no one. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I would like to draw your attention to 
page 1-6-0 - 160 of Mr Paton’s affidavit - EXHIBIT DD28D. 
MR X (through interpreter):  (Answer not interpreted). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the meantime you confirm that not only have 
you not met Mr Paton, but also you have never spoken to him 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 19 of 104 
 
telephonically? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I - I have never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have - you have had no communication with him 
at all? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On that page 160 Mr X what Mr Paton does at 
paragraph 39 is he summarises what his understanding was of 
Isibonelo’s role.  Just to clarify Ms Khumalo.  It - it is paragraph 39 on 
page 160.   
10 
INTERPRETER:  39, page 160.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to read into the record what 
Mr Paton says there, because what he has done up until this point in 
his affidavit Chair and Mr X is.  He has explained the various 
transactions in which Klomac was involved and what Mr Paton indicates 
at paragraph 39 on that page is the following.  He says: 
“To the best of my knowledge and having worked in 
the industry it does transpire that on occasion 
20 
during the course of the contract there may be 
contract instructions which require contract based 
charges for which no provision has been made in 
the Bill of Quantities.  Isibonelo to the best of 
Klomac’s knowledge is a nominated subcontractor 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 20 of 104 
 
of the client …” 
Now that is a reference to Mhlathuze Water. 
“…which carried out contract works for the client.” 
Again a reference to Mhlathuze Water.   
INTERPRETER:  May I also read it so that I can understand it before I 
interpret it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, read it.  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what I would like to ask Mr X is whether it 
is correct that Isibonelo was appointed as a subcontractor to Mhlathuze 
at any point after 2015? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  I take you back.  If I remember well.  Can 
I just take you back? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Ja. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  If I take you back.  Remember I 
did mention that I was supposed to work as a subcontractor for 
Mhlathuze, but I waited for the documents and those documents I have 
never received them or signed them.  So the answer would be, no.  I 
have never signed the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think - I think he said he was waiting for those 
20 
documents included in an appointment letter.  Is that what you said? 
INTERPRETER:  Oh.  My - my apologies - my apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 21 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you ever do any work as a 
subcontractor to Mhlathuze from 2015? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair, just to make a note.  The 
whole manner in which Bills of Quantities and - ooh, I see we have 
exceeded our time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  We have not actually. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We started early. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh we - we started early.  I am - I am sort of an 
10 
hour out.  So we do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We can actually progress a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just wanted to put a note in here.  The - the 
first part of the paragraph that we read into the record there of 
Mr Paton is about how on the side of the contractors to Mhlathuze the 
Bills of Quantities would be adjusted for these payments, but I - I am 
just indicating.  I am not traversing that with Mr X, because Mr X’s 
involvement does not … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Require that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  See that side … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  That is fine. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 22 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you will just explain that. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I understand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to return to your 
affidavit Mr X and that is in EXHIBIT DD31 at page 9. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am on page 9. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now what I am going to do Mr X is take you 
through a series of further invoices that were generated by Isibonelo 
and as I understand your affidavit you received instructions then to - to 
pay out the monies received and I am going to take you to each one 
and ask you to confirm that that is what happened and where necessary 
10 
I will ask you a few further questions about a particular invoice or a 
particular payment. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So let us start at paragraph 33 on page 
9. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am on paragraph 33. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now at paragraph 33 you start to describe an 
invoice that Isibonelo issued to Afrostructures and I would like to take 
you to that invoice.  You will find it at page 46 - 4-6. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is the date of that invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):  08/04/2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and is that an invoice of which you 
are aware? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am aware of it. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 23 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the customer there is indicated as 
Afrostructures.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have you ever had any dealings, telephonic, in 
person or otherwise with anyone from Afrostructures? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a description of works on this invoice.  
It reads: 
“Renovation of offices and conversion of garages to 
offices.” 
10 
And then there is an amount billed for that of R750 121,88. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I do see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where did you get that description of works 
from? 
MR X (through interpreter):  The information contained here was 
brought by Mr Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did Isibonelo ever renovate offices or convert 
garages to offices for Afrostructures? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can we take it that your previous evidence 
20 
about how these invoices would be generated and then taken away by 
Mr Majola applies to this invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you received funds related to this 
invoice.  You say that at page 10 on paragraph 35 on 17 April 2015.  I 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 24 of 104 
 
would like to take you to that bank statement and you will find that at 
page 48 - 4-8. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am - I am on my bank statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will see highlighted towards the bottom 
of that page … 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is an amount of R872 234,74 received - it 
appears - on 17 April from Afrostructures.  Can you confirm that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to deal with another set of 
10 
invoices, because they happen at the same time and then we will speak 
about what you did with the monies after they were received into 
Isibonelo’s bank account. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Understood. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we are now at page 10 of your affidavit - 
EXHIBIT DD31. 
INTERPRETER:  Is it - did you mention the paragraph? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Paragraph 36. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That refers to a - a second invoice that the - 
20 
that Isibonelo issued to Klomac and you will find it at page 50 - 5-0. 
INTERPRETER:  Did you say page 50? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  5-0, yes.  Do you have that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is the date of this invoice? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 25 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  08/04/2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 And it 
is 
again 
addressed 
to 
Klomac 
Engineering for the attention of Mark Freeman.  Your evidence 
previously was that you have had no dealings with Klomac Engineering 
and that you do not know who Mr Mark Freeman is.  Does that apply to 
this invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the description of works there is: 
“Refurbishment of office lift.” 
Was Isibonelo involved in doing work refurbishing an office 
10 
lift for Klomac Engineering at any point? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can we take it that your previous evidence 
applies here insofar as the description of work having been supplied by 
Mr Majola? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the total of that invoice including VAT was 
R866 680,67.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then just to take you to the bank statement 
20 
where the funds pursuant to that invoice were received.  You will find 
that at page 52 - 5-2 - of EXHIBIT DD31. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am on page 52.  I see page 52. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will see the highlighted entry on that 
page indicates that on 20 April 2015 there was a payment received from 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 26 of 104 
 
Klomac Engineering in the amount of R866 680,67.  Is that correct? 
INTERPRETER:  Is it 20 April 2015? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think - I think you must just repeat the 
number.  The amount - 866 000.  Yes. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see the amount. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you confirm that Isibonelo received those 
funds? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would not like to turn to what was done after 
those two amounts were received from Afrostructures and Klomac and 
10 
for that purpose if we could go back to your affidavit at page 11, Mr X. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am on page 11. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at paragraph 39 at the top of page 11 you 
record in your affidavit that and I quote: 
“Mr Majola instructed me to pay out the funds 
received from Klomac and Afrostructures in the 
following manner.” 
You indicate that on the 31 s t of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you want to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Translate that portion?  Ja. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the first payment you reflect there was on 
21 April 2015 and that was R600 000,00 paid to Sifezakonke.  Do you 
confirm that? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 27 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  Confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I ask whether the method of the 
process preceding this payment was the same as the one that you 
described generally earlier? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Majola at some point after you alerted 
him to the fact that the funds had been received told you where to pay 
out those funds.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now on 21 April 2015 R600 000,00 was paid to 
10 
Sifezakonke and you have already given evidence that you had 
previously amounts to Sifezakonke.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At paragraph 39.2 you indicate that the day 
later on 22 April 2015 an amount of R700 000 was paid to Isivunosami 
Trading.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now is Isivunosami Trading is a - is a new 
entity.  How did you get the details of its account? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It was brought by Mr Majola. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you have any dealings telephonic or in 
person with any person from Isivunosami Trading when this payment 
was made or before or after it? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  We have never met. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you know what … 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 28 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have never met but did you ever speak to them, 
did you ever communicate with them in any manner whatsoever? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did Isivuno Sami Trading ever provide any 
services or work to Isibonelo? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then at paragraph 40 Mr X you begin for 
the first time to deal with the cash withdrawals which I understand from 
your affidavit were also done on the instruction of Mr Majola, I would 
like to take you to those now. 
10 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   Yes.     
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What you recount at paragraph 40 is that there 
was an amount withdrawn from Isibonelo’s account on the 17 t h of April 
2015 for R30 000 and there was an amount withdrawn on the 21 s t of 
April 2015 for R100 000.   Please can you tell us how it came that you 
withdrew those amounts? 
INTERPRETER:   The question was, sorry? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What are the circumstances around the 
withdrawal of those amounts? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    It was requested by Mr Majola. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Both amounts? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes but I am not sure if I am allowed to 
explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can explain. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 29 of 104 
 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    May I place it on record Chair that 
looking at this amount, these are large amounts, in my company we do 
not do such transactions with these large amounts, it’s only up to 
R10 000.   If we are paying that we are doing, we transfer the money, 
hence I am saying it was not for my business, but it was requested by 
him, Mr Majola, to withdraw these amounts because we do not do these 
large amounts, it is only up until R10 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you mean that in your company at Isibonelo you 
don’t do cash withdrawals exceeding R10 000? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No, we don’t do it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you say that these – you say these cash 
withdrawals of R30 000 and R100 000 you say that they were requested 
by Mr Majola, is that because of the large amounts as you say or do 
you have a clear recollection that Mr Majola requested you to withdraw 
these specific amounts? 
INTERPRETER:    Though I don’t understand the last part Chair but 
Chair may I interpret then I will be corrected? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No it’s fine, let’s ask him to repeat himself. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Looking at my statement you will see 
the amount that is always contained in my bank statement, it is not a 
20 
large amount, it is just a small amount of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue Mr X. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    And then if you look at the money 
which has been deposited into our business account from Klomac, and 
the withdrawals, when you add them up together they will give you the 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 30 of 104 
 
amount which has been deposited by Klomac, they will total to that 
amount which has been deposited into our business account by Klomac. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then if we go over to page 12 of your 
affidavit Mr X.   
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes, I am on page 12. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We are going to deal with the next invoice that 
Isibonelo generated to Afrostructures, I would like to take you to that 
invoice, you will find it at page 62, six two. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I am on page 62. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What is the date of that invoice 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    24.06.2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And I see that it is made out to Afrostructures 
and the description of the works is alteration to offices. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is the previous evidence you gave applicable 
to this invoice, insofar as you do not know Afrostructures, you have not 
had dealings with them and Isibonelo did not do work altering any 
offices for Afrostructures? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Confirmed. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then at paragraph 43 you record that 
Isibonelo received the funds from Afrostructures, that’s back in your 
affidavit at page 12. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I see that paragraph. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would like to go then to paragraph 44 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 31 of 104 
 
because you describe there what instructions you received from Mr 
Majola after receiving that payment. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What did you do with the monies that were 
received on 24 July 2015 Mr X? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):   Though I do not have the statement that 
would remind me.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I can take you to it Mr X.   Let’s go to page 6. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I am on page 64. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There are two lines there highlighted in yellow, 
10 
the first reflects a credit into the account, so money coming into the 
Isibonelo account and it indicates that it was from Afrostructures in the 
amount of R917 940.54.   Do you confirm that that money was 
received? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s get the number right.  The amount is 
R917 940.54. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And three lines down on that page there is an 
20 
indication of a cash withdrawal, it appears to be from Richards Bay 371 
and it is in the amount of R60 000, do you recall the circumstances 
around that withdrawal? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What happened? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 32 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Mr Majola requested cash money, cash. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And that appears to have been withdrawn on 
the following day, on the 25 t h of July, is that correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then if you go over to the statement for 
two days later you will find that at page 66. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am on page 66. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There is a highlighted portion there reflecting 
a payment into Sifezakonke Engineering of R600 000 on the 27 t h of July 
2015, do you see that? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see the amount. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What were the circumstances around that 
payment? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I was complying with his instruction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That’s the instruction of Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X then I have to take you to page 68, 
because 68 is a continuation of your bank statement for the ate of 27 
July 2015, do you have that in front of you? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I am on it. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now towards the bottom of that page there is a 
highlighted line, three lines from the bottom, and it reads as follows: 
“See: payment confirmation SMS M Majola.” 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I see that transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And that appears to have taken place on the 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 33 of 104 
 
27 t h of July 2015, do you see that? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can you tell us how this SMS to M Majola 
arose? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I don’t know how it happened in terms of 
how the bank works, I don’t know how it happened. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   But do you have any knowledge of why there 
would be an SMS to M Majola after the R600 000 was paid to 
Sifezakonke? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I wouldn’t know, maybe this was done 
10 
between Mr Majola and my secretary, because I am not good with 
computers, so I don’t know exactly how it happened between maybe my 
secretary and Mr Majola as to how this sms went to Mr Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you know any people with the initial M and 
the surname Majola other than the Mr Majola that you have been 
referring to in your testimony? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  We can then go over back in your 
affidavit to page 13. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   May I have a break? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, I’m wondering whether we should just use 
it as a tea break. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think so Chair, we are quite close. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are quite close to it ja.   Okay, let us take a tea 
break, after all we started earlier than normal. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 34 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is five to eleven now, let us resume at quarter past 
eleven. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let’s proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Mr X can you hear us? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X I am going to continue just going through 
10 
systematically the different invoices and payments and for that purpose 
I would like you to be at page 13 of your affidavit, EXHIBIT DD31.   
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and you describe there at 
paragraph 46 another invoice that Isibonelo issued again to Klomac.   I 
would like to take you to that invoice, you will find it at page 70, seven 
zero. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I am on page 70. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What is the date of this invoice? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   24.08.2015. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X I think the version you’re looking at just 
because of how it is recorded in your affidavit, I think that is a 06, do 
you confirm it’s 24.06.2015. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Confirm yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.   And again can I just get your 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 35 of 104 
 
confirmation that the generation of this invoice followed the process 
that you described to us previous. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And let’s just for the record record it is an 
invoice prepared on Isibonelo Construction letterhead, it is addressed 
to Klomac Engineering and the description of works is perimeter 
fencing for an amount of R400 000, and servicing of air conditioners for 
R401 382. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 28 on mine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Sorry, I misread, that is R401 328, thank you 
10 
Chair. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Confirmed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And again ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Once again do you confirm that the amount of 
R401 328 relates to according to the invoice to servicing air-
conditioners? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I do confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And just to clarify again did Isibonelo ever do 
perimeter fencing work or servicing of air-conditioners for Klomac 
Engineering? 
20 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did you receive the description of works 
for this invoice as you have described previously from Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would then like to return to your affidavit at 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 36 of 104 
 
page 13, paragraph 48. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes, I am on page 13, paragraph 48. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At paragraph 48 you tell us what happened 
with the funds received from Klomac after that invoice was issued and I 
would like to just take you to those bank statements so you can confirm 
for us what happened with the funds.   The first of those you will find at 
page 74.   Page 74. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am on page 74. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will see highlighted there is an entry on 
the bank statement that on the 14 t h of August an amount of R149 000 
10 
appears to have been paid to Isivuno Sami, do you see that? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is your evidence given previously applicable 
here, insofar as the instruction to make that payment to Isivuno Sami 
came from Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then if you go over to page 76, there are 
two transactions that happened three days later on the 17 t h of August 
2015? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I see the amount. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So the first one highlighted there appears to 
have been a cash withdrawal, again at Richards Bay, of R50 000, why 
was that money withdrawn? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I was complying to the instruction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   From whom? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 37 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Mr Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X can you help us there once these 
withdrawals were made how would the cash be given to Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   If I have personally withdrawn the money 
from the account I would call him and tell him that I have withdrawn the 
money he should come. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Would he come to you to collect it? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Interpreter I just want to say if yesterday and 
early this morning it looked like there were challenges in your 
10 
interpretation, I think you have since improved considerably,  you are 
doing quite well now. 
INTERPRETER:   Thank you very much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  Sorry so we were at the 
point at which you indicated that Mr Majola would come to you to 
collect the cash, is that correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you indicated there would be times when 
you withdrew the cash, were there times when other people withdrew 
20 
the cash? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It was myself and my daughter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And when your daughter would withdraw the 
money how would the cash be handed over? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   She would then call him. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 38 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what arrangement would then be made? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   What would happen is my daughter 
would withdraw the money, then call me and inform me that I have 
withdrawn the money.  Then if I am busy I would instruct my daughter 
to call him but most of the times after my daughter has informed me 
that she has withdrawn the money I would then phone Mr Majola 
myself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And would it always be the case that he came 
to you to collect the money? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes, I have never taken the money to his 
10 
house or delivered the money to his house. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did you ever ask what the cash was for? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When your daughter had withdrawn the money would 
she meet with Mr Majola to hand over the cash sometimes or would the 
position be that all the time she would hand over the money to you and 
you would be the one to give the money to Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It wouldn’t happen often that my 
daughter would give the money to Mr Majola, what would happen is she 
would then inform me that she has withdrawn the money and hand the 
20 
money to me, because it would be a large amount, then I would be the 
one who is contacting Mr Majola to come and collect the money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So most – are you saying most of the time Mr 
Majola got the money from you and it was only a few times that he got 
it from your daughter. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 39 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and then I would like to take you to 
the next bank statement that indicates what happened with the money.  
Oh, sorry it’s on the same page, we were at page 76, are you there? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will see the second highlighted entry on 
that page indicates that on the 17 t h of August 2015 an amount of 
R550 000 was transferred to Isivuno Sami.  Can you confirm that that is 
what happened? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see that transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and you can confirm that that is 
what indeed happened, that an amount of R550 000 was paid to Isivuno 
Sami. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And does your previous evidence about the 
process apply that that was done on the instruction of Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Mr X.  We then go to a new entity to 
whom Isibonelo issued an invoice in September of 2015.  It is on the 
20 
29 t h September 2015 but you will find the invoice at page 78, seventy 
eight. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I am on page 78. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What just for the record is the date of this 
invoice? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 40 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am not sure if that is a 20 or 29 of 
09/2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think from your affidavit it indicates it is 
probably 29. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes it is 29, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and again this appears to be an 
invoice issued by Isibonelo to Mndima Civils, is that correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did Isibonelo have any dealings telephonic or 
in person with anyone from Mndima Civils when this invoice was 
10 
generated? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have you ever had any interactions with 
persons from Mndima Civils either before or after the generation of this 
invoice? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us look at what the description of work 
says on this page.   It reflects there building block stores, renovation of 
carpenters workshop and paint roof leak and be price that appears for 
that work is R816 000,90, do you see that? 
20 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did Isibonelo ever perform the work for 
Mndima Civils described in this invoice? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   How did you get the details of Mndima Civils if 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 41 of 104 
 
you had never interacted with them? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It was once again brought by Mr Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  I then want to go to the next 
invoice which now is sent to I think it’s the 4 t h entity we have dealt with 
in these proceedings.   You will find that at page 82, 82. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am on page 82. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   What is the date of this invoice. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   30/09/2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It appears to be the day after the date of 
Mndima Civils invoice we were just looking at which was 29/09/2015, 
10 
correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now this is an Isibonelo Construction invoice 
made out to customer and the name is SSOJV, what does that mean? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I don’t know what it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you don’t even know the entity to whom this 
was made out? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No I don’t know it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the description of works is office 
renovations for which the price charged was R1.5million and surge 
20 
tower refurbishment for R500 000, did Isibonelo perform any of those 
works? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I don’t know this job description. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And can you perform Isibonelo did not perform 
those works? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 42 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No we didn’t do it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And then I would like to move to 
what happened after receipt of the funds, both for the Mndima Civils 
invoice of 29 September and the invoice to SSO which we will 
understand in other evidence is a reference to Steffinuti ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr just to conclude on that 
invoice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you confirm Mr X that the total amount on that 
invoice is R2 280 000? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I do confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the invoice issued by Isibonelo 
Construction to SSOJV? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Ms Hofmeyr.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair.  I would then like to look at 
what happened when those funds were received, but first let’s go and 
look at the bank statements which shows the payment R2 280 000, you 
will find that at page 84, eight four. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am on page 84. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and you will see highlighted on 
that page there is an entry that on the 2 n d of December 2015 an amount 
of R2 280 000 appears to have been paid into the account, and the 
reference there is Steffinuti Stocks/OROJV. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see the transaction. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 43 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, I am sorry, you confirm that the document we 
are looking at is a statement from the Standard Bank account of 
Isibonelo Construction? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   At the time of the issue of the invoice and the 
receipt of this payment did Isibonelo have any interactions or dealings 
with Steffinuti stocks? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Have you ever had any dealings before or after 
10 
with any person from Steffinuti stocks? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would then like to track through the bank 
statements what happens with the money after that amount is received 
and I will draw your attention to page 86. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am on page 86. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you will see there the bank statement is 
continuing on the date of the 2 n d of December 2015, that is the day on 
which  the payment into the account of R2 280 000 was made. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The first highlighted entry on the page 86 of 
EXHIBIT DD31 is a cash withdrawal, again at Richards Bay of R30 000.  
Why was that cash withdrawn? 
MR X (through Interpreter):  It was requested by Mr Majola.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And was it given to Mr Majola? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 44 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And was it given to him in the way that you 
described previously, that you would phone him, tell him that you had 
the cash and he would come and collect it? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then the second highlighted entry on that 
page is a transfer of R400 000 on the same date, the 2 n d of December, 
to what appears to be Sifezakonke Engineer, is that correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see that transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you confirm that that was again in the light 
10 
of your previous evidence on the instructions of Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Then if we go over to page 88 you will see the 
bank statement for the next day, the 3 r d of December 2015. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I am on page 88. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There is a first highlighted entry there of a 
cash withdrawal at Richards Bay of R150 000, why was that cash 
withdrawn? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Mr Majola requested the money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Was the money given to him? 
20 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There is also an entry there of R15 000 of a 
cash, a cheque cashed, is that related to the dealings of Mr Majola? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It could be my cheque because I am 
looking at the entry there, it is cheque cashed, so it could be my 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 45 of 104 
 
cheque. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Right, then let’s go over to page 90, nine zero.  
We are now at the bank statement for the next day, that’s the 4 t h of 
December 2015. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There appear to be two payments that were 
made on this day, in highlighting to Isivuno Sami, there was first an 
amount of R150 000, and then later a further R100.   Can you confirm 
why those amounts were paid to Isivuno Sami on the 4 t h of December 
2015? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It was Mr Majola’s instruction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, if we go over to page 92 we move 
to the 5 t h of December. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes I see. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There is a highlighted cash withdrawal of 
R25 000 at Vryheid, why was that amount withdrawn on that day? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I – I remember this transaction, it was my 
money, the 25 that is reflected as a transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Let us go over to page 94. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry Miss Hofmeyr I wonder whether 
20 
you should not consider later on, highlighting it in a different colour those 
items, those amounts that he says where his. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We will do that Chair.  I think that the evidence 
today has assisted to clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes – yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 46 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So just for the records purposes what we will do 
is, we will retain in yellow highlighting all of those amounts that Mr X has 
confirmed were done on the instructions of Mr Majola 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And where he is confirming his evidence today 
that they relate to his own monies we will make a green highlighting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us then move if we may to page 94, nine 
four. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am on page 94. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   This is a bank statement reflecting transactions 
on the 7 December 2015. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the 7 December was five days after you had 
received the large payment of R2 280 000.00 from Stefanutti Stocks, is 
that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I notice that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And you will see highlighted there in yellow is a 
payment to Sifezakonke of R900 000.00.  What was the circumstances of 
that payment? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):   I was complying to the instructions of Mr 
Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then the last one in the sequence is at page 
96. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see it. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 47 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And now we are on the 8 December, so we are 
six days after receipt of the payment from Stefanutti Stocks and it 
indicates that a million Rand was paid to Isivuno Sami on that day.  What 
were the circumstances of that payment? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Complying once again to the instructions of 
Mr Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X what your affidavit then goes on to explain 
is in that period between the 2 n d December and the 8 t h December 2015 
that we have been looking at,  Isibonelo issued a further invoice to a 
customer identified as SSOJV.  I would like to take you to that invoice, it 
10 
is at page 98 of Exhibit DD(51).  And can I take it then, well, let us first of 
all do the date of this invoice, what is the date of the invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):   06/12/2015, 05 – 05. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  It is 0-5, I think based on your affidavit.  
It was made out to customer SSOJV, when it was made out [intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you get that date right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is 05/12/2015 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think there was a reference to 05. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, oh yes, yes, apologies, and that is 
confirmed at paragraph 57 of Mr X’s affidavit at page 16.  Right, let us 
look at the customer as to whom this was made out.  It was made out to 
SSOJV.  Mr X at the time this invoice was generated did you know who 
SSOJV was? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 48 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the description of the works, again, some 
more parameter fencing it appears in the amount of R895 400.00 and 
pump-station construction built for an amount of R853 107.20, do you 
confirm that is what is reflected on the invoice? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did Isibonelo ever do parameter fencing work or 
pump-station construction for SSOJV or any other entity? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And can you confirm the total amount invoiced on 
10 
this invoice was R1 993 435.01? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then if we go the bank statement that 
reflects the receipt of this payment you will find that at page 100/ 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 100. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can you please indicate from whom this payment 
of R1 993 435, they seem to have left off the one Cent, was received 
from? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Stefanutti Stocks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I think the full entry reads Stefanutti 
20 
Stocks / OROJV, is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   True. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I would then like to look at what happened to the 
funds after they were received in the Isibonelo Business Account with 
Standard Bank, and for that purpose please turn to page 102. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 49 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 102. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There is a highlighted entry there in yellow 
indicating a payment from Isibonelo to Isivuno Sami in the amount of 
R850 000.00 on the 24 February 2016, do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I do see the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what were the circumstances of that 
payment? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Complying to the instruction from Mr 
Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And if we go over the page to page 104. 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 104. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And there is a highlighted entry there in yellow 
indicating a payment from Isibonelo to Sifezakonke ‘Construc’, which I 
think is short for construction of R700 000.00 on the 24 February 2016.  
Do you confirm that that payment was made by Isibonelo to Sifezakonke 
Construction? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I do confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what was the circumstances around that 
payment? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Complying to Mr Majola’s instructions. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then if we go to page 106. 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 106. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will see highlighted there a cash withdrawal 
the following day on the 25 February 2016 at Richards Bay of 
R150 000.00.  Why was that cash withdrawn? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 50 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   Complying to his instruction, that is Mr 
Majola. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And can you confirm that once the cash was 
withdrawn what happened to it? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I called him and informed him that I have 
the money now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And was the money given to Mr Majola? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair we have come to the end of the series of 
payments, both receipts and payments out, but I did neglect to get Mr X’s 
10 
confirmation of the receipt of the Mdima Civils payment, and that you will 
find at page 80, eight zero Mr X. 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 80. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now that was a payment indicated on the 
statement to have been made on the 1 st December 2015  The amount was 
R930 241.02 and it appears to indicate to have been received from Mdima 
Civils, is that the same amount that you invoiced Mdima Civils for, a 
month, on the 29 September 2015?  Let me go to the invoice so you can 
compare it.  The invoice is at page 78, seven eight, and then the bank 
statement is at page 80. 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):   It is the same amount. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you and your evidence in relation to that 
invoice, I take it would be the same, you were told to invoice Mdima 
Civils despite not having any relationship with them.  The Description of 
Works came from Mr Majola, the invoice was generated and then payment 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 51 of 104 
 
was received.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, I would now like to move Mr X to the 
last topic of relevance in your affidavit and you will find that at page 17 of 
the affidavit, which is Exhibit DD(31). 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 17. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now what you say at the bottom of that page in 
paragraph 60 is that you going to deal with three payments that Isibonelo 
received from Premier Attraction 1016 CC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed, okay just continue. 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):   I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed, Miss Hofmeyr I think it would be 
convenient if we can have the total amount of all the amounts that he 
says were paid into Isibonelo’s account in accordance with Mr Majola’s 
instructions and the total amount that was paid out so that we have the 
big picture. . 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Big picture, certainly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is not ready let us do it before he finishes his 
evidence  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, we can certainly do that I will ask my Junior 
20 
and team of Investigators who are assisting us today, to get to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja if they can work – work out so that we have a 
picture of the total amount, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Full picture, indeed.  They can work on that and 
then we will deal with it at the end of the evidence with Mr X.  Thank you. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 52 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   We now move to what you describe in your 
affidavit at the bottom of page 17 as Conduit Payments, and you say that 
you are going to deal with three payments that you received from Premier 
Attraction.  Mr X I would like to take you first of all to the bank 
statements that show these payments into Isibonelo’s account and to do 
that we need to turn first to page 108. 
INTERPRETER:   You said the page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   108. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am on page 108. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Do you see at the bottom there a highlighted 
entry there in yellow, reflecting a payment into Isibonelo’s account on the 
24 t h of October 2015 in the amount of One Million Rand? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now the description for the transaction appears 
on the left-hand side of the page, do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And it reads as follows: IB payment from PA1016, 
do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   When you received this payment into Isinebelo’s 
account Mr X, did you know what PA1016 was? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I did not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I am going to come in a moment to what you did 
learn about that payment but I want to do all three payments first in the 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 53 of 104 
 
bank accounts.  So can we next go to the bank account appearing at 1-1-
0? 
INTERPRETER:   The next one is on page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   1-1-0, one hundred and ten. 
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 110. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will see highlighted there on the statement 
reflecting a transfer into Isibonelo’s account on 11th of December 2015, 
is an amount of R1 150 000.00 do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I see the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And again, the IB payment description indicates 
10 
that it is from PA1016, do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I do see that entry.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   On the 11 t h of December 2015, did you know 
what PA1016 was referring to? 
INTERPRETER:   Is it 2015, or 16.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies, I might have said, when I, December 
of 2015.   
INTERPRETER:   Okay.  [Intervenes] 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   2015.   
INTERPRETER:   2015.  Yes.  The question was, sorry.   
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies, I might have made an error because 
the statement indicates it is from December 2015 to January 2016, but 
this is the date of 11 t h December 2015 and the question was, when this 
payment was received in Isibonelo’s account, did Mr X know what the 
reference PA1016 referred to? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 54 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   I did not know.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And the final bank statement reflecting these 
three payments appears at page one hundred and twelve, 112.   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am on page 112.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There is a first highlighted entry on that page 
reflecting a payment into the Isibonelo account with Standard Bank on the 
2 n d of February 2016 with a payment reference again from PA1016.  Do 
you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I see the transaction.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   On the 2 n d of February 2016 did you know what 
10 
the reference PA1016 referred to? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X, I would then like to return to your affidavit 
at page 18.  That is in Exhibit DD(31).   
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 18.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Now you have testified that when these amounts 
were received in Isibonelo’s bank account, you did not know what the 
reference PA1016 referred to.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is correct.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And if you look at paragraph 61 on page 18 of 
20 
your affidavit. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am looking.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You say there: 
“When I looked at the Isibonelo bank statements 
reflecting these deposits, I noticed, noted that the 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 55 of 104 
 
reference on the payment was PA1016.  I had no 
knowledge when the Commissions investigator, when 
they first showed me these payments, that they were 
made by Premier.  I asked the Commission’s 
investigator to find out what entity paid these 
amounts.”   
MR X (through interpreter):   That is true.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what happened?  What did the commission’s 
investigators then do?   
MR X (through interpreter):   They left with this reference, PA1016 and 
10 
returned with the name of the entity or the company as Premier.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you, and you indicate at paragraph 62 that 
you were shown a spreadsheet.  [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Apologies, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make sure there is complete understanding, 
when you say Premier, you refer to Premier Attraction, is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, you refer to Premier Attraction 1016CC.  Is 
that correct?   
20 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Premier Attraction 1016CC.   
INTERPRETER:   Oh.  It is Premier Attraction 1016CC.   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And you indicate at paragraph 62 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 56 of 104 
 
that you were shown a spreadsheet relating to the three payments that 
had been received from Standard Bank.  I would like to take you to that 
spreadsheet.  It is at page 114.   
INTERPRETER:   Did you say 114?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   114 Indeed.   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, I am on page 114.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is this the document that the investigator showed 
you?   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will see over on the, well, let us deal with 
10 
the first line.  The first line reads:  
“Isibonelo Construction contra details”  
and then the second line,  
“Standard Bank account number”  
And then there is an account number given there.  Is that, what account 
number is that? 
INTERPRETER:   What account number is that, I mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what Ms Hofmeyr wants to know is whether he 
knows whose account number that is.   
INTERPRETER:   Oh.  Oh, okay.  My apologies, Chair.   
20 
MR X (through interpreter):   If it may be read out then I will be able 
maybe to recognize it.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, certainly.  And just for assistance, Mr X, if 
you go back to one of the bank statements of Isibonelo, and you can just 
flip back two pages to page 112.  You will see at the top of that page 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 57 of 104 
 
there is an account number indicated and let me read it into the record.   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is:  
“062014803” 
What account is that? 
MR X (through interpreter):   It is Isibonelo’s account It is my account.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And then if we go back to page 114.   
MR X (through interpreter):   I am on page 114.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   You will see that below those descriptions that 
we have just read into the record, there are three lines dealing with the 
10 
three payments that we have been looking at already in your evidence 
received from PA1016 and if you go right across to the other side of the 
page, you will see a column there that is headed Contra Account Names.  
Do you see that?   
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what is indicated there as the Contra 
account name for these payments?   
INTERPRETER:   Oh.  You mean on the.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   On the far-right hand side.   
INTERPRETER:   I went to the wrong… my apologies.  [Intervenes] 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Oh apologies.   
MR X (through interpreter):   They are too faint.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, I am sorry.  Yes, I am sure- I have 
highlighted them so maybe I can read them into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 58 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And ask whether it ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Confirms what you had told.  So, what they 
read Mr X is for each of the three payments received, the ones that we 
have been looking at previously which bore the reference PA1016.  The 
spreadsheet from the bank indicates that that payment was received 
from a Standard Bank account of Premier Attraction 1016 ta (which 
means trading as) co.  That is all that is entered there.  Does it accord 
with your understanding that this page confirm that the payment was 
made by Premier Attraction 1016? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, that is what the people from the 
Commission explained or said to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time that the Commission showed you 
this information about who had paid these amounts into your account, 
did you know anything else about Premier Attraction, who its owner was 
or who worked in the business? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did the Commission then tell you who they 
have established was the owner of Premier Attraction 1016? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, they did tell me. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who did they indicate that was? 
MR X (through interpreter):  They said one of the partners, it is 
Thalente Myeni. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know Thalente Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I do. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 59 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How do you know him? 
MR X (through interpreter):  He grew up in front of me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in December 2015 and early 2016, did you 
have any business dealings with him? 
INTERPRETER:  2015 till? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To early 2016. 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Around that period did you have any business 
dealings with an entity called Premier Attraction 1016? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Premier Attraction.  Ja, just get it right.  Okay. 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, I would like to return to your affidavit at 
paragraph 18 because on that page you describe a prior dealing you 
had with Ms Duduzile Myeni. 
INTERPRETER:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Page 18.  Mr X, at the bottom of that page you 
talk about some work that you and MS Myeni did around 1997/1998.  
Can you please tell us what that was? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, we met at a company who had been 
20 
groomed as small businesses in that company.  It is called Richards 
Bay Minerals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  There was a reference to young lions or 
something like that.  Mr X what were you talking about in relation to 
young lions? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 60 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  This- it was not amabhubesi.  It is 
businesses, small business so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Hence the interpretation was that is 
where we were being groomed as small businesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay well ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just so that I have it right it was ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  It sounded like (African Language) which would be 
young lions so I was very interested.  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we be clear this was small business 
grooming, not young lion grooming.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And Mr X, you describe over the 
page on page 19 the extend to which you and Ms Myeni worked 
together at that time.  Can you describe that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay we worked together in the 
construction industry.  She then requested me to help her because I 
had a skill and she also had a certain skill.  So, she requested me that 
we team up and work together. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did she come to learn of the details of 
Isibonelo’s bank account in those interactions? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I was working under her as a sub-
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 61 of 104 
 
contractor so when she was making payments to me or to my company, 
she would pay it into my account, Isibonelo account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And you go on at paragraph 65 to 
deal with the time when Isibonelo received these payments from 
Premier.  You have testified about this previously but I would just like 
to get this clear.  At that time did Isibonelo have any business 
relationship with either Premier the entity or Mr Myeni himself? 
INTERPRETER:  Meaning at the time when she was working with Ms 
Myeni? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, at the time that the payments were 
10 
received from Premier. 
MR X (through interpreter):  No, there were no dealings. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you are absolutely certain about that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I am absolutely sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should just say Premier Attraction at least. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we do not want anybody who reads the 
transcripts thinking we are talking about a Premier. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in this Commission it could be the Premier 
so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR X (through interpreter):  No, there was none. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At paragraph 66 Mr X you start to tell us in 
your affidavit what happened after you received these payments into 
the account.  Please can you take us through that?  Oh apologies. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 62 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that, has he confirmed his 
knowledge of the relationship between Mr Thalente Myeni and Ms 
Duduzile Myeni?  If he has not maybe we should get that out of the 
way. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He might not have because the evidence was 
... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because in the affidavit he has got there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The evidence that I think you only testified to 
10 
Mr X was that Mr Thalente Myeni grew up in front of you but let us 
confirm what is your understanding of the relationship between Ms 
Duduzile Myeni and Mr Thalente Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It is her son. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then I was going to move at 
page 19 of your affidavit to the explanation you give of what happened 
after you received these three payments.  Please can you take us 
through that?   
MR X (through interpreter):  Maybe my bank account would remind- 
refresh my mind. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly. 
MR X (through interpreter):  If you make reference to my bank 
account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So, the first amount was received in October of 
2015 and you will find that at page 108. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 63 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now this is the first amount of 1 million rand 
that was received on the 24 t h of October 2015 into the Isibonelo 
account.  What happened after you received that first 1 million? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Can I then once again refresh my memory 
by going back to the statement as to what then happened? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes of course. 
MR X (through interpreter):  After receiving this money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Because it happened long time ago. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because they are three different statements. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I have to refresh my memory. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At least they are three different payments.  Let 
me be clear. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go back to page 20 of the affidavit.   
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 20. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And you will see at the beginning 
of that page at paragraph 68 you indicate there in your affidavit; 
In respect of the first payment of 1 million which was received by 
20 
Isibonelo on 24 October 2015 the following transpired. 
 
And then in 68.1 you record in your affidavit; 
68.1 
Ms Myeni requested that I withdraw these funds and deliver 
them to her in cash. 
 
Do you see that? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 64 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How did she make that request? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I think it was telephonically. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you do pursuant to her request? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I then went to the bank to apply to 
withdraw this money.  And may I Chair place it on record that my bank 
will not allow me to withdraw a million rand.  So maybe I should also 
make reference once again to refresh on my bank account as to how 
did they break it down.  Because they were not going to allow me to 
withdraw a million rand. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, we will come to that in a moment.  What I 
would just like to understand first broadly is the process, right, because 
I understand that your evidence thus far is, you received the 1 million, 
you then were contacted by Ms Myeni and she indicated she wanted 
you to give her cash from that amount.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay we will go to each of the withdrawals in a 
moment.  But generally, how would you get the cash to Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It did not happen for a number of times 
that I would ... (intervenes)  
20 
INTERPRETER:  I hope I got it right Chair. 
MR X (through interpreter):  That I would give her the money.  Most of 
the times I would take it to her house. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And which house was that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  During the period of 2015 she had two 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 65 of 104 
 
houses that she stayed at and then the third one- okay, what happened 
is during that period she had about three houses but she moved out 
from the third one and had now two houses that she lived at. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicated in your evidence a moment 
ago that you would deliver the money to the houses.  Is that correct? 
INTERPRETER:  Is it houses? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How would you ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  African Language.  Okay alright. 
10 
INTERPRETER:  African Language. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How would you drop-off the cash at the 
houses? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Because I would also use her office- 
okay, both houses have offices so I would use her offices sometimes.  
So, what I would do is I would go to the office and hide it but not inform 
the domestic worker about me hiding the money.  Then I would then call 
her and inform her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just want to break that down a bit.  How did 
20 
you get access to the houses? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I had access to both houses in the sense 
that- I have placed it on record Chair, we were very close, our 
relationship was very close.  So, I had access to both properties.  I 
also had access to both offices.  So, I would go and help there and 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 66 of 104 
 
work in the office sometimes so that is how I had access to both 
properties. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then your evidence was that you would go 
into the office and you would hide the money.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you do that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  The reason why I would hide it, it was I 
wanted her Ms Myeni to be the one who is finding the money there 
where I have hidden it not anybody else. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you indicated you would contact her.  
10 
Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I would call her and tell her exactly 
where I have hidden the money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And I also understood your 
evidence earlier Mr X to be that you might have recalled one occasion 
where you actually gave her the money herself?  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did that only happen once? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I do remember handing over the cash to 
her in her hand but it might have been once or twice.  But I do 
20 
remember doing that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can we take it that for the rest you would 
follow this process where you would gain access to the office and then 
hide it and then contact her later? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 67 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you always hide it in her office or in that part 
of the house that she used as her office?  Or would you sometimes hide 
it elsewhere in the house? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would hide it in the place where we use 
it to work where there is files.  We call that an office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you always hide it in the same spot or did you 
change the spot where you hid it? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would change the spot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And did you say that sometimes you would hide 
it in the office in the one house and sometimes you would hide it in the 
10 
office in the other house? 
MR X (through interpreter):  She was not staying in the other house.  
So, she would stay in this one house.  So when she is staying in this 
house and not move her clothes to the other house and staying here, 
we would work from that house office.  Only when she moves then we 
will move the office as well. 
INTERPRETER:  I hope I got it right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the position that during the period that we are 
talking about namely 2015.  At some stage she lived in one house and 
at another stage she lived in another house? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So, it is not that she had two houses to which 
you had access at the same time. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay I would not remember exactly 
because it happened a long time ago.  But in 2015 she was staying in 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 68 of 104 
 
house- I would say house number one.  Then we would work from house 
number one.  During the period of 2015 I think she did move though I 
do not remember exactly when but I think she did move to house 
number two.  Then we would then work from house number two.   
So, the only thing is because it happened long time ago.  So, this 
transaction as to whether they happened at number one from what 
period until when, I would not be able to tell you.  But it happened yes 
at house number one then she moved to house number two.  Then it 
continued- then we continued to work in house number two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, would it be correct to say she used or you used- 
10 
you hid the money in one house at a time and she stayed in one house 
at a time? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to take you Mr X 
to the specific transactions that occurred after you received the first 1 
million on the 24 t h of October 2015.  And for that purpose, the first 
transaction that you identify in your affidavit you will find in the bank 
statement appearing at page 121. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on 121. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just to remember what the timing is.  On 
the- we have looked at the bank statement on the 24 t h of October 2015 
you received the first payment of a million rand from Premier Attraction 
1016.  Do you recall that? 
INTERPRETER:  The date was? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 69 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  24 October. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I remember that one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at page 121 there is an entry 
highlighted three days later on the 27 t h of October 2015 and that is a 
cash withdrawal of 50 000.  Do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was that money withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Ms Dudu gave me instruction to withdraw 
it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you give that cash to her? 
10 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes, I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I confirm it was in one of the two 
methods that you have described either handing it to her herself or 
hiding it at the office of the house she occupied at the time? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct although I do not 
remember exactly how I handed it over to her but it happened either 
way.  It is either I hid it or I gave it to her in person. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then if you go to the next bank 
statement it is at page 123. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 123. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before Ms Hofmeyr I ask the next question.  Mr X who 
came up with the idea that the money should be hidden in her office? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I did not want to be delayed so I am the 
one who came up with that idea of hiding it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you discuss it – the idea with her? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 70 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you just thought of the idea and you hid the 
money and you told her afterwards where you had hidden it? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she was fine with that I hear? 
MR X (through interpreter):  After she has found the money I think she 
was fine with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X if we then go to page 123. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see the next day, it is the first 
highlighted entry on that bank statement.  The next day is the 28 
October 2015 there is a cash withdrawal from Richards Bay of 
R31 500.00, do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I see the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was that money withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  She gave me the instruction, Ms Dudu 
she gave me the instruction to do so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is Ms Dudu Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Duduzile Myeni yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just ask Mr X at this point did Ms Myeni 
give you any explanation for why she wanted these amounts in cash 
withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No – no she did not and I did not ask her 
as well. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 71 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe this is the time to go back to the 
beginning.  Prior to you discovering these amounts that had come into 
your account from Premier Attraction had anybody spoken to you that 
there would be some amounts that would be transferred into your 
account – into your – or company’s account? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you discovered the first payment how soon 
did you discover it after it had been transferred into your company’s 
account if you are able to remember? 
INTERPRETER:  I am not sure if I got the question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let me repeat. 
INTERPRETER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you discovered the first payment are you able 
to remember how long after the payment had been made into your 
account that you discovered it? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I would get the report from my office that 
a certain amount has been deposited into the business account then I 
would then advise them that we remain – come until somebody calls.  
Maybe someone will call me and inform me that they have deposited 
the money into my business account. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I know it is a number of years back Mr X 
but do you recall how soon after you were told the first R1 million had 
been paid into the account that you were contacted by Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Would you please repeat the question? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 72 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am asking whether Mr X remembers how soon 
after he was told the first R1 million had been paid into his account he 
was then phoned by Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Maybe two days.   
INTERPRETER:  Can I just get clarity whether I was looking at the 
account that there is still this money or when Ms Myeni then contacted 
him because I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just ask him to repeat his answer? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  What happened is we would then 
receive this money into the business account.  I will be informed that 
10 
there is money that came into the business account and at that stage 
we do not know who deposited the money.  So until then let us wait 
until I am being contacted as to who deposited the money.  The waiting 
would be about two to three days.  Then indeed the call came. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the way he put it earlier on was that they would 
– that a period of about two days or so would pass while they were 
watching it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And remaining calm I think was the previous 
[indistinct] so I am glad we – we understand what was happening on the 
ground.  Okay thank you Mr X.  Okay so what – and certainly that time 
20 
frame at least accords with what we see happening in the bank 
accounts.  Because it comes in on the 24 October and then the first 
withdrawal you have told us about is the 27 October.  The second 
withdrawal we were dealing with at page 123 was on the 28 October.  
But also on page 123 Mr X there is a transfer highlighted further down 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 73 of 104 
 
on the page of R600 000.00 to an account that you identify in your 
affidavit and you have spoken about previously which was the Money 
Market account.  Can you explain why that R600 000.00 was 
transferred to your Money Market account? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay like I explained initially is that if 
there is a money that does not belong to our company – it is not our 
money but it is in our business account we will then move it to the side, 
that is to the Money account so that we can spend our own money 
without interfering with the other people’s money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that was done it appears from the 
10 
statement at page 123 on the 28 October 2015.  But there was then a 
withdrawal the following day on the 29 October 2015 and I would like to 
go to that.  You will find it at page 127.   
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 127.  I see the withdrawal 
transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what it records there is a withdrawal from 
the business account again the following day of R200 000.00 at 
Richards Bay.  Why was that money withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  He says Duduzile requested the money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was the money given to her in one of the 
20 
two ways you described earlier? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then we move a few further days 
forward in time and that is reflected the bank statement at page 129. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 129. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 74 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this statement reflects that on the 3 
November 2015 an amount of R27 000.00 was withdrawn at Richards 
Bay, do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes I see the transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why was that amount withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It was requested by Sis Dudu. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was it given to Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair there are a few more of 
these transactions relating to the first R1 million.  I see that we are 
10 
close to the lunch break.  So maybe we could just talk for a moment 
about arrangements if that suits? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How far are you from finishing? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am very close.  I need to complete these two 
– this – these transactions related to the first R1 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I need to deal simply with the later 
two receipts of amounts and what happened with them.  So I do not 
imagine taking more than about twenty minutes maximum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is an application that is also going to be 
brought.  We had notice of yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From the lawyers representing Mr Majola. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 75 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I – I have seen that they have come back 
to the hearing room while we have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Having Mr X’s evidence.  We would certainly 
like an opportunity to use the lunch break to receive the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at the application. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Look at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then possibly we can deal with it after we 
complete Mr X’s evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  So we – we should adjourn now.  
Should we resume at two or should we resume a little later than two? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think maybe quarter past two would be 
adequate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe quarter past two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just so that we can… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Properly consider the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give more time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the proposal would be to complete Mr 
20 
X’s evidence and then deal with the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  I think counsel for Mr Majola does 
not have a problem with that? 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 76 of 104 
 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay we – we are going to adjourn now 
and then we will resume at quarter past two.  So Mr X do come back at 
quarter past two.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we must dispose of the postponement 
10 
application … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not need any argument and I 
understand you do not oppose. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We do not oppose it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Counsel for Mr Majola, do you want to come 
forward to the podium and move the application from here? 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  If it so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come here, ja. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Suits Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I understand when you speak from anywhere else 
there is a challenge with recording and transcribing or the recording, 
ja. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Thank you.  Chair, the original Notice of 
Motion was in fact presented to the relevant officials. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 77 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  The prayers are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  In my view with respect … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Comprehensively set out there in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  And it is supported by the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Supporting affidavit of the Instructing 
10 
Attorney of record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes and basically I understand that one, 
because Mr Majola received the affidavit of Mr X only yesterday.  Is 
that right? 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Indeed so.  In fact I saw it after 7 o’ clock 
last night … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  For the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  He - he needs more time … 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Indeed so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To look at it and then to give instructions, but also he 
fell ill … 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  In … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This - today or still yesterday.  I am not sure.  From 
the affidavit it seems that he was seen by a doctor or has been 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 78 of 104 
 
hospitalised since this morning or since yesterday. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Yes.  I was advised … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  If my memory serves me well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Chair.  That he - he fell ill yesterday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  And it is a result of that that we managed to 
procure this medical certificate with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  The view to presenting same today … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  To your good self, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine.  I grant the application for the 
postponement of the hearing of Mr Majola’s evidence to a date to be 
determined.  So the Commission’s legal team will be in touch with you 
about a new date. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  I am truly indebted to you - to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Thank you so much. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Chair, I know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  In the High Court I do not have to ask to be 
excused … 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 79 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  But I think as a courtesy gesture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  I will nevertheless … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Ask Chair if I may please be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused. 
ADV FRANCOIS ROETS:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  If it is convenient we can 
10 
proceed with Mr X’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let - let us proceed.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, can you hear us? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr X, before we broke for the lunch 
adjournment we were at page 22 of your affidavit … 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  Yes.  I am on page 22. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we had dealt with the cash withdrawal of 
R27 000,00 which occurred on 3 November 2015 and that is referred to 
in paragraph 68.11 on page 22 … 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we - I would like us to move to 
paragraph 68.12 and I am going to take you to the relevant bank 
statement. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 80 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now in that paragraph you describe how some 
of the money that you previously tested you had moved to the Money 
Market account then comes back into the business account and I would 
like to just take you to that relevant bank statement … 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you bought back - as I understand 
your evidence at paragraph 68.12 - you bought an amount of 
R280 000,00 back from the Money Market into the current account.  Is 
that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there was a withdrawal a few days 
later in October 2015.  I would like to take you to the statement that 
reflects it.  That is at page 1-2-7. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 1-2-7. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Unfortunately, I made an error there.  Can we 
go to page 1-3-1 please? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 1-3-1. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So this is the bank statement that 
reflects as I understand your affidavit the money that comes back from 
your Money Market account into the business account and you will see 
20 
on that page highlighted in yellow that on 6 November an amount of 
R280 000,00 was transferred from and then there is a long account 
number there. 
That was the previous account number we were looking at 
when there were transactions with the business account - with the 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 81 of 104 
 
Money Market account.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I remember this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
And 
just 
to 
confirm. 
 
That 
was 
on 
6 November 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go over to page 1-3-3.  That is 
the following statement for the same period and what the statement 
reflects is that the on the same day - 6 November 2015 - there was a 
cash withdrawal at Richards Bay of R200 000,00.  Do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was that …? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was that amount withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Duduzile requested that I withdraw the 
money on her order. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is reference to Ms Duduzile Myeni.  Is 
that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then there are further 
transactions that occur on 23 November 2015.  Mr X, I am now referring 
20 
to page 23 of your affidavit … 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 23. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what you detail in that paragraph is again 
money moving back from the Money Market and then funds being 
withdrawn.  I would like to take you to the relevant bank statements. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 82 of 104 
 
You will find the statement at page 1-3-5 of EXHIBIT DD31. 
INTERPRETER:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  1-3-5. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on 1-3-5. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then you see there are two lines 
highlighted there of the transactions in yellow.  The first one is a 
transfer into the business account from that account that we have 
previously identified as the Money Market.  What was the amount that 
was transferred on 23 November into the account?  Thank you. 
MR X (through interpreter):  R20 000,00 and R10 000,00 as well. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  The - the 10 000 is reflected against a 
description that says: 
“Cash withdrawal at Richards Bay.” 
Do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was the R10 000,00 withdrawn? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It is - it is - it can be my money or the 
balance of the money which was remaining in the Money Market 
account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do I understand you to not be certain about 
20 
whether this R10 000,00 was withdrawn for your own purposes or to 
give to Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I do not remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then if we go over to page 
1-3-7.  You will see there that there are two transactions reflected on 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 83 of 104 
 
25 November two days later than the transaction we were just looking 
at and what appears to happen on this page is again a transfer from the 
account we have identified as the Money Market account. 
So an amount comes into your business account of 
R100 000,00 and immediately thereafter there is a cash withdrawal of 
R100 000,00. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I see both entries. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was the reason for the withdrawal of 
the R100 000,00 cash on 25 November 2015? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It was requested by Sis Duduzile. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you certain about that cash withdrawal 
having been a withdrawal that was requested by Ms Myeni? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I am sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what makes you sure? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Looking at the amount. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I - I understood your testimony previously to be 
that you would sometimes have a need for smaller cash amounts in 
your business.  I think you said up to around R10 000,00, but amounts 
greater than that would be amounts that were either requested by 
Mr Majola or Ms Myeni in this case.  Is that correct, Mr X? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, I would then like to move to the second 
two payments that Isibonelo received from Premier Attraction and for 
that purpose we go to page 24 of your affidavit. 
INTERPRETER:  Premier … 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 84 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Attraction. 
INTERPRETER:  Premier Attraction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Now Mr X just to orientate ourselves in 
the chronology.  You will recall that the first payment from Premier 
Attraction was received in October 2015 and what we have just dealt 
with in your evidence is the series of withdrawals in cash that you made 
after receiving that amount and which you have indicated were then 
handed over to Ms Myeni either herself or at the office of her home. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So now I would like to move to the second 
10 
payment that Isibonelo received from Premier Attraction and that was a 
payment we looked at the bank statement previously that was received 
in Isibonelo’s bank account on 11 December 2015.  Do you remember 
that? 
INTERPRETER:  11 December 20 …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  15. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I remember that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as you record at page 24 it was in an 
amount of R1 150 000,00.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now please tell us what happened after you 
received this amount in the Isibonelo account? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I - I think she did call me after the money 
was deposited into the account, because if I remember well it was not 
reflecting exactly where this amount was coming from. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 85 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did she say in that conversation? 
MR X (through interpreter):  She said she will provide me with the 
banking details where I am supposed to transfer this money to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how did she provide those details? 
MR X (through interpreter):  If it was not via the SMS she did give me 
the banking details telephonically. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did you do after you received those 
details? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I then gave them to my secretary for her 
to then deposit or transfer the money to that account. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us look at the bank statement that reflects 
that deposit.  You will find that at page 1-3-9. 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am on page 1-3-9. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, you will see highlighted there in yellow 
again is a transfer out of the Isibonelo account of R1 million on 
11 December 2015 and that was the same day that you received the 
payment we looked at previously of R1 150 000,00.  Is that correct? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see that transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now the description on this payment on the 
bank statement reads as follows: 
20 
“IB payment to Jacob Zuma Foundation.” 
And then an account number.  Do you see that? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr X, on the day that this payment was made 
into the Jacob Zuma Foundation account that was 11 December 2015.  
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 86 of 104 
 
Did you know who those monies were being paid to? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  I did not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did you first learn that the million Rand 
that was paid on 11 December 2015 was in fact paid to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation? 
MR X (through interpreter):  It was when I was approached by this 
Commission as they were investigating about these funds.  I did not 
know at the time and then they went to do investigations and came 
back and gave it a report that it was the Jacob Zuma Fund. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When - when Ms Myeni gave you the account number 
10 
to which you were to transfer this amount.  Did she not tell you who the 
holder of the account was? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I think she only gave us the account 
number without the holder or the name of the holder of the account and 
then my secretary did then process the account or punch the numbers, 
but it is possible that she did see the name of the holder of the 
account, but she did not ask me. 
She might have seen who is the holder - the name of the 
holder of the account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember whether Ms Myeni told you the 
20 
account number telephonically or whether she met with you and gave 
you a document or piece of paper? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I - I do not remember, but there would be 
two ways that she would do it.  If it was not during the telephone 
conversation she would ask me to bring a pen and then to write - for me 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 87 of 104 
 
to write down the account number.  Then it would be via an SMS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it - did she do the same thing when she gave you 
other account numbers?  She - did she give you only account numbers 
and did not tell you the identity of the account number? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I do not remember her giving me the 
name of the holder of the account.  I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In each case? 
MR X (through interpreter):  I am - I am.  I did not get that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Just repeat your answer? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  It would happen in this way Chair.  
10 
During the telephone conversation she would say to me get a pen.  I 
will give the account number or she would forward it to me. 
INTERPRETER:  Can I just get clarity when she - he says forward it to 
me how? 
CHAIRPERSON:  (No audible reply). 
MR X (through interpreter):  Via SMS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So are you saying to the best of your 
recollection whenever she gave you an account number in which to 
transfer money or to put money she would just give you the account 
number without give you the name of the account holder? 
20 
MR X (through interpreter):  Yes.  That is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Were you not keen to find out from her who the 
account holder would be in each case or was it because you were going 
to find out anyway when you make the deposit or transfer? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Okay.  I am - I am not good with 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 88 of 104 
 
technology basically Chair.  Computer and internet I am not good at - 
like I said intentionally.  So when these things would come to me I 
would then hand over these things to the children and then as to how 
they are changing it whenever they only have the account number.  I 
would not know that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you refer to the children are you referring to 
your secretary and your daughter? 
MR X (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the fact that you are not or you would not be 
able to use technology to get the names of the account holders.  I 
10 
would have imagined would have made you more curious and ask her 
who the account holder was. 
MR X (through interpreter):  Well I - I think my - my secretary as she 
was processing the payment or transferring the money she was able to 
see who is the account holder - the name of the account holder, but she 
did not come back to me to report to me that this is what she saw as 
she was processing or transferring the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you - and you did not ask her? 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  It was her money anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I mean you did not ask your secretary who 
20 
the account holder was in each case. 
MR X (through interpreter):  No.  I did not ask her as to who was or 
who is the account holder.  The only thing I wanted to know is that - is 
the transaction finalised.  Is the money transferred?  Then - that is all 
that I asked and she said yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214

CHAIRPERSON:  I get the impression that you were not so interested 
in knowing who the money was being paid to.  Is that right? 
MR X (through interpreter):  Correct, because it was painful or hurtful 
to see the big money coming into our account and then the next thing it 
is going out of your account.  So for me it was like let it go.  I do not 
want to see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr X.  The - I would like to deal with 
the treatment of the second - well the final of the three payments that 
were received from Premier Attraction and you deal with that at page 24 
10 
of your affidavit.  At the bottom of that page you indicate that: 
“On 2 February 2016 Isibonelo received an amount 
of R1 million from Premier …” 
For the record we are going to refer to it as Premier 
Attraction and you go on and say: 
“…and upon instructions from Ms Myeni an amount 
of R800 000,00 was paid out to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation on the same day.” 
I would like us to go to that bank statement - if we may. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    The page is? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   The page is 143. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you confirm what has been said to you as coming 
out of the last paragraph at page 24 Mr X?. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 90 of 104 
 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    124? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   143. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    143, apologies, 143.  I am on page 
143.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X you will be happy to hear that we are on 
the last page of the last annexure of your affidavit so the end is close. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X on this page you will recall we looked at 
the bank statement previously when the million rand comes into the 
account, that bank statement reflected that it came into the account on 
10 
the 2 n d of February, and it appears from this statement that on the 4 t h 
of February, that’s two days later, an amount of R800 000 was paid out 
and the description this time is IB payment to JGZF, do you see that? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes I see that transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Can you tell us again how it came about that 
after receiving the R1million on the 2 n d of February from Premier 
Attraction this amount of R800 000 was paid out to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I got the instruction from Ms Dudu. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did it happen in the same way as the 
20 
previous one where she called you telephonically? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And again how did she relay the details to you, 
did she give you just the account number or did she identify who the 
amount would be paid to? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 91 of 104 
 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    She only gave me the account number 
only. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And at the time did you have any knowledge 
that this payment of R800 000 was going to be made to the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X at the time that the R1million was paid in 
December of 2015 to the Jacob Zuma Foundation and the R800 000 
was paid in February 2016 to the Jacob Zuma Foundation did you have 
any intention to donate R1.8million to the Jacob Zuma Foundation? 
10 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I have never donated money to Jacob 
Zuma Foundation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you ever been asked to make a donation to the 
Jacob Zuma Foundation? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No because I had no money to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X I would now like to deal with the evidence 
that this Commission heard yesterday Mr Talenthe Myeni and I would 
like to have your response to some of that evidence.   I will ask you a 
20 
series of questions about it.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do so Ms Hofmeyr if you are able to now 
you could just let us know what the total is that was received from 
Premier Attraction by Isibonelo, is it three transactions.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   It is three transactions. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 92 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then he can confirm it, or you can do that 
later, as long as you are taking some steps. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair let me – indeed, can I just interpose 
there because you made a previous request that we also do a tracking 
of the total amounts received pursuant to the arrangement of Mr 
Majola.  What I wanted to propose in that regard is there are a number 
of transactions that we need to calculate, and also there have been one 
or two respects in which Mr Majola has clarified in his evidence today 
that amounts that he in his affidavit might have indicated that he 
thought were withdrawals for Mr Majola or Ms Myeni he now recalls 
10 
might have been withdrawals for himself. 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So what we wanted to propose in this regard it 
is an important piece of the puzzle and we would like to take a bit of 
time after today to put together a fully comprehensive supplementary 
affidavit that Mr X deposes to, so that he can have an opportunity to do 
the full tally, do the full account so that there is one record of it, of 
what was paid on instruction and what was otherwise utilised and what 
proportion was VAT as well because we would need to tally it against 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no that is in order. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   An d my proposal is we do that both for the 
payments received pursuant to the arrangement of Mr Majola according 
to Mr X’s evidence as well as the Premier Attraction payments.\ 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s okay. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 93 of 104 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So we will do that and that 
supplementary affidavit will be made available to the Commission.   Mr 
X I would now like to just deal with what Mr Talenthe Myeni said in his 
evidence before the Commission yesterday.  Mr Myeni’s evidence 
before the Commission is that these three payments that Isibonelo 
received from Premier Attraction related to work that Isibonelo had 
done for Premier Attraction around the time that the payments were 
received.    
 
Now what do you say in response to that? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    I have never worked for him. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And do you have any records of invoices that 
Isibonelo may have issued to Premier Attraction for these amounts? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And is it possible Mr X that Isibonelo was 
doing work for Premier Attraction and being owed these amounts of 
money without you knowing that it was doing the work? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think put it differently, the question is whether it 
was possible that Isibonelo Construction may have done work for 
Premier Attraction without him knowing that Isibonelo Construction did 
work for Premier Attraction? 
20 
 
Okay, okay, I think the problem is when you ...[indistinct]. 
 
Okay let’s start again, Mr X is there any work that your 
company Isibonelo Construction, could do for anybody without you 
knowing that your company is doing work for that person? 
MR X  (through Interpreter):    You mean a person would or a company 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 94 of 104 
 
would work using my name or my company’s name and I wouldn’t be 
aware? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is your position in Isibonelo if you are able 
to say that, but if you think disclosing that might not be appropriate for 
your safety then you must tell me but if you feel you can then you can 
tell me. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I am the managing director from the way 
I understand the question.  Well every work for my company comes 
from my office, as like I said I am the managing director so there is no 
work that will be done outside my office for an example that I wouldn’t 
10 
know about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so anyone who gets your company to do work 
for them you would know about that work, is that right? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I hope ... 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   That clarifies it, I am indebted Chair and Ms 
Khumalo thank you.   Mr X Mr Talenthe Myeni’s evidence yesterday was 
effectively that what you are telling the Commission now is a lie, 
because he says that this work was done and as a result of that 
Premier Attraction owed Isibonelo just more than R3million.   In the 
20 
light of that I want to ask you whether your evidence today has been 
untruthful? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   What I am telling the Commission it is 
the truth. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 95 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have any reason not to have kept the 
money if you had done work and had been paid for doing work? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   There would be no reason because I 
need the money so I would have kept it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Mr X is there any way in which you are going 
to benefit from giving the evidence that you have given today? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No there is nothing that I would benefit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And do you lose anything by giving the 
evidence today? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I lose hope for survival, for living.  And 
losing friends, even the community would regard me as a person that 
cannot be trusted because they don’t know the truth. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Mr X has your evidence, giving your 
evidence yesterday and today affected your family in any way? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Too much, they were even afraid to go to 
sleep, waiting for me at the neighbours. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why were at the neighbours? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   They didn’t know what was going to 
happen to me after this. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Mr X you indicated in your in camera 
application to this Commission that your daughter had received a call 
on the 24 t h of January this year.  Can you please tell us about that 
call?   
MR X (through Interpreter):   What happened is after I was 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 96 of 104 
 
approached by the investigating team of the Commission they were 
asking me questions about this monies and then I said please go back 
to those people who were depositing money into my account and ask 
them as to why were they depositing monies into my account.  Then he 
left, he came back after going to find out about why these people were 
depositing money into my account.  That is when the following day my 
daughter received this call from Dudu Myeni to say your father is 
selling us out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how did your family react to receiving that 
call? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   When I related this to my family I tried to 
put it lightly because I don’t want to scare them off, like to scare them, 
so ja that is how I related to my family. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair, those are our questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr X did Ms Dudu Myeni have your daughter’s 
number before this day when she called her.  As far as you know had 
she called her before and so on? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes because we are family or we regard 
each other as family so we do have our children’s contact details as 
well, or phone numbers. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you know for sure that she had called, Ms 
Dudu Myeni had called your daughter before this day? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It may happen that the last call would 
have been two years before that day or a year and a half 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that – are you talking about a call between your 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 97 of 104 
 
daughter Mr Myeni?. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you check the number on your daughter’s 
cell phone by any chance? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   No I didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   Now when these amounts that you had 
testified about were deposited or transferred into your company’s 
account did you say  you never asked Mr Majola why it was necessary 
that these payments should be transferred or paid into your company’s 
account when you really had nothing to do with them? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Like I said yesterday as we were having 
this conversation myself with Mr Majola I was probably said I would go 
and work on the site, number two if there is no money coming into my 
account that money is looked at as turnover and it improves the grading 
of my company, they call it CIDB, so that money improves, the grades 
that start from 1 to 9 DB, so it improves the grading of my company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you talk about those payments improving the 
grading of your company, do you mean that your company would be 
seen as doing business that involves large transactions? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so are you saying that that is what Mr Majola 
said namely these amounts would be paid into your account so that 
your company’s grading could be improved or are you saying that that 
simply the benefit that you saw for your company were in regard to 
these payments. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 98 of 104 
 
MR X (through Interpreter):   It was the way I viewed it that it would 
benefit me that it would upgrade the grading of my company or improve 
the grading of my company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I recall correctly you said yesterday that your 
attitude was that the payment of these amounts into your company’s 
account was wrong, am I correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   I did explain as to why I said it was 
wrong, if I remember yesterday I did respond to that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he means he could explain now if he can be 
given the context of how he came to give that answer yesterday. 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   If the question can be repeated again 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I asked you yesterday whether you thought 
there was anything wrong with your company receiving these payments 
that Mr Majola had arranged with you would be paid into your company.  
Do you remember me asking you that question? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes, I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right to think that your answer was that you 
thought these payments were wrong, receiving these payments was 
wrong? 
20 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes.  The reason – can I explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, why did you think it was wrong? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Okay, if you could remember I was 
hoping that I will visit the site, the work for this money which was 
coming into my account every now and again but my visiting or going to 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 99 of 104 
 
work at the site was – kept on being postponed, so now I was receiving 
this money without having seen the actual work that was done for this 
money which was being deposited into my business account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right to think that you thought that this was 
something that should not be happening, namely payment of these 
amounts into your account in circumstances where you had done any 
work? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes you are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why didn’t you at any stage say to Mr Majola I think 
this is wrong, please don’t – let us not continue with this arrangement? 
10 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Like I said yesterday to him this 
business was – this thing was already going on, so to him if I said to 
him let this stop it would have been like I am being jealous of him if I 
stopped it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then let’s talk about the payments from Premier 
Attraction. 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I think you said that prior to you becoming 
aware of the first payment into your company’s account, the money 
from Premier Attraction you were not aware or nobody had spoken to 
20 
you to alert you that some payment would be made into your account? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after you had become aware you said you did get 
a call from Mr Myeni is that correct? 
MR X (through Interpreter):   Yes. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 100 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know it is – it is many years ago but I would like you 
if you can to cast your mind back to that conversation that you had with 
her and try and tell me exactly how that conversation went. 
MR X (through interpreter):   Okay, I would honestly need help because 
I am not sure if the number I am using currently is the number I was using 
when she called me so I will have a problem with that which phone 
exactly or phone number basically that I was using then when I received a 
call because I had to change numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what I wanted is, if you are able to help me, is just 
the content of the discussion.  She called you, what did she say as much 
10 
as, tell me as much as you can remember?  I accept that you might not 
remember a lot about the conversation but tell me as much as you can as 
to how that conversation went? She called you, what did she say? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Maybe if I can go back to my office 
something can bring back my memory but right now, I do not remember 
the content.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but you have told us something that she 
told you in that conversation, is it not? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Okay, like I said, there was money which 
was deposited into a account, it was one million, literally we sat down 
20 
and we looked at it, waiting to hear where this money was coming from 
because there was no reflection where this money was coming from.  Two, 
three days after, then Miss Myeni called us and asked me did you see the 
activity in your account?  There is money which came into your account.  
So she was asking as to whether did I see that money. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 101 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is helpful.  So, she asked you whether 
you saw some activity into in your account right? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And what did you say in response? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Then I think what happened next was to 
wait for her, I think there was an arrangement now as to how this money 
was going to get to her, because it was her money which was deposited 
into my account so I was waiting for her to instruct me on how, what to do 
with the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did she say that she was talking about the money that 
10 
came from Premier Attraction, or did she not mention the name of the 
company? 
MR X (through interpreter):   She just said did you see that there was 
money which was deposited into your account? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you say yes, you saw? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, we saw it, it is in the account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did you know which amount she was talking 
about?  Which money there that had come in which she was talking 
about? 
MR X (through interpreter):   I know that, basically I know the 
20 
references of the people that I have worked for or worked with.  This one 
it was money that I did not know where it was coming from, but the 
reference was PA1016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the, but in the end both of you were quite clear that 
you were talking about the same amount? 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 102 of 104 
 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes.  That is correct.  The fact that she 
persuaded to get this million, I did not have it so yes I did not have the 
million, so it was clear that it was her money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time when on the two occasions that you say she 
asked you to pay the money into an account which later turned out to be 
the account of the Jacob Zuma Foundation.  Was your company in a 
financial position where it could have donated the amounts that you 
transferred into the Jacob Zuma Foundation account? 
INTERPRETER:   Did your company, I did not get that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was your company financially in a position to make a 
10 
donation as large as the donation, as the amounts that you, you paid over 
to the Jacob Zuma Foundation? 
MR X (through interpreter):   When my-my-my company’s account at that 
time when I received this million, had a balance of -840. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And its situation had not changed substantially when 
the second amount came in that you were asked to pay over to the Jacob 
Zuma Foundation? 
MR X (through interpreter):   No, it did not change. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Miss Hofmeyr, anything? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   No Chair, not at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr X, we have come to the end of your evidence.  Later 
on I will weigh up your evidence together with the evidence of any other 
person who may come and give evidence on the matters on which you 
have given evidence.  At this stage I cannot say what the truth is because 
I must still hear other Witnesses.  But I do want to thank you for coming 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 103 of 104 
 
to the Commission to give evidence and assist the Commission even 
when you were, you felt that your safety and that of your family was under 
threat.  The Commission will do everything it can to make sure that you 
are provided with protection, obviously it can only go up to a certain point 
but it will do everything that it is able to do and I also just want to tell 
you that we need more South-Africans who will come and assist the 
Commission and give Evidence, even if there may be threats to their 
safety and their lives.  But we do appreciate that it is not always easy, 
but to those who do come despite those situations we are deeply indebted 
and we appreciate it and we just want you to know, you and your family to 
10 
know that the Commission is grateful that you were able to come and give 
evidence despite the situation that you have described.  If later on we 
need you to come back, we will ask you to come back and I hope you will 
be able to come.  You understand? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much you are now excused. 
MR X (through interpreter):   May I say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes – yes sure. 
MR X (through interpreter):   I would like to say this to the community 
members where I stay.  My Sisters, my Children, my Friends, I did not 
20 
come here to sell out anyone.  I was forced by the statement which was 
brought to me by the Commission.  I could not change it but I had to tell 
the truth.  I could not change it.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is that all you wanted to say? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Yes, that is correct. 
18 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 214 
 
Page 104 of 104 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anything else that you might not have been 
asked which you feel you would like to say in regard to any of the matters 
that you have dealt with? 
MR X (through interpreter):   Nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you, you are excused.  Yes Miss Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think that is us for the day, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I thought we would finish at three. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes, Chair I have given up estimating time, I told 
my learned Junior that he must just stop me, I must give no expectation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but it is okay.  Tomorrow who is our Witness? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair, tomorrow there is another In-Camera 
application which will need to be dealt with initially and then there are 
Witnesses dealing with State Security matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay no that is fine.  Shall we start at normal 
time? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I think normal time should be fine Chair, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. Okay we will adjourn then for the day and 
tomorrow we will start at normal time, namely 10 o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 19 FEBRUARY 2020
