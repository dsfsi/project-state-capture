ADV CHASKALSON SC:  For most of this morning’s 
testimony Chair we will be concerned with Bundle 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Powell can I ask you first just 
to confirm under oath that the three reports that I have 
described to the Chairperson were prepared by your team.  
The first one at page 82 of Bundle 1 and that was 
submitted to the commission if I remember correctly on the 
11 August. 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The second at page 375 of 
Bundle 1 and it is if I remember correctly it was submitted 
20 
on 9 September of this year 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the third at Bundle 2 page 3 
which was submitted at – in – was it November the 11 t h this 
year? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312

MR POWELL:  Correct that was just recently Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just have to raise your voice Mr 
Powell. 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise I cannot hear.  Ja. 
MR POWELL:  I do confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Powell your affidavit appears

MR POWELL:  Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And in paragraphs 1 to 9 you 
describe 
who 
you 
are 
– 
can 
you 
briefly 
tell 
the 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson do you want to do the 
formalities first? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I have done it again.  Can we 
admit 
the 
affidavit 
of 
Mr 
Powell 
together 
with 
the 
20 
supporting reports as Annexure BB2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  But let us just 
confirm.  Mr Powell look t page 75 is that your signature at 
the top there? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 7 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you deposed to this affidavit before 
a Commissioner of Oaths? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that the affidavit starting at 
page 71 is your affidavit and its contents are to the best of 
your knowledge and belief true and correct? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We – Mr Chaskalson you would 
like me to admit it as Exhibit? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  BB2 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  BB2. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And I am in your hands Chair as 
to whether … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the annexures are part of the affidavit 
– are annexures to the affidavit then we do not have to 
admit them separately.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  They … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if they are separate then we have to 
admit them separately. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  They are referred to in the 
20 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And they are part of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we will just – so it will be BB2 – 
BB2 only or BB2 point something? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 8 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let us make it BB2.1 in case 
there is a need for an additional document to be put to Mr 
Powell in the course of his testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay the affidavit of Mr Steven 
David 
Powell 
starting 
at 
page 
71 
together 
with 
its 
annexures is admitted as Exhibit BB2.1.  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Powell can 
you briefly describe to the Chair your qualifications and 
your place at present employment? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Certainly.  Chair I hold the 
10 
degrees BProc, LLB attained from the University of Cape 
Town and I was admitted as an Advocate at the Cape Bar 
in 1991.  For the past sixteen years I have been an 
executive in the law firm ENS Africa and a role that I play 
as an executive at ENS Africa is I head up the forensic 
services division.   
I am the Managing Director of ENS Forensics PTY 
Limited a subsidiary of ENS Africa.  I started my career 
Chair as a Prosecutor in the Magistrate’s Court in Cape 
Town and I moved to Regional Court and I ended my career 
20 
as a Prosecutor in the office of the then Attorney General.  
I spent eight years as a Prosecutor.   
After that I moved to the Auditing firm Deloitte Chair 
and I headed the forensic services of Deloitte in the 
Western Cape for six years and I was a partner at Deloitte 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 9 of 225 
 
and for the last sixteen years I have been at ENS Africa.  
Thank you Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Mr Powell.  Now your 
evidence today is going to concern matters relating to 
EOH. Some of the background to your involvement at – 
with EOH has been dealt with by Mr van Coller who 
testified on Monday.  But can you very briefly turn to 
paragraph 14 of your affidavit on Bundle 1 page 72 and 
very briefly just describe to the Chair how you became 
involved in EOH and what the nature of your investigation 
10 
there was? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Mr Chair we had been providing 
services to EOH prior to February 2019 when drama 
emerged 
with 
Microsoft 
and 
we 
had 
been 
providing 
Governance 
Compliance 
support 
and 
some 
ad-hoc 
investigative work.   
 
But in February 2019 when Microsoft served a 
notice of cancellation of the appointment of EOH as a 
reseller of Microsoft products it caused a significant 
concern to the business and I was mandated by Mr van 
20 
Coller to do a comprehensive investigation. 
 
Prior to that we did not have access to the EOH 
server; we could not just look at emails; data of everyone 
and – in the business but we received an unfettered 
mandate to get to the bottom of what had happened and we 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 10 of 225 
 
were asked specifically to focus on the Microsoft contract 
at the Department of Defence and just before that Mr van 
Coller had mandated us to look into concerns that had 
come to his attention at the Department of Water and 
Sanitation 
and 
we 
then 
conducted 
an 
extensive 
investigation where we had unfettered access to the 
mailbox server of EOH and we then conducted a multitude 
of interviews with personnel to try get the bottom of what 
had happened. 
 
We 
also 
conducted 
an 
extensive 
data 
review 
10 
reviewing 
information 
on 
the 
system 
related 
to 
the 
Department of Defence and very soon after initiating that 
investigation 
we 
confirmed 
that 
there 
had 
been 
irregularities in respect of the Microsoft contract and Mr 
van Coller asked us to look at all the significant public 
sector contracts to make sure that similar issues did not 
exist in other contracts as well. 
 
And during the course of our investigation we did 
flag concerns that we had which I will elaborate on further 
in my evidence Chair that the issue related to the City of 
20 
Johannesburg.  We identified a range of concerns and 
irregularities 
and 
we 
were 
then 
contacted 
by 
the 
commission to ask if we will share some of the details and 
we were asked to look at certain persons that were of 
interest to the commission which includes the current 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 11 of 225 
 
Executive Mayor Mr Geoff Makhubo as well as a gentleman 
by the name of Patrick Makhubedu and then entities by the 
name of Molelwane Consulting and Molelwane Holdings 
and another entity by the name of Zylek. 
 
I do want to emphasise and perhaps it is opportune 
just to mention there are some limitations in the work that 
we have done Chair because EOH is a company of 
companies at various stages the business had more than 
275 subsidiaries in it.  They did not at all times have a 
centralised accounting system.  They have a system called 
10 
the Infor System.   
We have been able to analyse information on the 
Infor System from 2013 to 2018.  Most of the irregularities 
that we have identified occurred in a small time frame 
Chair and that time frame was 2014 to 2017.   
And it is quite interesting Chair that when the media 
starting zooming in on irregularities at EOH the mischief – 
the misconduct seemed to curtail.  So the media definitely 
had a positive influence and it coincided when the analysis 
in the media focussed on the Gupta’s and that seemed to 
20 
curb the illicit activities that were going on at the group. 
 
Chair I mentioned the limitations because we also – 
I do want to emphasise that some of the entities that we 
have investigated such as Zylek, Geoffrey Makhubo were 
not 
part 
of 
our 
initial 
investigation 
but 
when 
the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 12 of 225 
 
commission asked us because we have access to the EOH 
data and server we were able to extract a lot of information 
and I think that information is helpful to the commission 
and that will be part of my testimony today.   
But I do want to highlight that we have not had 
access to Mr Makhubo’s data per se.  We have got what 
communications he had with EOH people on the EOH 
system and we have got details of payments made to 
Molelwane and to Mr Makhubo from what we could gather 
from the EOH server. 
10 
 
We can see our analysis that Mr Makhubo has gmail 
addresses and we may not have access to all of the 
information.  So I just wanted Chair to be aware that there 
were limits to what we did and we have gone out of our 
way to assist the commission by doing an extensive data 
review 
to 
identify 
correspondence, 
payments 
etcetera 
linked to the individuals that were of interest to the 
commission.  Thank you Mr Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Mr Powell.  Before we 
get to the Johannesburg – or the issues relating to the City 
20 
of Johannesburg I just want to take you to paragraph 27 of 
your affidavit page 74 Bundle 1 where you speak about a 
Mr Jehan Mackay.  Can you tell the Chair who Mr Mackay 
was or is? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair.  Mr Mackay was the head of 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 13 of 225 
 
the public sector vertical team at EOH and he was also the 
Managing Director of a company called TSS MS.  Mr Chair 
I will in my testimony refer extensively to Mr Mackay and 
you will see that he features in quite a few emails and 
documents that we will draw the commission’s attention to. 
 
He 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
role 
players 
in 
the 
irregularities that I will be highlighting today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson you might wish just to 
give a spelling – spelling of some of the surnames for – to 
– for the convenience of the transcribers.  Ja at least now 
10 
that there are some of – as they get mentioned. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I will do that Chair.  Jehan 
Mackay as I understand if J-e-h-a-n first name and the 
surname is M-a-c-k-a-y.  At paragraph 28 you talk about 
suspicious payments from an FNB account belonging to Mr 
Mackay.  Can I ask you first how did you discover those 
payments? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Chair we had full access to the 
mine cost server and attached to email correspondence 
that we analysed the bank statements for a window period 
20 
of Mr Mackay were on the server and we analysed those 
statements and we identified payments to a number of 
politically exposed persons and we have shared that with 
the commission. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you take the Chair through 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 14 of 225 
 
that table of payments in paragraph 29? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair.  The table in paragraph 29 
is an analysis.  This is an extrapolation of an analysis that 
we conducted on Mr Mackay’s FNB bank statement and 
Chair you will see that it starts on the 26 May 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to clarify Mr Powell.  So the FNB 
account number that appears on the extreme left that is 
whose account? 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
Correct 
Mr 
Chair 
that 
account 
we 
ascertained belongs to Jehan Mackay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR POWELL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR POWELL:  The table sets out payments that we 
identified and extrapolated from his bank statements 
starting on 26 May 2015 until 29 June 2017.  And this was 
from his personal bank account and it kicks off on 26 May 
with the payment in the amount of R80 000.00 and this was 
made to an FNB account with a reference NG and the NG 
is repeated Chair I do not know why the NG is repeated but 
20 
it is as it was stated on the reference NG NG Kodwa.  
 
And then on 13 July 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But before you leave that – that 
reference Chair if I can for convenience sake direct you to 
the relevant pages in the bundle if you can annotate the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 15 of 225 
 
table where the relevant bank statements are.  That first 
entry is to be found at page 700 of Bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Page 700? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But Mr Powell were you able to 
identify who the recipient of this payment was? 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair it appears to be Mr Zizi 
Kodwa 
who 
I 
understand 
is 
the 
Deputy 
Minister 
of 
Intelligence in the current government. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you tell the Chair this is 
a payment in 2015.  What was Mr Kodwa’s position in 2015 
– are you aware of that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether you… 
MR POWELL:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are aware… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Chair I have that here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what position.  Oh you need to check. 
MR POWELL:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I think it is a matter of 
20 
public record Mr Kodwa was not in government in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But he was a spokesperson for 
the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 16 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:  Correct Mr Chair I do confirm we had – 
when we did our intelligence checks we did identify he was 
spokesman for the ANC.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The second – the second 
reference?  And Chair the bundle reference for the second 
reference for the statement is page 704. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR POWELL:  Chair the second reference is on 13 July 
2015.  There was a payment of R45 00.00 also referenced 
to NG NG Kodwa. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The third reference which Chair 
is at page 708 of the bundle in its original statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that can I just check Mr 
Powell whether as you understand the position NG are 
initials or what is it?  I just see that the N is capital letter 
but the g is small letter.  Normally one would write initials 
in capital letters.  Do you know or you do not know? 
MR POWELL:  I do not know Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MR POWELL:  It is odd and you will see when we deal with 
20 
number 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR POWELL:  There is SG Sintwa and I understand that 
Mr Sintwa at the time is described in the media a personal 
assistant to Jacob Zuma and we know that he was an 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 17 of 225 
 
advisor 
to 
Mr 
Zuma 
and 
there 
was 
a 
payment 
of 
R50 000.00 on that date of 12 September 2015 also from 
Mr Mackay’s personal bank account and Chair you will see 
that the initials seem to be repeated.  There it is Mr 
Siyabulela Sintwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and Sintwa is S for Sugar –i-n-t-w-a 
and there is JM in brackets after the surname. 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair I assume the JM is Jehan 
Mackay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I wonder if it might be 
convenient for me to give you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  All of the references. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that we do not interrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it would be – ja it would be. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So the first – the first is 700 – 
page 700.  The second is 704.  The third is 708.  The 
fourth is 713.  The fifth is 713 as well as is the sixth.  
20 
Seventh and I am now at 3 November is 717.  The eighth 
also – 5 November is 717.  The ninth at 26 November is 
717.  The tenth at 28 November is 717.  Then 4 December 
is 722.  18 December is 722.  2 February is 727.  27 
January is 737 and 29 June 731. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 18 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Powell you were – you just 
finished the third entry I think the 12 September entry. 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair.  The next entry is 7 October 
2015.  There was a payment of R21 600.00 to the FNB 
account of Mr Sintwa.   
 
The next date is 19 October there was a payment of 
R20 000.00 to the FNB account of Mr Sintwa. 
 
And on 29 October 2015 there was another payment 
of R50 000.00 to Mr Zizi Kodwa – NG Kodwa. 
10 
 
Again on 3 November 2015 there was a payment of 
another R50 000.00 to Mr Kodwa. 
 
And on 5 November 2015 there was a payment of 
R50 000.00 to Mr Sintwa. 
 
On 26 November 2015 there was a payment of 
R30 000.00.  It is referenced as FNB and it has the number 
OB000000282 April Streetwise [Zizi] and that appears to 
also be a payment to Mr Kodwa Chair. 
 
On 28 November 2015 there was a payment of 
R50 000.00 to Mr Kodwa again. 
20 
 
And on 4 December there was a payment of 
R40 000.00 to Mr Kodwa. 
 
And on 18 December 2015 there was a payment of 
R100 000.00 to Mr Siyabulela Sintwa. 
 
On 2 February 2016 there was a payment of 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 19 of 225 
 
R30 000.00 to Mr Zizi Kodwa. 
 
On 27 January 2017 there was a payment of 
R50 000.00 to Mr Sintwa. 
 
And the last entry Chair is 29 June 2017 there was 
a payment of R500 000.00 to the FNB bank account of Mr 
Nkabinde and this is referenced {JM} and it is referenced 
as loan.  So half a million is the last entry. 
 
Chair we identified that at the time Mr Nkabinde 
appears to be Mr Reggie Nkabinde and he was the 
Treasurer of the ANC Youth League – ANCYL.  Thank you 
10 
Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Powell when you looked at the 
bank statements of Mr Mackay did you notice any patterns 
relating to the periods around the time in which these 
payments were made on the statements themselves? 
MR POWELL:  Correct Mr Chair.  Very often the payments 
seemed to follow a deposit of a similar amount or a larger 
amount just prior to the transfer to the individuals that I 
have listed and many of those were referenced as transfers 
from TSS Tactical Software Solutions. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry.  Just repeat – you say 
the payments which are reflected in this table seemed to 
happen immediately after what? 
MR POWELL:  They were deposits into Mr Mackay’s bank 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 20 of 225 
 
account – electronic transfers to his account Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR POWELL:  And most of these seemed to come from an 
entity named TSS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so first Mr Mackay would 
received deposits into his account. 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then these payments would happen? 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair but that seemed to be the 
pattern. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That seemed to be the patters.  Okay 
alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you tell the Chair who 
TSS are? 
MR POWELL:  Ja.  TSS was a company and I refer to Mr 
Mackay as the Managing Director of TSS MS Chair.  This 
was a company that was acquired by EOH Group in 2011.   
So it was part of the EOH stable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And from whom was it acquired? 
20 
MR POWELL:  It was acquired from Danny and Jehan 
Mackay.  Danny is Jehan’s father Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And just to give the Chair an 
example of this phenomenon that you are describing can I 
ask you to turn to Bundle 1 – sorry Bundle 1 page 722. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 21 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And on Bundle – on page 722 are 
two of the transactions that you have already described to 
the Chair for December there is a payment of R40 000.00 
referenced NG Kodwa / 12.   
 
And 
on 
18 
December 
there 
is 
a 
payment 
of 
R100 000.00 referenced Mr Siyabulela Sintwa. 
 
Can you look at 8 December? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And just tell the Chair what you 
10 
see there? 
MR POWELL:  Chair it reflects an FNB QB transfer and the 
reference – the description column refers to transfer TSS 
JM.  And then there is a figure of half a million that comes 
in Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the table at 722 reflects a transfer or 
transfers from whose account?  From Mr Mackay’s personal 
account? 
MR POWELL:  Correct – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay to the accounts of the different 
20 
people. 
MR POWELL:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR POWELL:  And Chair the pattern referred to is that 
generally when these payments are made to the politically 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 22 of 225 
 
[00:29:19] person there is a larger deposit just preceding 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And it comes from the same 
source? 
MR POWELL:  Correct.  They seem to – to often come from 
TSS Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  In other words I guess 
what you are saying is one were to sit down and look at the 
different tables that you have indicated one will – and look 
at dates one could see a deposit going into Mr Mackay’s 
10 
personal account coming from – and then immediately or 
soon thereafter transfer into the account in one or other 
exposed, politically exposed person. 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, we are now going to 
move to matters relating to the City of Johannesburg.  And 
before we get into particular tenders.  I would like you to 
take the Chair briefly through a description of the who 
players, we are going to be seen, are.  And if I can ask you 
20 
to go to your first report at telephone numbers 1, page 84 
where you start doing that. 
MR POWELL:   Just let me check.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At 4.1, you describe TSS Managed 
Services but you have already explained to TSSR to the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 23 of 225 
 
Chair.  At 4.2, you deal with Mr Patrick Makhubedu.  Can you 
explain to the Chair who Mr Makhubedu is? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  Mr Makhubedu is a former 
employee of EHO.  We understand that he was employed at 
the TSS Group from 1 December 2007, initially in Business 
Development and then later as a General Manager, Sales. 
 
After EOH required TSSMS, Makhubedu’s employment 
was transferred to EOH on 1 March 2014.  Makhubedu was 
employed at EOH as Business Development Executive in the 
Public 
Sector, 
working 
closely 
with 
Jehan 
MacKay.  
10 
Makhubedu resigned from EOH with immediate effect on 
11 March 2019.  And Mr Chair, what is quite interesting is, 
we had invited him to a discussion.   
 
We wanted to interview him and that interview was 
supposed to take place at eight o’clock on the Monday 
morning and he resigned on the weekend and back dated his 
resignation to the Friday.  And he refused to engage with us 
at all. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now you have spoken about his 
position being Business Development Executive in the Public 
20 
Sector.  Can you explain to the Chair what Business 
Development embraces?   
MR POWELL:   Business Development is Marketing.  It is 
finding opportunities and expanding on existing contracts.  
And we saw that Mr Makhubedu was integral to a number of 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 24 of 225 
 
relationships at the City of Johannesburg and he seemed to 
win a lot of businesses for EOH at the City of Johannesburg. 
 
Chair, I will elaborate on some of the methods that were 
used to win business which was not quite savoury. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will get to that in detail in due 
course.  Let us continue through the list of individuals who 
we will be describing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Chaskalson, I am sorry.  I just 
want to mention that in the context of another work stream, a 
witness who gave evidence here, I think Mr Sodi.  He said 
10 
that his then business partner, Mr Mpambani, said that he 
wanted to unlock business opportunities in the Provincial 
Government of the Free State for their joint venture. 
 
So 
was 
this 
some 
kind 
of 
unlocking 
business 
opportunities? 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...position did it entail? 
MR POWELL:   I see the Business Development as exactly 
that.  Unlocking opportunities ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR POWELL:   ...at the City of Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   ...diverse(?) identities(?) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 25 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson, I am sorry I interrupted 
you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Not at all Chair.  At paragraph 51, 
you 
refer 
to 
Mr Makhubo 
and 
his 
relationship 
with 
Mr Makhubedu that you have been able to see from the 
outside.   
 
Can you tell the Chairperson what you know about 
Mr Makhubo and what his commercial relationships with 
Mr Makhubedu are ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair.  Makhubedu and Makhubo 
10 
are linked to a number of entities.  Some of these entities 
financially transacted with one another, including Molelwane, 
Mr Makhubedu’s 
consulting 
business. 
 
There 
was 
a 
gentleman by the name of Reno Neil Barry who was integral 
in a number of these financial transactions. 
 
Chair, it is also important to identify Mr Barry because 
he will feature in one of the business partners that seems to 
have 
been 
used 
extensively 
for 
concealed 
and 
illicit 
payments, which I will elaborate on further, later in my 
testimony. 
20 
 
Barry is the former Group Financial Manager at Tactical 
Software Systems (Pty) Ltd.  So he also worked for what is 
known as TSS. 
 
Barry provided accounting services from time to time to 
various of these linked entities, including Zylek.  Zylek is a 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 26 of 225 
 
entity which reflects Patrick Makhubedu as a key-principle 
Chair. 
 
Molelwane, an entity by the name of Mfundi Mobile and 
then Prime Molecular and Grass Farms.  Email evidence that 
we were able to analyse, indicates that Barry made a number 
of payments, including to Molelwane at the instructions of 
Patrick Makhubedu. 
 
The emails that we will elaborate on further in my 
evidence Chair, also suggest that Barry assisted Makhubedu, 
Makhubo and Makhubo’s wife in their personal tax matters.  
10 
He was the accounts and preparing their tax affairs. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If I can then take you over the 
page to page 86.  You have a table of entities that will 
feature or that you described.  You touched on Zylek.  But 
can you say something about Molelwane Consulting? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, if I may, I am going to take 
you from the table to the documents because when we do 
these investigations, we use the Sub-C documentation as a 
Windeed and Sub-C documents.   
 
The first one is Molelwane Consulting CC.  Chair, you 
20 
will find that in Bundle 1 at 163.  So I think what I will do is, I 
will go to 163 and then...  Sorry.  And it is the FOF-163, 
Chair. 
 
You will see that this is a Windeed company report.  It 
reflects Molelwane Consulting, status in business. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 27 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just give the Chair the 
date of that report because it may become significant later? 
MR POWELL:   Right at the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is at the top. 
MR POWELL:   Yes.  The dated requested was 2020, 
July 7t h.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And the info comes from the CIPC, Chair.  
And it reflects Molelwane Consulting as in business and its 
registration date was 1997.   
10 
 
Chair, so I think what Mr Chaskalson was alluding to is, 
this was a recent cheque that was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   So it was July of this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR POWELL:   And it reflects the members as Makhubo, 
Matlekale(?) Florence.  And then it has got a number of 
inactive – as an active director.  And I cites an ID number of 
7408010558082.  And she is described as an active member.  
The inactive members are Lynette Ruth Fox and it is status 
20 
is resigned.  And then Makhubo Moloantoa Geoffrey, status 
resigned.  Makhubo Tebogo(?) Clive. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, before you move to 
Mr Makhubo.  Can you just record the dates that CIPC 
reflects his resignations having taken place? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 28 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Ja, I shall turn to the date reference.  
Resignation date for Mr Makhubo, Chair is 4 October 2019.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does that ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Apologies Chair.  Is that is on the next page, 
page 164.  You will see that it refers to the members and it 
provides more detail on each of the members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   And you will see, the second last one is 
Geoffrey Makhubo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
And 
it 
is 
has 
an 
ID 
number 
of 
6802085374083. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
MR POWELL:   Status resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POWELL:   Appointment date, 1998, 16 September.  
Resignation date, 4 October 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   So it is last year that he resigned Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am interested, primarily in 
Mr Makhubo.  Can I just ask you if you know who the current 
active members listed as Florence Matlekale Makhubo.  Do 
you know Florence Matlekale Makhubo is? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, we are not a hundred percent certain 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 29 of 225 
 
but it looks her mother.  It is – if I look at the ID, it is a 47.  
And if you look at Geoff Makhubo it is a 68.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  Can you talk briefly 
about Molelwane Holdings next?   
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, and I think we will do the 
same on this one, being ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson.  As you direct 
him to specific topics, if you can just mention the page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, page ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
10 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am afraid Mr Powell being a sort 
of trained Forensic Investigator is ahead of me here.  I was 
not planning on going to the CIPC documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I do not have the references.  
He does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am just referring to the table on 
page 86. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I am sure he will give the 
references to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, that is fine 
MR POWELL:   Exactly right, Chair.  I have marked on the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 30 of 225 
 
table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR POWELL:   And I want to take you, Chair to 167 of the 
bundle.  Chair, you will see that this was also – the cheque 
was requested this year in July, 09/07/2020 which coincides 
with the time when the Commission asked us to have a look 
at this.  And it reflects the company, Molelwane Holdings as 
status, annual return final deregistration. 
 
So it looks like the company is in the process of being 
deregistered.  It reflects an active director as Asher Bohbot, 
10 
King Aluthe(?) Thokoane, ID number 8012315407087 as an 
active director. 
 
The two further names on this document.  The first one, 
I think, is irrelevant Chair because Christiaan Gouws is an 
individual whose business is selling companies off the 
shelves.  So here, he will appear in a multitude companies.  
So I do not think there is anything relevant to that.   
 
But it does reflect Geoffrey Moloantoa Makhubo as a 
resigned director.  And if we turn the page Chair, as we did 
on the last one, we get a more detailed breakdown and it 
20 
reflects that his profession was Chief Executive Officer and 
the resignation date on this one is 7 November 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is on the next page, is that right? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 31 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair, we will see later – or 
maybe when Mr Makhubo comes, that November 2011 is 
when Mr Makhubo entered government. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we can move then to Mfundi 
Mobile Networks.  You have said a little about Mfundi but 
...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...there is certainly a lot more to 
say. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Yes.  Mfundi Mobile, the directors are listed 
as Mongezi Duma(?) and Reno Neil Barry.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you give the Chair the 
reference again?  
MR POWELL:   I am going to do the same as I did previously 
and I am going to take you to page 160 of the bundle.  One, 
six, zero.  And this cheque was also requested in July of this 
year and it reflects the company name as Mfundi Mobile 
Networks, status in business.   
 
The company was registered in 2012 Char.  Registration 
20 
date, 10 October 2012.  The directors and other summary 
reflects Barry Reno Neil or...  ja.  Reno Neil Barry is his 
name Chair.  ID number 7409165060084 as the director and 
it is an active status Chair. 
 
And then there is an inactive director reflected as 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 32 of 225 
 
Duma(?) Mongezi Imbros(?), and it reflects that he is a 
resigned director.  And we turn the age Chair, we will see 
that Mongezi Duma resigned on 23 June 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is at page 161. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do you know anything else 
about Mr Duma?  If I might refer you back to page 86 of your 
first report? 
MR POWELL:   Yes, certainly.  Mr Duma was employed at 
10 
Tactical Software Systems as a Group Financial Analyst, 
Chair and you will find that on page 86 in the table.   
 
And Mfundi is quite important to my testimony Chair 
because we have identified that EOH paid Mfundi Mobile 
more than R 54 million excluding VAT for purported work on 
Public Sector projects where we could find no evidence that 
any work was done.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   While we are talking about the 
relationship between Mfundi Mobile and EOH  Can you take 
you to a contract that appears at page 466 of the bundle?  
20 
466. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Which describes itself as a 
teaming agreement. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 33 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this is a document which have 
furnished or your team furnished to the Commission.  Can 
you tell the Chairperson what this document is? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, just before we go into this 
document, I just want to highlight to the Commission that we 
had already, before the Commission asked us, identified 
irregularities within Mfundi Mobile and we had issued 
Mr Van Coller to depose here an affidavit and we issued a 
Section 34 report to the DPCI reporting irregularities 
regarding Mfundi Mobile.   
10 
 
The document that Mr Chaskalson has referred me to, is 
the appointment of, as an independent service provider and 
it is an agreement between the SAP Services, Business Unit 
of EOH Mathombo(?) (Pty) Ltd.  And the SAP is the software 
OEM, Chair, the Original Equipment Manufacturer.   
 
This entity’s primary business was the support around 
SAP Services.  And the contract is with Mfundi Mobile 
Networks represented by Mr Duma in his capacity as a 
director.  And this is what we commonly found and I think Mr 
Chaskalson referred to it as a teaming agreement.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the reference to – I mean, SAP 
Services Business Unit. 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of EOH Mathombo. 
MR POWELL:   Jip.  Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 34 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, if I may ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This has got nothing to do with the South 
African Police? 
MR POWELL:   Nothing to do with the South African Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, that is why I mentioned this is SAP 
which 
is 
an 
only 
distributor 
of 
software 
to 
many 
municipalities across the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Alright. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If I can ask you to go to the 
definition of deliverables in that agreement, page 467? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, at paragraph 1.1.8, the contract refers 
to deliverables and it states that this means:   
“The tasks and/or products and/or services delivered 
by the service provider as set out in Addendum A 
attached and read as it is specifically incorporated 
herein.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, I understand, these are going 
to be the services provided by Mfundi to EOH.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
MR POWELL:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then ask you to go to 
Addendum A so that we can see what the services are? 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 35 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is at page 476, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  476.  Yes? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, you will see that the project and 
deliverables of the service provider is blank.  Nothing is 
stipulated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second. 
MR POWELL:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   476.  I have got the Addendum A.   
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR POWELL:   This refers to the Addendum A, Chair 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...service provider is black. 
MR POWELL:   It is blank.  So Chair, what we found is that 
business ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Under payment arrangements, it is not 
blank. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja, if I understand Mfundi, it is 
blank. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you wanted to make – you wanted to 
say something Mr Powell. 
MR POWELL:   This is not uncommon Mr Chair.  We have 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 36 of 225 
 
found a number of service providers that were used where 
we cannot find any evidence that they have done work.  And 
when we looked at the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Agreements. 
MR POWELL:   ...deliverables in the agreements, it is either 
blank or it is nebulous consulting services ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POWELL:   ...as broad as can be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And we cannot find the actual work that was 
10 
done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I need to withdraw the 
remark that I just made.  The payment arrangements are not 
black.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja, no, no.  It is not 
blank/black(?). 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, if I can take you back 
to that table on page 86. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
I 
am 
sorry 
Mr 
Chaskalson.  
20 
Interestingly, what is blank also is rates, requirements, 
position and rates  Am I right? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 37 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we go back to the table on – to 
186.  We are not going to be deal with acts of – in your 
testimony.  So I ask you to go to Present Perfect Investec – 
Investments.  And tell the Chair what you have learnt about 
this entity. 
MR POWELL:   Present Perfect Investments, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Is it page 186? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 1, page 86 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I beg your pardon, Mr Powell.  In 
fact, we are not going to deal with Present Perfect 
Investments today either.  So if you can go down to Prime 
Molecular Technologies.   
MR POWELL:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  I was about to point 
out to Mr Chaskalson that both of us did not have the 
reference to that one.  So I am glad he has.  Prime 
Molecular Technologies Africa (Pty) Ltd.   
 
Chair, you will find that – the Windeed SIPC documents 
at 177 of the bundle.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, this report was also requested in July 
after the Commission approached us and we ran this check.  
We identified that Prime Molecular Technologies Africa is 
reflected as in business.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 38 of 225 
 
 
It was registered on the 13t h of August 2009 and it 
reflects as an active director, Patrick Makhubo with his ID 
number of 740801558082. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Powell.  If I can just 
interrupt there  It is a Makhubo because I do not want us to 
potentially confusing – I do not want the record which 
potentially confuses ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Patrick Makhubo. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC:   ...Mr 
Makhubo 
with 
Mr Makhubedu. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Oh, my apologies.  Did I say Makhubo?  It is 
Mr Makhubedu, Chair.  So Patrick Makhubedu is reflected as 
an active director and Ryno(sic) Neil Barry is reflected as a 
resigned director. 
 
And if we turn the page to 178, we will see that 
Ryno(sic) Barry was appointed in 2009 on the 13t h and it 
appears 
to 
have 
resigned 
on 
the 
same 
date, 
Chair, 
13 August 2009. 
 
So 
the 
active 
principle 
is 
Patrick Makhubedu. 
[Please note that speaker refers to Reno Neil Barry as well 
20 
as Ryno Neil Barry.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then lastly, Mr Powell.  EOH 
Africa (Pty) Ltd. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Mr Chair, for this one, I am going 
to take Chair to 120 of the bundle.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 39 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   This report was also requested in July. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell.   
MR POWELL:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Powell.  Before you take 
the Chair to the details in the bundle.  If you can just briefly 
describe what EOH Africa is and what it used to be. 
MR POWELL:   EOH Africa used to be TSSMS Chair.  There 
was a name change.  So it is as EOH Africa.  Sorry, 
Mr Chaskalson.  I am just going back to the bundle.  So the 
10 
former name of this entity was TSS Managed Services and 
they are relevant to this – to my evidence today Chair 
because they have also made payments to Molelwane and I 
will testify further about that at a later stage in my evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which name came first?  Was it TSS or 
was it ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR POWELL:   The first one is TSS Managed Services.  So 
TSSMS.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that how it is known now? 
20 
MR POWELL:   No, it is known as EOH Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it used to be ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   It used to be TSS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay that is what I wanted to know. 
MR POWELL:   Thanks, Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 40 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it was acquired by EOH when 
it was TSS, the TS Group when it was TSS Managed 
Services?  Is that correct? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So early payments that previously 
made here reflected somewhere as having come from TSS to 
whoever, would be the same source as the payments that 
may now reflect as coming from EOH Africa? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No? 
10 
MR POWELL:   It might be another TSS entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay, okay. 
MR POWELL:   So this one is most definitely previously 
TSSMS, now EOH Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POWELL:   The reference to TSS on most deposits is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If I can now ask you, Mr Powell to 
go to page 87 of the bundle which is where, in your first 
report, you talk about the contract that you have discovered 
20 
between Molelwane Holdings and TSSMS.   
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair.  We were actually 
unable to find the contract between Molelwane and EOH or 
any entity related to EOH but what we did find is, there was 
a Molelwane contract which was in a form of an unsigned 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 41 of 225 
 
teaming agreement between TSSMS and Molelwane Holdings 
(Pty) Ltd.   
 
We do not know if this was ever signed.  We have never 
seen a signed copy and we have attached a copy of this.  It 
has an effective date of 1 October...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just ask you to identify it for 
the Chair and go to page 184?   
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Mr Chair, this is the teaming 
agreement 
that 
I 
referred 
to, 
the 
unsigned 
teaming 
agreement and you will see that this reflects an agreement 
10 
date of 1 October 2009 between TSS Managed Services 
(Pty) Ltd with Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd referred to as 
Molelwane.   
 
And if we just page through the document, you will see 
that it is indeed unsigned, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it talk about deliverables? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you might take the Chair to 
page 189. 
MR POWELL:   189, Chair and 188 and 187 reflects that it is 
unsigned and then if we go to 189, you will see the services 
20 
to be provided by Molelwane are: 1) business advisory; 2) 
business development; 3) advisory services and 4) changed 
management.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There is a preamble to the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 42 of 225 
 
contract that located within the context of a specific contract 
of - if I can take you back to 184. 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  Under the recitals, Chair, it 
indicates that: 
“Whereas TSSMS is providing VOIP voice server IP 
and VPN services for its client and has identified 
Molelwane as supplier for the services described in 
part 1 of schedule A attached hereto.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So these business advisory 
business 
development 
advisory 
services 
and 
change 
10 
management services according to the contract are going 
to be provided in the context where TSSMS is providing 
voice over IP and virtual private network of services to the 
CCMA.  Is that how you understand it? 
MR POWELL:   That is correct.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a definition of the VOIP VPN 
services or if not do you know what that refers to? 
MR POWELL:   The VOIP is voice over IP, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is it? 
MR POWELL:   Voice over IP. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And, Chair, IP is internet 
protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it is like telephony over the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 43 of 225 
 
internet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and VPN, Mr Chaskalson, VPN 
services? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Virtual private networks. 
MR POWELL:   Virtual private networks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if you go back to your 
report at page 87 you refer to a payment schedule which 
you found.  Can I take you to page – that reference is in 
paragraph 66.4 and maybe if you can just explain to the 
10 
Chair the relevance of this payment schedule from TSSMS 
to Molelwane from the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that at page 87? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   87, Chair.  I must apologise, 
Chair, 
today’s 
testimony 
is 
going 
involved 
bouncing 
backwards and forwards from documents to reports to 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine, ja.  Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, if I can elaborate on what Mr 
Chaskalson has said, we have literally run through millions 
20 
and millions of emails and thousands of documents and the 
bundles before you are a more than a thousand pages but 
this is small snippet of the volume of documents that we 
have analysed.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 44 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go to 6.4 on page 87 
you described this payment schedule. 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  It appears that the TSSMS client 
is the CCMA and the schedule reflects what TSSMS would 
pay Molelwane Holdings for its services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And CCMA, does it refer to the CCMA 
that we all know or is it something else. 
MR POWELL:   It is the CCMA that we all know, the 
Council for Mediation, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR POWELL:   It reflects CCMA build 180 000.  TSS fees 
R117 000, Molelwane fees R63 000 and that is for voice 
over IP, Chair.  And then you will see for the virtual 
networks there is CCMA build 220 000, TSS fees, 150 000, 
Molelwane fees 70 000 and the monthly Molelwane fees 
are reflected as R133 000.  So it is quite a significant 
portion of that total bill, it is almost a third, roughly a third, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there is a column for VOIP and a 
column for VPN services. 
20 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And VOP is – CCMA was billed… 
MR POWELL:   180 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   180 000 and then TSS fees I assume 
from that was 117 000. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 45 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   That is what it looks like, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then fees for Molelwane was 63 000 
coming from the amount billed to the CCMA. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then under VPN services, it is 
R220 000 billed to the CCMA and then TSS fees are 
150 000 from that and Molelwane fees 70 000. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And monthly Molelwane fees is 133 000. 
MR POWELL:   Ja.  Now, Chair, the 73 and 63 seem to 
10 
total and it seems to be a monthly payment there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR POWELL:   And then the payment schedule goes on as 
follows. 
One-stop 
consulting, 
market 
Positioning 
and 
advisory Services, there is a fee stipulated here of 600 000 
and then the monthly advisory services, 63 000 and it 
states that all of this will be honoured subject to TSSMS 
achieving its revenue targets and payment from the 
customer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it looks like – does it look like – well, 
20 
certainly in terms of VPN services it looks like the fees are 
split between TSS and Molelwane. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I do not know if the same applies to 
VOIP, I am not sure. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 46 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   It seems to be split as well, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So now at paragraph 7.1 you 
refer to an invoice that I will take you to in a minute. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this was your first report to 
the Commission, you said we found to date only one 
Molelwane invoice.  
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair, I do need to change that 
because we were still looking and when we made the first 
10 
submission it was to be in time for the Commission’s 
request, 
we 
continued 
searching 
and 
we 
found 
an 
additional payment which I will elaborate on shortly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, what you said was true at 
that time. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but subsequently you found more. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you to page 398 of 
bundle 1? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, this appears to be the Molelwane 
Holdings (Pty) Ltd invoice and it is addressed to TSS 
Managed Services (Pty) Ltd for attention Mr Patrick – or 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 47 of 225 
 
sorry, it says Mr P Makhubedu and it reflects …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Just one second, Mr Powell, just to 
go back.  There is Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd and there 
is Molelwane Consulting, is that correct? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
Molelwane 
Consulting 
is 
a 
subsidiary of Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd or not? 
MR POWELL:   It is reflected as a separate entity, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a separate entity. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it could be a separate entity but still 
being a subsidiary, you are not sure. 
MR POWELL:   We do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the directorship, is it the same, do 
you know? 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  Yes, Chair, we went through the 
CIPC documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And you will remember on Holdings Mr 
Makhubo resigned, if I recall correctly before 2011. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   But on the other one he was still an active 
director until 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On which one? 
MR POWELL:   The Molelwane …[intervenes] 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 48 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Consulting. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  And in regard to 
Molelwane Consulting he was the sole director, the last 
time you checked? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, Chair, the CIPC records 
reflect that Florence Matlakhala Makhubo is now the sole 
director.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sole member because it is a CC.  
10 
She was previously a member with Mr Makhubo according 
to the CIPC up until 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  And Florence Makhubo was 
one name we saw. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that name relate to Molelwane 
Holdings (Pty) Ltd? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she remains the sole director. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   And that is the lady with the ID number 
starting 48. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, of 47 I thought? 
MR POWELL:   Yes, correct, Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 49 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, thank you, I just wanted to re-
orientate myself.  So we are now dealing with – at page 
398 with Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, can I take you to the 
date of that invoice? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, the date of the invoice, Chair, is 
30 November 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now on that date would Mr 
Makhubo have been a director of Molelwane Holdings?  
Molelwane Holdings, not Molelwane Consulting. 
10 
MR POWELL:   So he had resigned earlier but, Chair, I 
think you need to keep your wits about you because what 
we are going to analyse in the next couple of minutes is 
even though the invoice reflects Molelwane Holdings, the 
bank account actually belongs to Molelwane Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh.  
But 
he 
had 
resigned 
from 
Molelwane Holdings in 2011, if I recall correctly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair, but he 
was still a member of Molelwane Consulting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Consulting, yes, yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would this be the convenient time, Mr 
Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  We will take the tea adjournment, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 50 of 225 
 
it is now about eighteen minutes past eleven, we will 
resume at twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, when we broke you 
were looking at the invoice on page 398 and you had 
mentioned to the Chair that the invoice is in the name of 
Molelwane Holdings but the bank details at the bottom are 
Molelwane Consulting’s bank details. 
10 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair.  So Chair, you 
correctly pointed out the date of resignation from Holdings 
was 2011 and the resignation date from Consulting for 
Geoff Makhubo was much later, 2019, and this is an 
anomaly on the invoice because it purports to come from 
holdings but the bank details belong to Consulting and I 
understand further that the Vat details also belong to 
Consulting, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess – well, maybe with electronic 
transfers there is no problem effecting a transfer of money 
20 
from 
say 
TSS 
Management 
Services 
to 
Molelwane 
Consulting 
when 
the 
invoice 
does 
not 
come 
from 
Molelwane Consulting but comes from Molelwane Holdings 
but I would have thought that in the old way of doing things 
if there was a cheque written Molelwane Holdings (Pty) Ltd 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 51 of 225 
 
the bank would not put that cheque into the account of 
Molelwane Consulting.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It would be much – in the age of 
cheques it would have been much more difficult to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes, okay, alright. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
You 
mentioned 
the 
Vat 
registration number on this invoice. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair, the Vat registration number 
10 
also belongs to Consulting, as I pointed out, Chair.  Chair, 
if I may also just add, you know, any finance official that 
was processing this invoice should have put up a break 
and said stop, there is a problem with the invoice because 
it reflects – it purports to come from the Holdings company 
but this is Consulting, they should have queried it, but it 
was processed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now from TSS management side. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but from the bank’s side they would 
20 
not be able to see anything like that. 
MR POWELL:   You are quite correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR POWELL:   And I think one of the ingredients for the 
vast amount of fraud in the country is because the banks 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 52 of 225 
 
only 
look 
at 
the 
number 
and 
not 
necessarily 
the 
accountholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   But many of the banks do offer a service 
where you pay extra and you can validate the name of the 
beneficiary to the account number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There is another Molelwane 
invoice that you were able to find, that was the one that – 
the first one that you presented to the Commission 
10 
together with this report.  Can I take you to page 194? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Before we get to 194, sorry, one 
last point about this invoice.  Can you just note the invoice 
number because we will be comparing it when we see the 
next invoice. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair, the invoice number on this 
invoice is 021 and I think it is important just to tie the date 
30 November 2014 to the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am looking for the invoice number. 
20 
MR POWELL:   It is on the right hand column under tax 
invoice, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   You will see a little bubble. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 53 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   It is in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, on the – we are at page 398, 
is that right? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see where it says tax invoice. 
MR POWELL:   Just below that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR POWELL:   Right at the bottom in that block, Chair, it 
says invoice number 021. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, okay, thank you. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Chair and then I have also directed Chair 
to the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is 30 November 2014. 
MR POWELL:   30 November 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we can go to the 
second invoice you have been able to find on page 194. 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I think while numbers and 
dates are fresh in our mind can you just direct the Chair to 
20 
the date and number of this invoice? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  The first thing to point 
out is the date is 30 April 2016 almost two years later and 
if you look in the bubble below tax invoice, Chair, you will 
see invoice number 22.  So it seems to be a sequence and 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 54 of 225 
 
that indicates no transactions between. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And any other comments about 
this invoice? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, it is the same scenario as the prior 
invoice, the invoice emanates from Molelwane Holdings 
(Pty) Ltd, it is directed to TSS Managed Services (Pty) Ltd.  
It talks about services rendered as per agreement, LAN 
and WAN services.  The amount charged is 500 570 with 
VAT and again a similar characteristic to the last invoice it 
is the bank account details of that of Molelwane Consulting 
10 
and it is a First National Bank account and it has the same 
anomaly that we recognise don the first invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know what LAN and WAN 
services are? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think the abbreviation, Chair, 
Local Area Network and Wide Area Network.  I think that is 
what the abbreviation is, they are network-related services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I can confirm that as well from my 
side.  Thank you, Mr Chaskalson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, I see that the invoice does 
not reflect when these services were provided.  I take it 
was the same with the other invoice, just provided what 
services were provided but not exactly when. 
MR POWELL:   Ja, there is no date, Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 55 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are going to come back to 
both invoices in due course, Chair, when we put them in a 
chronology of events relating to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In your report you have dealt 
with these invoices at page 87 and then you go on to deal 
with payments to Molelwane in paragraph 8 over the page, 
bundle 1 page 88.  Again my preference is to deal with the 
payment when we can see them in a chronology relating to 
10 
tenders in the City of Jo’burg but there is one set of 
payments that we will not be getting to in that chronology 
and I would like to just ask you to flag it here for the Chair.  
On page 89 of bundle 1 you talk about steps that you have 
taken to track down historical payments with reference to 
the BEE reports furnished by EOH companies and you 
referred to a 2012 schedule of BBBEE service providers 
and amounts paid to them.  Can I take you to page 200 of 
the bundle – sorry and what you state there is that that 
schedule reflects that Molelwane was paid 1.35 million in 
20 
the course of 2012.  Can I ask would that be calendar year 
2012 or financial year 2012? 
MR POWELL:   That appears to be the calendar year. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Can I then take you to 
page 200 of the bundle? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 56 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you describe – this is a 
page of broader document that one sees going back from 
200.  Can you describe to the Chair what that document is?   
MR POWELL:   This appears to be an EOH Group BBBEE 
supplier list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second?  The document starts at 
page 198, is that right? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Chaskalson wants us to look at 
10 
page 200, hey? 
MR POWELL:   So this seems to be a schedule of all the 
BEE payments, BEE suppliers, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In what year? 
MR POWELL:   The 2012. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you just direct the Chair 
to where you see that?  
MR POWELL:   Sorry, Mr Chaskalson, my copy is cut off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see on the extreme right column 
20 
there are – there is a reference to 2012 but there is also 
2013 and 2011. 
MR POWELL:   Ja, I do see the 2012 reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or could it be different years? 
MR POWELL:   Ja.  There is reference to 2012 and 2013, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 57 of 225 
 
Chair, in the far right column. 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe if I can take you to the 
start of the email string under which that document is 
furnished. 
MR POWELL:   Yes, that will help. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is on page 195. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair, that does reflect that 
attached is what I found on the drive from 2012 so it does 
appear to apply to the 2012 year. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It would of course be anomaly 
because there are some dates in 2013. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But whether it is 2012 or 2013  
is not going to be relevant for our purposes. 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do want us to flag the entry for 
Molelwane on page 200. 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  Chair, if I can direct you to on 
page 195 the attachment is described as EOH Group BE 
20 
2012.  PP suppliers list, certificates, final, 11 October ’12.  
So I think that does help clarify the timing and then, Chair 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, did you say at page 195? 
MR POWELL:   Page 195. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, at the bottom. 
MR POWELL:   At the top where it reflects the subject, it 
refers to EOH Group BBBEE supplier list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
MR POWELL:   And then the attachment refers to EOH 
Group BE 2012, PP suppliers list and the document 
appears to be dated a final spreadsheet 11 October ’12. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I clarify the anomaly that 
turns out not to be an anomaly in relation to the dates and 
10 
if you go to page 198, is the date where we are seeing 
2013 dates is explained by the heading to that column. 
MR POWELL:   Oh, absolutely, correct, Chair.  Mr 
Chaskalson has referred Chair to that top column on the 
right hand said, it says certificate expiry date.  Chair, I 
think that is what the confusion was.  So the date seems to 
be 2012 and some of the certificates referred to in the 
schedule expired in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then can you direct the 
20 
Chair on page 200 to the line dealing with payments to 
Molelwane? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, just below the middle of that page 
you will see on the left hand side it refers to solutions and 
then two lines below solutions there is a gap in the middle 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 59 of 225 
 
of the page.  Two lines below that it refers to Molelwane 
Consulting CC 1 350 000 and then it refers to EME level 4 
and it refers to – there is a reference on the right to TSS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, it is a very long list, I am 
not sure if you picked up the Molelwane entry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have.  I do not know how many 
Molelwane there are but I have picked up the one I think 
that he is talking about, the amount is 1,350, level 4 and 
not applicable, not applicable and then at the end TSS. 
10 
MR POWELL:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That reflects that TSS paid R1,350 
million to Molelwane Consulting CC, is that right? 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair, thank you, Mr 
Powell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are almost ready to get to 
Johannesburg. 
 
In 
fact 
we 
are 
ready 
to 
get 
to 
20 
Johannesburg but before we get to the two specific 
contracts …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just – I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, 
just for the sake of completeness, is the date when that 
payment was effected reflected on page 200 or is the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 60 of 225 
 
amount of 1,350 million the total of various payments over 
a certain period? 
MR POWELL:   It appears to be various payments for the 
period, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, if you go – the column 
heading is on page 198. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that column is described as 
total spend for the measurement period. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, I see that, thank you.  Just that 
they made a bit blacker there, I think it would have been 
much better if it was the same as the actual page.  Okay, 
okay, alright. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I think what makes the process 
difficult 
is 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
determine 
links, 
relationships, quantify payments from various sources, so 
it is not a simple matter of going straight to the accounting 
system and this schedule just is – corroborates the 
information that we found. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   So it does make it difficult to piece it 
together, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we move now to the City of 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 61 of 225 
 
Jo’burg, in your second report at page 376 of bundle 1 you 
provide a table that gives an overview of the various 
contracts that EOH Group of companies had with the City 
of Jo’burg. 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair.  There are a number 
of contracts referred to on the table at paragraph 3 of page 
376 and if I can run through them quickly, Chair.  The first 
one was a tender referred to as COJ 8387 and that was for 
ICT LAM and 1 services.  The entity was TSSMS.  The 
value of the ward was R38.4 million.  The date, the period 
10 
was December 2010 to November 2012 and then extended. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask that – you speak of 
the value of the award, is that the appointment value or the 
total amount that was paid during the course of the 
contract? 
MR POWELL:   This is the tender award value. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed and did you find cases 
where the amount ultimately paid exceeded the amount on 
award? 
MR POWELL:   We did, Chair, there were a number of 
20 
instances where the amount actually paid went beyond 
what was awarded.  The other anomaly, which I think it is 
important just to understand, Chair, is that when we issued 
an interim report on what we had found, EOH published the 
interim 
report 
on 
their 
website 
and 
they 
were 
very 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 62 of 225 
 
transparent in communicating that they had problems and 
they went into great lengths and I know Mr van Coller has 
testified but the board were very, very anxious to undo all 
the wrongdoing to make sure that the removed the 
perpetrators, that they were no longer employed at EOH 
and that they were reported, prosecuted and that the 
company fulfilled all of its reporting obligations.  
And when we issued that report we found a 
multitude of tender abuses so what transpired – and I think 
this is just useful context before we go into the different 
10 
tenders, Chair, is that the guys would collude with the 
government officials at the departments to irregularly 
extend an existing tender.   
National Treasury puts limits on how far one can 
extend so if the value of the tender goes up by more than 
20% the entity should retender.  If the extension is for a 
completely different separate project it should retender but 
it looks like the small group of people who worked in that 
public sector vertical team under Jehan Mackay managed 
to bypass tender on multiple occasions.  So we have got 
20 
multiple extensions of contracts which should have gone to 
tender and then there is a swear word in procurement, 
Chair, and that swear word is sole sourcing because very 
often entities will motivate why they are the only party that 
can 
provide 
the 
service 
but 
the 
reality 
is, 
all 
the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 63 of 225 
 
competitors can provide a similar service.  But without 
competition the price can escalate exponentially and those 
are the types of things that happened on the various 
tenders.  And then the other types of things that happened 
is the EOH people would collude, that public sector vertical 
small group of people would collude with the officials and 
they would get an inside track on tenders before they even 
advertised.  So they would get advance notice, they would 
get more information than competitors and they would be 
placed in an advantaged position. 
10 
And when we go through the evidence you will see 
that 
these 
types 
of 
scenarios 
play 
out 
on 
multiple 
occasions and then when things go wrong for this group of 
people and it looks like they are not getting their way with 
the public entity then they would use politically exposed 
persons to exert influence on the decision-makers to make 
sure that it goes their way. 
So they would get advance notice of what is 
supposed to be confidential Bid Adjudication Committees 
and they would know that they are about to lose something 
20 
and they would then contact very well-known politically 
exposed persons, which I will refer to later in my evidence, 
Chair, and that person will then intervene and suddenly the 
anomaly or the decision to go out to tender will be changed 
or we find correspondence when, for example, City of 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 64 of 225 
 
Jo’burg advertised something for tender that they had 
promised to EOH, there is consternation with this group of 
people. 
But I am just pre-empting to just give you some 
context for what is about to follow, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you know, this concept of sole 
source seems to be abused quite a lot from the evidence I 
have heard over the past two and half years and one of the 
questions I have asked is, if you believe that a particular 
entity is the only source that provides a certain product or 
10 
a certain service, why is that justification for not inviting 
others who may or may not exist to tender because if that 
entity is the only one that provides that product or service, 
it will be the only one that will respond to the invitation.  
But if there are others, they will also respond, if you are 
mistaken in thinking that that entity is the only one.   
So, as a government entity, you suffer nothing by 
opening up the whole thing to open tender.  Where there is 
no emergency, why do you not advertise for the whole 
world and if there is only one entity that responds because 
20 
it is the only one, that is fine.  So I am yet to – that 
somebody will explain to me why the fact that you are a 
sole source for a certain product or service should justify 
not inviting whoever. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 65 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just in case you are mistaken to think 
that is the only source. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – ja, okay, alright.  Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Powell, 
are you finished with that table or is there anything else 
you would like to highlight? 
MR POWELL:   There are number of other tenders, Chair, 
and it is useful just to get an understanding of the volume 
of tenders at the COJ that we are talking about.   
10 
So the next one was COJ 8387 and that was ICT 
security and that was – the EOH entity was Mthombo and it 
was awarded for 26 million in December 2010 to 2012 and 
then extended. 
 
The next one was COJ A472 for SAP support.  EOH 
entity was Mthombo, 250 million.  This was also 2012 to 
February 2016 and then extended and then the next 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I think I did not hear the 
page. 
20 
MR POWELL:   Sorry, this is page 376, Chair, 376. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am there.  So okay, alright.  Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, this is just a short table setting out 
all of the different tenders at the City of Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 66 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   So I have just referred to COJ A472 for 
SAP support, Mthombo 250 million.  2012 to 2016 and then 
extended.  And then we do not have a tender number but 
SAP software, Mthombo was awarded for 97 million in 
November/December 2015 and then COJ A639 or ICT 
outsource, we do not have an award.  And then COJ A647, 
SAP upgrade was awarded to Mthombo.  The award value 
for 404 million and the date was June 2016 to June 2019.  
There was a delayed start with this tender.  Chair, we will 
elaborate on wrongdoing that happened around some of 
10 
these particular dates and tenders. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Powell.  At this 
point we are going to go into one very detailed chronology 
concerning procurement in Jo’burg in 2014 and for my 
starting point I would like you to go to page 761 of the 
bundle. 
MR POWELL:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you describe that document 
to the Chair? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  This is a proposal for the 
20 
upgrading 
of 
the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
network 
and 
infrastructure, it is dated 16 April 2014 and it was prepared 
for the City of Cape Town by EOH. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, you said City of Cape 
Town. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 67 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   I am sorry, City of Johannesburg.  My home 
city, Chair, apologies. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Are you aware whether it was 
prepared in the context of a competitive bidding process or 
not? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, we understand that this was an 
unsolicited proposal. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if we can fast forward a 
little bit to 6 August 2014.  The date on that previous 
document you pointed out was 16 April and can I take you 
10 
to page 606? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, this page 606 refers to an 
email from Geoff Makhubo dated 6 August 2014 and it is 
sent to Patrick Makhubedu and it seems to forward prior 
emails: 
“Dear 
Patrick, 
the 
ANC 
greater 
Johannesburg 
requests urgent assistance with the re-launch of its 
Youth League this weekend.  Apologies for the late 
request but it is an imperative from head office.  
Attached is the accommodation quotation.” 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I interrupt you at that point?  
Can I ask you to take the Chair to page 605?  
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  605, Chair, appears to be 
the conference quotation that is referred to in the request 
that I just read on email and it comes from Randburg 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 68 of 225 
 
Towers and it has a day conference package that is 
elaborated upon in the document and the date of the 
document is 24 July 2014 and the amount is R582 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that just for accommodation or is 
more than accommodation? 
MR POWELL:   There is a whole range, it is conferencing, 
it is dinners, tower rooms, admin. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
Decor, 
twin 
accommodation, 
single 
accommodation.  So it seems to be a conference with 
10 
accommodation 
and 
all 
of 
the 
necessary 
for 
the 
conference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if you go back – I maybe 
interrupted you too soon, I am afraid, Mr Powell, but if you 
can go back to 606 and take the Chair through the rest of 
the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just for convenience you can 
start – read it from the beginning again, the email at 606. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, so 6 August this email was just 
20 
forwarded by Patrick Makhubedu to Rene Jonker.  Rene 
Jonker was one of the divisional finance directors within 
the EOH Group and there is no …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr 
Powell …[intervenes] 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 69 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I might be of assistance, 
if it is at the top of the page once sees the forwarding to 
Rene Jonker. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  So the forwarding is from 
Patrick Makhubedu to Rene Jonker but the actual email 
which is in the middle is from Geoff Makhubo to Patrick 
Makhubedu, is that right? 
MR POWELL:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay so I think start with the email. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then once we know who it was from 
and who it was to then we can go to who the addressee 
forwarded it to. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR POWELL:   So this was forwarded to Rene Jonker in 
finance, with no narration, just sent from an iPad. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But can I ask you just to take 
the Chair through the body of the email that was forwarded 
to Mr...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just read the email first, ja. 
MR POWELL:   Chair but this, who what I read earlier so 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no what I meant read it again. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, sorry Chair.   The email comes 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 70 of 225 
 
from Geoff Makhubo, it is dated 6 August 2014 at 2:18 and 
it is sent to Patrickmakubedu05@gmail.com, and the 
subject is just forward FW, and it reads Chair: 
“Dear Patrick, 
The ANC greater league Johannesburg requests 
urgent assistance with the re-launch of its youth 
league this weekend.  Apologies for the late request 
but it is an imperative from head office.  Attached is 
the accommodation quotation.  Funds can be paid 
directly into the ANC or to the venue.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Regards Geoff Makhubo, ANC Regional 
Treasury? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON 
SC:   Now we have seen the 
accommodation details that he referred to at the Randburg 
Towns conference invoice.  Can I ask you then to go back 
up to 602 because it is a long email stream it is 
chronologically reversed as it were and can you tell the 
Chair what you see on page 602? 
20 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
On 
602, 
on 
6 
August 
2014 
at 
9:47pm…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry just to complete the – it is 
something you dealt with but I like it in proper sequence.     
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Certainly Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 71 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Geoff Makhubo sends an email to 
Mr Patrick Makhubedu…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …requesting assistance for the launch of 
the youth league for the ANC greater Johannesburg and 
when Mr Makhubedu receives it he forwards it to Rene 
Jonker, is that right?  
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then continue then.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then following the same 
10 
sequence if we can start towards the bottom of page 602 at 
the email he sent at 3:50pm.  
MR POWELL:   Certainly this is from Geoff Makhubo and 
interesting Chair it is also Geoffmakhubo@gmail.com date 
6 August 2014 to Patrickmakube 
du05@gmail.com and he copies another Gmail address for 
Patrick Makhubedu.  
“Subject: ANC greater Johannesburg accounts.” 
It starts with: 
“Heita,  
20 
Here are the account details name ANC greater 
Johannesburg…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do not think we need to quote 
the ANC bank account certainly not.  
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 72 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But we get the general idea.  
Can you follow that stream; can you take the Chair through 
what happens when that goes to Patrick Makhubedu.  
MR POWELL:   So Patrick receives this on 6 August 2014 
at 9:46pm he forwards to Rene Jonker and the subject is:  
“Forwarded ANC greater Joburg accounts: 
“Hi please see below the ANC bank details, regards 
Patrick.” 
The next email Chair is at the top of the page Rene Jonker 
responds at 9:47pm to Patrick Makhubedu and says: 
10 
“Thanks will pay first thing in the morning, regards 
Rene 
Jonker, 
financial 
manager 
TSS 
Managed 
Services Pty Ltd.”  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 607.  
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair page 607 is what we refer 
to as a POP, P-O-P Chair it is the proof of payment and if 
you look at the earlier invoice from the venue you will see 
the amount was R582 100,00 and that is the value of the 
POP.  So this is clearly the payment for the accommodation 
for the conference. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that is not a small amount that 
is just over a half a million rand.   
MR POWELL:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to take the Chair 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 73 of 225 
 
to the beneficiary name.   
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair if you look at the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 607 that is the document we are 
looking at, is it not? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR POWELL:   That is description: 
“ANC 
greater 
Johannesburg 
from 
account 
TSS 
Managed Services Pty Ltd and the description ANC 
greater Johannesburg.”  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you in fact when you read 
that description you omitted a detail there which cross 
refers to the invoice.  I appreciate that your printed copy 
may not be as clear as my electronic copy Chair if I might 
read the detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It says: 
“ANC greater Johannesburg (Randburg Towers).”   
MR POWELL:   Correct.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair you will recall that the 
20 
invoice that was attached to Mr Makhubo’s, the quotation 
that was attached to Mr Makhubo’s letter of 6 August came 
from Randburg Towers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR POWELL:   And then one further detail Chair is the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 74 of 225 
 
authoriser number two is Jehan Mackay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then asked you to go to 
page 609 and 610 and to take the Chair chronologically 
through what you see there?  
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  This Chair is a letter from the 
African National Congress greater Johannesburg Region, 
office of the Regional Treasurer it is addressed to the 
executive director EOH Mthombo and it is copied to Mr 
Ebrahim Laher and it is dated 8 August 2014.    
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just interrupt at the point, 
who was the executive director of EOH Mthombo at the 
time? 
MR POWELL:   The executive director of EOH Mthombo at 
the time was a gentleman by the name of Asha Bohbat, B-
o-h-b-a-t Mr Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think Mr Bohbat, in fairness to 
Mr Bohbat I understand that he was the chief executive of 
the entire EOH group I think EOH Mthombo…[intervene]   
MR POWELL:   EOH Mthombo was Jehan Mackay.  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Was Jehan Mackay indeed and 
everyone sees in the address Jehan Mackay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you said it is Mr Ebrahim 
Laher is copied just for the convenience of the transcribers 
the surname there is L-a-h-e-r.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 75 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you tell the Chair who 
Mr Laher is? 
MR POWELL:   Yes, Mr Laher was the director of the SAP 
business of EOH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then can you go back to the 
letter.  
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  This letter the header is:  
10 
“RE, request for financial assistance:

item and its figure at the same time so that one knows.            
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POWELL:    
“Monthly admin expenses 50 000,00, stipends for

But that is just for August Chair then for September we 
have a similar schedule and September shows: 
“Monthly admin expenses 50 000,00, stipends for 
20 
employees 140 000,00, ANCYL regional conference 
400 000,00.” 
And then apologies Chair the bottom line is cut off but the 
last item I can see is: 
“300 000,00.” 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 77 of 225 
 
But we will be able to…[intervene]       
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I do not know if you would 
want me to read those items into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may read them because, ja I think it 
might be quicker.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it is where the: 
“300 
000,00 
is 
against 
MK 
Military 
Veterans 
Association Regional Congress.” 
Underneath that there is a: 
“Heritage day celebration for 160 000,00 and the 
10 
total for September is 1 000 050,00.” 
Then if we go over leave for October, if you can pick up Mr 
Powell.    
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  So the: 
“Monthly administration expenses are 50 000,00, 
stipends for employees 140 000,00, ANC greater 
Johannesburg regional conference venue 1million, 
ANC 
greater 
Johannesburg 
regional 
conference 
packages 650 000,00, ANC greater Johannesburg 
regional conference transport 200 000,00, ANC 
20 
greater Johannesburg regional conference printing 
documents branding and décor 800 000,00, BGMS 
ancillary cost for branch, it looks like corrations[sic] 
370 000,00 totalling 3 000 210,00 Chair.  If I may 
continue? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 78 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
MR POWELL:    
“November the monthly administration expenses are 
stipulated as 50 000,00, stipends for employees 140 
000,00 
total 
R190 
000,00. 
December: 
monthly

employees 
R280 
000,00, 
staff 
getaway 
R150 
000,00, total R340 000,00” 
And then: 
“January monthly admin expenses R50 000,00, 
10 
stipends for employees R140 000,00, ANC January

and 
refreshments 
R250 
000,00, 
total R490 000,00. The grand total is R6 000 
180,00.” 
And then what follows are the ANC banking accounts and 
following the bank account details there is a note from 
Geoff Makhubo: 
“Your support is highly appreciated.”   
It closes with this comment from Geoff Makhubo: 
20 
“Your support is highly appreciated and we thank 
you 
in 
advance 
for 
your 
commitment 
and 
contribution towards strengthening our democracy.   
Yours in democracy Geoff Makhubo.”      
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 79 of 225 
 
following page 611. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second Mr Chaskalson, Mr Powell I 
do not know whether you had a chance of adding up all 
these amounts to see…[intervene] 
MR POWELL:   Yes, Chair that grand total is just over R6 
000 000,00, R6 000 180,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh there it is okay they provide it ja, 
okay.   
MR POWELL:   The next page, page 611 Chair is an email 
from Patrick Makhubedu dated 20 August 2014 sent to 
10 
Geoff Makhubo at a Gmail address and it is forwarded with 
a subject header:  
“Proof of Payment SCC, Proof of Payment Sandton 
Convention Centre.” 
And if you turn to the ensuing page 612 Chair the email 
attaches this document which is a Nedbank payment 
confirmation and if you look at that document we also refer 
to this as a POP Chair, it is a proof of payment and it 
comes from account details Prime Molecular Cheque 
account and then it has the reference both statements 
20 
have the reference SCC14872 and that seems to be the 
abbreviation for Sandton Convention Centre to account 
number and it refers to the account number and an amount 
sorry Chair I think this was a different proof of payment, 
apologies. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 80 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.            
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no it is the right proof of 
payment.  
MR POWELL:   Okay, amount R20 527,30.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   For the Sandton Convention? 
MR POWELL:   For the Sandton Convention Centre, 
correct.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you refresh the Chairs 
memory as to who Prime Molecular are? 
MR POWELL:   Prime Molecular if I remember correctly 
10 
Chair was one of Patrick Makhubedu’s entities.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct and the details 
Chair are to be found in that table at page 86.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we then go over the page to 
613.   
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what we see at 613 is an 
email string that runs to 615.  Can you take the Chair 
through what one sees on page 613 to 615?   
20 
MR POWELL:   Do you want me to start at the top and 
work down Mr Chaskalson or do you want me to refer to the 
document that is forwarded, I think the email forwarded?  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think this is a case where it 
does not matter either way works.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 81 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Chair the top of the page refers 
to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 6…[intervene] 
MR POWELL:   613.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR POWELL:   It is forwarded by Patrick Makhubedu on 22 
August 2014 at 3:06pm to Geoffmakhubo@gmail.com and 
the forward narration is payment confirmation 1165 and 
there is an attachment payment confirmation PDF and it is 
forwarded with no narration.  The item that was forwarded 
10 
appears to be an email that was resent it has the header 
just 
below 
resent 
from 
PatrickM@tssms.co.za 
from 
Standard Bank IB Support at Standard Bank dated 22 
August 2014 at 3:00pm to Patrick Makhubedu it is the 
payment confirmation from Standard Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR POWELL:    
“Dear Patrick, a payment has been made to your 
account to view the details of the payment please 
open the attached PDF.” 
20 
And then it is just the admin around that from the bank and 
then if we can turn the page Chair to page 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second, I just note the – I do 
not know whether it is the informal nature of the salutation, 
Dear Patrick, it is the bank writing to him maybe it is a 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 82 of 225 
 
client that has a close relationship with whoever is writing 
from Standard Bank or maybe this is, I would have 
expected Dear Mr Makhubedu but maybe that is old 
fashioned.      
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair it might just be an electronic 
payment confirmation with a polite greeting, we do not 
know.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think the customers are able to 
set how he or she gets greeted for the confirmation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright yes thank you.  Then you 
10 
said I should go to page? 
MR POWELL:   615, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR POWELL:   And this one is from Standard Bank and 
this one also starts with Dear Patrick Chair: 
“We confirm that the following payment has been 
made into your account from Mfundi 1.” 
And then it has a reference number 741172063 beneficiary 
name ANC, bank name First National Bank. It has the 
beneficiary account number, beneficiary branch number, 
20 
beneficiary reference is Patrick Makhubedu and the amount 
is R70 000,00 and payment date and time is 22 August 
2014 and there is a further comment: 
“If you need more information or have any questions 
about this payment please contact Mfundi 1.” 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 83 of 225 
 
And there is a cell number Chair.      
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you refer to Mfundi, can you 
remind the Chair who Mfundi are? 
MR POWELL:   Yes, Mfundi was the entity with I 
highlighted Reno Neil Barry as the key protagonist Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if I can ask you to go to 
page 337 and maybe start at 336.  
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair at page 336 we have an 
email from Reno Barry sent on 10 September 2014 9:30 to 
Patrick…[intervene] 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just refresh the Chairs 
memory as to who Reno Barry is? 
MR POWELL:   Yes, certainly Chair Reno Barry is the 
principle of that entity called Mfundi Mobile but the email is 
from Reno to Patrick Makhubedu the date is 10 September 
2014, time is 9:30pm.  It is a management report, subject 
management 
report 
Mfundi 
Mobile 
Solutions, 
Mfundi 
Management 
Report 
excel 
is 
attached. 
 There 
is 
a 
spreadsheet dated 10 September 2014: 
“Hi Patrick.” 
20 
Is the narration Chair: 
“Please find attached the management report for 
Mfundi as at 10 September 2014.”    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if you go over the page at 
337, can you identify this document for the Chair? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 84 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair this appears to be 
management accounts for Mfundi and…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I be more specific than that 
there was an excel spreadsheet attached to the previous 
email, is this that spreadsheet? 
MR POWELL:   Ja, correct.  So this says the annexure 
referred to management report 10 September 2014, Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now if one goes to the top left 
there will be a description of income coming into Mfundi.  
Can you explain to the Chair what you see there?    
10 
MR POWELL:   Certainly there is a reflection of monthly 
EOH invoice Chair and there is amounts in the columns on 
the right of that 406 000,00, 406 000,00 repeated for 
October, November, December, January, February and 
there is a total of R2million and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The figures on this page are not as clear 
as one would have liked them to be just start afresh, go 
back to the first figure you mentioned then let me try 
identify it.     
MR POWELL:   Chair the top figure on the left under 
20 
October 2013, October 13 it reflects 406 000,00 and it is 
the narration my page is slightly cut off Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  
MR POWELL:   But if you take the 406 000,00 and that 
number is repeated for October, November, December, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 85 of 225 
 
January, February and the total reflected is R2 000 030,00.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There are in fact three totals 
going across, three total columns the one at the end of 
February 2014.  I presume that that is because Mfundi has 
a financial year that ends in February, would that be a fair 
assumption?  
MR POWELL:   That appears to be the case Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then there is a second total 
which is second from the right which totals everything after 
February and then there is a main total that totals both of 
10 
them, is that correct?  
MR POWELL:   Correct.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you – I do not know if your 
copy is legible Chair we may apologise for the quality of 
these documents we may need to have better quality 
documents produced but on your copies of the document is 
the description in the first column legible, which describes 
what this revenue relates to?  
MR POWELL:   It is slightly cut of Chair but I can make out 
sales.  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair at the risk of assuming the 
witness’s role I have a clear electronic copy, can I read 
those? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can read it.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The first line item says: 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 86 of 225 
 
“Sales monthly EOH invoice.” 
The second line item said: 
“Sales EOH special invoice.” 
Can you comment to the Chair on what this reflects?  
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair the special invoice if you 
run across to the right you will see the figure under June 
14 of R1.2million and if you take that across it gets put 
into to the total and you see the R1.2million again and then 
it goes into the main total on the right.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we proceed Mr Chaskalson you 
10 
referred earlier onto there being three total amounts on 
this page.  I can see two but I cannot see the one which 
you said was for February 2014, I did not see anything 
written total whereas the other two you have got total and 
you have got main total.  So I do not know if I am missing 
anything.         
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, Chair the copy may well, 
your copy may well be illegible but after February 2014 
after that, there is a total cost, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes now I see it, ja okay thank you.    
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now so we have dealt with the 
revenue that comes into Mfundi from sales on monthly EOH 
invoice and EOH special invoice underneath that we see a 
whole list of line items that are described as cost of sales.  
I would like to take you first to the first line item which is 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 87 of 225 
 
cost of sales P Makhubedu.   
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair the first line item is cost of 
sales P Makhubedu and it has a figure of 1,140 000.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No I think you slipped a line.  
MR POWELL:   R1.2million apologies Chair it is just this 
copy is not that great.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is under August 2014, is that right?  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Okay.  
MR POWELL:   And it continues into the total and then into 
10 
the main total that same figure Chair.  So and that number 
coincides with the special invoice number which was also 
R1.2million, just above that Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I just want to refresh my memory this 
reflects payments from Mfundi Mobile Networks to the 
people mentioned here, is that correct?  
MR POWELL:   Correct.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is it, below the break Chair 
the first two line items are payments into Mfundi then there 
is a gap and then there are cost of sales which are 
20 
payments made by Mfundi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh the first two that is sales and ja 
those two sales that is payment to Mfundi.     
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the balance would be payments 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 88 of 225 
 
from Mfundi or by Mfundi.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed and all of the payments 
to Mfundi are described in relation to either EOH invoice, 
monthly EOH invoice or EOH special invoice.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no thank you.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We dealt with the first line item 
before we were looking at the spreadsheet we were dealing 
with a payment made by Mfundi to the ANC in August 2014 
on the 22 n d of August 2014.  Can I take you down the list of 
the cost of sales to six from the last cost of sale and can 
10 
you tell the Chair what you see there? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair I see a payment reflected 
under August 2014 of 70 000,00.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the line item description in 
relation to it? 
MR POWELL:   ANC.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay if you can read the full line 
item description because I think it is important.   
MR POWELL:   Okay: 
“Cost of sales ANC.” 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the payment by Mfundi to 
ANC is treated as a cost of sales by Mfundi? 
MR POWELL:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, then I want to take you 
to the next cost of sale to Mfundi can you identify that for 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 89 of 225 
 
the Chair.  
MR POWELL:   The next narration is: 
“Cost of sales Molelwane Consulting 80 000,00.” 
And then that is also…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that is the one just immediately below 
the one you have just read of cost of sales ANC? 
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair. That appears in the August 
14 column and that is taken through to the total and the main 
total column as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you just remind the Chair 
10 
whom are the members of Malolwane Consulting? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly that is Florence Makhubedu and 
Geoff Makhubo was a member active until 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at the time of these payments Mr 
Makhubo was still a member of Molelwane Consulting CC, is 
that right? 
MR POWELL:  Correct – sorry Chair the consulting was the 
Holdings was Florence.  Mr Makhubo was her partner. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If I might – if I might correct you. 
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
20 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
Florence 
Makhubo 
was 
in 
Consulting. 
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  With Geoff Makhubo. 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 90 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And as reflected on CIPC. 
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Until 2011 – until 2019? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  In Molelwane Consulting for a 
certain period the members were Mr Geoff Makhubo and 
Florence Makhubo is that right? 
MR POWELL:  Yes both Makhubo’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both Makhubo’s.  But in – at some stage in 
2019. 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Mr 
Geoff 
Makhubo 
resigned 
from 
Molelwane Consulting CC. 
MR POWELL:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in 2014 which you are dealing with 
they were both still members of the CC? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Am I right to say Consulting – 
Molelwane Consulting was a CC? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I do want to put it on record 
because Mr Makhubo has not testified yet but Mr Makhubo’s 
own version is that he had intended – he had attempted to 
resign in 2011 but his resignation was not processed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not processed. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 91 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Was not processed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We will canvass that with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  When he comes to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But he has publicly stated that he 
withdrew from both Molelwane’s in 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  May I just the round the loop and 
10 
get 
a 
specific 
date 
for 
that 
R80 000.00 
payment 
to 
Molelwane Consulting can I ask – Chair can I ask you and Mr 
Powell to go to Flow of Funds Volume 3 page 612? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 3. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Chair that page 612 is the 
only page I am going to be referring to from the bundle so 
20 
you just need the page not the whole bundle for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You might just take the page out 
and then you can put it back.  Yes thank you. 
MR POWELL:  What is the page reference? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  612. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 92 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:  Okay.  Right have it before me Mr Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And there can I ask you to look at 
the very first – sorry – this Chair is a bank statement for 
Molelwane Consulting CC that the commission has obtained 
from First National Bank.  Can I ask you to go to the very 
first entry on 612? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Chair it is dated 22 August.  It is a 
magtape credit.  Description Patrick Makhubedu and the 
amount is R80 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we know which year 22 August – which 
10 
year – do we know? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  On the previous – I apologise 
Chair I should have given you 511 with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is the bank statement from 16 
August 2014 to 17 September 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  While we are looking at the 
20 
statement can I ask you to go down to 1 September? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  On 1 September there is another 
magtape credit Chair and it is – description is Patrick 
Makhubedu R100 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One – that first one of 22 August you did 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 93 of 225 
 
mention the amount eh R80 000.00? 
MR POWELL:  R80 000.00 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And we have just been looking at 
the 
Mfundi 
Management Accounts.  
Can 
you draw 
a 
connection for me there? 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair there R80 000.00 was reflected 
as a cost of sales. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed.  From Mfundi to EOH in 
respect of August 2014.  If we go back to Bundle 1 we are 
10 
now going forward to 27 August and can I ask you to go to 
page 760?   
MR POWELL:  Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you describe to the Chair what 
you see there? 
MR POWELL:  Yes.  This is an email from Patrick 
Makhubedu sent on Wednesday August 2017/2014 Chair to 
geoffmakhubo@gmail.com 
and 
he 
copied 
himself 
with 
another email address patrickmakhubedu05@gmail.com and 
it is – it attaches EOH COJ Networking Solutions Version 3 
20 
doc and it is forwarded with the narration EOH COJ 
Networking Solution Version 3. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you go to the next page it is a 
document we started off this chronology with.  Can you 
describe it to the Chair? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 94 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:  Correct.  It is the proposal for the upgrading 
of 
the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
Network 
and 
Security 
Infrastructure Chair and the date of this – this is prepared 
for City of Johannesburg and the date is 2014/04.16 – the 16 
April. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So you earlier refer to this 
document as an unsolicited proposal that was sent to the 
City in April on 16 April 2014.  Can we just go back to that 
previous email so that we are clear on the date on which it is 
now forwarded from Mr Makhubedu to Mr Makhubo? 
10 
MR POWELL:  Certainly this – the date of this is 27 August 
2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I do not need to tell take you 
through the entire document but can I ask you to go to page 
776 where the price attached to this proposal appears? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
MR POWELL:  776. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  776 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
MR POWELL:  Chair at page 776 there is a table Solution 
Pricing and Assumptions and the total price it goes into the 
different components – the total price is R106 185 395.36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you may have two millions there. 
MR POWELL:  106 million yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 95 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  R106 185 395.36. 
MR POWELL:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR POWELL:  395 thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then Mr Powell can we move 
forward to the 29 August and can I ask you to go to page 
778? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That total that you have just read Mr 
Powell would – is that the total given of the quotation for the 
job that they wanted to do? 
MR POWELL:  Ja this is the proposal total Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Yes page 778 is that 
right? 
MR POWELL:  This is an email from Patrick Makhubedu and 
it is dated Friday 29 August 2014 to Geoff Makhubedu – 
Makhubo sorry.  To Geoff Makhubo and the subject is just the 
205191721pdf and that is also the name of the attachment.  
20 
And if you turn the page it is TSS Managed Services. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I – I just want to check that 
you have page 778.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If you can just describe to the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 96 of 225 
 
Chair what you see there? 
MR POWELL:  This is a tax invoice made out to the City of 
Johannesburg project name COJ Network and Security 
Upgrade and project – there is a project number in it. The 
customer number, order number etcetera and it refers to 
customer reference 8387.  Description upgrading of network 
and security infrastructure and the total is the total we just 
looked at previously the exact amount of the proposal 
R106 185 395.36 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on one second.  The proposal 
10 
was dated what? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  16 April Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 16 and this is the invoice dated 26 
June?  Is that right 2014? 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So in respect – there is an invoice 
for the full amount of the proposal.  The customer reference 
number is 8387.  Can I take you back to that table you were 
20 
going through with the Chair on page 336? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to make sure I understand.  Since the 
total of the total appearing on this invoice is the same as I 
understand it as the total of the quotation or of the proposal. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 97 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This suggests that the work would have 
been completed because you – one would expect that you 
put in your invoice after you have done the work. 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be your expectation as well? 
MR POWELL:  That would be the expectation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR POWELL:   I am not sure that is the reality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I just wanted to make sure I am 
10 
following.  Yes okay Mr Chaskalson I think you – I 
interrupted you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  First the reference number the 
customer reference was 8387 that refers to a contract which 
you describe in your table at page 376.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 376? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct Chair.  It is fact the 
first item on that table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So what was the contract with 
20 
reference number 8387? 
MR POWELL:  8387 was an ICT Lan and Wan project and 
the entity was TSSMS and the value was R38.4 million.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That was the award value? 
MR POWELL:  Yes and there is also the same – there is also 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 98 of 225 
 
a COJA387 for ICT Security Mthombo and that value was 
R26 million also 2010to 2012 and then extended. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So both of the relevant contracts 
ought to have expired in 2012? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I then take you ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  So if you look at the 
reference of 8387 the first item on your table at page 376 
that would be a contract that expired in 2012 or thereabout? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct.  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the invoice that we looked at two/three 
minutes ago which had the same reference 8387 was in June 
2014? 
MR POWELL:  14.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it purported to be an invoice for – or 
connected or arising from work connected with the proposal 
made in April 2014? 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then Mr Powell can we go forward 
20 
to 1 September and page 779. 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Page 779 Chair is an email from 
Patrick Makhubedu to Reno Barry sent on 1 September 2014 
and the narration is  
“Hi, 
please 
pay 
R100 000.00 
into 
the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 99 of 225 
 
Molelwane Consulting from Mfundi and make 
immediate clearance.  Thanks Patrick.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we then go back to our bank 
statement for Molelwane in August/September 2014 which is 
at page 612? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Volume 3 – Volume 3 – Bundle 3 of 
page 612. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The page that you would like us to go to is 
in another bundle? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is that one page that we – that I 
referred you to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Earlier Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what was the page number? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  612 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Chair you will recall that we 
had identified the R80 000.00 payment to Molelwane on 22 
August and also that R100 000.00 payment on 1 September. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  With – both with references Patrick 
Makhubedu.  You have just quoted the email that required 
immediate clearance. Can you point the Chair to what the 
balance of Molelwane was before the R100 000.00 was paid 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 100 of 225 
 
in? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair.  It looks like that account 
was almost empty.  The balance was R597.45 when the 
R100 000.00 came in and that pushed it to R100 000.00 just 
under R600.  So the account was almost depleted. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And while we are on this issue can 
you do the same exercise for the payment on the 22 August 
of R80 000.00? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair when the R80 000.00 came in 
the balance was also R600.00.  In that case it was R621.45.  
10 
So R600.0 the account was virtually depleted when it got the 
R80 000.00 credit.  Mr Chaskalson can I put away this 
bundle?  Is that the last? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes we are not going to come back 
to Volume 3 certainly not before lunch.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I was hoping that we might 
be able to complete the 2014 chronology but there is little 
prospect that we will do that before lunch so if this is a 
convenient time to take the adjournment I would ask that we 
20 
do so? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay we will take the lunch 
adjournment – adjournment now and then we will resume at 
two. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 101 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Now the 
chronology, we have just finished on 1 September.  Can I 
then, Mr Powell, take you to page 616? 
MR POWELL:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you describe it to the Chair, 
10 
the document that you see there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 616? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   616.  Chair, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Yes.  Mr Chair, this is an email from 
Patrick Makhubedu sent to Geoff Makhubo at Gmail and the 
subject is donations letters.  It is dated 9 September 2014.  
And there were a number of attachments; Donation Letter 
ANC, 
EOH 
Managed 
Services, 
Donation 
01/2014 
doc, 
Donation Letter ANC / EOH Managed Services Donation doc, 
20 
Donation Letter ANC TSS Managed Services, Fund Raising 
Gala 2014. 
 
And the narration is: 
“Hi.  Attached are the letters for your signature.  
Your help will be highly appreciated.  Regards, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 102 of 225 
 
Patrick Makhubedu.” 
 
And his cell number. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then, can you take the Chair 
to the attachments themselves?   
MR POWELL:   The following page on 617, has a series and 
it follows.  Chair, there are a number of documents attached 
and 
this 
is 
addressed 
to 
Patrick Makhubedu 
at 
EOH 
Managed Services (Pty) Ltd.  And it is dated 19 June 2014: 
“Dear, sir.  Re donation acceptance.” 
 
And the narration reads: 
10 
“On behalf of the African National Congress, we 
would like to acknowledge and thank EOH Managed 
Services (Pty) Ltd for the donation of R 2 million on 
13 December 2014. 
We 
confirm 
that 
the 
funds 
were 
utilised 
for 
Development and Education Programmes and a 
hundred percent of the funds were utilised for black 
beneficiaries.  Your sincerely.” 
 
And then it is a blank space for to be signed for the 
name, designation and company and institution. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So can I just clarify here?  We 
have 
Patrick Makhubedu 
sending 
unsigned 
letters 
to 
Geoff Makhubo for him or somebody else in the ANC to sign 
to confirm donations.  Is that correct? 
MR POWELL:   That is exactly what it is Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 103 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you just emphasise the 
amount of the donation in that first unsigned letter or 
recorded in the first unsigned letter? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  The first one is R 2 million 
and...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any understanding whether 
the R 2 million is payment made on the 13t h of December as 
reflected or whether it is R 2 million is a total of a number of 
payments made over a certain period of time? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I think what the email suggests is that 
10 
there were three different EOH entities and this R 2 million 
was the amount that came from EOH Managed Services (Pty) 
Ltd. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR POWELL:   If we turn a page to the next document Chair 
at 618, you will see it is a similar letter authored – sent to 
Patrick Makhubedu.  It is a draft for Patrick Makhubedu that 
he has emailed to Geoff Makhubo, asking him to sign. 
 
And this one refers to on behalf of the African National 
Congress.  We would like to acknowledge and thank EOH 
20 
Managed Services (Pty) Ltd for the donation of R 3 million 
on 16 April 2014.  And it has got a similar confirmation on 
the use of the funds. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just stop you there?  Can 
you recall what else happened on 16 April 2014? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 104 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   I think we referred earlier to that event, that 
there was a request ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was is it not the unsolicited proposal? 
MR POWELL:   Oh, sorry.  That is correct.   
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POWELL:   The unsolicited proposal was dated exactly 
this, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the last letter? 
MR POWELL:   Thank you, Chair.  The last letter is a similar 
letter. 
 
This 
one 
is 
again 
sent 
for 
attention 
by 
Patrick Makhubedu for his own attention.  TSS Managed 
Services. 
 
And this one says: 
“On behalf of the African National Congress, we 
would like to acknowledge and thank TSS Managed 
Services (Pty) Ltd for the donation R 151 000,00 on 
11 November 2013.” 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then can I ask you to go down to 
626? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 626? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   626.  Okay. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 105 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   This is a letter from Patrick Makhubedu to 
René Jonker.  René Jonker was a Financial Manager at TSS 
at the time – you will recall Chair, we referred to her earlier.  
 
And it is dated 11 September 2014.  And it is forwarded 
with attachments and the narration is: 
“Please receive the ANC letters as promised.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you then take the Chair 
to the attachments ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...on pages 627 to 629? 
10 
MR POWELL:   627 to 629 is the very same draft letters that 
was sent by Patrick Makhubedu to Mr Makhubo.  This – they 
are now placed on an ANC letterhead Chair for the African 
National Congress Greater Johannesburg Region, Office of 
the National(sic) Treasurer. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry.  Regional.   
MR POWELL:   Regional.  Sorry.  Regional Treasurer.  And it 
is attention Mr Patrick Makhubedu, EOH Managed Services, 
dated 19 June 2014 and it is exactly the letter that was sent 
by Mr Makhubedu to Geoff Makhubo and it signed by Geoff 
20 
Makhubo with his title as Regional Treasurer and his cell 
number below. 
 
And then a similar letter is attached at 628.  And this 
again 
on 
the 
African 
National 
Congress, 
greater 
Johannesburg, Office of the Regional Treasurer’s letterhead 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 106 of 225 
 
and it is addressed to Mr Makhubedu, dated 19 June 2014. 
 
And this one is to thank EOH Managed Services (Pty) 
Ltd for the donation of R 3 million on 16 April 2014 with a 
similar narration on utilisation of the funds. 
 
And then the last one is the third in the series that was 
originally emailed by Mr Makhubedu to Mr Makhubo and this 
one is again on the African National Congress’s letterhead 
as stated before, dated 19 June. 
“Dear Mr Makhubo.  Re donation acceptance.” 
 
And: 
10 
“This is to acknowledge and thank EOH Managed 
Services (Pty) Ltd for the donation of R 2 million on 
13 December 2014.” 
 
Thank you, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The date on that email was 
11 September.  Can I now take you to a document at page 
782? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, the document at page 782 is a, what 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
purchase 
order 
from 
The 
City 
of 
Johannesburg.  And it is addressed to TSS Managed 
20 
Services (Pty) Ltd. 
 
And the reference is to – it comes from Supply Chain 
Management of City of Cape Town.  It is a framework order.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [laughs]  Mr Powell, we are going 
to get you used to be in Johannesburg.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 107 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Did I say Cape Town? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja.  [laughs] 
MR POWELL:   I am so sorry. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He likes Cape Town too much. 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, I have sorted out a lot of drama in 
The City of Cape Town too. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja, it comes from The City of 
Johannesburg.   
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  So the terms of payment, COJ 
10 
paid immediately without deduction and it refers to the item 
and the material, active unit. 
 
And then there is a series of numbers that refers to ICT 
Infrastructure Network WAM/LAN.  And the amount is 
R 96 265 770,63, and the total figure with that comes to 
R 109 737 278,52.  And it is signed by the buyer at The City 
of Johannesburg. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 339, 
which is a document three days later, 15 September? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we get there, and maybe the 
20 
document you are referring us to, Mr Chaskalson will 
enlighten me.  This figure, is it connected in any way with 
the proposal or something else that we have dealt with 
before or not really? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, can you answer that 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 108 of 225 
 
question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr Powell.  Okay.  But if you cannot 
remember that is fine.  I just thought the figures seems 
...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   It seems similar ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...figure I had seen before. 
MR POWELL:   It seems similar to the unsolicited proposal 
figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   To be precise there.  The 
unsolicited proposal with that was R106million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this is R109million.  So they 
are not quite ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It might not be.  Ja, okay. 
MR POWELL:   That is why I said it seems similar Chair 
because it is a very close to that number but it is not the 
exact number. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
MR POWELL:   Ja.  Mr Chaskalson, which page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   339. 
MR POWELL:   339.  Mr Chair, this document at 339, there is 
a 
Nedbank 
payment 
confirmation 
and 
it 
is 
dated 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 109 of 225 
 
15 September 2014 and it is from account details, Prime 
Molecular cheque account and then the statement on that 
account is – the narration or the description is Molelwane 
Consulting.   
 
Then 
the 
beneficiary 
statement 
description 
is 
P Makhubedu.  And it goes to an account number of 
Molelwane and that number is reflected on the document in 
the amount of R 70 000,00 and payment date is reflected as 
15 September 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then once again – because I 
10 
do not keep track of all of these entities.  Prime Molecular is 
which entity? 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
That 
is 
the 
entity 
which 
reflects 
Patrick Makhubedu as the principle Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to another 
document dated 15 September?  It appears at page 783. 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, it would be nice to be as proficient 
as Mr Chaskalson, having it all electronically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR POWELL:   You and I have to page through the binders. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
Chair, 
this 
is 
an 
email 
from 
Patrick Makhubedu 
sent 
to 
Geoff 
Makhubo 
on 
15 September 2014 and the subject is COJ Upgrade Award 
docex.  Attachments, COJ Upgrade Award doc.  And then it 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 110 of 225 
 
has got an HTT 00001 reference.   
 
And attached to that on the very next page is a draft 
letter coming from Mr Makhubedu and it is addressed, this 
draft is addressed to TSS Managed Services.   
 
So what we must remember is.  Mr Makhubedu is 
sending this to Mr Makhubo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   To say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do a letter.  Sign a letter along these lines 
on your letterheads.   
10 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m 
MR POWELL:   And that is why this whole thing is very, very 
irregular.  And it is dated 22 May 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, can I just...  The 
attachment is dated 22 May 2014. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The email was sent? 
MR POWELL:   The email was sent on the September 15t h, 
2014 Chair.  Sorry.  The email is September.  It is Updating 
20 
the Award, Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And maybe you can read that 
email. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That attachment. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 111 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  So this goes to TSS Managed 
Services: 
“Attention Mr P Makhubedu..  22 May 2014? 
Dear Mr Makhubedu.  Upgrading of The City of 
Johannesburg Network and Security Infrastructure.   
We refer to your proposal dated 16 March 2014 
submitted in response to the above-mentioned RFP. 
We have pleasure in advising you that after careful 
consideration of the proposals received and their 
evaluations 
thereof, 
your 
proposal 
has 
been 
10 
successful and you have been nominated as the 
preferred supplier of the upgrading of The City of 
Johannesburg Network and Security Infrastructure. 
Your participation in this tender process is highly 
appreciated.   
Yours faithfully.” 
 
And then it leaves a space for the signatory to sign.  
Chair, you will recall, this was an unsolicited bid.  There was 
no tender and it refers to an RFP at the top line. 
 
An RFP is a Request for Proposal.  There was no 
20 
Request for Proposal and there certainly was not a tender. 
 
Chair, and I think it is just bizarre that Makhubedu 
should be sending this to Mr Makhubo for him to sign and 
send back to himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the other letters that you referred to 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 112 of 225 
 
a few minutes ago, there were three of them, I think. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Relate 
to 
Mr Makhubo 
sent 
to 
Mr Makhubedu.  Who were sent to Mr Makhubedu in his 
capacity as Johannesburg original Treasurer ...[intervenes]    
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of the ANC, Johannesburg to sign on the 
letterheads of the ANC.  This appears to be different.  It 
cannot be a point to sign in that capacity. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair.  This looks like this is for me 
10 
him to sign in his capacity as – at The City of Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So the contemplation is that whoever 
must sign the letter appearing at page 784, would be either 
Mr Makhubo if he was part of The City of Johannesburg at 
time, or some official in The City of Johannesburg.  Is that 
correct? 
MR POWELL:   That is my understanding Chair.  You have 
summed it up perfectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, are you aware what 
20 
position within The City Mr Makhubedu occupied in 2014? 
MR POWELL:   He was previously a councillor and then he 
was MMC for Finance at The City of Johannesburg, Chair.  
And I think held the latter position in the 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is how I understand his 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 113 of 225 
 
statement to the Commission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said MEC but I think 
...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   MMC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, MMC.  Ja. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now...  So, in effect, Mr Makhubedu works 
on the basis that The City of Johannesburg is going to – 
must write a letter to him to say in effect:  You are the 
preferred bidder or whatever in regard to this tender and... 
10 
 
But he prepares the letter and it must signed by 
somebody within The City of Johannesburg addressed to 
him. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in May...  Well, he may have back-
dated it.  It may be September 2014.  This is after a series of 
payments that he seems to have been involved in. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then donating to the ANC and so on.  
And having those dealings with Mr Makhubedu.  Is that right? 
20 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And that is why the dates and the timing is 
so important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 114 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I do a lot of support to companies on 
Anti-corruption Compliance and we advise our clients that 
during any bid adjudication and even if it is an unsolicited 
bid, you should not be making any donations.  You should 
not provide anything of value.  But what we have seen is 
almost a pattern of regular solicitation of donations coupled 
to the award of these tenders.  It is almost as if the tenders 
are being granted in exchange for financial benefit to the 
party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Yes, okay.  Mr Chaskalson. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Chair, and if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR POWELL:   Is that, and to the individual, because as 
Mr Chaskalson 
has 
taken 
us 
through, 
you 
also 
see 
simultaneous injections into personal bank accounts of 
Mr Makhubo at the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I would just like to clarify.  
It is not personal bank accounts to Mr Makhubo.   
MR POWELL:   It is Molelwane. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is Molelwane Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Molelwane Consulting.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you then to go to page 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 115 of 225 
 
785?  And if you can describe the email that you see there.  
There is a – it starts with something that is forwarded from 
Patrick Makhubedu 
to 
himself. 
 
We 
do 
not 
need 
to 
...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...concern ourselves with that.  
But the forwarded email, the trials below. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Describe to the Chair what you 
see there and how you understand it. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Chair, this is an email from Ebrahim Laher 
and I mentioned Ebrahim Laher was the Head of the SAP 
Division at EOH and it is sent to Patrick Makhubedu, dated 
18 September 2014.  
 
 It copies various other employees, like, Ashley de Klerk, 
Kenton(?) Seta(?), Stephen Nokinthorn(?) at EOH.   
 
And 
the 
subject 
header 
is 
forward 
with: 
 
EOH 
Confidential COJ.  And the narration, at the start of the email 
is: 
“Hi, Patrick.  In preparation for your meeting now 
20 
with Geoff, please see below for confirmation on the 
work being done by SAP our OEM(?) are, these 
services were part of A472 that was awarded to us. 
No formal tender process was done by the COJ to 
award these projects to SAP. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 116 of 225 
 
Who signed these projects off in The City? 
Trevor has indicated to Ashley, did not know about 
this.” 
 
The Trevor referred to was a Mr Trevor Fowler who was 
a senior employee of The City at the time and it goes on to 
say: 
“SAP have now been there for about a year.  Where 
is this billing, et cetera happening?” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So can you translate this email for 
the Chair?  What is actually is asked of Patrick here? 
10 
MR POWELL:   So what it appears to be Chair is that, SAP, 
the OEM, can provide services directly.  They do not have to 
go through a reseller like EOH.  And EOH were becoming 
uncomfortable because it looks like SAP were encroaching 
on their territory.   
 
And it appears that that is what they wanted to discuss 
with Geoff to try and influence, to try and stop this 
happening.  It would appear Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Are there any other Geoff’s other 
than Mr Makhubo who you are aware of in the course of your 
20 
investigation or you have become aware of in the course of 
your investigation of EOH’s relationship with The City? 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, we have not come across another 
Geoff.  The correspondence on COJ is predominantly 
Patrick Makhubedu, Geoff Makhubo and various others, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 117 of 225 
 
Ebrahim Laher, et cetera, but certainly no other Geoff. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 787? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  Page 787 is a document on 
the African National Congress’s letterhead, Tshwane Region 
and it seems to emanate from the Office of the Regional 
Secretary.  
 
It is dated 18 September 2014 and it is addressed to:  
Whom it may concern.  EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd.  Subject:  
Request for assistance.  It starts off with warm revolutionary 
greetings. 
10 
“As per the letter dated 12 September 2014, which 
was directed to your company, the ANC in Tshwane 
had requested that your company for assistance. 
However, until to date we have not received any 
confirmation of payment from our service providers 
relating to the under mentioned services. 
The ANC is requesting that your company to 
remunerate those service providers within a week or 
during the course of next week, as we cannot 
continue with the conference if those services are 
20 
not yet remunerated. 
For the ANC to achieve or hold a successful 
conference, we therefore request the following from 
your company.” 
 
And then it has got a bullet:  As conference package for 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 118 of 225 
 
400 delegates, 300 000 and then in brackets (Sekathle 
Trading and Projects), account number.  And it is an FNB 
bank account.   
 
And then it goes on to say: 
“We are non-profit organisation with the mission to 
deliver quality services to our members and fellow 
citizens of South Africa. 
We continue to meet our goals because of thoughtful 
contributions from companies like you.” 
 
And then it has got below that: 
10 
“NB:  It will be highly appreciated if payment is 
made during the course of next week or before in 
order for us to focus on other logistics.” 
 
The date again Chair is 18 September 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then on 789, you – just turn the 
page. 
MR POWELL:   On 789, we have an attachment that was 
forwarded by Patrick Makhubedu to René Jonker and Jehan 
MacKay at EOH.  And it is headed:  Request for assistance.  
Request conference doc as the attachment.  And it seems to 
20 
be the document we have just read Chair. 
 
And then, this forwarding is from Danny/Demino(?) 
Mathila(?). 
 
mathiladn@icloud.com, 
dated 
Thursday, 
September 18, 2014. 
 
And it is – there a request for assistance sent to 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 119 of 225 
 
Patrick Makhubedu at his Gmail address and this comes from 
– it says: 
“Good day.  Kindly find the attached in order.  
Regards Demino Mathila.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do I understand that the 
attachment is that request from the Tshwane, ANC 300... for 
R 300 000,00? 
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair.  It appears to be. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 621? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, at 621, there is an email 
10 
from Patrick Makhubedu, dated 20 September 2014.  And it 
is addressed to Jehan MacKay at EOH, Ebrahim Laher at 
EOH.   
 
And it forwards the financial assistance request and 
there is an untitled DDF attachment and the narration is: 
“Hi.  Please receive the request from ANC, Joburg 
region.  Regards Patrick.” 
 
Chair, I just highlight the date again.  You will see 
20 September and this document forwarded, the document 
that 
came 
from 
Geoff 
Makhubo 
addressed 
to 
20 
Patrick Makhubedu on Friday, September the 19t h.  So the 
day before, saying: 
“Dear Patrick.  Please find the letter of funding 
request towards our regional conference expenses.  
Regards Geoff Makhubo.” 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 120 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you turn the page? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  The next page, page 622 
attaches a letter on an African National Congress, Greater 
Johannesburg Region letterhead.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I stop you there? 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Is this the document that was 
attached to the email that was ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   That is correct.  This appears to be the 
attachment to the email I just read Chair.  And this document 
10 
comes from the Office of the Regional Treasurer, Greater 
Johannesburg 
Region, ANC.  And it is addressed to 
Mr Patrick Makhubedu.   
 
And it refers to the Executive EOH Mathombo and it is 
also CC to Mr Ebrahim Laher, dated 19 September 2014.  
Request for financial assistance.   
“Dear Patrick Makhubedu.  We would like to thank 
you for the support your organisation has given to 
the ANC in the past. 
The ANC in the Greater Johannesburg Region will 
20 
be 
going 
to 
its 
conference 
from 
the 
16t h 
to 
19t h October 2014 at Cedar Park in Woodmead. 
We are expecting 500 delegates from branches, the 
leagues, the alliance, representatives of business 
and the religious sector. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 121 of 225 
 
The congress will discuss and take resolutions on 
issues like governance elections, the economic 
transformation 
and 
social 
transformation. 
 
The 
conference requires resources to execute.  We, 
therefore, humbly request a donation to cover, 
amongst 
others, 
the 
following 
expenses; 
the 
conference 
venue 
and 
the 
accommodation, 
2 
million.  Conference package and paraphernalia, 
1.2 million.  Transport and registration 600 000, 
printing documents and shirts, 250 000, other 
10 
250 000, total 4 300 000.” 
Chair, and then what follows on the next page at 623 is the 
…[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, I think – I am hoping the 
Chair ’s copy is not cut off because I think yours is 
…[intervenes] 
MR POWELL:   Oh, sorry. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because there is an important 
paragraph at the bottom of page 622. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I think it might be cut off but I got 
20 
one line, if I may read it and then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see there is no full stop at the end of 
the last sentence on page 622. 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know whether that means it is 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 122 of 225 
 
cut off or that means they stopped, they did not put in the 
full stop.   
“The Regional Executive Committee will appreciate 
contribution of at least 2,5 million to ensure a 
successful conference.” 
That is my last line. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the last.  I just did not 
understand – I did not hear Mr Powell read that last 
sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I am slightly cut off further than you 
are so thank you, that is the last line. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then of course in the following page 
that is where it says the banking details and so on. 
MR POWELL:   Correct and then it ends with: 
“Thank you, your support is highly appreciated and 
we thank you in advance for your commitment and 
contribution towards strengthening our democracy.  
Yours 
in 
democracy, 
Geoff 
Makhubo, 
Regional 
20 
Treasurer.” 
With his cell number. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask, I do not want it to be 
published but can I ask that we take a note of that cell 
number because it is going to become relevant later on.  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 123 of 225 
 
Chair, will you just write it down somewhere because it will 
become later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The cell number on page 623. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yes.  No, that is fine, I 
have taken note of it.  It does look like the ANC was quite 
active in seeking donations during these particular months. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly from EOH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, from EOH, ja.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go back to a 
10 
document that we have seen previously, it is on page 296.  
I am not sure we have actually seen this one previously.  
Oh, we have not, sorry.  I skipped over it when we were 
doing payments. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, the document at page 296 is headed 
Transactions Report and it reflects company TSS Managed 
Services and in the middle of the page it has a line 
referring to beneficiary, Malolwane Consulting. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just look at the date as 
well, Mr Powell? 
20 
MR POWELL:   Absolutely.  Apology, Mr Chaskalson, the 
date is 20 September 2014 and if we look at the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am 296, is that where you 
are too? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 124 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Yes, it is a transactions report, Chair.  And 
then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The dates that I – oh, okay, I see 20 
September, ja. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   And just below the date, Chair, is a double 
line with beneficiary branch account reference, etcetera, 
and the beneficiary is reflected as Malolwane Consulting.  
The branch number is reflected, there is an account 
10 
number and the reference is TSSMS and then Genven, G-
e-n-v-e-n and the amount …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
ja, 
beneficiary 
Malolwane 
Consulting and then the branch and the account number 
and the reference, the reference is TSSMS Genven. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair.  And the amount is 
R570 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And it is got an action date …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 20 September. 
20 
MR POWELL:   20 September 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is 20 September 2014 the date of the 
transaction? 
MR POWELL:   It appears to be, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 125 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, can you tell the Chair 
what work, if any, you found that Malolwane did in return 
for this payment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So before that just so that I understand 
this document at page 296, it says Transaction Report, it is 
produced by who?  And it is a report of what? 
MR POWELL:   It is a report of the company on financial 
transactions, payments, Chair.  And this is a …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On TSS? 
MR POWELL:   TSSMS, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   And it is a supplied as a proof of a payment 
to Malolwane referring to the preceding email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  And the items mentioned at 
the bottom there below rejection reason, legend, are those 
…[intervenes] 
MR POWELL:    I do not think it is relevant, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is not relevant. 
MR POWELL:   Because this has been processed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, what is relevant is what appears 
20 
before that namely the transaction of R570 000? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which reflects – so it would be – it 
would reflect a payment by TSS Managed Services to 
Malolwane Consulting on the 20 September 2014. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 126 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Into that account number and that 
branch. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR POWELL:   The evidence leader has just asked me 
whether I am aware of any work that was done for this 
payment and I am not, Chair.  We tried to establish if there 
was services rendered and we are not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is your – in those instances 
10 
where you say, as you do, in regard to this payment that 
you, that is you and your team, tried to establish what work 
had been done and you did not find any evidence. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, we have gone to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How would you rate that you made a 
mistake, there is evidence, depending on the thoroughness 
of your investigation.  How would you...? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, it is not impossible that there may 
be something that was done that we are not aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR POWELL:   So our process is we go to the employees 
who were involved in the project at the time and we asked 
them did you work with this entity, did you come across 
this entity?  Did they feature in the project at all?  And the 
answer was no.  The work that was done on this specific 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 127 of 225 
 
project was done by a former EOH employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   That is why I am confident, Chair, that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the former employee said they did 
not do any work. 
MR POWELL:   The former employees.  The current 
employees have concerned that they did not do work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And they have indicated that the actual 
10 
work was done by an EOH employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  But your team, your 
investigation team, would it have taken statements from 
various persons who were interviewed to say what do you 
know about this? 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would that be statements that are 
stored somewhere? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, there are statements for some 
portions where we had lodged criminal cases. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And for others we have just gathered the 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And for some of these items like the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 128 of 225 
 
request from the Commission we have responded as 
quickly as we could to get the information across. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But you feel reasonably 
confident that where you say you could not find any 
evidence of work chances are good that no work was done. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair.  Chair and the other reason 
for my confidence is that this is a common practice that we 
came across at EOH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR POWELL:   With partners on projects and I have 
10 
referred, Chair, previously to these nebulous terms on 
teaming agreements that sometimes are blank or they refer 
to broad services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   On many of the projects.  We have had a 
similar phenomenon where people are paid but they have 
not provided any services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, if I can just conclude that thought it 
comes at great cost to EOH because they tender for a 
20 
project or they do the work on a project, they pay away to 
these business partners and in some instances they do not 
even recover the money from the client or the work and 
they just lose money as a result but the ED partners, like 
in this case, Malolwane, are paid and they get their money. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 129 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Thank you.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And just to – another detail on 
this document, if you go back to 295, back a page. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just describe that 
email?   
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, 295 is an email from a 
Natalie Buchner at EOH sent to Rene Jonker on 6 October 
2014 and it says: 
“Subject:  Re:  Proof of payment Malolwane.  
10 
Attachments, 
proof 
of 
payment 
Malolwane 
Consulting PDF.” 
And that seems to refer to this document that we have just 
analysed. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And just the narrative on the 
email? 
MR POWELL:   “Please find attached proof of payment for  
Malolwane in the amount of 570 000 paid on 19 
September 2014.  Thank you and regards, Natalie 
Buchner, Accounts Payable Manager TSS Managed 
20 
Services.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then the last document in this 
2014 chronology is at page 625. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr Chaskalson.  So the 
long and short of a number of these transactions, Mr 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 130 of 225 
 
Powell, is that there were many occasions when EOH or 
other entity under EOH would pay a lot of money to 
Malolwane Consulting or Malolwane Holdings for no work 
that has been done as far as your investigation has gone. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, we will elaborate shortly but the 
same scenario happens with Mfundi and we will go into that 
10 
detail shortly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you can go to – from 
20 September to 2 October at page 625. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair, at 625 we have a Nedbank 
proof of payment.  It is head Authorised Payment Batch 
Completed and this reflects batch description:  ANC 
Greater Johannesburg account, from account TSS Managed 
Services (Pty) Ltd and an account number.  It is date 2 
October 
2014 
and 
the 
description 
is 
ANC 
Greater 
Johannesburg account, the amount, the batch total is 
20 
referred to as 1.5 million and the authoriser T2 is Jehan 
Mackay and then if we look at the narration on the table 
just below it refers to the beneficiary name, ANC Greater 
Johannesburg 
account, 
beneficiary’s 
account 
number, 
branch, once-off payment captured, beneficiary statement 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 131 of 225 
 
description is TSS Managed Services (Pty) Ltd and on the 
accountholder ’s 
description 
TSS 
Managed 
Services 
account, it reflects ANC Greater Johannesburg account as 
the description and then the amount on the right is R1.5 
million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you can just go up to 
page 624 you will see an email which attaches that proof of 
payment. 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair.  At 624 there is an 
email from Patrick Makhubedu to Geoff Makhubo dated 2 
10 
October 2014 and it forwards POP ANC.  The POP refers to 
the proof of payment we have just read, Chair, and it is a 
JPEG 
picture 
attachment, ANC 
Greater 
Johannesburg 
account, 2 October ’14 and that is sent by Patrick 
Makhubedu after he receives the same proof of payment 
from Rene Jonker at TSSMS dated 2 October 2014 and this 
is sent to Patrick Makhubedu.  So he just forwards the 
proof of payment, once it has been made, off to Geoff 
Makhubo. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Powell.  We are 
20 
going to move on to a completely new topic now.  We have 
completed our 2014 chronology.  Is there anything beyond 
that which you have said already that you would want to 
say to the Chair in relation to that 24 chronology from 
August to October that we have been looking at? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 132 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   I think my observation, Chair, as Chair 
pointed out, there was a lot of donation requests that 
coincided with the award and we have pointed out the 
anomalies in Makhubedu drafting the award to himself.  It 
is just unheard of, Chair, it is just wrong. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Powell.  Our next 
chronology deals with a tender in 2016 and for the 
purposes of this chronology, I want us to start on your 
second report at page 91 where you describe the A647 
tender of 2016.  Can you go to page 91? 
10 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, Mr Chaskalson it would be 
convenient to put in a divider or something just that will 
indicate where one finds each one of the three reports so 
that it is easier to go to it much more quicker. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I will certainly do that, Chair.  
The problem in relation to this tender is that it straddles 
both reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And so there is no one simple 
20 
place where – and for the most part I will be referring to 
documents between about pages 450 and 530 where the 
original underlying documents are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I do have to refer to some 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 133 of 225 
 
stuff attached to the original report as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But we will have your file 
organised so that the three separate reports can at least 
be partitioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So in paragraph 91 you describe 
this tender, A647.  Can you explain to the Chair what this 
tender was about and what its period was? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, the COJ SAP upgrade 
10 
tender for 2016 is referred to as the COJ tender A647 for 
SAP upgrade/implementation.  This was advertised in 
November 2015 with a closing date of 14 December 2015.  
COJ awarded this tender to EOH Mthombo on 8 June 2016 
for a price of just over 404 million including Vat.  Chair, 
again, the date will become crucial and I emphasise 8 June 
2016 
and 
if 
the 
2014 
donations 
appeared 
large 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am busy looking for June 2014 or 2016.  
Oh, here it is, ja. 
20 
MR POWELL:   Chair, if the previous donations that I 
explained and elaborated on looked large, they are about 
to be dwarfed by some significant developments that we 
will now go into detail on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 134 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So our chronology starts on 2 
November.  Can I take you to page 480?  
MR POWELL:   Just before you do, Chair, we are now at 
the heart of what EOH had discovered after they appointed 
us, after what we initially found on the investigation and 
we reported to the Hawks, to the DPCI. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Thank you.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   480. 
MR POWELL:   Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where at page 91 do I find – oh, there it 
is, the reference to 404 million.  Okay, I found that now.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, are we still on that page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, we are now going to go 
through a chronology of the emails and the like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And so we are going to page 
480. 
CHAIRPERSON:   480. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And, Chair, in relation to this 
chronology I will be referring also to four of five documents 
in flow of funds bundle 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it may be useful to have that 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 135 of 225 
 
bundle to hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think let us have that bundle at 
hand. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, this time it is more than 
one document.  It is five across the file so I think we 
should give you the whole file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ja, just give me the whole 
bundle.  He might not refer to it now.  Okay, alright.  Thank 
you.  But at this stage you just want me to go to 480? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Of bundle 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of bundle 1, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I just would like you to have 
that other file to hand because we are going to get there in 
due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR POWELL:   Thank you, Chair, at page 480 of the 
bundle we have an email from a Nyikomutileni@EOH.co.za.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is N-y-i-k-o, I think it’s Nyiko. 
MR POWELL:   Nyiko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mutileni, M-u-t-i-l-e-n-i.  Yes. 
20 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair.  Thank you and it is 
addressed to Jehan Mackay sent on 2 November 2015 and 
it forwards City of Johannesburg outsourced IT services 
and the narration starts with: 
“FYI City of Johannesburg outsource tender is out.  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 136 of 225 
 
I have prepared all team members to attend to it.  I 
have 
also 
notified 
Mr 
Makhubedu 
because 
of 
Geoff’s influence.  Thank you.” 
And he forwards an attachment from a Herman Scheepers 
and it looks like the document was forwarded to him. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then ask you to go to page 
453? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, I am sorry, Nyiko Mutileni is an EOH 
person, nè? 
10 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  He is forwarding to his bosses 
because the City is now advertising the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Chair and we are about to go into how 
upset EOH were that this was being advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, I have actually glossed 
over quite an important part of that email.  He says: 
“I have notified Mr Makhubedu because of Geoff’s 
influence.” 
20 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I have previously testified that we 
have only come across Geoff Makhubo who engages with 
Patrick Makhubedu. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 137 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR POWELL:   And it appears, I am assuming and I think 
correctly so, Chair, that this “notify Mr Makhubedu because 
of Geoff’s influence” because it is clear Mr Makhubedu has 
a very good relationship with Geoff Makhubo. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then pick up what is 
going on inside EOH by going to page 453?  We may in 
fact have to go down a little bit. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe the correct place to start 
10 
is the last of that chain of emails on 453, 7 November 2015 
at 9.39. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Which will spill onto 454. 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  Chair, on 7 November, this is at 
the bottom of that page 453, Ebrahim Laher wrote an 
email: 
“COJ are proceeding with the advertising of our 
current 
contract 
this 
week, 
this 
despite 
their 
assurance 
that 
they 
would 
rather 
extend 
our 
20 
contract.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is Mr Ebrahim Laher. 
MR POWELL:   Ebrahim Laher. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Writing to whom?  Writing to Asher 
Bohbot or…? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 138 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   It is not very clear but it is clear Mr Bohbot 
replies, so I assume it has to Mr Bohbot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If I can possibly assist.  This is 
one long email chain between Mr Bohbot and Mr Laher. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we see the two parties right 
up at the top at 453, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank. 
MR POWELL:   Correct.  Mr Chaskalson is quite correct, 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   He goes on to say that – on the next page 
at 454. 
“Also it seems that certain camps want to reduce 
the scope of this contract radically even though 
they do not have the skills to run the system or the 
billing department.  This could create a billing crisis 
again unless the plan is to somehow obtain our 
skills in another way poaching/another partner.” 
20 
And then he goes on to say: 
“Our support contract, the SAP upgrade and the IT 
outsource contracts are out at the same time.  I do 
not think they will award all three to us.  As EOH, 
our current review out of these is about 250 million 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 139 of 225 
 
per year.  The upside, if we pull this off, is to go 
about 500 million per year but I am on the maintain 
our current base page.  Anyway...” 
He reads, that is the – the next line is: 
“Anyway I suspect the next quarter is going to be a 
political minefield and we need to be proactive and 
ready for what is coming.  We cannot lose this.” 
And 
just 
before 
that, 
when 
they 
announced 
the 
advertisement of the tender – and it looks like that 
knowledge came from the City of Johannesburg, they 
10 
received intelligence that this tender is going out, the 
response from Laher was just:”“Wow!...” Chair and that is 
on 3 November on page 454.  Asher Bohbot then asks: 
“What does this mean?” 
And then Laher explains – so, Chair, I am now going to 
move forward to page 453 for the rest of that thread.  
Asher Bohbot then asks: 
“How?  What must we do?  Can we get the involved 
guys together on Monday?” 
And then Ebrahim Laher replies: 
20 
“Hi Asher, yes, we have started some stuff…” 
And the next line I want to emphasise, Chair. 
“…and have a full political and technical strategy 
for this but our team is riddled with internal politics 
and half-hearted attempts and personal agendas.  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 140 of 225 
 
Your assistance in meeting, as you indicate, will be 
essential, I think.  I will chat to Jas and set this up.  
Thanks.” 
And then Asher just replies with a thanks. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if we can go – we have 
seen that chain from 7 November, 13 November – sorry, 
sorry, 483.  If you go down to 483. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, I am on 483. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And once again can I ask you to 
start at the bottom of this email thread? 
10 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   so that we can go through it 
chronologically in time.   
MR POWELL:   It starts at the bottom, Chair, with a note 
to: 
“Hi Nyiko, please find the attached letter.  Kind 
regards Mpho Kotane.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is Mpho Kotane, M-p-h-o K-
o-t-a-n-e. 
MR POWELL:   Mpho Kotane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
“SAP 
upgrade 
programme, 
change 
management lead.” And then there seems to be a document 
attached. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you then for that 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 141 of 225 
 
document to 485? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  The document attached 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
letter 
from 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
addressed to this Nyiko Mutileni and it is addressed to 
EOH Technology and Outsourcing and it is dated 23 
October 2015 and it refers to – sorry, the header is: 
“Request promotional items for the optimisation and 
modernisation of non-SAP applications” 
And it refers to …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe – because we are going 
10 
to run out of quite a lot of time, if you can just give a 
general description of what this document is. 
MR POWELL:   Ja.  Basically it is asking for sponsorships 
of a whole lot of goodies, technical, laptops, smart phones, 
gift vouchers, power banks, memory sticks, etcetera, as 
part of a promotion prize, competition prices.  It ends after 
a description of all the items on the next page, Chair, at 
486 and it refers to: 
“Please note the competition prizes are urgent, it 
will be appreciated if you could respond by Monday 
20 
the 26 October 2015 before close of business.” 
And then: 
“Thanking you in advance, Tumelo...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tumelo Kganane. 
MR POWELL:   Kganane. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 142 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Acting 
Group 
Head 
Information, 
Communications, 
Technology 
Information 
Management.  
That is somebody from the City of Johannesburg. 
MR POWELL:   Yes Chair his email underneath describes 
himself 
as 
someone 
from 
the 
City, 
it 
is 
Thumelakje@joburg.org.za. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And the letter is from City of Johannesburg 
of course. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, and then if you can just go 
10 
back to the top of this thread at page 483, what does Nyiko 
Mutileni do with this? 
MR POWELL:   At the top we see that Nyiko Mutileni sends 
this to Jehan Mackay and he copies Jaze Gordon, at the 
time Jaze Gordon was Jehan Mackay’s personal assistant, 
and it is dated 13 November 2015, request for donation 
and promotional items attaching the document, the letter 
and it reflects: 
“Hi Jehan, 
Please approve the request from COJ.” 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if I can take us forward a 
week, almost a week, and ask you to go to page 483 – 
sorry 456. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you could describe the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 143 of 225 
 
email at the top of the page, I’m not needing you to 
describe the whole thread, just the…[intervenes]. 
MR POWELL:   This document at 456, Chair, is an email 
from Ebrahim Laher to Asher Bohbot dated 20 November 
2015 and the subject is, City of Johannesburg A649 
Support, 
“Hi Asher, the CAJ Support tender has come out we 
have our work cut out and meeting with Parks’ 
people tomorrow afternoon”, 
 
At the time, Chair, Parks Tau was the Executive 
10 
Mayor, that email goes on to say, 
 
“Have spoken to Pat and Jehan and will manage 
that angle separately”,  
 
And, Chair, I’m presuming the Pat refers to Patrick 
Makhubedu who seems to have been integral to City of 
Johannesburg, 
“Am hopeful we will know more after tomorrow and 
then there’s a line below that, good intel on COJ 
from Sal today at SAP UK, Regards Ebrahim Laher”. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if we can go to page 487.  
20 
MR POWELL:   Chair, if I may just bring the connection, 
the earlier emails that we looked at the, EOH Team 
referred to a technical and a political strategy and I 
suspect that this, spoken to Pat and Jehan and will 
manage that angle separately, refers to a political strategy, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 144 of 225 
 
thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Powell.  Can I ask 
you to go to page 487, and here, unfortunately we have a 
copy that is very poor in the printed versions but I think 
that you may have the text from the electronic version 
separately. I’m interested to begin with – there’s a thread 
again and I’m interested in the piece of the thread, it says: 
“On 
1 
December 
2015 
at 
12:08pm, 
Patrick 
Makhubedu wrote”.  
 
Chair I’m not sure – I’m talking from if you go down 
10 
the document on page 487. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You’ll see at a certain point, 
lines start going down the left-hand side of your page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, there’s the first line, it says, 
“hi Pate”, there’s the second…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then there’s, just above the 
second line, on 1 December 2015 at 12:08, Patrick 
20 
Makhubedu wrote…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, there is that email that says, 
“Hi Pat, please call him and let you and I meet him, 
from Ashley”, 
 
Are you now referring to, below that? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 145 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Below that indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what is below that is not legible at 
all on my copy. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, Chair we will get an 
enhanced copy made available…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if I read it…[intervenes]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I read out what the section 
that I’m interested in emphasising? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It says, on 1 December 2015 at 
10 
8:21am Ebrahim Laher wrote: 
 
“Hi Guys,  
Quick update on the consortia talks for the bid. 
Deloitte have pulled out of the bid they think they 
will get the PMO”. 
 
Sorry Mr Powell do  you know what the PMO stands 
for? 
MR POWELL:   No, I’m not certain Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Going back to the text of the 
email, 
20 
“Trevor has apparently assured them!  I have asked 
Ashley to contact KPMG as per Pat’s conversation 
with 
Jeff. 
 
HDS 
want 
to 
pull 
out

to…[indistinct 5.51].  Pat…[indistinct 5.52] hasn’t 
heard from EMC, nothing from Ascentia, Regards 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 146 of 225 
 
Ebrahim Lehar”. 
 
The 
passages, 
I 
would 
emphasise 
Chair, 
are, 
update on the consortia talks for the bid, so they’re talking 
about putting together a consortium. 
“I have asked Ashley to contact KPMG, as per Pats’ 
conversation with Jeff”. 
 
Then can I take you up the page to the legible email 
at the top of the page from Jehan Mackay on 2 December 
2015? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair, and I may just add, I can 
10 
confirm what Mr Chaskalson has read because I have seen 
the original, unfortunately my copy, like yours is unclear, 
but I do confirm the content of that email.  The next one 
that Mr Chaskalson referred to is Jehan Mackay, Ray COJ 
upgrade consortium, 2 December 2015 he writes to Ashley 
de Klerk and he copies Patrick Makhubedu, Ebrahim Laher, 
Neyeko Mutheleni as well as Kurton Seta [7.00 ?], these 
are all EOH employees: 
 
“Hi Guys, 
 
Can we please ensure that our bids to COJ, we 
20 
commit that a certain percentage of the work and revenue 
will be allocated to Josie at Work Programme and we need 
to provide more or less an estimate on how many SME’s 
this allocation will benefit and number of jobs created from 
our meeting last night, this part is very critical.  In 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 147 of 225 
 
addition, please can we include an option D in the upgrade 
that basically, includes upgrade plus support and the 
potential value proposition to the city for combining, which 
obviously should be price.  We should be aggressive as 
this can be used to justify, giving us both upgrade and 
support”, 
 
The next line, Chair, is EBS: 
 
“Ebs/Pat, we need a number urgently that can be 
allocated for goodwill to the organisation and behind 
goodwill they’ve got the …[intervenes]”. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It’s a colon in brackets, so what 
does that symbolise? 
MR POWELL:   It’s usually a smiley face Chair and the 
EBS that’s referred, that appears to be a reference to 
Ebrahim Laher and abbreviation of his name and the Pat 
appears to be Patrick Makhubedu who he is in the stream, 
thanks Jehan and then…[intervenes]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, can I just ask you to 
comment on that last sentence, what is Jehan Mackay 
saying to EBS and Pat? 
20 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, they’re going to give benefits to 
the City of Joburg. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We may disagree, Mr Powell. 
MR POWELL:   Sorry, they’re going to give benefits – 
they’re going to provide goodwill to the organisation so it’s 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 148 of 225 
 
to build in some allowance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We’ll come to see which 
organisation gets the benefit later. 
MR POWELL:   Yes, Mr Chair, that was a Freudian slip, I 
think Chair knows which organisation I was referring to. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The closing date of the 
bid…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Chaskalson, I just want to 
understand that last sentence, is that we need a number 
10 
urgently that can be allocated for goodwill, then smile, to 
the organisation.  That number is supposed to be what, 
money? 
MR POWELL:   It’s money yes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand it. 
MR POWELL:   We need to build in a goodwill figure, Mr 
Chair, so if I draw the link between the dots it appears to 
be, we will need to make a donation to the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   And when we look at what transpires, it 
20 
would appear that what I just suggested is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Yes Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if -  you’ll recall that – I 
don’t need to take you back there because you’ve already 
mentioned this but I want to just locate this point in the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 149 of 225 
 
chronology at page 91 when you were describing the 
tender you mentioned that the closing date was 14 
December.  So, in the chronology we can just record 14 
December as closing date for the bids.  The next point in 
the chronology that I would like to refer you to is in, flow of 
funds, Bundle 3 at page 646. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, 646. 
MR POWELL:   Chair if you just go back to 645, you’ll see 
that this document is part of a bank statement and it’s 
Molelwane Consulting CC [11.29?] FNB, business cheque 
10 
account and their number and then Mr Chaskalson is 
referring me to page 646, Chair and on 646, if we have a 
look at the document…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, don’t speak too far away from the 
mic, Mr Powell. 
MR POWELL:   Apologies, Chair, I’ve got too many files in 
front of me, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, at page 646. 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
Mr 
Chaskalson, 
do 
you 
want 
me 
to…[intervenes]. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, I forgot I’m supposed to 
be asking questions here.  Can you go to an entry on 1 
February? 
MR POWELL:   1 February, Mr Chair, there’s a magtape 
credit, Patrick Makhubedu Mfundi R200 000. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 150 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you just look at the 
balance in Molelwane was before this transfer from Mfundi 
into Molelwane? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I’ve mentioned before, we’ve seen a 
pattern, this time the balance was R63.19.  So, there was 
almost nothing in that account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s the account of Molelwane 
Consulting CC? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
the 
description, 
P 
Makhubedu…[intervenes]. 
MR POWELL:   P Makhubedu Mfundi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that mean it comes from Mfundi to 
Makhubedu? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, maybe if I can take Mr 
Powell 
to 
another 
document 
which 
will 
answer 
your 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you go to page 344 of the – 
20 
Bundle 1 not Bundle 3, we can leave Bundle 3 for now, 
we’ll come back to it a little later …[indistinct 13.32]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   341? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   344, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 151 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Chair, I’m afraid I played a 
card too soon because I’m going to show you a very 
interesting document which I was hoping to defer to much 
later.  I’d ask you not to – we will come back to it and 
unpick it in great detail.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I just want to refer to 
something 
in 
that 
regard, 
344, 
have 
you 
got 
that 
document? 
MR POWELL:   I’ve got it Chair. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you describe that document 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
and 
then 
I’ll 
take 
you 
to 
the 
attachments? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly,  this document on 344, Chair, is 
an email from Reno Barry and the email address is 
renob@renobarryconsulting.co.za and it is dated 6 January 
2017 to Patrick Makhubedu, subject, “Mfundi ANC recon”, 
and it has an attachment, “Mfundi GM, ANC, updated 13 
August 2016 spreadsheet and Mfundi Management Report, 
December 2016 spreadsheet, the narration is: 
20 
 
“Hi Patrick, 
Attached is the last ANC recon I have, showing an 
amount of R560 000 still to go, however, there 
might be payments made afterwards that must be 
added to the recon to reduce this balance, see 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 152 of 225 
 
columns for August and September 2016 or items 
not included.  Please advise if any items must be 
added to the recon”. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I don’t want you to go through 
the whole of this document yet, because it’s a long 
document and we need to get there in due course but what 
I do – if you can go to the document at 346 which is – first 
can you confirm whether this is – if you go 345 there’s one 
document, 346, are those the attachments to that email? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair, so there’s a first attachment 
10 
and Mr Chaskalson is going to the second attachment to 
that email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, the first attachment is the one at 
345? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, and we’ll come back to that one 
later, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you’ll recall earlier that we 
took the Chairperson to some Management accounts of 
Mfundi Mobile in 2014 that looked in a similar – that had a 
20 
similar format.  Can I ask you to look at the document at 
346 and describe to the Chair, what this document is? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, just apologies, my copy is, again, 
cut off slightly so there’s – Mfundi Management Report 
dated 
December 
2016 
and 
this 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 153 of 225 
 
Management Report, there’s a narration at the top, that’s 
cut off, Mr Chaskalson so if you don’t mind, can I ask that 
you read that in and then I will continue? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It says, 
 
“Profit and loss report”. 
MR POWELL:   Profit and loss, I’ve only got the loss 
report…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Powell, you referred to the 
date of December 2016, but I only see 1 March 2016 to 28 
February 2017 on page 346, am I on the right page, is 346 
10 
the right page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is the right page Chair, I think 
the document has got a potentially misleading title, it may 
be that you say it in a running Management Report 
spreadsheet, 
running 
accounts 
that 
go 
beyond 
2016 
because the heading of the document itself, describes – 
no, no, no I take that back Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says profit and loss report. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it says, below that, Mfundi Mobile 
20 
Networks Pty Ltd, and then it says, date range 1 March 
2016 to 28 February 2017.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That’s correct Chair,  and if you 
look at the columns, you’ll see they end in December, they 
don’t run through to January and February.  So, they’re 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 154 of 225 
 
monthly columns…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, now – I thought he was 
mentioning a particular date and I was looking for it so – 
okay, so you’re talking about the column under December? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Not yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   He was just describing the name 
of the document that’s attached to the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright, not that’s fine.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now Mr Powell, I’m not sure if 
10 
the copy that you have to hand has the – has a left-hand 
side margin or if it cuts off, the descriptions on the left-
hand side? 
MR POWELL:   It’s got half of the wording, so I know 
there’s a narration for a travel company. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, well let’s – before we get to 
travel company, if I can just read the narrations on the left-
hand side into the record, starting off under sales, the first 
item under sales is: 
 
“Sales-COJ SAP support special”, 
20 
 
And that’s the item where you’ll find an entry in 
July, is that legible on your copy? 
MR POWELL:   Half of the narration. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well then, I’m afraid, I may have 
to read these narrations verbatim…[intervenes]. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 155 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson, let me try and just 
follow, I’ve just made a note just above the…[indistinct 
19.51] to say that’s all 2016, is that correct? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright and he said sales.  My first 
reference to sales is “Sales COJ SAP support”, is that 
correct? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That’s correct, SAP support 
special, this is a special sale that Mfundi pulled off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In July what did they get for 
their special sale relating to the COJ SAP support? 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, this seems to refer to R16million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, R16million was reflected as 
a – well an amount due to Mfundi in respect of its special 
sale and then – we’ll come back to this document in detail 
and I hope by that stage to have a better copy put in front 
of you but for now I’m interested in some of the costs of 
sales, well just one for now and the – I think that I – I’m 
not making the point that I’d hoped to make, we’ll have to 
20 
come back to this document later, after all of that diversion 
and sort of raising expectations my point falls flat, so let’s 
move on, I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We were on 1 s t of February when 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 156 of 225 
 
Mfundi was paid – when Mfundi paid Molelwane R200 000, 
can I take us to the 3 r d of February on page 488, I 
apologise for that lengthy diversion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remain at page 346? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, 488, Chair, 488. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is 488 of money flows Bundles 1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That’s correct Chair, I’m 
interested in the part of the email string that appears at 
the bottom of the page, the email headed, from Ebrahim 
Lehar, the last email on the page from Ebrahim Lehar 
10 
dated Wednesday 3 February 2016.  Mr Powell can you 
address that email for the Chair? 
MR POWELL:   Absolutely, so this is an email from 
Ebrahim Lehar, and it’s dated Wednesday 3 February 2016 
and it’s addressed to Ashley de Klerk, Kirton[?] Sita [?], 
Steven Lurkenthorn[?] and various other EOH employees 
and it’s headed – subject header is, “status of stuff” and it 
starts with: 
 
“Hi Guys, 
I’ve been running around like crazy and haven’t had 
20 
time to debrief you on all the key things that I’ve 
been involved in and I need to share with you.  
COJ, am very concerned about the city allowing 
people to re-price.  It seems to be a way to catch us 
out on scope, we need to be careful here”, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 157 of 225 
 
 
And then the point below that is actions: 
 
“I will meet with Geoff”. 
 
And then below that it talks about – my copy is 
illegible on the first word, 
“Someone 
and 
I 
need 
to 
meet 
with 
Dada…[Intervenes]”.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is Ash and I, who is that? 
MR POWELL:   Asher Bohbot Chair, the Chief Executive 
Officer of EOH at the time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And who is Dada? 
10 
MR POWELL:   Chair, it escapes me at the moment. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay well let’s not go further 
down this email because the critical point, for our purposes 
today is actions, “I will meet with Geoff”. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we go down the chronology 
again and go back into volume 3 – Bundle 3 and go to page 
652.  
MR POWELL:   Chair, just before I go into 652, I’ll just 
identify, this is the second page of a bank statement for 
20 
Molelwane Consulting and it’s a Gold business account 
with the account number and …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On what page, 651? 
MR POWELL:   Correct and the statement date is 17 May 
2016 and Mr Chaskalson is going to take me to the 25 t h of 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 158 of 225 
 
April…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry just hang on one second Mr 
Powell. 
MR POWELL:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’re saying the bank statement at 
page 651? 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say what is the date, I see 16 
April 2016 to 17 May, that’s the date you are talking about? 
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR POWELL:   And on page 652 we look at 25 April you’ll 
see 
that 
there 
is 
a 
magtape 
credit, 
description, 
P 
Makhubedu and the amount is R50 000 and if I may pre-
empt Mr Chaskalson’s next question, Chair, the balance 
preceding this deposit, was R617.77, so the account was 
almost depleted and it got this deposit from Patrick 
Makhubedu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, it’s like there’s a pattern, when the 
account is very low then there’s a top-up? 
20 
MR POWELL:   Exactly, Chair, that’s what it clearly looks 
like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, if I can take you to page 
346 and 347 which is the Mfundi Mobile cost of sales and if 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 159 of 225 
 
you can start on page 346 just to get the month heading 
because on 347 where I’ll take you the headings don’t 
appear, I want to make the point that the second column is 
April. 
MR POWELL:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON 
SC:   So, if you go 
down to 
347…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay firstly at 346 that’s a bank 
statement. 
MR POWELL:   So, we’ve got to go to…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   For Molelwane Consulting CC. 
MR POWELL:    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, Chair, that’s the document 
we were looking at a minute or so ago, if we go back up to 
344, I think it will be – yes 344, there’s the email from 
Reno Barry to Patrick Makhubedu attaching the last ANC 
recon and his management report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m at Bundle 3. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I’m sorry we should be 
back in Bundle 1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 1 and what page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   344 is the covering email again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes, I’ve got it. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 160 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And so that was the Barry to 
Makhubedu email with the ANC recon and the management 
report and the management report itself, which talks about 
the special COJ SAP support for R16million and the costs 
of sales, that’s the document from 346. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And on 346, Chair, I’d just ask 
you to note that the second column is April, month April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the last column is total. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last column is? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Total. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, if we go down to 347 and we 
see the second line item. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That line item is Molelwane 
Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Unfortunately, in the April 
20 
column there’s an amount but it’s illegible but if we go 
across to the total, we can see what that amount is, 
because it’s the only amount on that line, so the total 
which is the far column on the right…[intervenes]. 
MR POWELL:   That is the R50 000 that we’ve just referred 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 161 of 225 
 
to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it R50 000 I thought it was R400 000? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, R400 000 is just below it, 
that’s the third line item. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, I think – no I was drawing a 
line and I’m not using a ruler so – ja okay so it’s that 
R50 000. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we’ve just seen - referred to 
a 
payment 
from 
– 
a 
payment 
with 
reference 
Patrick 
Makhubedu on 22 April of R50 000.00 what do we infer from 
10 
this set of accounts?  Who made that payment? 
MR POWELL:  It appears in the Mfundi documents so clearly 
it looks like Mfundi made the payment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then we go to page 194 which is a 
document we have seen before.  Can you start with the date 
of this document? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Chair this document is dated 30 
April 2016 and it is a Molelwane Holdings Pty Limited Tax 
Invoice addressed to TSS Managed Services Pty Limited and 
20 
attention Patrick Makhubedu – Mr P Makhubedu and it – the 
description there is Professional Services Lan and Wan 
services rendered as per agreement.  Lan and Wan Services 
R500 000.00 and I think Chair noted that there is no date of 
when the services were rendered previously.   And the value 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 162 of 225 
 
at the bottom with VAT is R570 000.00 and the reference 
again is to Molelwane Consulting bank account.  So it is that 
anomaly I drew Chair’s attention to where the invoice says 
Holdings but the account is consulting. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  For present purposes the point I 
want to make is that on 30 April 2016 a Molelwane invoice – 
well is sent to TSS Managed Services.  Have you been able 
to identify the services in respect of which Molelwane was 
invoicing? 
MR POWELL:  No Chair I have – I have answered this 
10 
previously we could not find the services being provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your question Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  What services has Mr Powell been 
able to identify as having been provided? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
For 
Molelwane 
[speaking 
over 
one 
another]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In respect of this invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And he – the answer is none 
as far as you … 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR POWELL:  And if I can add I mentioned previously we 
spoke to people who worked on the project.  We also did 
extensive email reviews and normally when it is an on-going  
project there is exchanges of progress – nothing of the sort 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 163 of 225 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I ask this question?  In the course of 
your investigation did you establish whether Molelwane 
Holdings Pty Limited during the times when it sent invoices 
but those – the money – the payment went into Molelwane 
Consulting?  Did you establish whether Molelwane Holdings 
Pty Limited did have a bank account? 
MR POWELL:  No Chair we have not gone that far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be interesting to … 
MR POWELL:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To find out whether Molelwane Holdings 
Pty Limited did have a bank account. 
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But money was not put into that account. 
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether it did not have a bank account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair that certainly something the 
commission can establish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Relatively easy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR POWELL:  Chair if I may say you know we were not 
investigating Molelwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR POWELL:  But when the commission asked us to see if 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 164 of 225 
 
there is any documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR POWELL:  We found a lot of documents as Chair can 
see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The next stage in the chronology 
after 30 April is to be found at pages 495 to 497.  And again 
this is an email string but maybe we can start at 495 and if 
you can read up the string and tell the Chair what is here? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Chair at 495 we have an email 
10 
from Ebrahim Laher dated Saturday 9 March 2019 – sorry 
this cannot be the right page. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No you are on the right page if you 
can go down the string. 
MR POWELL:  Oh sorry. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So – because it goes to from Nyiko 
Mutileni. 
MR POWELL:  Ja.  So we have got 17 May 2016 Nyiko 
Mutileni writes to Ebrahim Laher at EOH.  The subject 
header Request for Sponsorship and he seems to forward 
20 
this request and the request below is from Nboniseni 
Nemaangani at City of Johannesburg. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And just for the record if I can 
spell that out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 165 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Nboniseni and Nemaangani – 
Nemaangani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
MR POWELL:  Thank you Mr Chaskalson.  This document is 
then forwarded to Ebrahim Laher and it appears … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can I take you to the next 
page with is 427.   
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  First can you confirm is this the 
document that had the request for the sponsorship? 
10 
MR POWELL:  497? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  497 yes. 
MR POWELL:  Correct.  This appears to be the request for 
sponsorship and it refers to a request for sponsorship New 
York trip.  It is addressed to – it looks like a Mr Tinyiko 
Mutileni.  I do not know if that is another name of the Nyiko 
Mutileni that we referred to. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think Nyiko is an abbreviation of 
Tinyiko. 
MR POWELL:  Thank you.   And it is basically a request for 
20 
sponsorship trip New York trip and  
“Please receive our request for sponsorship 
in pursuance of the trip to City of New York.  
The 
trip 
is 
from 
1 
to 
10 
June 
2016.  
Delegates will be able to attend student 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 166 of 225 
 
exhibition, be part of the celebration of 
completion of the global partners junior 
2015/2016 curriculum which is focussed on 
arts in cities around the world.” 
 
And it goes on to say: 
“The program is managed by the spouse of 
the 
Executive 
Mayor 
of 
the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg Ms Felisiwe Twala Tau under 
[00:07:15] by the GDS 2030 vision of a 
resilient 
sustainable 
and 
liveable 
10 
communities that has been created.  The 
program is located within the office of the 
Executive Mayor but structured to be self-
funding and community driven.” 
 
And there it refers to: 
“Attached is the quotation from the travelling 
agent for ease of reference and he requests 
favourable consideration.” 
 
And then there is another document on 498 and it is 
headed NYC Global Partners and this is addressed to 
20 
Nboneseni Nemaangani that Mr Chaskalson just spelt out a 
moment ago and it is an invitation to take part in this event.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So the invitation comes on 26 
February the request to EOH to Mr Mutileni is dated 3 March 
and that gets forwarded by Mr Mutileni to Mr Laher on 17 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 167 of 225 
 
May and… 
MR POWELL:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And 17 May is where we are in the 
– in our overall chronology of the A647 bid.  Can we then go 
onto page 501?  And at the top of the page what – well that 
is – there is a string.  I am interested in the email dated 19 
May that is the third email in the string. 
MR POWELL:  Just one second.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  501.   
MR POWELL:  The second email in the string is an email 
10 
from Geoff Makhubo sent to Asher Bohbot copying Patrick 
Makhubedu and Jehan Mackay as well as Ebrahim Laher and 
it is dated 19 May 2016 and its subject is Request for 
Donation. 
“Dear Mr Bohbot please find request letter 
for a donation.  As you are probably aware 
we have twelve weeks to elections and the 
costs are escalating.  We request a response 
of the earliest convenience.  We hope that 
our 
request 
will 
meet 
your 
favourable 
20 
consideration. 
 
Regards 
Geoff 
Makhubo 
Regional 
Treasurer 
ANC 
Greater 
Johannesburg Region.” 
And that same cell number for Mr Makhubo that Chair 
recorded earlier. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 168 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So we will get to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reference to elections there in 2016 
must have been a reference to the local government 
elections? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016 okay. 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We will get to the request in a 
minute – the attached request for donations.  I just want to 
orient ourselves again to the tender that we are talking about 
10 
A647 has it been awarded yet? 
MR POWELL:  No it is pending. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is pending.  Can – let us go to 
that letter itself and that starts at page 499. 
MR POWELL:  Chair at page 499 we find an African National 
Congress letter Greater Johannesburg Region Office of the 
Regional Treasurer directed to Mr Asher Bohbot Group Chief 
Executive Officer at EHO Mthombo Pty Limited copying 
Jehan Mackay, Ebrahim Lehar, Patrick Makhubedu dated 19 
May 2016.  Request for Financial Assistance.

therefore the election campaign will be full 
steam 
starting 
with 
the 
local 
manifesto 
launch 
and 
unveiling 
of 
our 
Mayoral 
candidate. 
 
As 
discussed 
with 
your 
colleagues 
in 
previous 
meetings 
these 
activities require resources to execute and 
10 
the elections budget is R50 million.  The 
Regional 
Executive 
Committee 
humbly 
requests and will appreciate contribution and 
transfers as per timelines below.”   
 
And then there is a table Chair.  The table reflects 
date of transfer and the amount and it reflects 18 May 2016 
R5 million.  30 May 2016 R5 million.  15 June 2016 R10 
million.  30 June 2016 R10 million.  22 July 2016 R10 
million.  1 August 2016 R4million.  15 August 2016 R3 
million.  30 August 2016 R3 million.  The total is the 
20 
R50 000.00 and then it provides the… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You said R50 000. 
MR POWELL:  Ag R50 million as we said earlier Chair.  
Apologies.   
“And then what follows are the account 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 170 of 225 
 
details and the statement that these are 
important activities in the calendar of the 
ANC 
and 
our 
mandate 
renewal 
by 
the 
electorate. 
 
Your 
support 
is 
highly 
appreciated and we thank you in advance for 
your commitment and contribution towards 
strengthening 
democracy. 
 
Yours 
in 
Democracy signed Geoff Makhubo Regional 
Treasurer with the cell number.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I just want to check that I have the 
10 
right reference here.  Can I then ask you to go to – sorry that 
was 19 May.  If we go back to 25 May – sorry if we go back 
to 194.  No, no, no not 194 sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  193. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Still on Bundle 1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Still on Bundle 1 Chair.  
MR POWELL:  Chair 193 there is an email from Patrick 
Makhubedu dated 25 May 2016 sent to Rene Jonker.  Rene 
Jonker Chair will recall is the Finance person at EOH and it 
20 
attaches invoice 22 April 2016 pdf.  And the narration is very 
short. 
“Hi please pay this asap.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if we go over the page we see 
the invoice that we have now seen several times before 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 171 of 225 
 
which is the Molalwane invoice for R500 000.00? 
MR POWELL:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then can we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite a large sum going into 
Molalwane Consulting particularly if there is no work that 
was done.  Yes Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we go to page 194.1 and 
Chair I just want to make sure that you have 194.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes I have. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you describe to the Chair what 
194.1 is? 
MR POWELL:  Yes if we start at the bottom of the page it 
looks like this was a purchase order -  a purchase approval 
that was sent to – on 26 May 2016 to Rob Godlington.  Rob 
Godlington was one of the Executives at EOH and he 
received this purchase order approval request and it spoke 
about the R570 000.00 amount and it referred to Mololwane 
Consulting and it was requested by Wesley Van Rheede and 
20 
the date was 26 May.  He then writes Rob Godlington writes 
to Peter Wynne at EOH regarding the purchase order 
approval: 
“Hi Peter.  What is this for?  Cheers Rob.” 
 
And then Peter Wynne at the top of the page Chair 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 172 of 225 
 
replies Thursday May 26 9:05 pm to Rob Godlington 
“Hi Rob.  ED for City of Joburg.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you just remind the Chair what 
ED is? 
MR POWELL:  Ja.  Chair that is the abbreviation for 
Enterprise 
Development. 
 
So 
it 
usually 
involved 
empowerment spend to develop small SME’s. 
MR POWELL:  Thank you. 
MR POWELL:  I would not have thought Molelwane would 
have qualified Chair but so let me continue. 
10 
“ED for City of Joburg it was budgeted for in 
the financial year 16 numbers.  I asked Rene 
for a schedule at the time of ED payments 
budgeted when we compile the budgets then 
if the amount is in the budget I do not ask 
any further questions.” 
 
 
He goes on to say: 
“If you would like me to get more info and the 
historic payment details for this ED partner 
then I know that Rene will have it.  I have 
20 
asked 
Rene 
to 
provide 
details 
of 
ED 
payments for SASSA and that is the Social 
and Security Agency as there were some 
factual inaccuracies in the numbers I quoted 
in my email earlier this week.” 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 173 of 225 
 
 
This is something else Chair. 
“The initial number R2 million and not R3 
million for SASSA.” 
So essentially what he 
is saying here is Godlington wanted to know 
what is the PO for and they said Enterprise 
Development for City of Joburg.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we then go to page 503 our last 
exchange was on 26 May – this Godlington win exchange 
about paying the invoice.  On the same day something else 
happens.  If we go to page 503.   
10 
MR POWELL:  If I may say Chair the enquiry as to the 
purchase order what is this all about seems to have been 
very superficial because if management had dug into this 
that should have raised red flags. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course was Peter or somebody said I do 
not ask questions? 
MR POWELL:  That is also disturbing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR POWELL:  It is people looking the other way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  Mr Chaskalson. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we go to 503 what do we see? 
MR POWELL:  At 503 Chair we have got an email from Geoff 
Makhubo sent to Patrick Makhubedu copying in Ibrahim 
Laher and Jehan Mackay and the subject is Progress on 
Donation Request and Mr Makhubo writes: 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 174 of 225 
 
“Dear Patrick, Jehan and Ibrahim.  I have 
sent a couple of letters of request to your 
good selves as a sequel to the meetings we 
had. 
 
The 
last 
letter 
had 
cash 
flow 
requirements starting this week.  I have – I 
have communicated our agreements to the 
ANC 
Leadership 
especially 
the 
Regional 
Office Bearers and Province.  I have also 
committed expenditure to ensure that we get 
renewal of our mandate of transforming 
10 
Johannesburg.  This I have done because of 
the positive experience I have with you.  Can 
you please give me feedbacks on the – give 
me feedback on the requests as we have a 
launch rally on the 4 June 2016 and of 
course we need to accelerate campaigning.  
Please, please come to the party as we are 
relying on you.  Regards Geoff Makhubo with 
his cell number.” 
 
So he is following up on that unpaid request from the 
20 
ANC on the R50 million donation. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And at this stage has the tender 
been awarded yet? 
MR POWELL:  Not yet.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we then go to Bundle 3 page 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 175 of 225 
 
267?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it 267 or 367? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 3 page 267.  Bundle 3.  
And if you can just describe to the Chair the document 
there? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair the document before us on 
page 267 of Bundle 3 is a Molelwane Consulting CC account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I – can I just ask you to 
describe to the Chair how – to report to the Chair how this 
account is described because there are two Molelwane 
10 
accounts and we are going to be going. 
MR POWELL:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  To another one shortly. 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  This one is described as 
Molelwane Consulting CC and it has a CK registration 1997 
salary account as the header Chair.  And then it refers to a 
gold business account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then if you can go over the 
page at page 268 there is an entry on the 30 May. 
MR POWELL:  Certainly Chair on 30 May there is an 
20 
electronic magtape credit – apologies – TSS MS Pty Limited 
and it is the 570 that we referred to earlier Chair.  And if I 
follow and pre-empt Mr Chaskalson’s next question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR POWELL:  The balance in that account was R268.00  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 176 of 225 
 
just before this large cash inflow of R570 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that is on the 30 May can I 
staying in the same bundle but going to page 849. 
MR POWELL:  849.  Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And 849 is a table that the 
commission 
has 
extracted 
of 
transactions 
between 
Molelwane Consulting accounts and the two colons on the 
left hand side are the two different Molelwane accounts.  The 
salary account and the current accounts and these are 
10 
transactions out of either of those accounts into the account 
of Mr Makhubo’s – Mr Makhubo’s personal account.  It is the 
commission’s document. Can I ask you to go down to 31 May 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Chaskalson.  You say this 
document 
at 
page 
849 
represents 
payments 
into 
Mr 
Makhubo’s personal account, is that right? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The – indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So the transaction amount – the 
20 
second column from the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Is the amount that is paid into Mr 
Makhubo’s account from one of the two Molelwane accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I – either Holdings or Consulting 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 177 of 225 
 
CC? 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
They 
both 
are 
Molelwane 
Consulting accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But CC’s accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh CC not Holdings. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But the CC has two bank accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Yes thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we go to 31 May. 
MR POWELL:  31 May 2016 there it reflects a transfer – 
10 
internet transfer R50 000.00 and it – the narration is 
Payment to Mr Makhubo’s FNB account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is the commission’s narration 
I should add.  And underneath that? 
MR POWELL:  There is another transfer of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry the one you have just dealt with did 
you say 31 May 2016? 
MR POWELL:  31 May 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is it that amount of R50 000.00? 
MR POWELL:  Correct Chair and the one that I am referring 
20 
to is immediately below that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR POWELL:  Is R200 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is R200 000.00? 
MR POWELL:  Ja. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 178 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR POWELL:  I think what Mr Chaskalson seems to be 
pointing out Mr Chair is that the monies go to Molelwane 
Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR POWELL:  And then find its way to Mr Makhubo’s 
personal account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed that is what I am inferring.  
It is an issue we will take up further with Mr Makhubo when 
10 
he comes on Friday.  If I might just take you back to Bundle 
3 at page 270 you will see how those two transactions are 
reflected in the books – in the account of Molelwane.  So if 
we start at 269 we have the statement from 30 May to 30 
June.  And if one looks at 31 May the first line item – the 
first two line items are – just have the description transfer 
and are both for R50 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said page 269 of Bundle 3?  Are you at 
269? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh so 269 is the cover page for 
20 
the bank account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh then we go to 270? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And what transaction – what date? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  31 May.  And Chair you will recall 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 179 of 225 
 
there were two transactions on the commission’s spread 
sheet one for R50 000.00, one for R200.  One of the first two 
transactions on 31 May with the simple description Transfer 
would be the R50 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
Because 
there 
were 
two 
R50 000.00 transfers out of this account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  With no further description.  Then 
on 31 May we see the R200 000.00 with the – sorry a bit 
10 
lower down – below the Geoff Pardy reference we see 
transfer R200 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we then go to page 504?  
Sorry 504 in Bundle 1 not in Bundle 3.  We in Bundle 3 we 
need to go back to Bundle 1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  504 on Bundle 1. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So we – our chronology has taken 
20 
us to 31 May thus far.  Can you describe to the Chair that 
you see on page 504? 
MR POWELL:  Certainly.  Chair the letter on page 504 is the 
– a letter from the City of Johannesburg.  It is a registered 
letter sent to EOH Mthombo attention Ebrahim Laher. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 180 of 225 
 
“Dear Sir/Madam.  And it refers to Proposal 
number A647 request for proposal for the 
appointment of service provider for the SAP 
implementation/upgrade for period of three 
years.  Kindly be advised that your offer in 
respect 
of 
an 
appointment 
of 
services 
provided for the SAP implementation/upgrade 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Executive 
Adjudication Committee at its meeting held 
on 2 June 2016.” 
10 
 
So Mr Chaskalson referred Chair to the fact that the 
last communication was end of May.  Just over a week later 
we now have the award… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Two days later. 
MR POWELL:  Two days later apologies.  We now have the 
award Chair and then there is – reflects that this award is 
effective for a three-year period, commencing from the letter 
of 
acceptance 
and 
it 
refers 
to 
Service 
1, 
SAP 
Implementation, 
R 297 895 680,00. 
 
Service 
to:  
Implementing SAP Learning Solution.  Develop training 
20 
material and provide training accordingly, R 45 474 144,00 
including VAT. 
 
And the last one is Service 3, existing ERP, system data 
is required to be transformed, cleansed and migrated to the 
new ERP System by the appointed Master Data Management 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 181 of 225 
 
Specialists. 
 And 
the 
price 
for 
that 
is 
reflected 
as 
R 61 286 400,00. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you total those numbers, what 
do you see the total value of the award for EOH? 
MR POWELL:   A fraction over R 404 million, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry.  The date of this letter.  So 
the decision was apparently taken on the 2 n d but EOH is 
notified? 
10 
MR POWELL:   On 8 June 2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then, can I take you to page 507? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number again? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   507, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Or maybe we should start on...  
Well, 507 is the sequence.   
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Where the sequence begins. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What do you see on 507? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, this is a purchase order.  It is EOH 
SAP Services.  That is their division run by Mr Laher.  And it 
looks like EOH Infrastructure Technologies is delivering to 
EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd, Bedfordview.   
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 182 of 225 
 
 
And it then goes into details on – dated 27 June 2015 
and goes into detail regarding the provision of various 
computer periphery, hardware, software. 
 
And 
the 
value 
of 
all 
of 
that 
Chair 
comes 
to 
R 204 095,00. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we then go up a line, we will 
see an invoice on page 506.  Can you describe that to the 
Chair? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  There is an invoice on page 
506, EOH Mathombo.  The invoice date is 30 June 2016.  
10 
And if we look at the invoice, it refers to – it is generated by 
EOH Infrastructure Technologies and it is addressed to EOH 
Mathombo (Pty) Ltd.   
 
But Chair, if you look at the column on the right, you will 
see that the delivery address is Masa House, 12 New Street, 
Dundee Square, Marshalltown.   
 
And then it reflects:  Attention Geoff or Justice.  And if 
you look at that cell number Chair, you will recall that that is 
the number that Mr Chaskalson asked you to write down.  
That is the cell number of Mr Geoff Makhubo. 
20 
 
So it appears the Geoff referred to on this donation of 
R 204 000,00 worth of laptop equipment, is delivered to the 
ANC.  And the address Chair, we have confirmed, is one of 
the regional offices of the ANC. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then on page five...  Can you 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 183 of 225 
 
go to page 521? 
MR POWELL:   Yes.  Chair, on page 521, there we have 
another purchase order.  This one is directed to Serendipity 
Tours in Waterfall Centre, Midrand and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   One second.  Let me get there. 
MR POWELL:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR POWELL:   And the delivery address is reflected as 
delivered to EOH Mathombo and the company that is 
addressing it, is EOH SAP Services, Mr Laher’s business.  
10 
And if we look at this, it refers to purchase numbers, dates, 
categories. 
 
The date is 29 June 2016.  And if we look at the 
description, it looks like this is a tour of some sorts.  So it is 
a proforma invoice, 11 May 2016, COJ Team.   
 
And then there is a list of names and some of those 
names 
featured 
on 
some 
of 
the 
documents 
we 
saw 
previously.  So it is Nboniseni Nemaangani.  I see it is on the 
list and various others.  There are 18 names.  And what this 
entails ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.   
MR POWELL:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you at 571? 
MR POWELL:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What page are you on? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 184 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   21, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   521? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   521, Chair.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe you can pause for the 
Chair to get there and just... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
MR POWELL:   Apologies, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was making a note on the previous 
reference.  Okay, I am sorry.  I am going to have to ask you 
10 
to start afresh. 
MR POWELL:   Not at all Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   On that page, yes. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  This is a purchase order and it 
comes from EOH SAP Services, EOH Mathombo (Pty) Ltd.  It 
is addressed to Serendipity Tours who are based in Midrand 
and it is has got a delivery address to EOH Mathombo (Pty) 
Ltd but what is referred to in the description below Chair is, 
there is a list of names of COJ Team and it refers to a 
proforma invoice dated 11 May 2016.  
20 
 
And if you look at the narration, it talks about a list of 18 
names and that is referred to as the COJ Team.  And then, 
flights on Emirates.  Return airport hotel and private 
transfers.  Six nights accommodation at 3 Star Hampton in 
Manhattan Time Square, 5 to 11 June 2016, and seven 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 185 of 225 
 
standard twin-room sharing, three standard single rooms 
with breakfast, approximate airport taxes included. 
 
So this seems to be a delegation going to New York that 
EOH is paying for around the time that they awarded this 
tender which, as I indicated earlier, from just good business 
practice, it is really bad Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I maybe make that a bit more 
specific?  If one goes back to that invitation letter for 
Ms Towers’ project of taking people to New York at page 498.  
There is a list of no names in that invitation letter. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if I can...  Chair, if I can ask 
you to go to 498? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there you will see that the – 
this appears to be the same project.  There is a very 
substantial overlap in the list of names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  H’m.  Is it usual for a municipality or 
a government department to ask for donations as far as you 
know, Mr Powell? 
20 
MR POWELL:   It is pretty abnormal Chair, particularly while 
a bid pending with that particular service provider.  It is just 
seems totally unacceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It is certainly not something that 
...[intervenes]  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 186 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Chair, for any listed company in South Africa, 
most of those organisations would have a compliance team. 
And if we look at the EOH of today, Mr Van Coller is putting 
the Compliance Team and a whole lot of policies and 
controls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR POWELL:   At that time, there was one compliance 
officer for the EOH Group and it was a massive group at that 
time.  And I am not criticising the compliance officer but 
whenever did anything, they did not even advised the 
10 
Compliance Team and there was no scrutiny that would have 
suggested that it would be prudent not to do this kind of 
activity pending or after an award. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it just seems strange that any private 
company should spend half a million of its money on taking a 
local government officials or any government officials on a 
trip somewhere.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, in fairness but to Ms Tower. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   This looks like a charity that she 
20 
sponsors.  So the people who would go, they have a local 
government, officials are there, chaperons, as it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But it looks like, these are school 
children who are being sent on a trip under Ms Towers’ 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 187 of 225 
 
charity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, not municipal officials? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, not...  There is a municipal 
official who will be looking after them while they are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But he or she will be as a 
chaperone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But for one. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed.  It is not – the group is 
primarily children. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, I thought it was The City of 
Johannesburg officials.  Okay, no ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There may be one or two.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There is certainly one official.  
There may be two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Who are going to look after the 
20 
children. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That would be the primary 
beneficiaries of the children. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 188 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   If you remember the previous documents, it 
did speak about this being a sponsored initiative by the 
Executive Mayor’s Office.  So there is still the annexed to 
The City of Johannesburg and it is still coming from the 
service provider who is busy bidding for work of City of 
Johannesburg.  So I still maintain my view that it is highly 
inappropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Mr Chaskalson 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go to page 525? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson, we are at quarter past 
10 
four.  Let us talk about the way forward.  We may need to 
take a short adjournment.  I can still continue.  But I just 
want to have an idea, just talk about how much is left. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   My sense Chair is that, we 
probably got about half an hour, maybe 40-minutes left on 
The City of Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There are then two other contracts 
unrelated to the City of Joburg and in fact, they are quite 
severable in terms of their treatment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Unless you want us to try to push 
it.  Well, we – realistically, I think we would require at least 
two and a half to three hours to get through those other two 
contracts. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 189 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It may be more convenient to 
finish Johannesburg today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then to look for another slot, 
if there is another slot available at any stage to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, from my point of view, depending on 
what your situation is and Mr Powell’s availability and his 
counsel.  I can go on.  I can still go on for some time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I am certainly able to go on 
10 
myself.  Can I suggest that we attempt to go on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We maybe take stock after we 
have finished the first of the second of those two contracts 
when we will have a clearer sense of... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe we could go on up to – about 
six o’clock or just before six o’clock and see how far we are. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at that stage, if, for example, all that 
is left is an hour, it may well be it is an hour or so.  It may 
20 
well be that we could look at seeing whether if Mr Powell is 
available tomorrow.  We could start an hour earlier or we slot 
him in at some other time.  But I have flexibility on my side 
in terms of going on.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 190 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then I think we should at least try 
to look to complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Powell, how is your situation 
about continuing for some time? 
MR POWELL:   No problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no problem.  And your counsel, 
no problem?   
COUNSEL:   No problem with me at all.  I just want to make 
sure that Mr Powell ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   He may just need a bit of time to rearrange 
flights, et cetera.  But we will do that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Maybe, let us take a short 
break now and then resume.  We are at – what – seventeen 
minutes past.  If you are going to need to rearrange flights, 
you might need, about what, 10 to 15-minutes? 
MR POWELL:   Ja, five minutes is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five minutes is fine.  Okay let us take a 
ten minutes’ break.  We will resume just before half-past. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 191 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, I am going to take 
you back – you do not need to go there but you will recall 
that we took you to an email of 2 December at page 487 
where Jehan Mackay told Ebrahim Laher and – or Ebs and 
Pat: 
“We need a number urgently that can be allocated 
for goodwill...” 
Smiley face symbol. 
“...to the organisation.” 
Can I now take you to page 525 of volume 1?  And can you 
10 
take the Chair – again it is one of these email strings but 
can you start with the forwarded message that you see on 
525?  It says forwarded from Patrick Makhubedu. 
MR POWELL:   Yes.  Chair, on 525 in the middle of the 
page 
there 
is 
a 
forwarded 
message 
from 
Patrick 
Makhubedu dated Tuesday July 19th, 2016, and it is sent 
to Ebrahim Laher. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, can I just pause there?  
Would that be Pat and Ebs? 
MR POWELL:   That is correct, Chair, those I did identify 
20 
the two who were in that string previously. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what does he forward? 
MR POWELL:   Copy invoice, Chair, and I must apologise, 
the copy is very, very faint, so... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you read what the invoice – 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 192 of 225 
 
I mean, we may have to generate better copies of these 
invoices but are you able to read what the invoice says? 
MR POWELL:   To be from Mfundi Mobile Networks (Pty) 
Ltd, Chair, and it is addressed to EOH Mthombo (Pty) Ltd 
and if I am reading this very faint print correctly it says: 
“Sales COJ SAP support special” 
And there is a figure of R4 million and with that it comes to 
R4 560 000, SAP services. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And you will recall earlier 
we have seen some management reports that talk about 
10 
the COJ SAP support special. 
MR POWELL:   Exactly right, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And also refer to sales.  Can we 
go down the page because that is one invoice that you 
have seen.  If we go down to page 527, what do you see on 
527? 
MR POWELL:  Very similar scenario, Chair, in the middle 
of the page there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu 
dated July 19, 2016 and it is addressed to Ebrahim Laher 
and it says: 
20 
“Hi, please receive the invoices as discussed.” 
And it is another invoice from Mfundi Mobile Networks (Pty) 
Ltd addressed to EOH Mthombo (Pty) Ltd and this refers to 
sales, COJ SAP support special and it is also 4 million and 
with that it comes to 4 560 million and it also refers to SAP 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 193 of 225 
 
services.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is a different amount to the one 
you have dealt with at 525. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, it is the same amount but 
it is a different email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, same amount.  Oh, okay. 
MR POWELL:   It is the second amount of 4 million, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if we can go to the third 
amount then. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, at 525, on my 
page 525, the amount that is right at the bottom appears to 
be 4 560 000. 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then – oh, okay, at page 527 it is 
the same amount, hey? 
MR POWELL:   Correct., it is another transaction of the 
exact same amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a separate transaction but the 
amount on each transaction is the same. 
20 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we can – and the 
amount is 4 million plus VAT to give 4 560. 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 194 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, just bear in mind the 16 million that 
was approved earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Because it is going to tie up to that figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we go then to page 529?  
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Chair.  And again we have a 
similar pattern.  Just above the middle of the page there is 
an email from Patrick Makhubedu dated Tuesday the 19 
10 
July 2016 and it is sent to Ebrahim Laher and the narration 
is: 
“Hi, hope you have all three invoices.” 
And then below that is a further Mfundi Mobile Networks 
invoice addressed to EOH Mthombo (Pty) Ltd and again we 
have sales COJ SAP support special.  The amount this 
time is R8 million and below that is a narration SAP 
services and the amount with VAT is 9 120 000.  Mr 
Chaskalson can you just confirm the numbers it is very 
…[intervenes] 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, yes, in fact go to 530, you 
should have a more legible copy. 
MR POWELL:   Yes, exactly right, Chair, on the following 
page there is a more legible total and you will see it ends 
with Patrick Makhubedu and his cell number. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 195 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that total 9,120 total when you add up 
4 point something and…? 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those two amounts? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   4.560. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There were two for 4 million plus 
VAT equals 4 560 and a third for 8 million plus Vat, 9 120. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the overall total… 
MR POWELL:   16 million ex Vat. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   16 million ex Vat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And now need to go to see how 
that 16 million on SAP – sorry, sale SAP support special 
was explained by Mr Barry or accounted for by Mr Barry 
and then for that purpose we have got to go back to page 
344 where we skirted around a little bit thus far. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you mention a page to which we 
must go, Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   344. 
CHAIRPERSON:   344, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at the risk of repetition, I 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 196 of 225 
 
would like you to take the Chair through this covering 
email on 344 quite carefully because now we are going to 
get into it in considerable detail. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  You now have more context to 
the schedules that are attached to this email.  So if we just 
revisit the email, Chair will remember that this was from 
Reno Barry and Reno Barry you will remember was the 
person that was very active on Mfundi Mobile.  It is dated 6 
January 2017 and it is sent to Patrick Makhubedu and the 
subject was Mfundi ANC Recon and then it attached the 
10 
two documents.  We have referred to the one document 
which was an extract from a Mfundi management report 
and the second item is GM ANC updated – or sorry, the 
first time GM ANC updated 13 August 2016 and just to 
revisit the narration: 
“Hi Patrick, attached is the last ANC recon I have 
showing the amount of 560 still to go.  However, 
there might be payments made afterwards that must 
be added to the recon to reduce this balance, see 
columns for August and September 2016 for items 
20 
not included.  Please advise if any items must be 
added to the recon.  Kind regards, Reno Barry.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the recon that we are going 
to look at in a minute has the file name Mfundi GM ANC 
updated.  Can you speculate as to what GM might stand 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 197 of 225 
 
for?  I will leave it for argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anybody’s initials?  If you do not know it 
is fine.  
MR POWELL:   No, I was just thinking of the irony, it could 
have been JM and I would have understood, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anyway, I wanted to ask the question.  Is 
the reference to recon in this email a reference to a 
reconciliation of the amounts? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you take the Chair to page 
345? 
MR POWELL:   Thank you, Chair.  Page 345 is this 
reconciliation, it is headed Mfundi Mobile expenses, ANC 
GM. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And under sales what do we 
see? 
MR POWELL:   We see sales, COJ SAP support special, 16 
million and the total for sales 16 million and then we have 
…[intervenes] 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, so can you link that to 
documents that we have been discussing with the Chair?  
Where does that 16 million reflect in terms of invoices that 
we have seen thus far? 
MR POWELL:   We have just looked at the 4 million, 4 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 198 of 225 
 
million, 8 million from Patrick Makhubedu, Chair, so this 
seems to tie up to that and you will remember that it also 
ties back to a letter of request for 50 million.  It would 
appear that EOH paid 16, not the 50 that was requested 
and they paid it in the broken up tranches of 4 million, 4 
million and 8 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Which were invoiced by Mfundi. 
MR POWELL:   Which were invoiced by Mfundi, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that request, where there was the 
figure of 50 million, did I understand it correctly to be a 
10 
request for them to make whatever contribution they could 
make so that it did not necessarily – it was not a request 
that they must pay the whole amount of 50 million? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, you are quite correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   But having said that, they did give a 
monthly budget that they needed to receive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR POWELL:   And that did come to the 50 million on the 
request. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   So that was part of it but if you read the 
preceding page it is exactly what Chair is suggesting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR POWELL:   This is the amount they need. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 199 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The impression I got and maybe there 
was no basis for it was that maybe it was the kind of 
document 
that 
the ANC 
may 
have 
sent 
to 
different 
companies and then each company would just see what it 
could contribute. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, I concur, those were my thoughts 
exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, thank you. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, if I may just pause on this because, 
you know, the making of political donations is not per se 
10 
irregular but when you make it to one political party and 
you do it at a time when a bid or a tender is being 
adjudicated it becomes problematic.  So any compliance 
team worth its salt would have blocked this, they would 
have 
told 
the 
company 
you 
cannot 
go 
there 
but 
unfortunately, at the time they did not have a robust 
compliance programme in place and they did not have the 
wherewithal to stop it and I think almost by design the old 
EOH did not create the controls because it would have 
inhibited this kind of behaviour.  Thank you, Chair. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just stop you there, Mr 
Powell?  The answer you just gave the Chair would have 
obviously carried considerable weight if the 16 million was 
explicitly donated to the ANC but in this case that is not 
what happened. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 200 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Mr Chair, Mr Chaskalson is quite right and 
that is the second part of what I did what to convey to 
Chair is that this was a concealed donation, they did not 
outright go and make a payment to the ANC, they paid 
Mfundi and the document we are about to take Chair 
through is a recon from Mfundi.  What the ANC then did is 
they supplied all of their election campaign expenses, 
printing, advertising and all the different aspects, expenses 
that go with preparing for an election, the ANC would 
submit invoices to Mfundi and Mfundi would deduct it from 
10 
the 16 million balance and Chair will recall that Reno Barry 
had indicated that there was just a couple of hundred 
thousand left over and we are about to go through this list 
of items, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that EOH would have 
received and express request from the ANC on the ANC’s 
letterheads about that 50 million? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there would be no record of EOH 
response to that request directly. 
20 
MR POWELL:   Correct, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there would be money that was 
given to Mfundi and then what one would see later is the 
ANC would send invoices to Mfundi and so on. 
MR POWELL:   Exactly right, Chair.  That is what 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 201 of 225 
 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you take the Chair through 
these costs of sales? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  Chair, there is a column on this 
reconciliation called cost of sales …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before we proceed, you remember 
we have been seeing this sales and cost of sales, in the 
context of Mfundi Mobile and the ANC, cost of sales would 
mean what on your understanding? 
10 
MR POWELL:   Chair, Mfundi has not done any work for 
EOH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   Other than manage these donations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so Mfundi did not sell anything to 
the ANC and... 
MR POWELL:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the ANC did not sell anything to 
Mfundi or... 
MR POWELL:   No, all that has happened is they have 
20 
been a front for receiving the political donation and they 
disbursed payments for expenses for the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And when I see cost of sales 
below that where it says less management fees and so on, I 
must understand that as far as you are concerned there 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 202 of 225 
 
were no sales. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, maybe we should just take 
a few examples to illustrate some of these costs of sales 
that are reflected on the spreadsheet.  So can I ask you, if 
you go to the – well, let us before we get to the invoices 
that came to Mfundi, let us look at the first …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, Mr Chaskalson, I am sorry to 
interrupt you.  Just to put it bluntly, is your understanding 
10 
that where they say sales they were just concealing the 
true nature of the arrangements and the transactions? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair, it is a misnomer, a 
misrepresentation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay. 
MR POWELL:   And in fact, Chair, it doubles into an 
accounting irregularity on the EOH side because they are 
concealing the donation in their books and records. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   This should have been recorded as a 
20 
donation and it should have gone to, you know, the party, 
that is what they chose to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   But instead it was hidden in the books and 
records in this fashion. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 203 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And sorry, just to come back 
there.  You will recall that when we looked at those 
invoices that were invoiced to EOH, they were described as 
sales, COJ SAP support special. 
MR POWELL:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So when they issue an invoice to 
EOH they call it sales COJ SAP support special, so that 16 
million is a sale to EOH for the support of the SAP contract 
at COJ. 
10 
MR POWELL:   Ja, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that would be – they would reflect 
this as sales between EOH and Mfundi, not between Mfundi 
and the ANC, is that right? 
MR POWELL:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then when Mfundi then pays to the 
ANC it would reflect that as what? 
MR POWELL:   Well, they put it in as cost of sales. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As cost of sales too. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The cost that they must incur to 
20 
make the sale of 16 million to EOH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But before we get to the cost of 
sales, there is an item that is worth looking at with some – 
looking at closely because this is not just about, you know, 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 204 of 225 
 
washing EOH’s donations to the ANC because the first item 
– can you just tell the Chair what the first item says and 
how you understand it? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, there is the cost of sales less 
management fees and taxes, 2.4 million.  So Mfundi has 
taken a commission for its role in what looks like almost 
laundering funds. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And are …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the 2.4 million is there where it says 
less management fees and taxes, that is their cut? 
10 
MR POWELL:   That looks like it Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   They may have to pay some tax, 
I do not know – but it is their cut plus tax. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MR POWELL:   Chair, but if I may, the other interesting 
thing about this document is that it reflects that both 
Mfundi and the EOH people that were involved in this, they 
have linked the donation to the ANC to the COJ tender 
because they are putting in as cost of sales. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So let us see how this cost of 
20 
sales worked.  I do not want to take through all 20 odd of 
them but let us look at an example or two.  If you go to the 
third line item it says cost of sales, Black & White, 
677 160.  Can I ask you go to page 691 and can you take 
the Chair through that document? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 205 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Chair, at 691 we have Black & White T 
Shirts (Pty) Ltd issuing an invoice that is date 27 July 2017 
and there is an invoice number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2016 is it? 
MR POWELL:   2016, 27 July 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR POWELL:   It is invoiced to Jolidee Matongo and if we 
look at the description it says S & P polyester yellow tee-
shirt printed – and it looks like abbreviation for full colour 
front plus one colour back, 20 000 at R29.70, total amount 
10 
594 000 and with VAT that figure comes to on the invoice 
R677 160 and if we go back to our document at 345 there 
is the figure.  So you can see this looks like tee-shirt 
printing as part of the election campaign, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, we do not have to 
speculate too much there because there is actually a 
covering invoice – oh sorry, a covering email.  Can I take 
you to page 689? 
MR POWELL:   Chair, at 689 we have got an email from 
Geoff Makhubo dated 27 July 2016 to Patrick Makhubedu 
20 
and it refers to: 
“Subject:  Forwarding invoice 21326 from Black & 
White T Shirts.” 
And then there are a number of attachments.   
“Please pay 50%.” 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 206 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is an email from Geoff Makhubo to 
Mr Patrick Makhubedu. 
MR 
POWELL: 
 
 
Correct, 
Chair, 
and 
it 
looks 
like 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it relates to a certain invoice 21326 
from Black & White T Shirts and then the attachments are 
then given there. 
MR POWELL:   Chair and it looks like the supplier wanted 
a 50% deposit before they incurred the cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
MR POWELL:   So if you look at the preceding request 
from Jolidee Matongo, it is asking for 50% payment by 
today.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And let us look at another 
example.  Chair, it may be convenient for you to take out 
page 95 which has- not page 95, page 344 which has that 
table so that you can have it on one side and we can then 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   345? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   345, indeed, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let us go down to another large 
item, there is a payment of 1 425 000 to Nahana Holdings, 
N-a-h-a-n-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I have lost the page where 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 207 of 225 
 
we have got that list. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The list is on page 345. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, I took it out and ja, okay, 
I have got it, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if one goes about six or 
seven down one sees Nahana Holdings, 1.425 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell, can you take the 
Chair to page 680? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   680. 
MR POWELL:   Got it, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC: And what do you see at 680?   
MR POWELL:   Chair, at 680 we have an invoice from 
Nahana Holdings (Pty) Ltd and the customer is reflected as 
Greater 
Johannesburg 
Region, 
ANC, 
contact 
Geoff 
Makhubo and the Johannesburg with what appears to be Mr 
Makhubo’s cell number again, it is dated 20 July 2016 and 
there is an invoice number of NNCJ004 and then the 
description, 
it 
says 
Greater 
Johannesburg 
Region, 
20 
ANC#Real Stuff, second tranche invoice and then it has got 
#Real 
Stuff 
Social 
Media 
Strategy, 
establish 
content 
structure for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, contracting of 
influential ambassadors, senior social media strategists, 
analytics and monitoring reports, scheduling and strategy 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 208 of 225 
 
planning, PR and branding and there are various other 
items, there is content development and real stuff on 
ground activations and there is a figure of 1 250 000 and a 
grand total with VAT is 1 425 000, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that of course corresponds 
to the line on the cost of sales. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now can I ask you to go up to 
page 679 to see how this ends up being paid by Mfundi 
Mobile? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, I am making 
a note on my page 345 where to find the …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   680. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ja, I have made that note but the 
earlier one for Black & White do you remember what page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That Black & White was 691. 
CHAIRPERSON:   691.  Okay, thank you.  Yes? 
MR POWELL:   And if we look at 679, Chair, at the bottom, 
a Sibusisogumede@nahana.biz emails the attached invoice 
that we have just looked at for 1 250 000, it gets sent to 
20 
Andy Dikoba at Di Data and copied to Sifiso Zulu and then 
this gets forwarded and then - on 22 July 2016 and it goes 
to Obakeng Ansel Chikane and also to Geoff Makhubo and 
that 
gets 
forwarded 
from 
Geoff 
Makhubo 
to 
Patrick 
Makhubedu on 22 July 2016.  The underlying email seemed 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 209 of 225 
 
to refer to Dimension Data but it looks like this was paid by 
Mfundi, not by Data. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is certainly what – well, it 
went from Di Data to Geoff Makhubo and Obakeng 
Chikane.  What went from Di Data, went from an individual 
at Di Data, what went was the invoice. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And eventually it was forwarded 
from Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makhubedu and later 
appeared as a cost of sale to Mfundi.  The next item I 
10 
would refer to is – the next big item which is an amount of 
994 964 to Shereno Printers at 668.  It is page 668 is 
where the story of those payments is going to be told and 
can you – let us start with the covering email on 668 and 
the trail that it shows. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly.  So at the bottom of 668 Chair 
there is an email from Jola D Matonga, this name we 
referred to earlier, she sends this email through on 13 July 
2016 to Geoff Makhuba and she sends it to a Gmail as well 
as a City of Johannesburg address, and copies a person by 
20 
the name of Bruce Serella and the subject header is 
invoice 70718 from Sherena Printers CC and she says: 
“Good day, 
Attached are the invoices from Sherena Printers.  
These are for the 1 000 A5 leaflets per candidate 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 210 of 225 
 
that were printed and have already been delivered.  
They are also for the 300 posters per candidate and 
have been printed and delivered.  Please process 
payment, the supplier is on my case. 
Regards  
Jola D Matonga” 
That gets sent by Geoff Makhubo on 21 July 2016, he 
forwards this to Patrick Makubedu and attaches the invoice 
and various supporting documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that the email address for Jola D 
10 
Matonga is Gauteng.co.za. 
MR POWELL:   Correct Chair it looks like she is a 
government official. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, at not at Johannesburg City or you 
don’t know? 
MR POWELL:    No, I think COJ has a different address, 
this could be a government department Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair the title is GPDGDED 
which 
presumably 
refers 
to 
the 
Department, 
I 
think 
20 
Provincial 
Government 
Department, 
maybe 
Economic 
Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you take the Chair to 669 
and 670. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 211 of 225 
 
MR POWELL:   Certainly 669 and 670 are invoices from 
Sherena Printers invoiced to the African National Congress 
and the invoice contains the detail, order number is just 
referred to as Jola D Matonga and it refers to 40 500 A1 
posters re order Jo’burg only 135 [one thirty five] different 
kinds of A1 posters, 300 of each printed in full colour, an 
amount of R518 400 with VAT the total amount there is 
R590 976. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Can I just ask Chair can I ask 
you and Mr Powell just to write that number down, 590 976. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five nine zero, nine seven six? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Correct Chair, and then Mr 
Powell if you can go to 670.    
MR POWELL:   670 is the second invoice form the same 
source, Sherena Printers CC and it has the same order 
number as Jola D ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Powell I think your voice has 
gone down a little bit, it is late in the day. 
MR POWELL:   Sorry thanks Chair, I have gone closer to 
the mic Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POWELL:   This is also addressed to the African 
National Congress. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is what page now? 
MR POWELL:   670. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 212 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR POWELL:   And it refers to 135 000, description is A5 
leaflets, Joburg only, 135 awards, 135 different kind of A5 
leaflets being 1 000 of each printed in full colour and an 
amount on the right as R345 375 and the VAT inclusive 
number is R403 987,50. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you were to add 
those numbers up I wouldn’t ask you to do that but I will 
tell you that the answer is R994 963,30 and they have 
rounded it up to 994 964 which you will find on the table at 
10 
page 345, so next to Sherena Printers these two invoices 
reflect as 994 964.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the last example that I 
would like to take you to is the item called Black Brain, an 
amount of 1 736 000, can I ask you to go to page 683 for 
that, so Black Brain is 683, and if you can take the Chair to 
what you see on page 683? 
MR POWELL:   Chair on 683 we have an email from Geoff 
Makhubo to Patrick Makubedu and it refers to business 
20 
request, or bus request for PR Councillors and the 
narration is just yes and it is sent from my IPhone and that 
follows a question from Patrick Makubedu just saying so 
we must only pay R1 736 000 with Patrick Makubedu’s 
name and cell number just below that and that seem to 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 213 of 225 
 
have referred to the preceding email on 22 July 2016 which 
was sent by Geoff Makhubo to Patrick Makubedu and it had 
a figure, it contained a table which referred to various 
suppliers, Black Brain appears on the table near the 
bottom of the page at the top Chair and it has an invoice 
number BBANC280616 and an amount of R2,736 000 and 
what Mr Makubedu seems to be asking is so we must pay 
only 17 – R1 736 000 the Black Brain number and the 
answer was yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Before you leave that page with 
10 
the table you will see a number of other ...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:   Yes I see there’s another email referenced 
on 22 July 2016 when Geoff Makhubo wrote to Patrick 
Makubedu, he wrote Black Brain and I think it’s just a typo 
in R1 736 000 and in brackets it says “[we had paid them 
R1million from the ANC account] otherwise all is fine”. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if I can take you to a 
different rendition of that email or to the same email but in 
a different place with a table underneath it, page 685, do 
you see the 22 July email from Geoff Makhubo – sorry – 
20 
the it’s the Patrick Makubedu email saying so we must pay 
only 1736 in response to Black Brain is 1763 we paid them 
one million, otherwise all fine.   
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There was a table to which Mr 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 214 of 225 
 
Makhubo was responding. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And so we dealt with Black Brain 
which 
on 
the 
table 
reflects 
as 
R2 736 000, 
but 
we 
understand now that one was already paid. 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The other items on the table we 
dealt with Sherena Printers already. 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Taj, can I ask you to go back to 
10 
page 344. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you will see a line item for 
Taj which reflects total payments to Taj of – can you just 
give the Chair the amount?   
MR POWELL:   Certainly Taj Printers R331 592 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
am 
sorry, 
is 
that 
at 
344 
or 
...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:  This is at 345, it is the reconciliation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that’s the sheet that I took out. 
20 
MR POWELL:   And that document there is just two lines 
below the middle the reference to Taj Printers Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja you said we look at Taj and 
what is the amount? 
MR POWELL:   The amount for Taj is R331 592 Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 215 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now these amounts when you 
add them they come to an amount slightly less but they 
may not have been the only amounts paid to Taj.  Can you 
look at Paper Push. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly Paper Push Printers is reflected 
on the reconciliation as R185 820 Chair, and there’s 
another amount just slightly higher up, just above the 
middle of the reconciliation there’s Paper Push Printers 
R64 980. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    And can you look back at your 
table?   
MR POWELL:   And going back to the table we have got 
Paper Push 18 July 16, R64 980. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay when you refer to the table you 
refer to the table at what page? 
MR POWELL:   Sorry Chair, this is page 685. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At 65? 
MR POWELL:   Six eight five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   685.    
20 
MR POWELL:   Chair and if you look at that number the 
64980 is the number of the schedule for Paper Push 
Printers, the higher reference, just above the middle of the 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, I can see  that.  Thank you. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 216 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now we haven’t reconciled 
everyone of these against the underlying invoices, I don’t 
even know if those are to be found on EOH, but we have 
described the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes no one does get the picture. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The picture is amplified a little 
bit in those management accounts that came with the same 
– under cover of the same email from Mr Barry, so if I can 
now ask Chair if you can go to page 346, which is the 
management accounts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there Chair we have seen 
this document before, we noted that the revenue is at 
R16million from EOH SAP’s report special which is a sale 
made by Mfundi and the cost of sales.   Can I – if we go 
through again keeping that reconciliation loose can I ask 
Mr Powell can you find, have you got a copy that has the 
left column legible or not?   Maybe, it might be best to get 
volume 1 from behind you and just go to page 346 of 
volume 1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I need to go to volume 1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair you, I think your document 
of 346 is a legible document but Mr Powell’s may not be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is legible.  
MR POWELL:   Volume 1? 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 217 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe somebody should assist the 
witness. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Powell has his volume, page 
346.  Can you start by looking for the cost of sales in 
respect of Black and White?  
MR POWELL:   Yes certainly, I see Black and White about 
seven lines down. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you move across what is 
the cost of that sale? 
MR POWELL:   Just one second.   677 160. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that of course reconciles 
with the number on the reconciliation and in which month is 
that sale reflected in? 
MR POWELL:   It is reflected in July, sorry the numbers 
are slightly out of sync. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is the July column, the column 
headings on the left hand side of the column and the 
numbers on the right hand side of the column.  If you go 
over the page to 347.    
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We see Nahana Holdings that we 
have already looked at.   
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the cost of sale there? 
MR POWELL:   R1 425 000 Chair. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 218 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I can tell you that that is 
also in the July column although it is not on your 
...[intervenes]  
MR POWELL:  Yes I can see that Chair.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Taj Printers that we were 
looking at? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly, Taj Printers is also in the same 
column Chair so it looks like also July an amount of 
R331 592.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Paper Push Printers?   
10 
MR POWELL:   Paper Push Chair we have got also in that 
July column, R64 980 which was that number in the table 
that we just looked at on one of the invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was saying Mr Chaskalson the 
challenge here is that I have is to see which figure relates 
to which entity, I don’t know whether – with bigger spaces 
between them it would be and maybe with lines in between. 
MR POWELL:   Chair I am using a page as my ruler 
otherwise it becomes very difficult. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair what we will do is we will 
20 
go back to the original spreadsheet which I presume Mr 
Powell will have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON CC:   And we will reprint it with 
columns, with cells with borders to one can see the lines. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 219 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja no that’s fine because I think if you 
were to ask me I would give you all the wrong numbers. 
ADV CHASKALSON CC:   There is one – we have already 
talked about the cost of sales to Molelwani Consulting for 
R50 000, there is another line item that I want to identify to 
you, that is the cost of sales on page 346 for Flywell 
Travel.   
MR POWELL:   Chair for Flywell Travel we have a figure of 
R89 000 – there’s two – sorry let me just make sure – there 
are two columns, the one is R207 025 and the second 
10 
figure is R89 330.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I want us to focus on that 
R89 330.  
MR POWELL:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I ask you to go to page 693.     
MR POWELL:   Chair at 693 there’s an email from a Depika 
Bana and it is sent to Patrick Makubedu’s gmail address 
and there is a Ayaaz Ahmed cc’d and it refers to subject 
invoice HOF and then a number of 0153043 and it refers to 
Excel Flywell Travels Pretoria Pty Limited and the narration 
20 
is: 
“Dear Patrick,  
Please see attached invoice for Geoff’s travel.   
Kind regards 
Depika Bana  
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 220 of 225 
 
Travel Consultant” 
And it seems to come from Flywell.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask that you write down 
that invoice reference, HOF153043? And then can you go 
to page 800.   
MR POWELL:   The very last page in the bundle Chair, 
There’s an invoice at page 800 from Flywell, Excel Flywell 
Travel Pretoria Pty Limited and it is addressed to Mfundi 
Mobile Networks, it refers – it is described as a computer 
generated tax invoice and it refers to air tickets and the 
10 
passenger name on the detail is – it refers to a ticket 
number Makhubo Malotoa Geoffrey Mr and it appears to be 
J & B Grubog JFK Johannesburg and ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I stop you there, do you 
know, can you identify those airports for the Chairperson? 
MR POWELL:   Chair we just did this check a couple of 
weeks ago and we confirmed that this is a trip from 
Johannesburg to São Paulo in Brazil, followed by a 
connecting flight to Bogota in Columbia and a return from 
Bogota via JFK to Johannesburg South Africa. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the amount? 
MR POWELL:   The amount is R80 000 for the ticket totals 
R80 350 and the number including VAT is R89 330 and that 
is the number that we just looked at on the schedule Chair 
related to the second expense for Flywell Travel. 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 221 of 225 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Under cost of sales? 
MR POWELL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry but the invoice at page 800 is 
an 
invoice 
sent 
by 
Flywell Travel 
to 
Mfundi 
Mobile 
Networks and it purports to relate to the travelling of 
Makhubo Geoffrey as reflected therein, that is what it 
reflects is that right? 
MR POWELL:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR POWELL:   Chair and again the anomaly with this is it 
10 
is reflected by Mfundi as a cost of sales on the SAP 
support for COJ and again the timing is really bad Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can – just to complete this loop 
can we go to 694, and what do you see there? 
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair at 694 we have a Standard 
Bank payment receipt, beneficiary name Flywell Travel an 
then the account number, it is with ABSA Bank and it is an 
ABSA electronic settlement, beneficiary reference LO8227, 
your reference Flywell and the amount is R89 330 so this 
20 
was clearly paid and this is the proof of payment Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Powell.  That 
concludes our run through the chronology of the 2016 
contract, 
we 
have 
now 
reached 
the 
end 
of 
our 
Johannesburg section of your evidence.   Is there anything 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 222 of 225 
 
further in relation to the EOH Johannesburg, City of 
Johannesburg relationship that you would want to address 
to the Chairperson? 
MR POWELL:   Chair if I may I would like to point out that 
EOH have actually lost money even though it appears to 
have 
been 
tainted 
by 
corruption 
with 
the 
concealed 
donations the City of Johannesburg hasn’t paid for these 
services and EOH have paid away to all the third parties, 
including Mfundi and so EOH is actually suffering the new 
EOH with new management is actually struggling in not 
10 
recovering this money and they are currently bleeding in 
terms of the project and I think that is something Mr Van 
Coller  highlighted, so I think what it says Chair is that if 
people were crooked they were not very efficient crooks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Can I – Chair I think at this 
point we need to discuss the way forward, because we 
have now finished with Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much was your estimate of how 
much more time would be necessary to finish his evidence? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair because we are going onto 
a completely new set of relationships with a different cast 
of characters my sense is that we are probably looking at 
at least three hours if I measure against how it went with 
Johannesburg and the conception it may make sense to 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 223 of 225 
 
end at this point and then we can take a decision on 
whether and if so when Mr Powell returns.  I must say 
Chair that there is a – there are a whole series of other 
investigations relating to EOH, we are just dealing with 
City of Johannesburg and one in the NPA and one in the 
SAPS.   If this is going to become a focus for the 
Commission then it is many, many times.  If it is not going 
to become a focus for the Commission then breaking now 
makes as much as sense as breaking later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well what I was thinking is the more 
10 
limited time is needed for him to finish the better it is to 
accommodate him on another date, we are left with an hour 
it is easier than if it is four hours, if it is two hours it is 
easier than if it is three hours, but I am quite happy to stop 
here so your estimate in terms of what you wish to happen 
to achieve is that if we stop here we probably need about 
three hours that we must find somewhere. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think it would three to four 
hours Chair, I think we could probably do it in three, the 
problem is that there will be something of a start up costs 
20 
because we have to talk about a new set of relationships 
and a new set of intermediaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Who will appear in both of the 
next two investigations and it may make sense to try and 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 224 of 225 
 
do them together so that one remembers who the parties 
are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine, I think then we should 
stop now then we will look at when we can slot him in to do 
the balance of the – to deal with the balance of the 
matters, that you have in mind you should deal with.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay Mr Powell we will stop here 
and obviously we will ask you to come back some other 
time so that you can deal with the other matters that Mr 
10 
Chaskalson has in mind you should deal with. 
MR POWELL:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then tomorrow Mr Chaskalson we 
have one witness that is Ramosebudi? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and what is your estimate of how 
much time we need for him? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair I think we will use the day 
tomorrow, I have had some – well I don’t want – I would 
expect to use the day tomorrow. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   A day should be fine? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   A day should be fine, we won’t 
need more than a day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, no that is fine, I was 
asking because I think I have agreed with Mr Kennedy that 
25 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 312 
 
Page 225 of 225 
 
we can have – I can have an evening session with one of 
his witnesses who will take about two hours but I said to 
him his witness might need to be here by four o’clock but 
maybe we will start at five all depending, so and I was 
thinking whether there may be a need for us to start at 
nine rather than ten for purposes of your witness but if you 
think if we start at ten we should be able to be done by 
four or five ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am confident that we will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.   So we are going 
10 
to then adjourn for the day.  I thank you very much, we 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 26 NOVEMBER 2020
