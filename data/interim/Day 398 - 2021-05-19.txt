CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.  I understood that Mr 
Barrie was delayed on the way. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Pardon Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understood that you were delayed on the 
way or something. 
10 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Ja I forgot that I had to fetch my wife 
from hospital and I had to make arrangements for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Thank you Sir.

MR KOKO:  I thank you too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka I – we adjourned at around ten 
two days ago. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am hoping that two hours or so would be 
enough?  How much time do you think you need? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you asking the right person Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The leader of evidence does not know 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 4 of 383 
 
what is going to happen.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did you take the attitude that now we 
are given Wednesday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we can go wide. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No not at all.  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because my estimation last time was 
that I could personally finish within an hour’s time when we 
10 
went into the Tegeta matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When we started the Tegeta matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja no, no I just want to have an idea 
you know so … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja let us budget – well let us estimate 
two hours for it.  I hope it takes less than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it takes less all the better. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:  Chair there is an audit trail on Tegeta which Mr 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 5 of 383 
 
Seleka is not touching at all which is important for you when 
you make the judgment.  Audit trail that is backed up by 
documentation.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  That we cannot ignore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR KOKO:  And I am going to try to refer to it.  I felt under 
pressure last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  The day before  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
MR KOKO:  I did not sleep properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  That I did not go through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is important that… 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
These 
documents 
are 
dated, 
they 
are 
20 
sequenced, they are proper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And unless you look at that audit trail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It is difficult to come in at the end and say tell 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 6 of 383 
 
me about the 1.6 billion or tell me about the cooperation 
agreement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  For example I want to give you the cooperation 
agreement and show you how I am – how irregular and 
unlawful it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Mr Seleka starts post that.  So I 
really need to go through this audit trail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  We – it is important 
10 
that with the allegations that have been made against 
people like you. 
MR KOKO:  Against me in particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the process is such that you do not 
have a lot of complaints when we are done that you have 
had a fair opportunity to put your side of the story.  So Mr 
Seleka you know what Mr Koko is talking about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Let us – let us start.  You continue 
with questioning. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you had planned. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we are done with that to the extent 
that during that period Mr Koko might not have dealt with 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 7 of 383 
 
some of the issues that he feels need to be dealt with I will 
take a break and you and Mr Barrie and Mr Koko can talk to 
identify what those issues are and then we can resume after 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And deal with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Just administer the oath or 
affirmation again. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Matshela Moses Koko. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR KOKO:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
20 
me God. 
MR KOKO:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. You may be seated. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Seleka. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 8 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  I would start 
Chairperson by taking reference to Eskom Bundle 14(d).  
14(d) is contains an affidavit and evidence placed or 
provided to the commission by Cliff Decker Hofmeyr, the 
affidavit of Mr Rishaban Moodley.   
 
The affidavit start on page 882 – 8 – ja page 882 
and deals with a number of aspects and I would like to pick 
it up from page 891.   
CHAIRPERSON:  We are dealing with Tegeta now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is Tegeta matters yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and in particular about the penalties 
or not yet? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we are starting with 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes what – what we wish to deal with 
here firstly is the issue regarding he hardship clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes whether OCM invoked the hardship 
clause refer the matter to arbitration and whether the 
arbitration was pursued. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes is that not common cause? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That the arbitration was pursued Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – I thought it is common cause 
that OCM invoked the hardship clause. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 9 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Better steps were taken to pursue the 
arbitration route but it was not pursuant to finality. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that is common cause. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes – the  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if it is common cause we do not 
need to spend time on it.  We need to focus on those issues 
where there is – there are disputes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  What the Chairperson was asking 
last time and engaging with Mr Koko on was why did OCM 
10 
not pursue the arbitration? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I thought the Chairperson’s answer 
– I mean the answer to the Chairperson’s question may lie 
in what is stated partly in this affidavit and in the affidavit 
of Mr 00:08:52. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we go straight to that ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Straight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No not to whether they invoked the clause 
or whatever. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if that is common cause the only 
issue is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did they not pursue it to finality. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 10 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we can go straight to that. 
MR KOKO:  Chair it will – part of the audit trail I talked 
about the documents.  I would like you to see the hardship 
notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It – because it is going to – I will inevitably 
refer to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  But while we are here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Can we go to it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us – let us leave that for later.  
And I may have seen it before but I am – I am willing to see 
it again.  But if in response to his questions you have to 
refer to it then let us look at it when you – when you asked 
–  
MR KOKO:  Excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Because the answer lies there Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  The rest is noise and waffling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So if I go straight to 
which what you see here. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 11 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have – do we have any affidavit or 
maybe it is what you said from OCM/Glencore that says 
here is the reason why we did not pursue arbitration to its 
finality? 
MR KOKO:  Yes there is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is? 
MR KOKO:  Yes there is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR KOKO:  It is in Clinton Ephron’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ephron. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  And it is also in the transcripts 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Okay. 
MR KOKO:  I know exactly what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know it – ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair thank you.  There are two time 
periods 
Chair. 
 
There 
is 
a 
time 
period 
before 
the 
cooperation 
agreement 
where 
the 
hardship 
clause 
is 
invoked in 2013.  So this affidavit talks about that. Then 
20 
comes the cooperation agreement in 2014.  Then they 
suspend the arbitration because they want to talk and reach 
an amicable solution. Those talks fail when Mr Molefe 
comes where he terminates the cooperation in 2015.  Then 
the reinstatement of the arbitration starts.  But then Mr 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 12 of 383 
 
Clinton Ephron says the date of the arbitration was in May 
2016.  He says that in his affidavit.  So May 2016 he gives 
the date the hearing was scheduled for 16 to 27 May 2016.  
Before then April 2016 Tegeta pays the full purchase price 
for the acquisition of OCM.  So the pursuit of the arbitration 
gets to be over 00:12:10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it deal with why it was taking so 
long?  Because arbitration is supposed to be fast. 
MR KOKO:  Chair this is the part that I am saying there is 
audit trail and in all respects you are being misled by your 
10 
legal team and your investigation team.  The audit trail 
speaks for itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  The – and . 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will look at it. 
MR KOKO:  But let me tell you this.  The hardship notice of 
3 July 2013 was followed by an arbitration agreement of 12 
December 2013 and that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one we looked at the other 
day? 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  And that is 180 days in between and that 
130 days was not a coincidence because the arbitration 
clause 30 of the CSA and 2016 of the First Addendum says 
so.  If you do not resolve the dispute or not 180 days from 
the notice period – date do you then – matter must go to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 13 of 383 
 
arbitration.  And the matter was referred to arbitration.  And 
you are right the arbitration – the arbitration agreement had 
even appointed the arbitrator and there was an arbitration 
after that and it had 90 days to conclude.  But because 
Optimum and there is documentation to it there – here we 
have to through it.  Mr Clinton Ephron says he was then 
approached in his transcript by Mr Bester to say rather than 
conclude the arbitration let us agree on a cooperation 
agreement.  I - that i– false Chair.  The only proposition is 
that the arbitration was not taken to the – to its conclusion 
10 
because 
the 
hardship 
notice 
has 
to 
show 
special 
circumstances which excludes the.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The export. 
MR KOKO:  The export conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So that arbitration agreement of December 12, 
2013 was bound to fail on that basis.  The – but the second 
part of the arbitration why it was not taken to finality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Its conclusion ja. 
MR KOKO:  Is that there was a – a clause 4 – 3.4..3 Notice 
20 
you will find it in C – in Clinton Ephron’s affidavit of C – title 
CE – C2.  It is dated 23 April 2013.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR KOKO:  It dealt with coal furnaces that the mine as it 
currently operates can no longer produce those qualities.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 14 of 383 
 
But that 
dispute was not included in the arbitration 
agreement.  So the arbitration agreement not only stood to 
fail but it was not going to address the coal qualities.  That 
is why they came – they came up with the cooperation 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let us stop it there Mr Koko.  As I 
said after Mr Seleka has finished questioning you to the 
extent that you will not have dealt with this issue that 
00:15:43. 
MR KOKO: But Mr Seleka has already in June 20 – in 
10 
August 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  And that is 00:15:48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I am saying is I will – we will 
deal with this.  I do want to go through the document trail or 
whatever that you want to address.  So – so I will allow you 
to take me through. 
MR KOKO:  But the point is Chair what happened to the 
arbitration agreement of December 12, 2103?  That is the 
issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson the 
affidavit of Mr Clinton Ephron I will just read the paragraph 
it say: 
“Eskom 
termination 
of 
the 
settlement 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 15 of 383 
 
process led to the hardship arbitration being 
recommenced 
on 
23 
June 
2015 
and 
a 
hearing was scheduled for the period 15 to 
27 May 2016." 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot understand why … 
MR KOKO:  Chairman you cannot understand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean what is the – what is the point of 
going to arbitration if you are going to take almost a year to 
get – to get to a hearing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I – I.. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But anyway you cannot answer that 
question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I cannot answer that question Chair.  
That… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let Mr Koko do not address me on the 
issues now.  I will give you a chance later.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us allow Mr Seleka to put his 
20 
questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when – when he is done then we will 
see how we deal with the issues that you want me to be 
alive to. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 16 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So for that reason Chair then we should 
shift the files – change the files.  Let us go to File 18(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 18(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Chair Mr – before we do that.  Mr Seleka has 
made certain submissions and he has made them I tried to 
count last night this is the fourth time he makes it which are 
10 
false and I do not know when to deal with that but it is false 
that Mr – that the cooperation agreement was terminated by 
Mr Molefe.  It is false, completely false and it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he said Eskom. 
MR KOKO:  No he keeps on saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least now he was reading from Mr 
Ephron’s affidavit. 
MR KOKO:  Chair you see… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Ms Thuli Madonsela has created a story that 
20 
says Mr Molefe was brought to Eskom to terminate the 
cooperation agreement and force Optimum into conditions 
of hardship.  Mr Molefe – Mr Seleka continues with that 
story line which is false and not backed up documents. I 
want to show you even in the – even in the affidavit of OCM 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 17 of 383 
 
they do not support – they do not say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay make a note – make a note of it I 
will give you a chance to deal with it later on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Chair please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just make a note. 
MR KOKO:  Please because it is blatantly false. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Make a note of all the issues that you 
would like address before you leave the witness stand 
10 
today. 
MR KOKO:  18(a). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  18(a).  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Alright you do have 
something to write on there if you want to make notes. 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do okay alright.  Bundle 18 page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 423. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I am going not to respond to some 
20 
of these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But can I say something on this one?  
We shall visit the issue with Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 18 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We produce his letter to him remember 
Chair he was asking for the letter to see what it was worded 
and we – we had – we had to print out a – his signed letter 
to give it to him. After the adjournment he said okay it is 
fine he accepts this is what he wrote in that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I am not sure why… 
MR KOKO:  But Chair would you… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am not sure why – why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him finish Mr Koko. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I finish?   
MR KOKO:  Chair we are going to go back to that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on – hang on let him finish Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So the – that I am making false 
submissions cannot be any further from the truth. 
MR KOKO:  Chair we going to go… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  We are going to go to the letter of May 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can we start Mr Koko make a note. 
MR KOKO:  Which page? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make a note. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  423. 
CHAIRPERSON:  423? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  423 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 19 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Chair so that the Chairperson knows 
what I am dealing with and can indicate.  Chair this is the 
emails between Mr Koko and Mr Joel Raphela prior to the 
letter to the DMR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Joel Raphela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before Mr Koko addresses a letter to the 
DMR where – which he will explain to you why it was written 
to the DMR 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now Mr Koko during your explanation in 
the 
evening 
session 
of 
two 
days 
ago 
you 
told 
the 
Chairperson two things about this – your communication 
with Mr Raphela.  One is that in your email to Mr Raphela 
you said these people are threatening us with Ramaphosa.  
There are the emails on page 423 and 424.  Chairperson by 
way of in a chronolo… 
MR KOKO:  No, no, I wish to a point to sit – what about the 
– in emails I said what? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I will tell you. In a chronological 
order Chair they start on page 424. 
MR KOKO:  No, no Chair Mr Seleka said something I do not 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he what – he says he wants to – he 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 20 of 383 
 
will clarify to you but he now wants to give the context 
before he puts the question to you. 
MR KOKO:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So they start from – it is the bottom 
email on page 424 and they go up in that sequence Chair to 
the page before.  Firstly it is email on 5 December 2015 at 
12:42 pm from Matshela 2010 – matshela2010@yahoo.com 
and the email simply says: 
10 
“Please review and advise.” 
And you will see … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email was to whom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This email Chair we – we picked up from 
the reply that it was to Mr Joel Raphela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you will see the – the reply is the 
top one on Saturday December 5 which is the same day at 
8:45 pm and the email comes from Maleotlala Raphela – 
maleotlala@gmail.com and he writes: 
20 
“Receipt of your email and its contents 
noted with thanks. Letter is being reviewed 
and to – I think is it too good – and will be 
sent 
back 
with 
comments 
covering.  
Significance of 31 December 2015 and we 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 21 of 383 
 
absence of decision makers around that time 
I there – tingly all three time without reliable 
suppliers come 1 January and number of 
megawatt being risked.  A more detailed 
comment will be sent tomorrow.” 
Now Chair what was sent and Mr Koko will confirm that is a 
draft I think to Mr Raphela.  But then it carries on on the 
next page where Mr Raphela then gives detailed comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The page before or next page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The page before. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  423. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is 423. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  423 thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So now it is on the 6 t h of the 12 t h – the 
6 t h of December 2015 at 14:50 from Mr Raphela the email to 
Mr Matshela – matshela2010 and it is a Re Re – so it is a 
double reply it says: 
“My 3G not working hope you receive this.  
20 
Further to my email of yesterday I am 
proposing the following.  At OCM current 
supply 
arrangement 
with 
the 
business 
rescue practitioners and on 31 December

arrangement are on the Eskom’s or the 
national grid.” 
But then he carries on there Chairperson.  I want to ask Mr 
Koko this is regard to what he said to the Chairperson in 
the evening session two days ago.  In a long winded 
explanation that Mr Koko gave he threw something into it. 
MR KOKO:  Chair my response were not long winded and I 
take exception to that.  I take exception to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in – I guess in his explanation will do 
10 
Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:  No Chair I – I do not tolerate such discussion – 
such approaches. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he said in my emails to Joel 
Raphela I said these people are threatening us with 
Ramaphosa.  And my question to him is he should show the 
Chairperson where did he say that in his emails to Mr 
Raphela? 
MR KOKO:  Chair go again Mr Seleka is off 00:26:09.  The 
transcripts will show you exactly what I said and I am 
20 
beginning not to like this Chair.  Mr Seleka has done it 
many times putting words in my mouth and I have referred 
you in particular to the transcripts.  You can see today I am 
not in a good mood.  I said to you I told Mr Raphela that 
Optimum keeps on threatening us with Mr Ramaphosa.  He 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 23 of 383 
 
then said to – he summarised what we discussed and he 
then said to me I must put in writing.  I said to him… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to remain factual. 
MR KOKO:  I want to remain factual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  That is what I told you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so in other words from what you said it 
is clear that you did not put it in writing. 
MR KOKO:  Exactly.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the disc – you were saying in the 
10 
discussion. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you said. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So I do not – I am – Chair I am going to put a 
stop to this type of line that puts words in my mouth that I 
never said.  When the transcripts are in black and white.  I 
am saying this Chair because I – I was – I went to bed last 
night very aggrieved because I watched the travelling 
20 
agents here.  I watched them reading paragraphs in their 
affidavit that they disowned.  I have constantly told you that 
your legal team and your investigating people are coaching 
these witnesses to the extent that they come here and say 
this is not me.  I did not write this.  And nothing happens.  I 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 24 of 383 
 
wrote to you at the beginning that your investigators Mr 
Seleka in particular are coaching these witnesses but 
getting upset. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But. 
MR KOKO:  I do not like it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in as far as the – Mr Koko obviously if 
you have something to say about the travel agents we – you 
can deal with that in due course. 
MR KOKO:  I do have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my recollection is that as far you were 
10 
concerned – as far as what they had to say about you I did 
not think that there was anything in dispute between your 
version and their version.  But you can deal with it later on. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
MR KOKO:  I have a lot to say but I do not want to be 
distracted about the falsehood that Mr Seleka just said now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Okay I have my notes 
Chair but we will see the transcript.  And then Mr Koko you 
20 
said  
“I went to the DMR and I told them I do not have coal you 
have to work with me.” 
MR KOKO:  That I said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well can you tell the Chairperson – well 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 25 of 383 
 
let me – let me say this to you then you can comment 
00:29:17.  That statement if you made it at all to the DMR. 
MR KOKO:  I did – I did make it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where did you make it? 
MR KOKO:  I met Mr Raphela.  I drove to meet him in 
Pretoria North.  We met I think the restaurant was Spur and 
I did so on two occasions.  The first occasion was after the 
meeting I had with the business rescue practitioners on the 
28 t h of October 2014 at 2015 that the meeting that was 
followed by a letter on the 29 t h of October 2015.  It is part 
10 
of the audit trail I want to give you.  I met him again at the 
same restaurant after I received the letter of – on the 3 r d of 
November 2015 and that letter need me not want to speak 
again to the business rescue practitioners.  It told me four 
things, as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, which letter? 
MR KOKO:   We will find it in ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just give me the date? 
MR KOKO:   3 November 2015.  I have got it.  It is in 
Bundle 15(c).  It is in Bundle 15(c).  That letter – and 
20 
Chair, this is the audit trail that you left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I will make sure we go through.  On the 22 n d – 
on the 20 t h of August 2016 – 2015, we get a letter, it is in 
my bundle, it is in 15(c), that says we are stopping the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 26 of 383 
 
band(?).  You will not get coal. You have got until the 24 t h, 
on Monday, to decide what to do from the Business Rescue 
Practitioners.   
 
I then write a letter to Mr Molefe and we will go 
into that letter.  I then asked the senior counsel’s opinion.  
The 
interim 
agreement 
that 
the 
Business 
Rescue 
Practitioners proposed was a 30-day agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, Mr Koko.  You 
know, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am wondering whether it is not best 
that 
we 
start 
with 
this 
trial 
that 
Mr 
Koko 
wants 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, we will not go fast. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because no matter how I say let us 
finish your questions and then get to it ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...we will not go back to it. 
MR KOKO:   We will not go far without an audit trial. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we do it ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...then whatever questions you have 
later on then at least he does not have to tell me anything 
about the trial because he would have dealt with it. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 27 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is no way ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  He feels strongly about it and 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it then work if we do it that 
way or would that ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And I will not be long.  If you just 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thirty minutes.  Okay.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us do it then.  Is that fine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The audit trial? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is that fine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says it will take 30-minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I know Mr Koko takes long, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am reluctant to agree because I know 
that Mr Koko takes long. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, on that particular point ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say we are not starting. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With what you want.  You see, once he 
has dealt with it ...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 28 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ....he goes back – I cannot tell you have 
told me about it. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair.  You can shut me down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in that way – ja, I can shut him down.  
So I think let us do that now because he is the one who 
wants to deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it suits you, we can give him the 
platform. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He makes sure that I have the bundle.  
You have there the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then he goes through without you 
having to ask him a lot of questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can ask him questions after. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He goes through and he finishes it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What – you said Bundle 15? 
MR KOKO:   15(c), Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   15? 
MR KOKO:   15(c). 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 29 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is there an A or B ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   15(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   15(c).  Ja, let us go to it and... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thirty-minutes, hey? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell us on what page we must start 
on, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, 15(c), 1590. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1590, okay.  Okay just announce again, 
Mr Koko, what topic this deals with? 
10 
MR KOKO:   This deals with the acquisition of Optimum by 
Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By Tegeta? 
MR KOKO:   By Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Yes, by Glencore, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And then maybe just to identify the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Please go to one five – page 1581. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1581? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got 1581.   
MR KOKO:   You will see that is a document that was 
published by ...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 30 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure the transcript 
has got, as we are now using Eskom Bundle 15(c).  Okay 
alright.  Glencore International proposed to be renamed 
Glencore Extractor PLC, right.  That is at 1581. 
MR KOKO:   And Chair, I need you to go to 1590. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I got – I am there. 
MR KOKO:   And you have go the highlighted part there?  I 
want to read them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And during the second half of 2011 
10 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You said you wanted to 
identify the document first.  You did not say what it is. 
MR KOKO:   Oh, it a document by Glencore ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...during the measurement structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And it was issued for – to the investors. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
that 
before 
Glencore 
acquired 
Optimum? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Before Glencore acquired Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue. 
MR KOKO:   It says: 
“During the second half of 2011, Glencore 
acquired a 31.2% interest in Optimum Coal for 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 31 of 383 
 
382 million Dollars. 
Following 
the 
receipt 
of 
applicable 
for 
approval, a consortium of Glencore and Cyril 
Ramaphosa 
and 
prominent 
South 
African 
businessmen, who is Glencore’s local BEE 
partner, 
completed 
the 
acquisition 
of 
the 
additional 
interest 
of 
Optimum 
on 
26 March 2012...” 
 
Chair, I want to stop there.  So I – the first point 
I want to put to you is that Optimum paid – Glencore paid 
10 
382 million Dollars in – to buy 31.2% stake in Optimum.  It 
then paid – and it means that by October 2011, Glencore 
was 
effectively 
a 
shareholder, 
31.2% 
shareholder 
of 
Optimum.  On 26 of March, they paid another 382 million 
Dollars to acquire additional 30% of ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, where do you see – I do not see 
that 392 in regard to 26 March.  Where is it? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see R 38.00 per share later in the 
highlighted portion. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is not properly written here but I also 
– I have it now and that I can give you through during 
break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I have it.  I have it. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 32 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I do not want to waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  That is fine. 
MR KOKO:   But all in all, Glencore paid 760 million 
Dollars to buy Optimum.  And the point I am making is.  
They had two-stepped(?) it.  October 2011 and then they 
doubled their investment in March 2016(sic).  By October 
2011 ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   2012. 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   March 2012. 
MR KOKO:   By October 2011, they had – they were in a 
position to ask for all what they need.  They were the 
shareholder of Optimum.  So they cannot come here and lie 
to you that we did not have information to do due 
diligence.  You were a 31% shareholder and you doubled 
your 31% shareholding.   
 
You cannot come to this Commission and say 
you did not do a due diligence because you did not want to 
increase the shares of Optimum when you are already a 
20 
shareholder.  That is the first part.  So they are lying to 
you. 
 
Chair, I do not want to go to the document but 
this happened in October 2011.  You will remember there 
was 
an 
arbitration 
that 
was 
concluded 
on 
the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 33 of 383 
 
12 t h of April 2011.  That was signed by Mr Marokane.  That 
dealt with all the disputes and rights of parties and dealt 
with the issue of quantity, it dealt with the issue of quality 
and confirmed(?) all the rights.  So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the settlement agreement? 
MR KOKO:   It is the settlement agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Addendum 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  So for all intense and purposes, 
10 
Glencore was aware of all of this because they were a 31% 
shareholder.  They cannot come and say they did not know.  
Mr Ramaphosa then became the Chairman of Optimum on 
the 26 t h of March, replacing Mr Bobby Godsell.   
 
So if we are going to implement a settlement 
agreement of 12 April 2016, it means that Optimum had – 
on the first day they had to start paying penalties or Eskom 
had to start deducting penalties because all the disputes 
were resolved. 
 
Chair, from day one that Optimum took over 
20 
Optimum on the 26 t h of April they have never paid 
penalties other than the – index. They never did.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And they was no reason why. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say from the time that Glencore took 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 34 of 383 
 
over ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   From ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...took Optimum over and ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and just buying the majority shares. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  They never deducted penalties.  There 
was no reason why because there was an arbitration 
agreement, there was a settlement agreement which says 
10 
Optimum must do that and they did not do it.  And here I 
am saying in my affidavit because an ace up their sleeves 
that they had and I have no – because of this Commission, 
the ace up their sleeves at all material times has been 
Cyril Ramaphosa.  But on the 23 r d of April, they then 
issued – it is another...  They then ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 2012 or which year? 
MR KOKO:   On the 23 r d of April 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   They then issued a notice.  I am going to take 
20 
you that notice.  It is very important Chair because you 
will...  [Speaker moves away from microphone]   
ADV BARRIE:   It is at page 1799 of this bundle, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   1799. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 35 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair.  Now you will see that this is a 
notice.  It is  letter from Mr Riaan du Plooy of Optimum to 
Pam Pillay of Eskom and it is dated 23 April 2013 and the 
title of the letter is Hendrina Coal Supply Agreement, Size 
and Specification.  And if you – it says – if I take you to 
paragraph point 3.  It says: 
“OCH has now reached the conclusion that its 
size and specifications set out in Clause 3.43 
of 
the 
first 
addendum 
are 
no 
longer 
realistically representative of the coal which 
10 
OCM can reasonably be expected to achieve 
from the exploitation of the coal deposit. 
It has been the OCM’s view OCM conducting 
its operation in a proper manner...” 
 
And then if you go to paragraph 46(?): 
“We, therefore, hereby formally notify Eskom 
that we wish to renegotiate specifications as 
set out in 3.4 of the first addendum as 
contemplated in Clause 3.44 and 3.45...” 
 
Chair, I took you to the first addendum that – 
20 
now Eskom and Mr Argon(?) refers to this attachment, is 
that we stopped deducting penalties because of this 
document.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Who says that? 
MR KOKO:   It is Gert Opperman in his transcript. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 36 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says Eskom stopped imposing 
penalties because of this document? 
MR KOKO:   Because of this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is on page 62.  You will find that on 
page 62 of Mr Gert Opperman’s addendum on Day 62 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   ...of the proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I can read to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But I will not ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Now Chair ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now let us just get what this letter says.  
We.. 
“OCH has now reached the conclusion that its 
size and specifications set out in Clause 3.43 
of 
the 
first 
addendum 
are 
no 
longer 
20 
realistically representative of the coal which 
OCM can reasonably be expected to achieve 
from the exploitation of the coal deposit...” 
 
Basically, OCM is saying:  We cannot meet the 
contractual requirement relating to the specification.  Is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 37 of 383 
 
that right? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And what do they propose should 
happen? 
MR KOKO:   To renegotiate the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “We, therefore, hereby formally notify  
Eskom 
that 
we 
wish 
to 
renegotiate 
the 
specifications as set...” 
 
So they want to renegotiate so that there is an 
addendum to the contract as far as the specifications are 
10 
concerned? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Now what they did not mention in that 
contract.  They say 2.43, 2.44, 2.45.  They do not mention 
3.46 which I want to take you to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But before we go there.  The letter 
would only have penalties – would only affect penalties 
20 
insofar as there may have been a failure on their part to 
comply with the contract in terms of specifications of the 
coal because they are saying they want to renegotiate that. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 38 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Now this is not a reason for Eskom not to 
deduct the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So if Eskom decides to not deduct penalties, 
it is unlawful.  It is an unlawful activity and it is in 
contravention with Clause 55, 51 and 50 and 51 of the 
PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe one would not say it is 
10 
unlawful because they are not under an obligation to 
impose penalties.  It is a right they have which they can 
use if they want and not use if they do not want.  That is 
Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   No, Eskom has got an obligation, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To impose a penalty? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Clause – I can take you a clause, 
Clause 9.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Please, at some stage, take me 
there so that I can have a look, so that I can understand 
20 
your ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   The only remedy in the coal supply agreement 
for Eskom for non-compliant coal, we have discussed it the 
other day, are two.  Rejection or penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but my understanding what one 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 39 of 383 
 
would expect from the contracts such as this, is that, the 
issue of penalties would be there for Eskom’s benefit and 
if, for whatever reason, Eskom thought it was in its interest 
not to enforce the penalties, even though it is entitled to 
do, enforce them if it wants to, it would be within its right 
not to enforce.   
 
But the – but one they are – once Eskom says to 
Optimum pay these penalties because of A, B, C, D then 
Optimum is obliged to pay.  That would be what one would 
expect. 
10 
MR KOKO:   It is excellent, Chair.  And with your point will 
apply when I deal with the corporate(?) agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Eskom has not waived its right ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...to not – did not deduct penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  I think we maybe we 
involved in some – you are saying right now, now 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...then what – are going to say 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...I am saying Eskom has not ...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 40 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...Eskom has not set down ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
...and 
say 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
Eskom 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...we know we have to deduct penalties but we 
think it is in the best interest of both parties that we do not 
do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Eskom... [Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
And 
therefore, 
the 
people 
who 
are 
administering the contract, they are obliged to deduct the 
penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.  You see, when you are talk 
about the people who are administering within Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the obligation part makes sense. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they are people within Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If their job is penalties that should be 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 41 of 383 
 
imposed, they should be imposed. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  And that is the report(?)  And Eskom has 
not – they are obliged to deduct penalties.  Those people 
have not done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And the letter of CE2(?) will refer to, it is not 
a license(?) for them not to do that.  In fact... we do not do 
it.  [Speaker unclear] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   They are breaking Eskom rules and they are 
breaking the PFMA’ rules. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So, Chair, if you go to nine – 70 – page 7016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1760? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, start by telling us what that 
document is. 
MR KOKO:   It is a first addendum to the Coal Supply 
20 
Agreement.  You will recall that the Annexure 3 – CE2 
referred to 3.44 and 3.45. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And 3.44 is – deals with what happens in the 
event that Optimum feels that they can no longer meet the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 42 of 383 
 
specifications in the Coal Supply Agreement.  So they – 
you can – they are entitled in terms of this document, in 
this clause to ask for renegotiations of the Coal Supply 
Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   But it does not end there, Chair.  If you go to 
3.46. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   3.46 says:  In the ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...did not refer in the letter, you may be 
10 
saying. 
MR KOKO:   To which they did not refer in the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
“In the event that the parties shall fail for 
whatever reason to reach such agreement, 
such 
failure 
to 
reach 
agreement 
shall 
constitute a dispute which shall be dealt with 
in accordance with the provisions of Clause 
6...” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the matter on which they would be 
failing to reach agreement is quality ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Is quality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of coal, ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is quality of coal. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 43 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MR KOKO:   So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And quality of coal, does – oh, the 
specification would include quality? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tegeta specifically says size and 
specification ...[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   It the size and specification. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   Size and specification is quality – is part of 
the quality – it is free scale(?) property(?) of the coal’s 
size and specifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, specification. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Now Clause 6 is the Arbitration Clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Yes, you want us to go there or we 
20 
do not need to? 
MR KOKO:   We do not need to go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   All that I am saying ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Arbitration Clause. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 44 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   All that I am saying is that I think I can no 
longer meet the specifications.  Let us renegotiate the 
agreement – the dispute arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   As simple as that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the only arbitration agreement was done, 
was in December 2016.  So this dispute should have found 
its way in the December 2016 Arbitration Agreement and 
did not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this of the 2011 settlement agreement. 
MR KOKO:   It is after the 2011 settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So the only arbitration that 
came after this is 2016? 
MR KOKO:   No, is December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2013? 
MR KOKO:   December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   12 t h December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, fine. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Which was – for the reasons I have told you.  
I have told you that the specific circumstances do not 
include export. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The special circumstances. 
MR KOKO:   The special circumstances include export. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 45 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Secondly, the size and specification that is a 
fact here, I have referred you to an affidavit of Mr Gert 
Opperman, paragraph 60, that the actual... was there 
operations.  The problem was the secondary crusher at the 
substations as they operated wrongly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   So they would not been banned(?).  In any 
event, Mr Voges stopped it in October 2015.  So either 
way, those disputes, they were bound to lose.  That is why 
10 
they then entered into a Cooperation Agreement in – on the 
23 r d of May 2016.  And Chair, I do not want to take it to 
my...  I – the purpose of the Cooperation Agreement did 
three things... three things.  To state arbitration of 
December 2013.  Put it on hold.  One.   
 
Two, to suspend penalties that Eskom was not 
deducting.  So they wanted to regularise that.  Four, was to 
enter into a fourth addendum and it was signed on the 23 r d 
of April.  Now Chair, this is the very important part.  It was 
signed – the person who signed it had no authority to sign. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was that again? 
MR KOKO:   Ms Maharaj. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   Ms Maharaj. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 46 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   It was an unlawful act and I am going and 
show you – show this to you.  I am going to take you to 
Bundle 15(a).   
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 15(a). 
MR KOKO:   M... 49.  [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just what page? 
MR KOKO:   ...page 690. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
MR KOKO:   690. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Six, nine, zero? 
10 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, just for the record.  This is the 
document, 
32.1034, 
Eskom 
Procurement 
and 
Supply 
Management Procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV BARRIE:   It starts at page 595 of this bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 595, that is where the document 
starts and the page that you want me to go to is? 
20 
MR KOKO:   690. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Six, nine, zero. 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am there Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, for every contract that is – all contract 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 47 of 383 
 
in Eskom are approved by a Tender Committee.  We call it 
PTC, Procurement in the Committee.  They have got a 
different delegation of authority and the highest Board 
Tender Committee is the one with the board that adjudicate 
tenders, more than R 750 000,00... R 750 million.   
 
And nobody in Eskom is allowed to change the 
terms and condition of the contract unless it has got an 
approval 
of 
the 
original 
Procurement 
and 
Tender 
Committee that approved it.  You are delegated.  If you 
want to make changes on the procurement, on the terms 
10 
and conditions you go to the board.   
 
The Cooperation Agreement changed the terms 
and conditions of the Coal Supply Agreement.  Did that.  
Now, I am going to read to you the foot of page 690.   
“It must be noted that there is a difference 
between Eskom internal governance process to 
authorise a modification and a contractual 
process to effect a change to the works 
information or – requirement specifications, 
terms and conditions of the contract. 
20 
Internal governance process must first be 
followed via a formal modification process 
before changes to the work information or 
employers requirement specifications including 
quantities and/or design can be given effect at 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 48 of 383 
 
the compensation events of the written(?) 
orders...” 
 
So you have to follow the internal governance 
process and the internal governance process, you will find 
it at page 691. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is an internal Eskom document 
which sets out in this paragraph that if you want to change 
anything in a contract you must follow official modification 
processes. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, on page 69(?), bullet point 3, it refers 
to what we call a commercial ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, what page? 
MR KOKO:   Page 69, the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   691? 
MR KOKO:   691. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
20 
MR KOKO:   It refers to the Commercial Transactions 
Approval form.  It says: 
“The procurement practitioner arranges for the 
Commercial 
Transactions 
Approval 
form 
to 
be 
placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
Procurement 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 49 of 383 
 
Committee or may present the transaction to the 
relevant dual or duplication for approval depending 
on the total approved during the time. 
Requests must be addressed to the delegated 
approval 
authority 
that 
approved 
the 
original 
contract.  Where the revised best estimate of the 
expenditure plus cumulative contingencies value 
stated in the delegated consent form…” 
That is what is what the DCF stands for. 
“…and/or total type exceeds the delegation of the 
10 
authority of the original authority, the request must 
be submitted ot the next higher level of authority.” 
 Chair, this good governance, so you needed a commercial 
transaction form, the commercial transaction form had to 
be approved by the procurement tender committee that 
approved the coal supply agreement of Optimum and that 
was the procurement tender committee of the board.  It is 
not in place.  I asked for it, I have written to your legal 
team, give me the commercial transaction form that was 
approved by the board tender committee of Eskom that 
20 
gave authority to the person who signed the cooperation 
agreement.  It was never given – it is not there.  So the 
cooperation agreement is irregular, Chair. 
 
Chair, I want to take you on the same bundle to 
MK50, it is in page – and this is the audit trail that you 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 50 of 383 
 
need otherwise you wander in the wilderness.  Page 781. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, page 781, submission document. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or does it start at 780. 
MR KOKO:   It starts in 780.  Chair, it is the feedback of 
the document that served at the board tender committee on 
the 15 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and it is a submission, document. 
MR KOKO:   And it is a submission document, if you go to 
the signature page …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is executive summary. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what page do you want me to go 
to? 
MR KOKO:   The signature page is page 784. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess it is important to read what 
is paragraph 1 at page 780: 
“Mandate to conclude negotiations with Optimum 
Coal Mine for coal supply to Hendrina power 
station.” 
20 
Okay, that is what it is about. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, continue. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I refer you to – if you go to page 781, 
paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  It says: 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 51 of 383 
 
“Based 
on 
the 
risk 
associated 
with 
the 
abovementioned hardship notice the Primary Energy 
department sensitised the Eskom board tender 
committee about the said notice on 12 August 2014 
and was mandated to enter into negotiations with 
Optimum to resolve prevalent issues in order to get 
assurance 
that 
Eskom 
could 
secure 
coal 
for 
Hendrina until and post 2012.” 
Chair, here is Mr Bester and his team who says the first 
time that we notified the procurement tender committee 
10 
was on the 12 August 2014, three months after the 
cooperation …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is he the author this document? 
MR KOKO:   He is the author of this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Three months after the cooperation agreement 
was concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When was the cooperation agreement? 
MR KOKO:   23 May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka will take you to the bundle, I do n 
to want to waste fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   So all that I am saying to you is that on paper 
it is common cause that the procurement tender committee 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 52 of 383 
 
of Eskom did not authorise the cooperation agreement and 
the first time it came to know about it was the 12 August 
2014.   
 
Chair I will take you the document of the 12 August 
2014 because the only time it went there was because of 
me but I want to take you to page 780, read 2.2, it says: 
“Primary Energy division is mandated to negotiate 
and 
conclude 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
Optimum 
hardship claim in lieu of writing off the penalties 
that have been suspended against Optimum since 
10 
2012.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   PED is what? 
MR KOKO:   Primary Energy department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   PED is mandated to negotiate and 
conclude the termination of the Optimum hardship claim in 
lieu of writing off the penalties that have been suspended 
against Optimum since 2012.  In other words, penalties had 
been suspended at that time and this paragraph says PED 
must conclude the termination of the hardship claim 
instead of writing off penalties. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the first time I am telling you is that there 
was no authority suspending the penalties.  So the team 
acted irregularly and unlawfully. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 53 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But secondly, at this point in time the 
penalties were – it was in March.  If you go to the affidavit 
of CSH which I will take you to, the penalties were already 
R1.3 billion that were suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is March 2015? 
MR KOKO:   This is March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   The penalties was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or April 2015 or thereabouts. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but Chair the actual number of penalties 
was 1.9 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As at when? 
MR KOKO:   As in April 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2019? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But, Chair, we are going to come to that 
because this is where you will see …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before you proceed, Mr Koko, 
I was looking at the end of this document because you said 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 54 of 383 
 
that Mr Bester was the author.  I do not see his name.  
Where do you get that from that he is the author? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, please go to page 796. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There I see his name and signature.  But 
is that not a separate document? 
MR KOKO:     It is the same set of documents, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you say it is the same set of 
documents? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, all these documents, the Eskom 
regulations requires of you to bring all of them together. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But who has signed at the end of the 
document we are looking at because it does not give the 
name, it just say Regional Executive Acting and there is a 
signature.  Do you know who is signature when you say 
Executive Acting? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, which page are you talking to, which 
signature? 
CHAIRPERSON:   784, which is …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   The top one is Mr Vusi Mboweni. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first one? 
20 
MR KOKO:   The first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the second one is Mr Eben Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And if you look at the next page, on page 785, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 55 of 383 
 
at the top it says compiler. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 785? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does it say compiler? 
MR KOKO:   To the Chairman, Compiler. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, Johan Bester. 
MR KOKO:   Johan Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is a very different document. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I agree with you but if you – the Eskom 
requirement is that this is a single board(?) document, all 
10 
of these documents are compiled by Mr Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this document starting at page785 like 
an annexure to the one that we are dealing with? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair, correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there would be a submission 
document first which this document is. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there would be annexures to it. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the body of the submission 
20 
document would that be something that tells us what 
documents are annexed so that we know that which 
documents are… 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we find that in the regard to the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 56 of 383 
 
documents that follow? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where do we find it? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, what happens there and maybe I do not 
understand it is that the board submissions …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, which this one is. 
MR KOKO:   Is a tick box. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So there must – the secretariat will not accept 
the board submissions unless all these are together. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  The documents are together. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, I understand that, but I am 
ask whether in the submission document itself there would 
be any reference that tells what annexures are annexed.  
You know, in the affidavit. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, Chair.  No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know in the affidavit that you say 
annexure so and so. 
MR KOKO:   I get your point, I get your point. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you do not have that here. 
MR KOKO:   No, we do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So in order to know what 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 57 of 383 
 
– to know which documents were annexures to this 
submission document, where would we go? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you do not need to worry because each 
document stands on its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that they went together, that is 
what I am talking about. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That they went together, how do we 
know? 
MR KOKO:   The minutes of the board. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The minutes of the board will indicate. 
MR KOKO:   The minutes will indicate it and Mr Seleka has 
it, I can tell you that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I do not have it, Chair, you will 
have to show me …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   But I got it from you.  You will have it 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka, let us continue, we can 
check that later. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am very, very, very happy to show 
you because I have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is fine, you can show me 
later. 
MR KOKO:   I have it, Mr Seleka. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 58 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can show me later, let us just 
continue with the trail. 
MR KOKO:   So, Chair …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are now at 1130, Chair, just to 
remind you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, yes.  Okay, we have done the 
30 minutes, actually a little more than that but you have 
not finished, I will give you more time. 
MR KOKO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but ten should be fine? 
10 
MR KOKO:   I will stop at – in ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright, let us continue. 
MR KOKO:   Go to 783. 
CHAIRPERSON:   783? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  No, no, no – ja, 783. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, paragraph 3.1.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   3.1.3, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Optimum …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Optimum hardship and penalty costs. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
“Optimum has not met required parameters in terms 
of the existing coal supply agreement and hence 
have outstanding penalties due to Eskom of 16 
million at the end of January 2015.” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 59 of 383 
 
Chair, this is the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are they saying 16 million in July 
2015? 
MR KOKO:   But Chairman, this is – now you will 
understand why I was intolerant to this team because the 
penalties are in the region of R2 billion.  They are lying to 
the board, they are telling the board the penalties – first 
they are saying the penalties have been suspended from 
2015 and there is no authority …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say they suspended them 
10 
without authority? 
MR KOKO:   They suspended them without authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And then they tell the board actually, the 
penalties that we suspended is not 2.1 billion, it is R16 
million.  These are the people we are dealing that your 
investigators are not picking up these things but they want 
to judge my behaviour.   
 
Chair, because I have got ten minutes I want to 
take you back to the affidavit of – I think it was 14A that 
20 
we started with Mr Seleka, of CDH.  Chair, I can 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second.  With regard 
to the conduct of the Eskom personnel who were supposed 
to enforce penalties that you complained about. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 60 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the point again that you seek to 
make with regard to their conduct in suspending penalties, 
number one.  And two, saying the penalties are 16 million 
when according to you they have gone a billion? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have opened a criminal case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is a criminal matter and I am saying to you 
– I am saying to the police these people are working with 
Glencore.  It cannot happen one way. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   This is a criminal matter.  I have opened a 
criminal case, I have gone to the Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So – but I am …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is the reason why you were 
mentioning it. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but all these things, Chair, informs my 
20 
decisions at the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   When we deal with these other issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But because of the time please take me to the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 61 of 383 
 
CDH affidavit, it is in 15A. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom… 
MR KOKO:   The one we started with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom bundle 15(d). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have said ten minutes, Mr Koko, but I 
do want you – I do not want you to complain that you have 
not dealt with issues. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I will …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if I must add a little bit in order to 
make sure you have dealt with, I will add, I just want you 
10 
to deal with the issues. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I just want to tell you I am respectful, I 
do not want to waste your time but it is very important that 
I make the issues that I want to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   I respect your time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes, Chair, may I speak? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   One can see the witness is already 
20 
under time pressure and he is making mistakes as regards 
dates and references and so on so forth to which the 
evidence leader is contributing.  The witness must have his 
say and he should stop feeling pressurised by time.  He 
must do this properly because he now feels because of the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 62 of 383 
 
conduct of the evidence leader that oh, he must have to 
rush it and he should not rush it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Barrie, I think Mr Koko and I 
understand each other.  I want him to feel that he has dealt 
with issues.  I think in return he is saying I am quite happy 
to do that but I do not want to spend more time than is 
necessary.  So the bottom line before me, Mr Koko, is that 
you must be able to deal with the issues you want to raise 
properly. 
MR KOKO:   Thank you, Chair, I will do that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, sorry – Mr Koko, before you 
move on, I want clarity on the criminal case that you 
opened, would that be against Mr Vusi Mboweni and Edwin 
Mabelane who signed the document? 
MR KOKO:   I have listed eight names, Chair, and I have 
got it – it is in my car and I am happy to give it to Mr 
Seleka [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine but let us take the tea 
break now, that will give you time to just look at the issues 
you still want to cover. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Can we finish the CDH matter? 
CHAIRPERSON:   CDH matter? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at twenty five to, we will 
continue with it after tea.  But it gives you time to also look 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 63 of 383 
 
at these are the issues I want to cover and then you can 
cover them.  Okay, let us take the tea adjournment, we 
resume at ten to twelve.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
MR KOKO:  ...up to the tune of R2billion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   That Eskom was entitled to and we dealt with 
the – how the CDH lawyers ill-advised Eskom on the 
10 
Clause 9.6 when the spreadsheet would work, that actually 
Eskom was entitled to the – and I am talking about the 
project team here because they were authorised to deduct 
penalties and they did not deduct penalties. 
And Eskom as a whole did not take a decision to 
deduct penalties and the action by OCM not to go on 
arbitration but instead go put the business into business 
rescue was act of impunity…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Business rescue. 
MR KOKO:   Business rescue, was act of impunity and I 
20 
will also go to it and I will refer to it now because the first 
addendum of the coal supply agreement makes provision 
for Eskom to take over the mine.  So - and one of the 
letters I wrote to Brian was invoked that clause to take 
over this mine. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 64 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That Eskom may take over the mine 
under what circumstances, generally speaking? 
MR KOKO:   So, for example, under conditions of hardship, 
Eskom can step over and say we are going to keep this 
mine, 
demanding 
the 
coal 
supply 
agreement 
makes 
provisions to that.  We have taken legal advice to that 
Chair, I will refer you to that legal advice and the legal 
advice from the counsel says now that the mine is under 
business rescue Eskom can no longer exercise that 
provision in the coal supply agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And my proposition to you is that Glencore 
chose to rely on business rescue rather than arbitration to 
make sure that Eskom does not step in an exercise the 
clause in the contract that says it is entitled to take over 
the contract, all that was an act of impunity and the ace up 
their sleeve was nothing else but their political connectivity 
Chair. 
Chair can we  go to paragraph 18, to Bundle 15C, 
page 1825. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1825? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  Chair, the Board of Eskom 
that I worked under was very, very considerate to the plight 
of Optimum.  They did not take the view that says we have 
got a coal supply agreement.  We have got a hardship 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 65 of 383 
 
clause that excludes hardship, you are in hardship it is 
none of your business - none of our business, go away. 
The Board of Eskom did not take that line, the 
Board of Eskom was very, very considering.  The Board of 
Eskom was alive to the fact that if Optimum goes under, we 
going to catch the few[? 3:34] and the document you 
have…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But that attitude, which you say the 
Board did not take, I got the impression that that is the 
attitude that Mr Molefe took.  Is that a mistake?  
10 
MR KOKO:   It is a mistake, Chair and this is the mistake I 
am trying to correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is a mistake that was first peddled by Mr 
Thuli Madonsela that everybody's peddling it here.  The 
documents that is before you, the documentary evidence 
before you shows you that the Eskom Board bent extremely 
backwards to accommodate…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I am not talking about the Board 
and I am not necessarily looking at what Ms Madonsela 
20 
said or the documents I am just recalling my impression of 
Mr Brian Molefe’s evidence and his attitude in regard to 
Optimum because he said, I think he said what you have 
said in so far as Optimum or Glencore’s problem being one 
that is connected with the outside market, one. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 66 of 383 
 
Two, I think he made it clear that his position - at 
least that was my impression of him, that his position was 
we have an agreement with you, you now want us to 
increase the funds there is no justification for us to do that 
and we will stick to the agreement, that was my impression 
of what he said. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I got to that position myself, after 
Glencore kicked us on the face, when we engaged them 
and the document before you now shows you how I, Mr 
Matshela Moses Koko bent backwards to accommodate 
10 
them. And after they kicked me in the face, I showed them 
a finger. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay page 1825.  
MR KOKO:   The document on page 1825 is the submission 
to the Board Tender Committee of 12 August 2014.  You 
may recall that I took you through Bundle 15 where there 
Mr Bester said the Board was informed of the hardship 
clause on the 12 t h of August 2014.  This is the time that the 
Board was informed Chair.  If you go to the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I see that you were a signatory to 
20 
this document.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, and when Mr Bester wrote to me for 
the first time around June the hardship position of 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 67 of 383 
 
Glencore he did not tell me that he has already signed – 
that they have already signed the cooperation agreement.  
He just told me about the hardship, I said such a condition 
we should not be sleeping, we should be rushing to the 
Board because the consequences of this to Eskom is bad.  
So we then put this document and you will see 
throughout this document, nothing - there is no reference 
to the cooperation agreement because I even did not know 
about a cooperation agreement.  At that point my point was 
what Mr Bester is telling me if I become part to it, if I say 
10 
we have got a contract, we must comply.  Is there way 
of…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would hurt Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   That would hurt us, that was my position.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you decided to go to the Board. 
MR KOKO:   And then I decided to go to the Board to 
convince the Board to say, well, let us look for a middle 
ground.  We know we are right, we know we can force our 
right but I do not think it will help us, more so that 
Optimum at that point had already given Mr Bester a 
20 
proposal on how to break the deadlock. 
And Chair, if you go to page 826.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
I 
am 
going 
to 
read 
it; 
it 
says 
OCM…[intervene] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 68 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it makes it easier if one can say 
what the purpose of the document is, paragraph 1: 
“Title of a submission request for a mandate to 
negotiate but not conclude coal supply agreements 
for up to 24 years to ensure the security of coal 
supply for Hendrina Power Station.” 
Okay, ja continue.  
MR KOKO:   So if you go to page 1826 Chair: 
“OCM is currently claiming hardship, citing that 
Optimum Colliery has not been recovering its cost 
10 
on the Eskom product over the past three years.  
Based on the current modus operandi OCM have 
proposed a price increase from the current R154 
per ton after quality price adjustment this dropped 
R136 per ton, year to date May 2014 to R285 per 
ton for the remaining part of the period and R375 
per ton plus profit margin post 2018 to 2023.” 
I will stop there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   So Optimum says to Mr Bester we are in 
20 
hardship, to get out of hardship we need a price increase 
from R154 per ton to R285 per ton.  If you go to the bottom 
of the same page.  I am going to read the last sentence to 
go to the next page he says: 
“As the current coal qualities are not meeting 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 69 of 383 
 
Hendrina specifications…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you said we go to the bottom 
of the page. 
MR KOKO:   The last sentence: 
“As the current coal qualities are not meeting the 
Hendrina 
specification 
the 
primary 
energy 
department aims to negotiate but not conclude a 
real base of R296 per ton which equates to R14,28 
per kilojoule based on the current higher CV’s of 
20.75 mega joules per kilogram as received” 
10 
AR means, as received, Chair.  
“The aspirational base is R190 spectrum, which 
equates to R9,20 per gigajoule based on the CV’s 
of R20,75 per mega joule as received, which is also 
higher than the current CV of 28.38.” 
Chair, here we were asking the Board, we said to the 
Board it is not whether we are right or wrong.  We know we 
are right, we know the contract protect us but with the 
proposal from Optimum to increase the price from R154 per 
ton to R255, however, we also realise that there is quality 
20 
issues, so let us actually give them R296 rather than R285 
per ton. 
So that was our real base and the aspirational base 
was R190 per ton.  The Board approved this and there is 
minutes to that, so the Board said…[intervene] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 70 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, and this is July 2015? 
MR KOKO:   July 2014, August 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   August 2014.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, so the Board says to us, okay, the 
current 
price 
that 
is 
allegedly 
causing 
hardship 
for 
Optimum is R154 per ton, we are giving you the authority 
to go and renegotiate between under R196 per ton to R296 
per ton.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, it was quite an exciting moment, 
10 
because we know as a team that actually we only have to 
meet R285 per ton. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Then we will have a – then we got a deal.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   So we were given the deal and the deal that 
we were given Chair, can I take you back to page 1825. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before you go there, first 
show me where the Board approved this request, if you are 
able to. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Mr Barry…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, if it is not here, you can do it after. 
MR KOKO:   It is in the minutes, the minutes are here and 
the minutes are in Bundle 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   18? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 71 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Barry can look for them and 
then later you can tell me.  It is just that it is important 
because I think that it deals with an important issue, 
namely, what you are saying is at least your division and 
yourself you…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Oh, they are here, page 1…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko, hang on, you are saying that 
this reflects that - at least from your side, you were 
prepared that the price be increased, even if not to the 
10 
amount that OCM wanted, but to try and meet them 
halfway. You were prepared to push that line, that is what I 
understand you to be saying. 
MR KOKO:   Most definitely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Where are the minutes I see 
you are excited that you have found them.  
MR KOKO:   Page 18…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It seems to be actually more than one 
that OCM had…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   The point that I – it is more than…[intervene] 
20 
ADV BARRY SC:   It is not half way it is more. 
MR KOKO:   We were giving them more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no when I was saying halfway I did 
not mean exactly, and I was just saying less than what they 
wanted but it goes up nevertheless, less than what OCM 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 72 of 383 
 
wanted. 
MR KOKO:   No, no Chair the Board says give them more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am saying we are not in 
disagreement.  
MR KOKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am saying what you are pointing to 
seems to suggest that at least your attitude or your units 
or divisions attitude was that we should not insist on the 
current price because they are complaining. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We should increase it, even if we do not 
go up to what they want, that is what I am saying. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, where are the minute? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought it was different, Mr Koko.  I 
thought they had proposed R285 but that you were 
prepared to give them R296. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, ja so that is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay so that is different, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you prepared to give them even 
more than what they wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is interesting.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 73 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is what I wanted to correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  I thought at some 
stage, maybe it is a different time.  I thought at some stage 
they went to 500 or something.  
MR KOKO:   No, I am coming to that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are coming to that, okay.  
MR KOKO:   And this is what I called kicking in the face.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright let us go to the 
minutes.  
MR KOKO:   So page 1830. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where I am. 
MR KOKO:   Those are the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is one, eight, three, zero of 
Eskom Bundle 15C.  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR KOKO:   And Chair, the minutes are…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is the Board Tender Committee 
meeting; this is the Board Tender Committee meeting? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the meeting of 12 August 2014, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the minutes are in page 1841. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1841, is that where we will find the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 74 of 383 
 
resolution? 
MR KOKO:   That is where the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where the issue was dealt with. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I apologise 1843. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1843? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, paragraph 7.5: 
“Request for mandate to negotiate and conclude 
coal supply agreements for up to 24 years to ensure 
10 
the security of coal supply to Hendrina Power 
Station.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   And it was facilitated by Mr Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a discussion?  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, the item was tabled for 
approval, the terms which were included in the meeting 
pack.  Alright, continue.  
MR KOKO:   Right, I am going to read the last sentence of 
20 
the first paragraph, and I read it Chair because that is me 
saying - talking in the Board.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   That statement is my statement in October 
2014.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 75 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   And it tells you my statement…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you saying October now, I thought it 
was in August. 
MR KOKO:   In August 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And that tells you my attitude…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes: 
“It was submitted that historically Eskom was taken 
10 
for a ride an adjustment was being done at this 
point.”  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, now I see where you are 
reading: 
“It was submitted, that historically Eskom was taken 
for a ride and the adjustment was being done at this 
point.” 
That is what you say.  
MR KOKO:   That is what I said, that tells you my attitude. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
20 
MR KOKO:   It tells you that my attitude was not an 
overnight attitude but I was accommodating them because 
at this point I was saying but I have a coal agreement.  You 
make millions in the export market.  I did not benefit in 
your up sign.  Now must take the downside of your 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 76 of 383 
 
decisions, I will but I am unhappy but I am drawing the 
line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR KOKO:   “And the Board resolved with the primary 
image  
division is mandated to negotiate with Optimum to 
ensure the security of supply for the Hendrina 
Power Station.” 
And Chair the approval is granted for the primary energy to 
issue an open tender to secure coal supply posts 2018, 
10 
post the end of the coal supply agreement and the most 
important one: 
“The divisional executive PED is authorised here 
with the power to delegate further to take all 
necessary 
steps 
to 
give 
effect 
to 
the 
above 
including the signing of any agreements, concerns 
or 
other 
documentation 
necessary 
or 
related 
herewith.” 
Now Chair, what the Board is saying here, it says if you get 
thee - if you manage to negotiate the price below R296 do 
20 
not come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, go ahead and sign. 
MR KOKO:   Sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Conclude the agreement. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 77 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well the last number one, under 
resolved that at page 1843 says: 
“Primary energy reason is mandated to negotiate 
with Optimum Coal Mine to ensure security of 
supply for the life of Hendrina Power Station.” 
That is one, two: 
“Approval is granted for PED to issue an open 
market inquiry to secure coal supply to Hendrina for 
the period post 2018 taking into consideration the 
following.” 
10 
Now, two, what is two about, is it about getting other 
stakeholders who may assist to ensure that there is coal 
security?  
MR KOKO:   No, Chair two, is about meeting the 
requirements of the National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that in relation to the issue of the 
price? 
MR KOKO:   No, two, says the contract ends in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So when the contract ends in 2018 there is no 
20 
obligation on Eskom to extend the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of course.  
MR KOKO:   So, we have to follow the process in Section 
217 in the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 78 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   They must tender and tender a competitive 
bid for Eskom to engage that and we quite frankly expected 
that they will tender the bid because they next door, they 
have got a conveyer another person will have to be far. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   But we have to go through that process.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and then three, your authorised, 
PED is authorised, you were authorised as Mr Matshela 
Koko because you were the divisional executive, is that 
right, you were the divisional executive?  
10 
MR KOKO:   No, no, Mr Bester was acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay so he is the person who was 
authorised? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay: 
“With the power to delegate further to take all the 
necessary steps to give effect to the above, the 
effect to the above includes one at page 843 
namely, to negotiate with Optimum Coal to ensure 
security supply of supply for the life of Hendrina 
20 
Power 
Station, 
including 
the 
signing 
of 
any 
agreements consents or other documents.” 
So here the Board Tender Committee gave PED complete 
authority to fix this issue about the coal price. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 79 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and the mandate that you were given 
as PED was enough to solve this problem because it went 
even above what OCM was asking for. 
MR KOKO:   Most certainty.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, now I am going to take you to Eskom 
15, Bundle 15A, page 782, we have been to that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, this is important, ja.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, all I am saying to you is once you go 
through the audit trail, there will be more important things. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what bundle must we go to now? 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15A, page 782.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You see the importance of this part and 
this is - by this time, Mr Brian Molefe was there. 
MR KOKO:   No, he was not there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this not 2015? 
MR KOKO:   No this is 2014 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no, no, that is fine.  I thought 
it was August 2015. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but we will come to the role of Mr Molefe 
20 
Chair, because I think he is the poor old man he's just 
been done hard.  
CHAIRPERSON:   He is not that old. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, his going to be angry with me, he is 
going to be angry with me.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 80 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 15, bundle what? 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15A…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 15, I think I have got B here.  Do 
we not have 15A?  
MR KOKO:   Bundle - I am looking for MK15.  
CHAIRPERSON:   She says 15A stops at 500.  I think she 
understands that you have given a page number that goes 
beyond that. 
MR KOKO:   I am looking for, I said Bundle 15. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Yes, it is correct the page number the 
10 
right number 15, 782. 
MR KOKO:   782. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, she says…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15, 782. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, do we have such a bundle?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me check 15D, Chair.  
ADV BARRY SC:   The document starts at page 780.  
CHAIRPERSON:   My registrar thinks it will be in B, but it 
should not be in B if you have it in A. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair let us let us go with her. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But yours - all of us should have the 
same thing, what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, 782 is in 15D.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think the transcript then we will 
have to go with my pagination, 782 is a submission 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 81 of 383 
 
document.  Is it 782, is that the page that – no that starts 
at page 780, we have looked at that submission. 
MR KOKO:   Okay, so let us go to 780, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Let us go to 780. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am there. 
MR KOKO:   780, is the result of the negotiations with the 
team of Mr Bester.  They are now coming back to the Board 
and they are saying to the Board Tender Committee on the 
12 t h of August 2014 you have given us a mandate to go and 
10 
renegotiate the hardship notice of Optimum.  We have done 
that and we did not succeed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   How could they not succeed?  
MR KOKO:   That is my point, Chair you see, you are going 
to see – you are going to get to that point, now.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they were given such a wide 
mandate. 
MR KOKO:   You see, once we get through the documents 
we going to show that attitude.  So let us read the 
Resolution 2.1. Resolution 2.1 says: 
20 
“Primary energy division is mandated to conclude 
negotiations with Optimum mine to ensure security 
of supply for Hendrina Power Stations at R442 per 
ton for CV 23.5 dry basins from 1 April 2015 to 31 
December 2018, to include this new coal supply 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 82 of 383 
 
agreement 
the 
following 
value 
rights 
to 
be 
exercised by 31 December 2015.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they are asking the Board Tender 
Committee for a higher mandate. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Close maybe, close to double the 
mandates. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh no, not really.   
MR KOKO:   No, I will take you to the cost implications. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, but where do we find them 
saying what the problem was with reaching agreement with 
OCM on the mandate that they have been given?  
MR KOKO:   Chair, the best you can get, and I happen to 
know what the issues are, but the best you can get is to go 
to page 782.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Page 782 says – no I leave this – there is a 
page where they - yes, please go to 787, page 787, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, we have dealt with these documents 
and the bundles and the attachments, so this is an 
attachment, we have had this discussion before.  So page 
787, number two says: 
“Approved 
mandate 
parameters 
and 
negotiation 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 83 of 383 
 
results.” 
So you will see that R296 on the left-hand side, approved 
mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am looking for it on this page, oh ja I 
see it, yes, mandate ja.  
MR KOKO:   That is the number you saw on the 12 t h of 
August 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   And look at the results. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Results achieved. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   442? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   How was it possible?  
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair.  Now remember, when we 
asked for a mandate we already had a proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, which was one…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   285. 
CHAIRPERSON:   280 something. 
MR KOKO:   285. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you were give the mandate of 
296.  
MR KOKO:   We give them the mandate of 296.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 84 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they said, you reach the agreement, 
you do not have to come back.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So what happened, where is the 
explanation of what happened?  
MR KOKO:   So Chair, when I was on suspension here and 
when I came back, I was met with the hostility and the 
arrogance of Glencore, who are you, Mr Koko?  
We are told Eskom has agreed you will always hear 
the 
Ms 
Thuli 
Madonsela 
made 
this 
document, 
this 
10 
document that says Eskom had agreed until Brian Molefe 
came.  So Chair, you can now go to Bundle 15C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before you do that, when PED went 
to the Board Tender Committee and said we know that 
contractually we are right and we can refuse to increase 
the price. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, that was me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but we think it is not going to help us 
to adopt that attitude.  We are asking the Board Tender 
Committee to give us a mandate to negotiate an increase. 
20 
You – OCM had put a proposal already. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All that needed – and that proposal was 
within 
the 
mandate 
that 
was 
given 
by 
the 
Tender 
Committee. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 85 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   All that needed to be done is just to 
accept that proposal.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, now you are talking my language. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no need to negotiate because 
it was less than what the Board was prepared to pay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, now you understand why I think Thuli 
Madonsela owes us the apology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but if you can take me to where the 
explanation is…[intervene] 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is all what you have in that bundle, 
that is all what you have.  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no explanation? 
MR KOKO:   No, there is no explanation, all what they - all 
what they – the best that I can tell - is that the – I am an 
engineer so I tried to understand what they tried to do.  So 
they call it the – at the face of it they tried to buy coal of 
the higher energy content for Hendrina.  But that was still 
not the mandate of board.  Just to – it does not matter what 
you think. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see it is – it is a very interesting – 
it is a very strange thing. 
MR KOKO:  Chair it is not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You … 
MR KOKO:  It is not strange. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 86 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You –  
MR KOKO:  The facts speak for itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, look at it this way.  In the context of 
for example a trade union.  A trade union says we want you 
to increase our salaries or the salaries of our employees by 
10% and then a division of the employer of the company 
goes to the board or whatever to say we want to resolve 
this issue.  The board says go back you can negotiate even 
if it is more than 10% up to 20% but do not come back to us 
settle it if it is within that mandate.  All that the employer 
10 
delegation or negotiation team has when they come back is 
to say we accept your proposal of 10%.  And then the whole 
thing is done. How does it go up like that now? 
MR KOKO:  Chair my family – my kids including my cat had 
been through a lifestyle audit.  I am challenging you to get 
the people involved in legal negotiations to do the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja continue. 
MR KOKO:  That is the best I can say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  Chair and on the – on page – on that same 
20 
page please go to page 50 – to page 796.  Chair I meant it 
when I say my family and my cat went through the lifestyle 
audit and I challenge the people that was involved in legal 
00:02:14 to do the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 796? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 87 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  796 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR KOKO:  I am going to read you the impact  
”Furthermore the” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us talk first about what document that 
is.   
MR KOKO:  It is the same document we just looked at 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is the last page of the same 
document. 
10 
MR KOKO:  It is the same – it is the last document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is signed by Mr Johan Bester, General 
Manager Fuel Sourcing Primary Energy Division and Mr 
Vusi Mboweni Divisional Executive Primary Energy Division 
as well as Mr Edwin Mabelane Group Executive Acting 
Group Technology and Commercial.  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  So it says in the middle of the page  
“Furthermore they delivered cost of this 
alternative source when in all likelihood be 
higher than the price from Optimum – okay – 
20 
as the mine delivers via 00:03:12 the Eskom 
assessment of the Optimum proposed costs 
indicate that if agreed to will cost Eskom 5.5 
billion at 5.5 billion ton per ton for the 
remainder 
of 
the 
current 
cost 
supply 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 88 of 383 
 
agreement.” 
So the team is saying this proposal to increase the price 
will cost Eskom R5.5 billion extra. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which proposal is it?  Is it the 449? 
MR KOKO:  The 442. 
CHAIRPERSON:  442 from OCM. 
MR KOKO:  From OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja which is a new proposal. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the mandate was given. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be… 
MR KOKO:  Chair when I was here I made to read the 
minutes of February 26 2015 deliberately because in those 
minutes the FD says we are not going to get a equity 
injection.  We are not able to be able to borrow.  The best 
we can do is to go for the MYPD3 reopener which we did 
and was declined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So you cannot get money from the tariff – from 
20 
the regulator.  You cannot borrow more money.  You cannot 
get a equity injection. Where are you going to get a R5.5. 
billion?  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what – was this known to the team 
that was.. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 89 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  They have written it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean the points that you have just made 
were they alive to them?  Were they aware of them? 
MR KOKO:  Of course they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were aware of them. 
MR KOKO:  Of course they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  They just think that the associates of Mr 
Ramaphosa are entitled to bully Eskom to extract R5.5 
billion out of Eskom and nobody says anything about it and 
10 
Mr – Ms Thuli Madonsela misses it.  Chair how is it possible 
that Ms Thuli Madonsela needs this work that this proposal 
will cost Eskom R5.5 billion that Eskom does not have and 
the 
association 
– 
the 
associates 
of 
the 
President 
Ramaphosa are entitled to it.  How is that possible? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well all I am saying Mr Koko is that the 
Public Protector did not have as much time as this 
commission has had to look at these issues and you – you 
are raising some of the – some of the aspects you are 
raising have not been raised by any of the Eskom witnesses 
20 
before.  So – and of course as I understand it she did not 
have the – your input. 
MR KOKO:  And she had exactly – why would she not have 
my input when she passes a judgment that is against me?  
The rules of fairness expect of her to say you are educated I 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 90 of 383 
 
am going to make a finding that is addressed to you what is 
your comment?  Chair – Chair let us go to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair may I ask.. 
MR KOKO:  Now enter Mr Molefe Chair.  Now enter Mr 
Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  May I ask Mr Koko whether the 
allegations made against specific individuals are contained 
in any of his affidavits? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is thinking.   
MR KOKO:  Chair my main affidavit deals with this.  I go to 
town about how I was treated.  I am not sure which … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she is… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no I am asking a different question 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I know the issues he has done some – 
some addressing of them in his affidavit.  I am asking 
whether to the extent that he 00:05:56 has he dealt with that 
20 
in any of his affidavits? 
MR KOKO:  Who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To the extent that you blame certain 
individuals have you – have you dealt with that in any of our 
affidavits? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 91 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think he has complained in – I do 
not know in the affidavit but previously he has complained 
that the Public Protector did not speak – did not give him an 
opportunity.  Am I right Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair not the Public Protector.  I am 
talking – sorry Chair I am talking the people at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay well you see you – the last people 
he mentioned was Mr Ramaphosa and the Public Protector. 
So when you said people … 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you were talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those.  Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I would include the President in this 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja the President ja. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I did not include them but I have opened a 
criminal case.  I have said before and not only did I open a 
criminal case but I also went to the Public Protector. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also you have not – in terms of the 
people if I understand Mr Seleka correctly to the extent that 
he is referring to the people that you said were supposed to 
enforce penalties you have not mentioned those people by 
name as far as I understand. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 92 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  No I have not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I have not here but in my case with the police 
and the Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh obviously. 
MR KOKO:  I have done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.   
MR KOKO:  Chair now enter Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you want to deal with the situation. So 
is what you are saying this that before – in 2014 you had 
10 
adopted an approach with regard to OCM’s proposal or 
demand or request for an increase that sought to try and 
dissolve that issue – you got the board tender committee to 
approve your approach and to give your division a wide 
mandate to increase the price actually even above if 
necessary what at that time was OCM’s proposal. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that instead of the team that 
was negotiating with OCM reaching agreement with OCM on 
their own proposal – on OCM’s proposal at that time or even 
20 
if it was more than their proposal but within the mandate that 
was given to them they came back to the board with a 
proposal from OCM that was 442. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but now you are going to the stage 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 93 of 383 
 
where Mr Brian Molefe enters the stage? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:  But before then there was a board meeting of 
the 15t h of April 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I do not want to take you to the documents I am 
going to waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  But the board of the BTC and the board had no 
10 
authority to approve this proposal.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The 442 proposal. 
MR KOKO:  The 442. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because there was no money. 
MR KOKO:  Because there was no money.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It was like – it would have broken the PFMA 
rules. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Now I have had a lot of merry-go-round why the 
20 
board did not do this – why – it is simple. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  The board cannot approve an unfunded 
expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that was the position. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 94 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  It was the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the mandate that the board tender 
committee had given your division was fine. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was within – was  
MR KOKO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was fine – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR KOKO:  But the 442 was unfunded and the board – BTC 
and the board could not approve an unfunded decision.  I do 
10 
not know why Mr Molefe went up and down and not tell you 
that.  I do not know why Dr Ngubane did not tell you exactly 
that. This mandate is unfunded.  The board cannot approve 
an unfunded proposal – Klaar.  It had to send it back to the 
executive.  There is one executive in Eskom.  There is 
00:11:36 there are not two bulls in one kraal and the 
executive of that – the only bull in the kraal at the time was 
Mr Molefe.  So he had to go and deal with it.  But Chair I 
have asked you to go to page 1864. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again. 
20 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Chair before that  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  In relation to the evidence leaders 
question whether these matters have been dealt with in prior 
affidavits.  In fact they have in quite some detail in the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 95 of 383 
 
supplementary affidavit of Mr Koko which is in Bundle 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was not talking about details he 
was talking about the names of people. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Yes but the names are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The names are there. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  The only fact that was not available at 
that time that the affidavit was deposed to but the allegation 
was still Mr Koko in these documents said that this Maharaj 
did not have authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV BARRIE SC:  But if you have regard to Bundle 15 it 
starts at page 1168 and from paragraph 118 and it extends 
through to paragraph 147. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  So this is not new before the commission.  
It has been before the commission for a substantial period of 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Since December. 
MR KOKO:  Chair it is correct that Mr Molefe was new to 
20 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  It is correct that Mr Molefe was not familiar with 
the operational detail of Eskom.  At best we could say Mr 
Molefe is familiar with the PFMA because he has worked for 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 96 of 383 
 
state owned companies and he was at National Treasury.  So 
at best we can say he knew that you cannot take expenditure 
if you cannot fund.  So – but the decision to cancel the 
cooperation agreement I do not think he was clued up 
enough to make that decision.  He was not.  I mean I have 
also listened to the narrative here but I am also disappointed 
with Mr Molefe for not dealing properly with this because he 
could – I blame myself for that because a lot of what Mr 
Molefe did Chair was because of me persuading him to do it 
and one of the regrets I have is that Mr Molefe should just 
10 
tell you that you know what talk to Mr Koko.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And Mr Singh should do the same.  Mr Singh 
should say you know what talk to Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR KOKO:  He is the decision maker.  He has been to the 
extent that we made these decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  He persuaded us to do that and we may have 
not understood him.  And all what I wanted to know when you 
20 
sit alone and make this decision is that on the Tegeta 
transactions all of them without fail I am the man. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Not other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 97 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  So Chair if I am taking you to page 907 – 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take – I take that to mean you take 
responsibility for all the decisions. 
MR KOKO:  Of course – quite – to the extent that I was in 
the office.  Remember there was a .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  There was a time I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not there. 
MR KOKO:  In the office but I can tell you now the one – the 
R1.6 pre-payment the R595 pre-payment, the penalties 
10 
looked no further.  Look at me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  None – Bundle 15(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is c for you but we said b for us is it 
not? 
MR KOKO:  No, no this time it is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we back – are we back to c? 
MR KOKO:  Yes please back to c.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you finish whatever point you wanted 
to make on that last page of that document by Bester, 
20 
Mboweni and (talking over one another) 
MR KOKO:  Yes Chair the point I wanted to make to you is 
the Optimum proposal at 442 was going to cost Eskom R5.5 
billion 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 98 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  And we could not fund it from the Equity 
injection, we could not fund it from the debt and we could not 
fund it from the Regulators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was out of the question. 
MR KOKO:  So it was out of the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  So it is not the reasons of state capture that 
00:15:28 did not approve it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  it just – there was no money. 
MR KOKO:   There was just no money. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It is as simple as that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15(c) what page? 
MR KOKO:  Page 1864. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18? 
MR KOKO:  64 
CHAIRPERSON:  64.   
MR KOKO:  Chair there are two important advisory we 
20 
received from CDH. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  One is dated 17 March 2015 I was on 
suspension by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before that let us identify what 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 99 of 383 
 
document this is that you are referring me to? 
MR KOKO:  This is a document Mr Seleka’s has referred to 
we start – this is where we started it is an affidavit of  
Rishaban Moodley of CDH. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  1864 I am there. 
MR KOKO:  Chair there are two important… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what – what time frame are we at – 
that – okay this was deposed to in 2020 but the time frame 
we are looking at is 2015? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  Chair there were two – there are two important 
legal advices we got from Eskom.  One is date 17 March we 
will look at it now and the second one is dated 3 March both 
in 2015. 
 
They are no different to the legal opinions provided 
by CDH in 2013 and 2014.  So CDH has not given a different 
legal advises all along.  It has been consistent all along.  So 
I am going to take you to paragraph… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has the question been the same? 
20 
MR KOKO:  The question has been the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  The question has been the same.  Chair please 
go to paragraph 45 on the same page.  I am going to try to 
read it Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 100 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It is quite – it is very important that I read it 
because it deals with the issues Mr Seleka has been very 
passionate about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  45.? 
MR KOKO:  5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  5 okay. 
MR KOKO:   
“Prior to the lapsing of the cooperation 
agreement 
CDH 
provided 
updated 
legal 
10 
advice on the penalty claim and related risks 
on 17 March 2015 to Ayanda Nteta, Andrea 
Williams, 
Pam 
Pillay 
and 
other 
Eskom 
officials.  We provide verbatim quotations 
from a portion thereof for context.  We 
understand that the period for which the 
penalties specifically for sizing has not been 
imposed it is from 20 it is from March 2012.  
In order to protect Eskom’s accrued rights we 
propose that the following be done. 
20 
Eskom and Optimum immediately and prior to 
1 April 2015 agree that the running of 
prescription 
in 
respect 
of 
any 
payment 
reduction or penalty due to Eskom be stayed 
until such time a commercial resolution is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 101 of 383 
 
reached. 
 
Alternatively 
Eskom 
institute 
arbitration and/or action proceedings against 
Optimum for the sole purpose of staying 
running of prescriptions in respect of the 
potential claim it may have.  The risk aspects 
to take note of an arbitration process only 
interrupts prescription for a year from the 
referral of proceedings.  The CS” 
And this is a very important part Chair. 
“The CSA provides that all disputes between 
10 
parties 
must 
be 
resolved 
by 
means 
of 
arbitration.  Should summons be issued the 
claim could be jeopardised as Optimum could 
raise a 00:19:22 that the court does not have 
to jurisdiction to entertain such disputes.  
Should no agreement be reached relating to 
the staying of prescription or should Eskom 
not 
institute 
proceedings 
to 
stay 
prescriptions 
every 
month 
which 
lapses 
means it forfeits losing approximately R50 
20 
million on average. This potential would have 
a PFMA implication for Eskom.  It should 
however be noted that the enforcement of 
Eskom 
accrued 
rights 
by 
actions 
or 
arbitration is subject to the following.  The 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 102 of 383 
 
tification  [?] of Clause 3.6 of the First 
Addendum 
as 
Eskom 
and 
Optimum 
is 
opposing interpretation relating the manner 
in 
which 
payment 
reduction 
should 
be 
calculated. 
6.2 Eskom compliance with all contractual 
requirements 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
CSA 
and 
addenda Clause 9.6 and – of the CSA and 
3.43 of the Second Addendum to inform 
Optimum on a monthly basis of its failure to 
10 
comply 
with 
the 
quality 
specification 
including such calculations of the penalty to 
be 
deducted 
from 
month 
invoice. 
 
The 
prescription of such proportion of the claim 
not stayed the prescription of such portions 
of the claim not stayed in time.” 
Chair it speaks for itself.  This is the advice from the 
Optimum says we have got issue of prescription and if 
Eskom does not institute proceedings arbitration Eskom 
stands – intends to lose R50 million a month.  Tell me which 
20 
executive Chair will sit and fold his hands? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Put that point. 
MR KOKO:  CDH says that penalties that have not been 
claimed since 2012 March and they will prescribe unless 
Eskom acts. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 103 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  And either institute summons or arbitration.  And 
if it does not do that Eskom will forfeit R50 million a month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh the point you are making is once 
there was this advice. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Action had to be taken. 
MR KOKO:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. To institute – to pursue the claim for 
penalties. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what that is the point you making. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are saying it was not because of 
anything else. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was because this is what the advice 
said. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  And this is dated 17 March 2015. Brian 
Molefe was still at Transnet. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and he comes … 
MR KOKO:  He comes into this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For around 20t h or 17t h April. 
MR KOKO:  He comes in 20t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He comes when it – when this advice has 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 104 of 383 
 
already been given. 
MR KOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Chair do not forget the advice of Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  They refer to 9.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  It says but you will have a difficulty in this claim 
because of 9.6 clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:  You see how they are misleading – how 
misleading it is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but 9.6 says what? 
MR KOKO:  9.6 says and they – the bottom of the page 
Chair  Please check – page 86 they have written it.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It says: 
“Eskom must notify Optimum in writing within 
15 days after each days.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry.  You are reading 
20 
from where now?  1866? 
MR KOKO:  The foot note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  oh at the footnote. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 105 of 383 
 
“Eskom must notify Optimum in writing within 
15 days after each day’s delivery whether all 
coal supplied and driven Optimum to Eskom 
complied 
– 
comprised 
with 
the 
quality 
specifications.” 
So at this stage the settlement agreement that you talked to 
me about two days ago had it happened? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which – which dispensed. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your understanding. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It dispensed with this need. 
MR KOKO:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So you are saying that at this stage 
this was wrong. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no need for this. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the settlement agreement had 
20 
superseded this. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it said the spreadsheet that is – that 
was – that would be exchanged every day would be enough.  
There would be – it would constitute compliance. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 106 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
MR KOKO:  Chair I am taking you to 15 – page 911.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 911 of the same bundle. 
MR KOKO:  Of the same bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the same bundle is 15(c). 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eskom Bundle 15(c).  Page 9? 
MR KOKO:  Now we are in 3 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 9? 
10 
MR KOKO:  9 – no, no page 1861 I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1861. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  Paragraph – paragraph 45.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes start by identifying the document 
before you read. 
MR KOKO:  It is the same affidavit of Mr – of Mr Rishaban 
Moodley of CDH. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  And now we are in June Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is June 2014 – 2015? 
20 
MR KOKO:  June 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Mr Brian Molefe’s at Eskom by this 
time. 
MR KOKO:  Mr Brian Molefe is as Eskom 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 107 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  But then – let me start at 45 – paragraph 45.7 it 
says: 
“The duration.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Where I am 
there is no paragraph 45.  You said we should got to 1861 is 
it not? 
MR KOKO:  No I apologise 1868. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1868.  Yes you want to start at 45.? 
MR KOKO:  7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
10 
MR KOKO:   
“The duration of the cooperation agreement 
was extended for a period until sometime 
May/June 25.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MR KOKO:  2015.   
“In 
extending 
the 
negotiations 
OCM 
considered to stay the – to the staying of 
prescription in March 2015.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   
“Despite the extension of the period – of the 
period the attempt to conclude a new coal 
supply agreement under the 00:26:25 was 
not” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 108 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Proceeded with. 
MR KOKO:  
“Proceeded with.” 
And 
the 
conclusion 
remember 
Chair 
there 
was 
no 
negotiations.  We won 442.  R442 per ton.  We would only 
conclude this at R422 per ton.  And Eskom could not do 
R442 per ton.  That is the only reason why the coop – the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No agreement could – was reached. 
MR KOKO:  The agree – could not be reached.  It was not 
because of reasons of state capture, Mr Molefe at Eskom.  
10 
Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no funding for (inaudible). 
MR KOKO:  There was no funding for it.  The rest – the rest 
is noise, hearsay and politics of the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
MR KOKO:  And then on 3 June 2015  
“CDH furnished Eskom with a memorandum 
of advice and enclosed a draft termination 
notice to be sent to Optimum.  In essence 
CDH advised that Eskom should immediately 
20 
proceed with the institution of the arbitration 
proceedings in respect of Eskom’s [?] rights. 
In light of prescription recommencing and 
Eskom people may obligation.  In addition 
CDH advised Eskom to prepare for any 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 109 of 383 
 
potential business rescue proceedings and 
short supply of stoppage of coal supply by 
Optimum.  Pursuant to the aforesaid Eskom 
terminated the settlement process on 22 
June 2015.  In light of settlement process 
being terminated Optimum reinstatement that 
should proceedings.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean the – I mean the settlement 
process there are they talking about the negotiations or 
what? 
10 
MR KOKO:  They are talking about the negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja terminated the negotiations yes. 
MR KOKO:  Ja.  Chair now let me take you to 45.13 
“The instructions to proceed with a letter of 
demand and the arbitration was based on the 
advice provided in order to preserve Eskom’s 
rights and again the backdrop that it was 
understood by Eskom that there remained 
several issues of concern which would need 
to be addressed and resolved during the 
20 
00:28:37 arbitration.” 
Chair this in my point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Mr Molefe did not know – was not familiar.  He 
could not have known this.  He had to be advised.  And he 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 110 of 383 
 
was advised.  And I am not going take you to the letter that 
advised him because he it was formal letter that went to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From CDH. 
MR KOKO:  No from CDH to Eskom executives and from 
Eskom executives to Brian [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR KOKO:  It says. 
“Based on” 
Maybe we should go there.  Maybe we should go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go there. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Chair it is MMK15.   
ADV BARRIE SC:  Chair that should be in Bundle 15(a) at 
page 204. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  204? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  As you please.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a summary record of discussion 
as to MMK-15.  Ja, that is Bundle 15(a), page 204.  But 
that is ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is 24 November ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR KOKO:   No.  Mr Barrie, MK-12? 
ADV BARRIE:   [No audible reply] 
MR KOKO:   MK-12. 
ADV BARRIE:   That is on page 194. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am there.  Page 194. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 111 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, 114(sic). 
CHAIRPERSON:   194. 
MR KOKO:   194. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  That is a memo from A Mabelane, 
Inspector Group Executive, Commercial and Technology to 
Mr Brian Molefe, 
acting 
Chief 
Executive 
and 
Mr 
Vusi 
Mboweni is... Senior General Manger of Primary Energy 
Division and it is dated 8 July 2015.  The subject is Letter 
of Demand for Optimum Coal Mine and Optimum Coal 
Holdings.  And in paragraph 1 it says in terms of purposes, 
10 
says: 
“The aim of this memorandum is to notify the 
Chief Executive of the Letter of Demand which 
will be send to Optimum Coal Holdings in 
respect of the claim for penalties incurred...” 
 
Yes, continue then, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you heard evidence from Ms Daniels 
that Mr Moodley and Mr Silanko briefed me and Mr Molefe 
about the prospects of the penalties and will get(?) it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Now, this letter is signed by Mr Silanko.  So 
he could not have told us that we are going to lose... 
[speaker no clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   So, once again, the testimony of Ms Daniels 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 112 of 383 
 
must just be taken for what it is.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I just want ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Silanko was the head ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Was ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of legal. 
MR KOKO:   He was... council. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   And you see who compiled it.  Mr Bester.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Bester compiled it.  It was supported 
by 
Mr 
Neo 
Silanko, 
General 
Manager 
of 
Legal 
and 
supported by Vusi Mboweni, Senior General Manager of 
Primary 
Energy 
Division 
and 
approved 
by 
Mr 
Edwin 
Mabelane, acting Group Executive, Technology and Group 
Commercial.  That is on 10 July 2015.  As well as by 
Mr Brian Molefe on the 15 t h of July 2015.  
MR KOKO:   Chair, what is interesting and I just – again, 
this is - I feel pity for Mr Molefe.  That signature is not his. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is his PP. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  He was not ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
I 
assumed 
that 
he 
gave 
authorisation. 
MR KOKO:   He gave – he did.  No, he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 113 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   He did.  So, Chair, if I can read you the 
financial implications.   
“Eskom terminated the settlement discussions 
of – 22 June 2015 again on the advice of CBH 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Which I agree with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   “In terms of reaching an undertaking between  
parties which by virtue of termination of the 
10 
settlement 
discussion 
prescriptions 
recommends.  In this instance, prescription 
recommends on 23 June 2015 in respect of 
any 
potential 
claim 
Eskom 
has 
against 
Optimum in respect of payment reduction, the 
recommendation)sic) 
of 
prescription 
from 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The commencement. 
MR KOKO:   “The recommencements of prescription from  
23 June 2015. 
 
That 
means, 
Eskom 
must 
20 
immediately proceed with steps to preserve 
Eskom a crude(?) rights.  Prescription would 
only stop – upon a matter being referred to 
arbitration.  Hence the compressed time period 
of – thus referral contained in the attached 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 114 of 383 
 
letter of demand...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And remember, the last letter of demand was 
drafted by ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but before.  I am just moving back 
...[indistinct] 
MR KOKO:   [coughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Eskom Holdings and Optimum, OCM 
and OCH.  Do they not refer to as...  Okay.  Are party to a 
coal agreement with addenda – agrees – supply and deliver 
10 
of coal to Eskom.  Okay.  A number of...  This was 
unsuccessful and during 22 June 2015, Eskom issued a 
letter terminating this negotiation process.  [Speaker not 
clear]  Okay.  No, that is fine.  So you have read paragraph 
6. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  Chair, what then transpired is what is 
now popular.  Then we have got business – then the 
business goes into – the company goes into business 
rescue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, now the Cooperation Agreement has 
20 
been terminated? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   CDH has advised that steps should be 
taken to claim the penalties? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 115 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Alright, continue. 
MR KOKO:   And then there is a letter of demand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And on the – with the R 2.15 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   And Chair, I have already told you that this 
R 2.15 million...  [Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   They are documented in a spreadsheet that 
was relied on by mister... back to the R 2.15 [coughing – 
10 
unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, well, for the sake of completeness.  
Should you not refer to the letter, CDH letter and one – 
page 196 that seems to be the letter of demand? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair.  I have put my file away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no you do not have to but I just want 
to say.  I think what I see at page 196 is a letter of demand 
by CDH to Optimum Coal and the heading is:   
“Demand for repayment in respect of coal 
which 
failed 
to 
comply 
with 
quality 
20 
specification of the CSA during the period 1 
March 2012 to 31 May 2015...” 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, in the same letter, I think it is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 116 of 383 
 
paragraph 6, it says to Optimum consider this as if you are 
unhappy.  Consider this to go to arbitration.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it may be paragraph 5: 
“Further, in the event that Optimum disputes 
the claim, an amount of – must provide us with 
the names of its preferred arbitrators within 
five business days of the noting of the dispute. 
Should you fail to reach agreement on a 
particular 
arbitrator 
within 
seven 
business 
days from the date of exchange of the names, 
10 
arbitration’s request shall be made to the 
President of the Law Society to nominate an 
arbitrator...” 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Chair ...[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE:   Chair, I note that there is a page missing, 
actually, in this letter.  The second page is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, I see it is page 183. 
ADV BARRIE:   I believe this letter is available elsewhere 
but we will look into it and ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
20 
ADV BARRIE:   ...that particular ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   So Chair ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
...procedurally, 
Eskom’s 
framework 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 117 of 383 
 
governance wise, we cannot be faltered at that – until at 
that stage.  So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The point you [coughing – unclear] 
seeking to make for some time by reference to this 
documents is to say the institution in pursuit of the claims 
against OCM was based on, among other things, legal 
advice. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also it was.  We have reached that 
point of not agreeing a price increase because OCM 
10 
insisted on the price of 442. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And had they not insisted on that price, 
we could have accommodated them because we have 
obtained the mandate from the BTC which actually went 
beyond the proposal they had made at that time. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the most unfortunate part.  Then came 
August 20 letter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  And where do we find that? 
MR KOKO:   The August 20 letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is it – have you got it? 
MR KOKO:   I have it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 118 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   ...not having because this is a letter 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what date is it? 
MR KOKO:   It is... 
ADV BARRIE:   Is that the letter dated 20 August 2015? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, sir. 
ADV BARRIE:   Yes, that is in Bundle 15(c) at page 1904. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this is the letter that – relationship.  
You asked me yesterday what – when I said, when did you 
– the relationship was broken and you said when?  I said 
10 
20 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That page number, I do not 
have it on page ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   1904, bundle ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 1904? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought it was 904.  Right, this letter, 
yes.  Yes, I am there, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   So this is a letter from Werksmans Attorneys 
representing the Business Rescue Practitioners. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And what is the date of that letter? 
MR KOKO:   20 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And you will see it is for the attention Chief 
Officer, Generation. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 119 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this a response to the letter? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not.  To the demand, okay.  Ja? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this was pursuant to the meeting I had 
with them on the 17 t h of August 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Business Rescue Practitioners? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MR KOKO:   And this is a letter terminating – suspending 
the coal supply... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   I am going to read paragraph 4. 
“You will, further, be aware from the notices in 
respect of Business Rescue proceedings, the 
hardship claimed initiated by Optimum in 2013 
and your expensive engagement with OCM 
pursuant 
to 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
conducted 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
Cooperation 
Agreement between Eskom and OCM dated 
23 May 2014. 
20 
That 
the 
principle 
reasons 
for 
the 
recommencement of OCM’s Business Rescue 
proceedings is the financial distress in terms 
of the CSA has placed and continue to place 
on OCM. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 120 of 383 
 
The financial position of OCM was clearly 
communicated 
to 
Eskom 
on 
numerous 
occasions prior to the commencement of OCM 
Business Rescue proceedings in both written 
correspondence 
and 
formal 
meetings 
held 
between representative of OCM and Eskom. 
This financial position has been exacerbated 
by Eskom’s recent claim for historical claim 
and future penalties which if upheld with 
effectiveness(?) resulting in OCM supply coal 
10 
to Eskom at... [Speaker unclear] 
 
Chair, I want to take you to paragraph 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
“Notwithstanding the aforesaid – are amenable 
to supply coal to Eskom during the Business 
Rescue 
proceedings 
on 
terms 
which 
are 
sustainable for OCM. 
Accordingly, OCM hereby offers to supply coal 
to Eskom to the terms set out in the agreement 
20 
– this letter – interim agreement, which the – 
agreement 
is 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
negotiated 
between 
OCM 
and 
Eskom 
Negotiating 
Team 
 
- 
to 
the 
Cooperation 
Agreement. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 121 of 383 
 
The price included in the interim agreement 
represented 
the 
average 
cash 
cost 
of 
production of OCM. 
The cost in the interim agreement are not 
materially different from the cost provided to 
Eskom as part of the Cooperation Agreement 
process and have only been adjusted to make 
account – to take account of the different time 
period during which the coal is to be supplied. 
We record that pursuant to the Cooperation 
10 
Agreement, 
Nedbank 
and 
Business 
Point 
Capital were appointed by Eskom to review the 
OCM cost in detail and they confirmed that 
OCM cost were agreed reflection of cost of 
money...” 
 
Chair, we will go to the interim agreement but 
what the Business Rescue Practitioners were now – why – 
sent to us, we now are suspending the Cooperation 
Agreement and unless you give us the terms that we 
agreed – we negotiated in Addendum 4, called the...  
20 
[Speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the price under the interim agreement 
that they will ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   You are going to fall off your chair, Chair.  Let 
us go to CPM-8.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 122 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page is that? 
MR KOKO:   No ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it a different bundle? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the- where is the attachment to this 
letter, Mr Barrie. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, CPM-8 is the next page. 
MR KOKO:   No, no I am looking ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we have gotten ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   ..the interim ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...one o’clock but I want to finish your – 
10 
what 
you 
wanted 
to 
deal 
with 
so 
that 
after 
lunch 
...[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE:   What is the date of the letter that you want 
to refer to Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   Chair...  Mr Barrie, PMM-7 has got an 
attachment 
and 
that 
attachment, 
it 
is 
the 
interim 
agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe...  I am just trying to see whether 
we should rather adjourn and then you can look it up 
during the lunch break.   
20 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka, do you have mister ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   ...affidavit because it is in the attachment.  It 
is PMM-8.  If you ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  I – we have the affidavit without 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 123 of 383 
 
the annexures. 
MR KOKO:   But if we take a break, I will find it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Would that be the last 
document you wanted to deal with? 
MR KOKO:   That would be the last document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Because there is ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is fine. 
MR KOKO:   ...it just follows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine. 
10 
MR KOKO:   It just follows.  Then I will ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...then you ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   ...exactly the document without referring to 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   After this, we get – after the agreement, we 
then get a letter which is – which skim’s the cat, that says 
Optimum under Glencore will only supply coal to Hendrina 
until the end of December – ah, to the end of January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Now I heard Mr Seleka saying to you that – 
but there was no crisis.  There was an internal agreement 
in place that lasted until October 2016.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   What Mr Seleka ...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 124 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct] 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR KOKO:   August 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   July. 
MR KOKO:   July 2016.  That we see there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   What Mr Seleka is not telling you that the 
10 
interim agreement in 2016 only existed because of the sale 
agreement of the 10 of December.  The condition precedent 
of the sale agreement of 10 December 2015 was post-
commencement funding, which I will take you to, when I 
answer the questions.  Post-commencement funding by 
Tegeta.  That Tegeta will fund the operations of Optimum 
from January 2016 to July 2016.  That is the only reason 
why coal was guaranteed and it flowed to Hendrina. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us take the lunch 
adjournment.  It is nearly ten past one.  We will resume at 
20 
ten past two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.  Did you find it, 
Mr Koko? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 125 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I did and I thought when you come back 
would have made copies for you but unfortunately there is 
a problem with the back office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   But I am going to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Proceed and read the relevant portion. 
MR KOKO:     And read the relevant portions and then 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is another bundle that we have but 
the bundle is not here. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, his phase one bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   So, Chair, it is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So just indicate again what document it 
is? 
MR KOKO:   It is annexure to Pierce Marsden affidavit and 
it is referenced PMM7 and in the attachment to PMM7 is 
the interim agreement that was proposed by the business 
rescue practitioners on 20 August 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   When they suspended the cooperation 
agreement 
and 
the 
answer 
I 
wanted 
form 
that 
doc 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at that stage the cooperation 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 126 of 383 
 
agreement had not been terminated yet. 
MR KOKO:   It had been terminated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It had been terminated, it is just that you 
said suspended, that is right. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no.  The business practitioners – 
this is what I have come to understand from my legal 
adviser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   That the business rescue practitioners has no 
authority to cancel the course of the agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it gets suspended. 
MR KOKO:   They can suspend and they can approach the 
court to suspend it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what I am saying is, that there 
was 
time 
– 
there 
is 
a 
time 
where 
the 
cooperation 
agreement was terminated, is it not? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I apologise …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are confusing me? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes, the cooperation agreement was 
cancelled. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before this part? 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   This the place went to the cancellation of the 
cooperation agreement. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 127 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
The 
cancellation 
of 
the 
cooperation 
agreement was followed by a letter of demand which 
triggered the board …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The business rescue. 
MR KOKO:   The business rescue proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, ja. 
MR KOKO:   And one of the first things that business 
rescue practitioners did was to send a letter of August – I 
met them on the 17 August. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And they have discussions on the 17 August 
2015, was that followed for money with the letter of August 
20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And the question you then asked – I made you 
read the main letter which says we will not supply you, 
Eskom, with coal at a price that is less than the cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   That is what they said and they said the cost 
20 
had been reviewed by Nedbank and basis point capital.  
That is paragraph 7 of the letter that I have read earlier.  
Attached to that is an interim agreement and the interim 
agreement was for a 30 day period and the price for it, 
Chair, if I can just reference it properly, you will find the – 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 128 of 383 
 
I know you make an issue about clause and sections so I 
am not sure if I can say… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you have got them right you can 
tell me so that I know where to …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   So I would rather say paragraph 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 5 of the interim agreement, the 
price is R22.32 per gigajoule and the CV is 23.  And that 
makes the price that they say is their minimum they can 
supply to Eskom, R513 per ton.  Now, Chair …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That 513? 
MR KOKO:   …13 per ton.  Now, Chair, now you then 
understand the emotions that comes into this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now this is what month in 2015 
now? 
MR KOKO:   This is August …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015. 
MR KOKO:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the 20 t h? 
MR KOKO:   This is the letter that came on the 20 t h. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 20 t h, ja. 
MR KOKO:   This is an attachment to the letter of the 20 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, this is the interim agreement, was an 
attachment to the letter of the 20 August 2015. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 129 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now are you able to remember when it 
was in 2014 when you went to the BTC to obtain that 
mandate that we were talking about.  Which month was 
this? 
MR KOKO:   12 August 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is 12 months later? 
MR KOKO:   12 months later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the price in August 2014 their 
proposal was for …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   285. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   285 per ton. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now 12 months later their proposal 
is 5… 
MR KOKO:   513. 
CHAIRPERSON:   513 per ton minimum. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that, before that, when was it 
20 
when they were seeking 442? 
MR KOKO:   April 2015, 25 April 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So August 2014, 285? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   April 2015 …[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 130 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   No, April 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, April 2014 was 285? 
MR KOKO:   285, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is when you went – you 
approach. 
MR KOKO:   The DC, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The DC, okay.  And then April 2015, 
442? 
MR KOKO:   442. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then a few months later, August, it 
10 
is 513? 
MR KOKO:   513. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, right.  Continue? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, I did not like that, I considered that 
a blackmail because at all material times I was there so 
you can imagine – you cannot imagine, but the discussions 
between me and them was not pleasant and they say so in 
parliament …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now on the 17 August? 
MR KOKO:   On the 17 August. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, when you had an unpleasant 
discussion? 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  And they say so and they are correct 
and, Chair, I must tell you, one of the gentlemen, Mr 
Steen, I did not interact with him, he was not – but the guy 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 131 of 383 
 
that I interacted was Pierce Marsden, ordinarily a very 
pleasant competent guy and when it really gets heated he 
will cool down and say but Mr Koko, you will need to help 
me here, you know, he will …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting was quite heated? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And he will really …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The pressure will go up. 
MR KOKO:   But he will – very decent gentleman, he will 
10 
count up to ten, I think, take a deep breath and then come 
back again and we will never personalise each other and 
he says so in his affidavit that he did not think Mr Koko – 
the debate did go high, the temperature, but he did not 
think I was personal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   So I am glad he says so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Ja,  And he says in his affidavit – and I have 
got a reference, he thought I was taking the best interest 
20 
of Eskom and any other person would have done the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And I respect him for that, our agreement was 
very professional.   Chair, that triggered a letter, an email 
to me on the Saturday.  The first thing I did, Mr Seleka 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 132 of 383 
 
asked, I want to Mr Silanko I said we need a legal opinion 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on now, you say that triggered, 
that being the letter of 20? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the rescue practitioners? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   He triggered from me to approach Mr Silanko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I said, Mr Silanko, I need a legal opinion on 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But just complete your description of 
what your reaction was to this interim, this [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it was a form(?) of betrayal, I felt that 
Optimum was extorting – behaved like extortionists and 
they were not negotiating and I will take you to the letter of 
the 24 t h now.  They are simply saying let us – Mr Koko, we 
are going to interact with you in good faith but the CSA 
20 
must be amended, the price must be 442, the penalties 
must be scrapped.  If you do not entertain that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but that time the price was higher 
now, not 442. 
MR KOKO:   But that time was 513. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 133 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   If you do not do that we will put the business 
in liquidation.  That was their aim.  Give us 513, terminate 
the penalties, give us addendum four and if we do not do 
that, we will liquidate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was addendum 4 different from the 
interim agreement? 
MR KOKO:   Addendum 4 was the product of the 
cooperation agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   It was still in draft form. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it was contemplating what price at 
that stage? 
MR KOKO:   442. 
CHAIRPERSON:   442, oh, okay.  But of course in August, 
from August 20 they were now talking about 513. 
MR KOKO:   513, correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I then wrote a letter on a Saturday after 
briefing counsel to get us a senior opinion’s counsel. (sic)  
20 
And that letter, Chair, you will find it in bundle 18(b) page 
1577. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, we can make copies now, Mr 
Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   18(b) what page? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 134 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   1577. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This would now be the Saturday after the 
20 August.  No, I do not have it in (b) it must be in (c).  I 
do not have that page under bundle 15. 
MR KOKO:   It is bundle 18, Chair, 18(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you said 15. 
MR KOKO:    I am sorry, 18(b) 1577.  Chair, when people 
talk - you know, one of the things I do is it, you know, 
when it comes to these matters, I really sleep with a clear 
conscience having been through this process and one of 
10 
the letters that makes me sleep with a clear conscience is 
what you will find in 1577, my interest at all material times 
was not to act in the interests of any other third parties but 
in the interest of Eskom and that was based on the fact 
that I have been in Eskom for years and I know what the 
contracts say.  Some of them becomes Eskom way of life.  
You do not even know what you have them, you know but 
this is how Eskom works, you know, the Eskom way, we 
call it the Eskom way.  So what you see in 1577 is what I 
knew was in the contract. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you wrote this email to Mr Brian 
Molefe and you copied Mr Neo Silanko. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say: 
“Subject:  Memorandum from Counsel.” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 135 of 383 
 
Eskom write relating to Optimum business rescue.  Do you 
want to read it into the record? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I say: 
“Chief…” 
I normally call Brian Legoa.  So I say: 
“Chief, I gave instructions to the lawyers to make 
applications for a court interdict and to also remove 
the appointed business rescue practitioners for 
10 
Optimum Mine.  I regret to tell you that we are not 
going to court as yet because of the advice 
provided by counsel.  Counsel has provided us with 
legal options available to us.  See the attached 
memorandum.” 
And I go to it. 
“As things stand, our degrees of freedom are very 
limited.  The practitioners have given us a propose 
interim agreement that will increase the coal costs 
from R165 per ton to R513 per ton.  They have 
20 
given us until Monday to accept the terms and 
conditions 
of 
the 
proposed 
interim 
agreement, 
failing 
wish 
they 
will 
cancel 
the 
coal 
supply 
agreement with Eskom.  The idea instead for us to 
acquire the mining rights from Optimum Mine and 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 136 of 383 
 
appoint a contract miner to mine coal on our behalf.  
The lawyers do not believe this is possible.  I will 
call you to discuss our options.” 
Chair, let us go to the memorandum and I will direct you 
specifically 
to 
– 
I 
think 
let 
us 
go 
to 
page 
– 
the 
memorandum …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But even before you go there, your 
attitude based on what you testified two days ago, if I am 
not mistaken, would have been – it is not open to them to 
cancel …[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the agreement between Eskom 
and Optimum Mine in regard to the coal, the CSA, does not 
allow that. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they aggrieved there is a route that is 
provided which would enable a new third party who is 
acceptable to both parties to decide whether they have 
good grounds or not to be aggrieved. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, continue. 
MR KOKO:   And, Chair, I will not take you to the 
cooperation agreement but if Mr Seleka do that, I will show 
you something there that aggrieved me the most. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 137 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   In the cooperation agreement we say Optimum 
has accrued the rights to cancel the contract.  In the 
cooperation agreement.  Where do they derive that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I will not take you there but if you go into 
there you will find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   The parties have accrued right including the 
rights …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To cancel. 
10 
MR KOKO:   To cancel the contract.  There is no such. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your concern there I guess is the 
fact that people on the Eskom side adopted that, have 
agreed to that approach. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue, the memorandum 
is there, page 1578. 
MR KOKO:   And that is a legal opinion from a senior 
20 
counsel, if I can – it is Mr Seleka’s colleague.  If I can… 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it not him, hey? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no.  I know – I have got used to 
the lawyers calling each other colleagues, lawyers… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 138 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   If it is not the right thing I will not use it.  
Chair, if you go to page 1599. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  1599? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:   You will see the names of the counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The counsel, ja. 
MR KOKO:   I cannot pronounce that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think it must be Luderitz SC. 
MR KOKO:   It is a difficult name for me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You are on paragraph 7.1, starting 
from there? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, I want to read paragraph 6.1, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   In paragraph 6.1 deals with the acquisition of 
the mining rights. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR KOKO:   “The CSA affords Eskom the right to acquire   
the mining venture for CM on terms regulated by the 
coal supply agreement.  The coal supply agreement  
20 
has however been suspended and so too Eskom’s 
contractual rights to acquire the mine.  In the event 
of the cancellation of the coal supply agreement 
Eskom will have no enforceable contractual right to 
acquire the mine.” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 139 of 383 
 
Now – and, Chair, this is my proposition to you, that the 
only reason – and Ivan Glasenberg in paragraph 31 of his 
contract 
directed 
that 
they 
go 
for 
business 
rescue 
practitioners because he says he understood it that they 
are able to suspend and cancel the contract, the coal 
supply agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that? 
MR KOKO:   The only reason in Mr Ivan Glasenberg’s 
affidavit that he says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why they went for… 
10 
MR KOKO:   Why they went for business rescue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   He says he understood that they can – they 
have the right to suspend and cancel the CSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The CSA, okay. 
MR KOKO:   That is what he says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And the only reason I think he did that is 
because he knew that we would step in to exercise our 
right in terms of the coal supply agreement to take over the 
20 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But once he suspended we cannot and that is 
why I say in my email to Mr Molefe …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We cannot. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 140 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   We cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Based on the advice given by counsel.  I am 
not one of those executives who do not take advice.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I said let us go to court but once I got 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Legal advice. 
MR KOKO:   Legal advice I realise rushing to court… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Well, on the face of it it makes 
10 
sense. 
 
If 
entering 
business 
rescue 
suspends 
such 
agreements it makes sense to say well, you cannot 
thereafter and while the suspension is in place, purport to 
exercise rights that are in the agreement because even 
that right is suspended. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is what I think, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   What then happens is that we had no choice 
20 
and I said in my email to Mr Molefe and I told him, Chair, 
we have no choice, our degrees of freedom are limited, we 
cannot go to court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And we have to find a decent way to getting 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 141 of 383 
 
back to Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR KOKO:   Because the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are in a corner now. 
MR KOKO:   They are in a corner, the belt is not running, 
so we have to reach out to Glencore, we have  - this is the 
only way we had to do and Mr Molefe agreed with me.  
Chair, I do not know who initiated the meeting.  Whether it 
is me – they say it is them, I think it is me, but it does not 
matter.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So eventually, I remember talking to the CEO 
of OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ephron. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Ephron.  We arranged a meeting on the 3 
November.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, for the 3 November. 
MR KOKO:   3 September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And in that 3 September it is me who said you 
20 
know, this business rescue has upset me so much, we are 
not going to entertain him, our solution will come out of 
Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that where you did not want to 
meet with the practitioners? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 142 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was because this is what they have 
done. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, so you wanted to talk to 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ephron, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Ephron, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Again the meeting was not nice, I did 
not talk, I do not talk when my boss is in the room, I only 
speak when spoken to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But it was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was you, Mr Molefe from Eskom’s 
side. 
MR KOKO:   It was me, Mr Brian Molefe.  I think there 
were only three of us in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, from Eskom or…? 
20 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, from Eskom it was me and Mr 
Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And then it was Mr Ephron. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 143 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Because we did not allow the business rescue 
to come in, I do not remember the fourth person in the 
meeting, I think it was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, but you provide the reasons why 
you did not want the business practitioners. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because by putting – or rather – well, 
actually because they demanded …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   513. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the people who put the company in 
10 
business rescue were not the business practitioners, it was 
Ephron that you wanted to talk to.   
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And remember that when he did that he did 
not give me the privilege to talk to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   He did not even pick up the call and say listen 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but what I am saying is, on reflection, 
20 
the business rescue practitioners were not the people you 
were supposed to be upset with, it was Glencore, it was 
Ephron, the ones you wanted to meet. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I told you that in the heated moments 
with the business rescue practitioners, we will all hug and 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 144 of 383 
 
cry together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   So I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And when Mr Seleka said yesterday it is not 
Glencore that cancelled that business rescue, I said yes 
and I put a [indistinct] with but I knew where he was 
getting to, he was making a distinction that the people in 
charge at the time was the business rescue practitioners 
but the people who put it there was – so I accept that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, let us wrap up now 
because we …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   So I am done, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are done now. 
MR KOKO:   So the only thing that I will refer to is the – 
now we entered into an interim agreement …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Now 
tell 
me 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness 
the 
outcome 
of 
that 
meeting, 
the 
3 
September. 
MR KOKO:   So the interim agreement, the outcome of that 
20 
meeting is recorded in a document called PMM8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is in bundle 15, PM8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we do not go there, if you remember 
what it is, that is fine. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 145 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   So all what it said is that they will supply 
Eskom with coal at original price of R154 per ton, they will 
do so for 60 days and that 60 days – and that was signed 
on the 22 September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And it was effective from the 4 September 
until the 4 November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   That was the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is the outcome of that 
10 
meeting. 
MR KOKO:   Ja.  Chair, I am where Mr Seleka was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   This is where I was and I could not answer 
him directly until we get …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without going back to… 
MR KOKO:   Without going to how we ended up. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
How 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR KOKO:   Because now the question becomes, did we 
20 
have an emergency or not?  And how did – what was the 
scope of the cooperation agreement and then I was going 
to refer – now I can talk to it without referring to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, not, that is fine.  Mr Seleka.  
It has been quite a wait on your part but I do want to say 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 146 of 383 
 
that I think that the issues that Mr Koko has dealt with 
appears to me to be legitimate issues to raise.  They throw 
certain light on certain things.  Ja, okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. The document which Mr Koko 
wanted to refer the Chairperson to, copies of that have 
been made so …[intervenes]    
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to put on record where it is to 
be found?  The one that he was reading? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, which he said …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The interim agreement? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Chair.  Which he said it was an 
attachment to Mr Pierce Marsden’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said it is a letter and then in the 
interim agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is a better place to place it 
because it is an attachment to the letter that is already on 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Marsden’s affidavit, if it is 
20 
somewhere in the bundle that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   Oh yes.  No, it is, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Save to point out, Mr Koko, I think the 
calculation of R513 per ton you have calculated it yourself. 
MR KOKO:   Oh, ja, Chair.  I did not calculate it, it is a 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 147 of 383 
 
given.  I just showed you how it got there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So they way you do it, the price is there, 
R22.30, am I right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   R22.30. 
MR KOKO:   Per kilojoule. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Kilojoule. 
MR KOKO:   So if you convert to mass it is 513. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so what I am saying to you is the 
calculation arriving at 513 is not in the document, you did 
10 
it yourself. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, yes but what I am saying to you is, energy 
is mass and that is the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine.  But let me sum 
up the points you have sought to make with regard to the 
trail that we have followed.  As I understand it, it amounts 
to the following that you say, one – I am now linking it with 
part of what you said two days ago. 
1. 
Any party that was aggrieved in terms of the CSA 
was not allowed to cancel the CSA, their remedy were 
20 
those provided for in the CSA. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which include in certain circumstances, 
arbitration. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 148 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as Eskom is concerned, when it 
comes to coal being supplied that did not meet the 
specifications it included rejecting the coal or prior to the 
settlement agreement, arbitration settlement agreement, 
giving notice to OCM within 15 days but after the 
settlement 
agreement, 
that 
was 
superseded 
by 
new 
arrangement and that new arrangement was that the 
spreadsheet that would be exchanged early would be 
regarded as compliance. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is one, two you are saying that 
OCM being aware of the availability of the arbitration route 
did take steps to pursue that route but did not pursue it to 
finality. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say the reason why, as far as 
you were concerned, they did not do that is because they 
knew they had no case. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would lose arbitration.  
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you make the point that from 
your point of view – well you also say, those within Eskom, 
who were - whose duty it was to enforce penalties, 
suspended 
the 
enforcement 
of 
penalties 
without 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 149 of 383 
 
authorisation.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you say when OCM complained 
about the price in 2014, you approached BTC, the Board 
Tender Committee and sought a mandate, which would 
accommodate or would enable you to agree to the proposal 
from OCM.   
We - in terms of an increase on the price. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And actually even if they ask for a little 
10 
more, you could still have agreed to give it. 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say, those who were negotiating 
with 
that 
mandate 
was 
given 
and 
those 
who 
were 
negotiating with OCM which were under your team, I think, 
under your team, under your leadership. 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know what happened but 
later on, they came back and said OCM one at 442 as a 
price. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright a you sit there you do 
not know what difficulties if any, there were in pinning 
down OCM to the proposal that they had made earlier on. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 150 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say, thereafter OCM moved 
even from 442 to 513.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And, of course, once OCM was under 
business rescue, you were advised that Eskom could not 
take over the mine.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is what happened.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say the decisions that were 
10 
taken to pursue the claim of penalties were because of 
advice, legal advice that was given t Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, did I leave out anything? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, and that is because I did not tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So on the 20 t h of July 2015 when I came back 
from 
suspension, 
I 
confronted 
Mr 
Bester 
about 
the 
outcome, I said Bester you went with me to the BTC in 
2014.  You showed me the proposal of OCM a policy - and 
20 
Chair, by the way, I asked your legal team how they wanted 
to attach that proposal.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it would be good if we have it. 
MR KOKO:   I asked and I wrote to your legal team and I 
did not get it.  You showed me this proposal, we debated.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 151 of 383 
 
We made a conclusion.  We compromised, first between 
the two of us we reached a compromise before we go to 
the Board. Now I come back, you want 442, not a nice 
discussion he chose to resign.  He felt uncomfortable, and 
he resigned instead of answering my questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So he did not explain what happened? 
MR KOKO:   He resigned.  He writes in his affidavit; Mr 
Koko was asking too much, too many questions.  Mr Koko 
was asking too many questions of details and asking too 
many documents. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is what you were asking you 
say. 
MR KOKO:   And that is what I was asking and he says it, 
he says I was asking for the report of Nedbank.  This is 
responses – he was saying to me but this 442 was 
reviewed by…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nedbank. 
MR KOKO:   I said give me that Nedbank report.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR KOKO:   Give it to me let me go and look at it myself.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you never got it. 
MR KOKO:   Till today, I have never got it, I got it from the 
Commission.  The basis point report, I never got it until 
today.  I never, never got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  We will now make quite 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 152 of 383 
 
some progress because we have covered what Mr Koko 
wish to deal with first before dealing with questions.  So Mr 
Seleka. 
MR KOKO:   I apologise for disrupting you, sir, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair can we go to Bundle EB15 
Docket B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 15, Docket B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am only going to touch on certain 
questions you were asking Mr Koko and see whether there 
are no explanations from him.  One of them is where you 
were asking why the increase from - what is it?  What 
was…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   285, and then to 442.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, why could they not continue their 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, now Mr Koko let us go back to the 
20 
document you were reading from, which is approval of a 
negotiated outcome.  You referred to the Chairperson to 
page 786. 
CHAIRPERSON:   786? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   786. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 153 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Bundle 15B.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of Bundle 15B, so you read from there.  
Let us go to 794, and I just want to ask for your comment 
on this because there are paragraphs there in 794, 
particularly the last three paragraphs.  It says: 
“PED 
engaged 
the 
services 
of 
independent 
corporate finance advisors, [Nedbank], capital and 
basis points to conduct the financial due diligence 
on Optimum’s cost mentioned above.  The price 
offers for the coal that meets Hendrina’s highest CV 
10 
specification is R442 per ton until 2018, which 
Optimum has indicated does not include a margin 
and this has been verified by the independent 
financial advisors. The price post 2018 is R475 per 
ton 
which 
excludes 
a 
margin 
of 
20%. 
The 
conclusion from the independent corporate finance 
advisors 
was 
that 
based 
on 
mining 
and 
beneficiation costs for the coal quality specification 
and cash requirements that Hendrina agreed on the 
price of R442 per ton offered by Optimum, for a CV 
20 
of 23.5 MJ/kilograms dry basis is cost reflective and 
they are in agreement with how the costs have been 
allocated 
to 
produce 
the 
coal 
for 
Eskom 
in 
comparison, 
PED 
approved 
mandate 
was 
to 
negotiate a real base of R296,30 per ton August 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 154 of 383 
 
2014, money values for a CV of 22.8 MJ/KG on the 
dry basis.” 
And then they conclude there in that paragraph.  Was this 
not the reason for the change in the price or the proposed 
price? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, let us say that was the reason why is 
not within your mandate.  You have got a mandate.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, if that is the answer that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   So, why go and act outside the mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   You came and said you have got a proposal 
from OCH of 296.  We took that proposal to the Board on 
the basis of which we get given a mandate.  If you stay 
within that mandate, the Board says do not come to us, 
just sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also Mr Seleka is there a place 
where they explain what happened after they were given 
the mandate to - by the BTC, did they meet and they had 
discussions, and how did the proposal of 285 get not 
accepted.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a place where they explained 
that, as far as you have been…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair what I have been able to see 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 155 of 383 
 
because this is evidence in phase one is that they engaged 
us they say here the services of independence corporate 
finance advisors, Nedbank capital on basis points to 
determine – to do financial due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was – it was what one would 
expect is that if you are in negotiations with an outside 
party, you are a negotiation team or an entity as Eskom.  
There is a proposal given to you by the outside party.   You 
go to your principals and say, please give us a mandate.  
They give you a mandate, that is enough for you to cover 
10 
that.  
You do not go and do research, because you have 
got enough mandate.  You do not go and even look for 
advice.  You come back and say, okay, this is what we have 
offered, we have a mandate you either accept that, or if 
you still want to negotiate them down, you tried that but 
you would only go and do research after you have done 
something that deals with the proposal that was on the 
table. 
So if there is not anywhere where that is explained 
20 
then that is fine, but one would have liked to hear the 
journey from getting the mandate from the BTC to the time 
when Eskom, when OCM puts up a hire amount. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you will not find it, it is not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 156 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   I can speculate…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did this 442 even come from OCM or did 
it come from the independent advisors? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From my reading of the evidence 
Chair, Eskom itself engaged independent advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who came up with 442. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To do a deal, ja after what they say is 
that due diligence that was conducted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but is that your understanding to? 
MR KOKO:   That is my understanding Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So OCM is not the one who increased 
the price?  
MR KOKO:   I do not think they were acting alone, Chair.  I 
do not think they were acting alone because let us suppose 
Chair and here is the reason why I am saying they were not 
acting alone.  If it was an Eskom decision, why would it be 
a do or die for Optimum?  Why would Optimum say if you 
do not give me 442 or 5.3 I am liquidating, why did they do 
that?  Because Optimum to say listen 442 is your number 
our number is 285, we are happy with 285. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the people who were negotiating, 
have we got affidavits from them, we need to deal with this 
aspect. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is why I kept on telling you that 
you have got the wrong person sitting here because this 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 157 of 383 
 
person sitting here has been targeted.  The people who did 
this, one of them was sitting here and these issues have 
not been brought to him.  Not only once, his got two 
affidavits already, not once in his affidavit do they say but 
respond to this.  I make this point in my main affidavit not 
only once is he told but Mr Koko is making this point, can 
you respond to it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you will give their names to the 
legal team. 
MR KOKO:   It is your favourite witness Mr Bester. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you call him that.  
MR KOKO:   Because you have got favourite witnesses, 
Chair I know that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   There are no favourite witnesses.  
MR KOKO:   They get coached, they get protected when 
we make noise you go for the kill. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no Mr Koko you will give the names 
– you mentioned one person you gave...[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   That is Mr Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is he the only one that…[intervenes] 
20 
MR KOKO:   That is Mr Bester.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And he needs to be asked, why did you think 
that I do not deserve to get the copy of Nedbank Capital 
and basis point.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 158 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  I guess maybe the best is to 
get the transcript of Mr Koko's evidence today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to call upon him to depose to an 
affidavit and deal with the issues.  That is whatever as 
maybe in any affidavit, it might not have been sent to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or Mr Koko.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because maybe there is an explanation 
10 
but on the face of this of it does sound strained but you 
have got an offer, you go and obtain a mandate from your 
principal, your principal gives you a wide mandate, which 
is enough for you to accept this offer.  
But if Mr Koko is right, and if you understand his 
right, they go to outside advisors in circumstances where 
they have got an offer that they are mandated to accept 
and move on. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe they - I mean they might be 
20 
able to explain, but I am just saying, that is what, that is 
part of what I am interested in. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Chair, if I may and this is simply to 
avoid that Mr Koko must come back at another occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 159 of 383 
 
ADV BARRY SC:   But I do want to just draw your attention 
on page 793 of this bundle to the paragraph under the 
upper table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   793? 
ADV BARRY SC:   793, you will see, there is a little table 
at the top.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRY SC:   And then there is a paragraph there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV BARRY SC:   And that has to be dealt with – read in 
10 
conjunction with page 795 paragraph 3.1.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV BARRY SC:   And the essential reason that is put out 
there but I do not – I am not a witness is that Optimum 
wanted to close the export mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka you…[intervene] 
ADV BARRY SC:   But there was evidence there, that is no 
reason for a price increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Seleka you will cover that, this 
part – let me this paragraph at page 793 reads: 
20 
“PED had intended to negotiate a real base of 
296,30 per ton with Optimum based on the fact that 
the Eskom products should be cross subsidised by 
the export product and hence should be supplied at 
marginal cost or at a subsidised price which was 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 160 of 383 
 
the original basis for allowing the mine to convert 
from being a cost plus mine only supplying Eskom 
to a dual product mine with more than 50% of its 
volume being sold to the export market. According 
to Optimum the price required to cover costs to 
break even to meet the current CSA qualities except 
for a one and sizing on the Eskom contract needs to 
increase significantly.  Eskom’s assessments of 
Optimums proposed costs indicate that if agreed to 
will cost Eskom R5.5billion at 5.5 MG per annum for 
10 
the remainder of the CSA.” 
Is there something you want to explain in that paragraph 
Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   No Chair, that table is - and thanks Mr Barry, 
the table is quite nice table because that table says that 
first column is a price achieved and then the second 
column is the approved base, the 296 of particular 
importance Chair is the last column.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Approved aspirational base. 
MR KOKO:   Approved ja, the row – the column 22.8.  So 
20 
we went to the Board and we said to the Board, we have a 
proposal from Optimum for a 22.8 CV and that 22.8 CV will 
cost us 285.   The Board said go and negotiate but we 
giving you 296. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To give you enough room. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 161 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   To give enough room.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just in case they change in the 
meantime.  
MR KOKO:   Exactly, the team came back and have 
negotiated a coal of 23.5 higher than what the Board 
approved at a price of 442.  It only depends, I do not know 
why they did that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, no, that is fine Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   And I do not know why they thought this is so 
10 
important to destroy the operations on both sides. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Koko let us allow Mr Seleka 
now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know Mr Bester deals with this aspect 
of export in one of his affidavits Chair, but I just want to 
come back to the issues that arose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In regard to the price and I want to 
clarify this with Mr Koko so that we all are on the same 
page.  Chair, please go back to Eskom 15C, 15C. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On that page 1826, 1826, which is a 
submission document.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, just for clarity again that 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 162 of 383 
 
paragraph you read below the table, it says: 
“OCM is currently claiming hardship, citing that 
Optimum colliery has not been recovering its costs 
on the Eskom product over the past three years. 
Based on the current modus operandi OCM had 
proposed 
the 
price 
increase 
from 
the 
current 
R154,40 after quality price adjustments this drops 
R130,36 per ton.” 
YTD, what does that mean? 
MR KOKO:   Year to date. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “Year to date, May 2014 to R285 per 
ton  
“excluding escalations for the remaining contract 
periods, and R375 per ton in 2014 money values.” 
And then they go on to say: 
“Plus a profit margin post.” 
Now, let us forget post 2018 to 2023 for now, how should 
we understand that R375 per ton in 2014 money values? 
MR KOKO:   The 375 will be the price at the end of 2018, 
Chair.  So your contract ends in 2018 and the Optimum 
20 
proposal was that between 2014 and 2018 the base price - 
remember I took you to the price and payment schedule it 
has got a base price.  The base price becomes what 285 
until the end of the contract and then the base price from 
2018 becomes 375 until 2023. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 163 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but why do they write in 2014?  
MR KOKO:   Because…intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh in 2014 money value, oh okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is nominal rands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I see so you are saying that 285 
was to before 2014 to 2018 and then from 2018 to the end 
of the contract 2023. 
MR KOKO:   No, no 2014 to 2018 which is the end of the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja and anything beyond that would 
10 
be 375. 
MR KOKO:   Anything beyond that would be 375.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that was their proposal. 
MR KOKO:   That was their proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
So 
just 
tell 
me 
whether 
my 
understanding of the way they wrote it here, if they say per 
ton year to date May 2014 to – well this drops R130 per 
ton year to date day, as you say May 2014 to R285 per ton 
excluding escalations for the remaining of the contract 
20 
period and R375 per ton in 2014 more values and then they 
plus profit margin post 2018. 
MR KOKO:   And the profit margin is 20%. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the profit margin was 20%.  
MR KOKO:   So, on that 375 Chair, you will add 20%.  So it 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 164 of 383 
 
is 375 plus 20%.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that 20% is of what?  
MR KOKO:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 20% of 375. 
MR KOKO:   Of 375, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but that margin of 20%, did not apply on 
the 285. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  But what does this excluding 
escalations that appears after 285 per ton? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair, is just too much detail that we should 
not have put there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay 285 was 285 for all intents and 
purposes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, so the important numbers there is 285 
and 375 plus 20%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the 375 was for after the contract 
had ended. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there was a renewal or an extension. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct, and their state of mind OCM when 
they did this proposal, was to seek to avoid an open tender 
process.  I would have done the same, you always take the 
chance, if Eskom agrees you are in the money, if they do 
agree you have lost nothing. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 165 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair we will ascertain with Mr 
Bester.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
What 
was 
going 
on 
there 
and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   While you are looking for whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we take a short adjournment just 10 
minutes? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I could quickly 
read from Mr Johan Bester’s affidavit submitted in phase 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where he addresses this meeting Mr 
Voges that he had with him on the first day of Mr Koko’s 
20 
return from suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 20t h of July. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 20t h of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For the record I will mention where the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 166 of 383 
 
affidavit is found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is Eskom Bundle 18(a) it is page 24.  
He says: 
“Mr Matshela Koko’s first day back at the 
office 
after 
his 
more 
than 
three 
month 
suspension was Monday 20 July 2015.  He 
had me summoned to his office at 9H00 on 
that same morning. Mr Koko told me he 
wanted to brought up to speed with important 
10 
transactions such as Eskom’s negotiations 
with Optimum (essentially Glencore as the 
main shareholder and funding partner of 
Optimum) as it related to the Optimum Coal 
Supply 
Agreement 
for 
Hendrina 
Power 
Station.  He wanted all briefing notes and 
third party reports and recommendations.  He 
also wanted the feasibility study report and 
other documentation relating to the New 
Largo project for the supply to Kusile Power 
20 
Station.” 
Paragraph 10. 
“Prior to Mr Koko asking for the detailed 
Optimum and New Largo information I had for 
almost an hour fully appraised him of the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 167 of 383 
 
status on Optimum and New Largo.  I recall 
that I explained to Mr Koko how important it 
was to keep the Optimum Mine from shutting 
down and that as a last resort if Eskom did 
not have the stomach to pay a sustainable 
price for the coal from Optimum in addition to 
Hendrina Power Station then Eskom should 
rather consider purchasing Optimum from 
Glencore to supply Arnot Power Station as 
we were running into supply problems from 
10 
Exxaro Arnot Colliery.  I explained to Mr 
Koko that Optimum Colliery was relatively 
near logistically and the coal qualities were 
also similar.  I told him that once – one could 
apparently see the washing planted Exxaro’s 
Arnot mine from the northern operations of 
the Optimum open car section.  But then Mr 
Matshela Koko started asking a little too 
much detail and for documents that I thought 
was unusual for someone at his level of 
20 
seniority.  I asked myself where he would 
even get the time to read through the New 
Largo feasibility study.” 
Paragraph 11. 
“I told Mr Koko that I was uncomfortable 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 168 of 383 
 
continuing meeting with him and that he 
would have my resignation before 12H00 that 
day and I walked out.  I did not wait for a 
reply.  I dropped my resignation at his office 
at around 11H00.” 
 
I thought I would read that Mr Koko I suppose you 
have seen his affidavit? 
MR KOKO:  I have Chair and Chair what the committee must 
know I was asking him for documents I was entitled for in my 
position.  You know Chair somebody works for you.  You are 
10 
entitled to these documents he says but give me these 
documents let me read for myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And then he comes and he says … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are asking too much. 
MR KOKO:  You are asking too much.  These are the white 
people that are not used to working for black people who ask 
for detail.  Chauvinist white people who thinks that they can 
simply say – accept what I say.   He is not used to working 
for a black person who is looking for details and if he is not 
20 
happy he will go and read for himself.  But besides I think he 
was covering up something.  He was covering up something 
because it is the same person who brought the proposal of 
the 285 to me.  It is the same person who motivated to me in 
Sep – in June/July 2014 which – and it happened August 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 169 of 383 
 
2014 to the board who persuaded me and I believed in him.  
I believed in him and went with him and he led the 
presentation at the board and I supported him.  What Mr 
Seleka has not read further is that he – he also says he was 
surprised that I refused that he leaves Eskom.  He says so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he said he was going to resign. 
MR KOKO:  No, no when he resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  In his affidavit he also says he was surprised 
that it was me who tried to persuade him not to leave Eskom.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no but that is what I am saying that 
you mean that he says he was surprised. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
When 
he 
talked 
about 
resigning 
or 
presented the letter of resignation that you were the one 
saying do not go. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  Even after the re – even after – even 
during he says even during – while he was serving notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It was me who went to him and say  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must not go. 
MR KOKO:  You must not go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Because Chair I loved detail and I love 
engagement with people of detail.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 170 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR KOKO:  I am one – I am not one of the people who 
avoids intelligent people.  I do not choose people who are.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You wanted to have all the information 
MR KOKO:  Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But he had something to hide.  I can tell 
you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  And Chair I will also 
10 
just place on record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he end up leaving? 
MR KOKO:  He left against my will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the reason given for the 
resignation? 
MR KOKO:  That I am asking too much details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did he put that in the letter? 
MR KOKO:  No he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR KOKO:  He did tell me.  He did not tell me.  I said Mr 
20 
Bester these documents – these documents are in the space 
I am delegated.  I am entitled to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I should be instructing you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 171 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:  And if you refuse to give them to you I should be 
dismissing you for that.  It is a dismissible offence.  These 
documents are in text.  It is not the document of a division 
next door when I am not entitled to it.  I am not encroaching 
I am not overreaching I am asking for documents that are 
rightfully belong to me.  Except that I delegated you to deal 
with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you end up getting the documents after 
he had left (Inaudible) 
MR KOKO:  No I did no Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were not there. 
MR KOKO:  No well they were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he was the only one who could give the 
reports. 
MR KOKO:  Yes I only got one of the reports that had been 
reports from the commission’s investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Three – five years later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but after – but after he refused if you 
really wanted the documents nothing prevented you from… 
20 
MR KOKO:  Ja Chair quite obviously I – I did not follow 
them.  I did – once he refused to give me and he left there 
was no need for those documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but if there was a need before he 
refused that need should have persisted after he had refused  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 172 of 383 
 
and actually that is all the more reason why you should have 
wanted to see them. 
MR KOKO:  Chair let me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why is he refusing? 
MR KOKO:  Let me tell why he – why he mentioned that 
report.  First he did not think I would ask for it but secondly 
he did not want to explain himself to the change between 
296 and 442.  He did not want to explain himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question is… 
MR KOKO:  But I got that explanation from the mines.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is you should have – that 
would have been all the more reason why you wanted – you 
would have wanted to see what he did not want you to see. 
MR KOKO:  No but I got the similar – I got the information I 
wanted from the mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja how long after? 
MR KOKO:  It did not take me long.  It did not take me long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did you ultimately get – got – get all the 
information you had wanted from him. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you got them from the mine  
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Then I am just 
really quickly touching on the certain portions that are 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 173 of 383 
 
relevant to the evidence that came out.  On the same Bundle 
18(a) page 34 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe I would say this to – for 
your consideration Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that you might need 
somebody like Mr Bester. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deal with some of the issues or all the 
issues that Mr Koko has raised it may be that it might not 
10 
help much to do it piece meal in the sense that you have not 
got everything but maybe could be follow up by way of 
written questions and answers we talked about.  But that 
which you can do if you – if you prepare you can do now but 
I am just suspecting that you might need more information 
from Mr Bester.  But I am quite happy to leave it to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can raise what you – what you want – 
you feel you are able to deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I would simply put something to 
20 
Mr Koko and he can maybe respond or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or – is that alright Chair. 
MR KOKO:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 174 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I seem to recall seeing this also in that 
submission Mr Koko which we read.  He is saying particularly 
about now this price in paragraph 38 page 24 he says: 
“PED appointed Nedbank and an independent 
technical consultant” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are reading from what document now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  8 – Mr Bester’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Johan Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one you were reading from earlier. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is just a different paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“PED appointed Nedbank and an independent 
technical consultant basis point to evaluate 
the cost structure of Optimum supply to 
Eskom.  This is covered extensively in the 
affidavit and the annexures to my affidavit 
20 
made to the SAPS SCO/DPCLS attached 
hereto. 
 
The 
analysis 
suggested 
that 
Optimum required R442 per ton just to break 
even and that it would be difficult for Eskom 
to procure coal from third party suppliers for 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 175 of 383 
 
less than R300 to R350 per ton.  And then it 
would cost Eskom in excess of R100 per ton 
to deliver the coal by truck to Hendrina 
Power Station.” 
Paragraph 30 reads” 
“Thus Eskom’s alternative would be at least R400 
per ton however an analysis by commercial team 
and the PED technical and PEC transport teams 
and 
a 
team 
from 
Hendrina 
Power 
Station 
suggested that  
10 
1. The power stations coal stockyard is not big 
enough 
to 
safely 
accommodate 
approximately 400 trucks per day.  The 
stockyard was designed to accommodate 
road deliveries for the entire power station 
burn.   
2. There is an underpass that is en route to the 
stockyards that can only accommodate one 
truck at a time ie trucks that come past each 
other but need to wait for the underpass to 
20 
be clear before being accessed from the 
opposite direction.  Thus it would be a 
challenge to get 400 trucks in and out every 
day.  I think it is approximately 400 trucks.  
We 
would 
struggle 
to 
procure 
the 
full 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 176 of 383 
 
Hendrina 
Power 
Station 
burn 
of 
approximately 5million tons per annum.  It is 
my 
view 
that 
a 
transaction/ 
relationship/contract is only sustainable if 
both parties derive a benefit.  It was clearly 
not sustainable if Optimum continued to lose 
R16 million to R100 million per month.  It 
would eventually go into business rescue 
and file for bankruptcy and eventually the 
outcome would be no coal supply.” 
10 
So Mr Koko there I think those reasons are – were – are a 
reproduction of what was contained in that submission.  You 
recall these reasons? 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do.  You have any comment or…? 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Insofar as these… 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He says it would be more expensive to 
secure coal. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From third party suppliers. 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do.  Chair you know one of the values of 
paying attention to detail and – and aim for nothing but 
excellence.  I used to tell my team at work that we aim for 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 177 of 383 
 
excellence. We will pay attention to detail.  Absolute is not 
good enough.  Is that you – you do not get fooled by such 
submissions.  That is why some of us chose to be engineers 
and remained worker engineers when some of our colleagues 
shows to go into management.  Chair let us go to Bundle 
15 715.  Bundle (a) 751.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 15(a). 
MR KOKO:  Ja it is MMK49.1 Mr Barrie. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15(a)  
MR KOKO:  7. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got c and e here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is actually (b) Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – oh I have got this pagination of yours 
is causing problems.  So we will find it in Bundle15(b) what 
is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  751. 
MR KOKO:  751.  So in 2015 in January I was presented 
with a submission by Mr Bester’s team in – if you are there 
yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am there. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  And  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the one starting at page 751? 
MR KOKO:  751 correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 178 of 383 
 
“And it was a feedback on the status of the 
board in the committee mandate obtained by 
the Primary Energy division which granted 
for 
purposes

requirements based on which – based on 
which a coal supply strategy to secure coal 
from 
Waterback in the Lephalale region 
would be implemented.  This was the – this 
was aimed at adducing and identify short 
falling in Mpumalanga region estimated 20 
10 
million – 20 to 40 million tons per annum 
from 2018.” 
So here the BTC had directed Mr Bester’s team to do a study 
to take the coal from the Lephalale because it is – the 
Highveld region – the Highveld region coal is being disputed 
and the next region on coal is Lephalale.  And the – so the 
board directed us to look at the feasibility of taking coal in 
Lephalale – mining it in Lephalale, putting – the rail and 
sending it to the Highveld.  And this is the submission they 
gave me and I interacted with the team and you will find if 
20 
you go 761 – page 761  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see the documents… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It starts by saying that submission I see is 
signed by Mr Vusi Mboweni Divisional Executive acting 
Primary Energy and noted by you as Mr Matshela Koko 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 179 of 383 
 
Group Executive Technology and Commercial on 10 February 
2015.  Right.  We go to 9 – 761.   
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And you see who signed the document again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there is a document that comes after 
that submission and seems to start at page 758 addressed to 
the Chairman of the EXCO – Eskom EXCO yes it is compiled 
by Phiwa Makhoba Fuel Sourcing.  It is on feedback on the 
Waterback development program but it is signed at page 761 
10 
by Mr Johan Bester Fuel Sourcing and Mr Vusi Mboweni.  Mr 
Bester signed on 19 January 2015 and Mr Mboweni on 22 
January 2015.  Yes Mr Koko you can then go to the part 
which you want to draw my attention to. 
MR KOKO:  Right.  So on the document that was signed by 
Mr Bester the one that was prepared by Ms Phiwa.  Please 
let us go to 768.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  I am going to read to you the bottom paragraph 
into the – I am going to read in the record the one that start 
20 
with relaxing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:   
“Relaxing the Waterback commitment beyond 
2018 will ensure Eskom continues engaging 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 180 of 383 
 
with the suppliers to progress their project to 
feasibility stages where they can be able to 
offer as a more accurate price indication of 
their product.  It is also worth noting that 
Eskom recently secured a bulk sample coal 
from Exxaro to be tested at Majuba.  This 
coal landed at Majuba Power Station at R530 
per ton into the rail coal – into the rail.” 
Now Chair what Mr Bester says is that we took coal from 
Lephalale.  We railed it to 530 kilometres to Majuba and it 
10 
cost us R530 per ton.  And then he wants me to pay the 
same amount for the conveyor next door.  Chair you do not 
have to be smart to realise something is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say the price if you compare the 
two the price that he is talking about for the costs of 
conveyance of transporting coal does not make sense. 
MR KOKO:  You know what I told him they are taking you for 
a ride. That is what I told him.  I said Mr Bester they are 
taking you for a ride.  You telling me that you took coal from 
– you mined coal in Lephalale you transported it 530 
20 
kilometres to Majuba. The distance between Hendrina and 
Optimum is not 20 kilometres.  And you want me to pay the 
same price.  You are taking me for a ride.  Something you 
are not telling me.  Let me read the document myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No is that when you asked for more 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 181 of 383 
 
documents? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It is his documents.  He thought this black guy 
does not read.  This black guy is like other black executives 
who just oversee.  Not me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Mr Koko you are saying you told him 
about this. 
MR KOKO:  Of course I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Of course I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of course you did. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  I know that it is not in your 
affidavit so we will ask him to deal with it.  Then the next.. 
MR KOKO:  Chair that is the only reason I have put this 
document in my affidavit.  Because I knew the costing of 
coal price and affordability will come up.  This is in my 
original affidavit.  And he has my affidavit because he 
commented on it.  So he has had sight of this.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair he certainly has Mr Koko’s 
affidavit 
but 
Mr 
Koko’s 
affidavit 
does 
not 
have 
this 
allegation.  So that is what I am saying we will give to Mr 
Bester this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 182 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then Chair I am moving on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 15(c) page 1788 which is 
the second addendum to the coal supply agreement.  And I 
am really just going to the paragraph without (inaudible) 
MR KOKO:  Mr Seleka please tell me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  15(c) page 1788. 
MR KOKO:  I am there Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Just for the benefit of the 
Chairperson Mr Koko it might be necessary to read the first 
10 
and the second addendum but let me start with the second 
on a very particular point.  You read to the Chairperson 
paragraph 3.4.2. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is the one about the spreadsheet. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  3.4.2 is followed by 3.4.3. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And it reads: 
“Eskom will be entitled to offset any and all 
20 
amounts due in respect of any penalties in 
respect of the quality of coal sold and 
delivered by Optimum Colliery to Eskom 
including without limitation in respect of the 
AI of AI.” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 183 of 383 
 
And just give us what AI stands for again? 
MR KOKO:  Abrasiveness Index. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Abrasiveness Index thank you. 
“Against the amount due to Optimum Colliery 
for and in respect of the purchase price of 
such coal.” 
So Eskom is entitled to offset. Then it reads further to say:  
Shall I proceed Chair?   Shall I proceed?  It reads further to 
say: 
“It being specifically recorded that Eskom will 
10 
in writing advise Optimum Colliery monthly in 
arrears 
of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
such 
penalties will have been calculated and 
Eskom 
will 
deliver 
to 
Optimum 
Colliery 
together with the details of such calculation 
the laboratory relevant results in respect of 
the coal in question in support of such 
calculation.” 
Is there a reason why you did not read this paragraph? 
MR KOKO:  Chair  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I mean this clause. 
MR KOKO:  Chair if go into the transcript I was very, very 
clear to you.  I read 4.2 and I referred to 4.3 and I said 4.3 
applies – it is a standalone clause and it tells you your – 
what you are entitled to and if you do this – the deduction a 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 184 of 383 
 
month in arrears you tell the reason why.  If you do not do it 
you do not forfeit your penalties.  So the transcripts will 
again say it – I said it so I made a reference to 2.4.4 – 3.4.3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I certainly do recall that.  I had a look at 
both.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you were giving evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes they – there are further sub-
paragraphs … 
10 
MR KOKO:  Chair I must say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must also – I must … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I – finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let Mr Seleka finish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  They are further sub-paragraph 3.4 
quality of coal and you have 3.4.1. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And 3.4.2, 3.4.3 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And my next question is do you know 
whether or not paragraph – Clause 3.4.3 was complied with 
by Eskom?  Well it being specifically recorded that Eskom 
will in writing advise Optimum Colliery monthly in arrears of 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
such 
penalties 
will 
have 
been 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 185 of 383 
 
calculated. 
MR KOKO:  Chair the answer is partial and I will – I am 
happy to refer you to a document.  And if I am allowed I will 
do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Seleka do you need him to refer to 
the documents? 
MR KOKO:  Eskom has complied with but not fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
MR KOKO:  Eskom has complied to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:  And not fully. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And I am happy to show you a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I can talk to it or I can show you it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you should do both. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Maybe you should do them … 
MR KOKO:  So let us go to the affidavit of Snehal Nagar. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  If I can be assisted where to find it.  Chair, one 
20 
of the things you will appreciate about my training is that I 
am an Engineer and engineers are trained to talk to 
engineering code.  We are taught from university.  If it is 
not in the design code or it is not in the rule book, you do 
not mention it.  It does not exist.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 186 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I tried to do that.  If I cannot point to a 
document ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You keep quiet. 
MR KOKO:   I keep quiet and I would appreciate the rest of 
your witnesses to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  They are not engineers. 
MR KOKO:   It is common sense, though. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bundle is in Eskom – I mean, that 
affidavit is in Eskom Bundle 18(a), page 125.   
10 
MR KOKO:   18(a), 125.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, if I need to move ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   125? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...to something else, you – if you are 
satisfied with ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...not satisfied ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am leaving it to you.  You deal with 
whatever you feel needs to be dealt with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just to draw to your attention 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...certain things who combines 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 187 of 383 
 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 125? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   125, yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Chair, if you go to paragraph 7.4.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   7.4, page 132.   
CHAIRPERSON:   122? 
MR KOKO:   132. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One, three, two. 
MR KOKO:   One, three, two. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   One, three, two.  
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 132, it says: 
“Based on the aforesaid calculations and our 
interpretation 
of 
the 
information 
provided 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on.  You are starting to 
read from whereabouts in paragraph ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Just – the last – the second last sentence of 
paragraph 7.4 on page 132. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It starts with based? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can see, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 188 of 383 
 
“Based on the aforesaid calculations and our 
interpretation of the information provided and 
the interpretation of the CSA, Eskom could 
impose a further penalty in the total amount of 
R 2.17 billion 
as 
summarised 
in 
the 
spreadsheet attached as SM...’ 
 
So, Chair, Eskom had a particular view of the 
interpretation of the CSA and based on that interpretation, 
the penalties is where the two point one four point five 
billion rands come from and if Optimum has a problem, we 
10 
go to dispute and we will deal with that.  But what I want to 
you to do is that, is to go to the next page which is 133. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 133? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, next to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Just...  The next page, you will see is the 
penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  March 2012. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, starting from March 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR KOKO:   And – so if you go to – I hope you did not 
close that page, Mr Seleka, on Bundle 15 170, page 7718 
and you asked if Eskom – do I know if Eskom complied to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 1788? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 189 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, and I said...  [Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So Eskom is entitled ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But complete your point in relation to 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Ja.  So Eskom has done the set-off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   So the – paragraph 3.4 point...  Eskom will be 
titled to a set-off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Eskom has done the set-off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And when you do the set-off ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...you then provide the reasons – areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And you see it is nicely done.  YOU will see in 
paragraph – in page 133, the last paragraph.  It says: 
“From the table above, it appears that CV(?) 
as the sales and penalties were not applied 
20 
before September 2013. 
It also appears that the sales and penalties 
was not applied for the entire period..” 
 
Right?  And Chair, this is what I expected your 
investigators to investigate, but in any event ...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 190 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, I missed that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says this is what he expected the 
Commission’s Investigators to investigate. 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  He says ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   If Eskom is entitled to the penalties of two 
point one and they are not paid, surely, it is a big issue.  It 
should be big issue for me.  It should be a big issue for the 
Commission.  Why they did not go as not – why Eskom has 
not deducted penalties of two point one notice(?)?  And 
10 
when we – me and my team demanded them we were 
penalised and fired by the same President who was the 
Chairman of Optimum.  And this were ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want to...  What does page 133 
represent for you?  Is that the amount that remained after 
the set-off? 
MR KOKO:   No, it is the amount – it is the value of the 
set-off every month.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   3.4.3 talks about monthly set-offs. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are the last figures in those columns the 
total ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Set-offs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in regard to of a set-off in each 
column? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 191 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So.  And R 158 million is 
that the total of all the other columns? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...say total or I think something has been 
– is no longer there. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So it is the total.  Chair, ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So 158, R 158.3 million is the totals of 
the columns of the set of – all the set-off amounts 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the months from 20 March 2012 to 
May 2014? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair.  So ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   So if I can be very pedantic? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that comes from two comma 
something billion? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, if you go to the next part. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 192 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   The next page 134. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   The total value of the set-offs ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   ...is R 2 344 802 – no, two million three 
hundred and forty-four – two billion three hundred and 
forty-four million eight hundred and two thousand two 
hundred and twenty-one rands.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What does that amount represents? 
10 
MR KOKO:   It is the total number – it is the total value of 
the set-offs... between 2012, March 2012 and May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you just agreed when I asked 
whether the R 158 million was the total. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I just want to answer you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I just want to – the total value of the set-offs 
is this R 2.3 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Right? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And of that R 2.3 billion only R 158 million 
was deducted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Okay so – then your 
answer, I guess your answer to my question in relation to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 193 of 383 
 
the figure of R 158.3 million at page 133 should not have 
been that R 158.3 million was the total of the set-off.  It 
should have been the total of the set-off is R 2.3 billion. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But R 158 million is all that was 
deducted? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And what was deducted – areas ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Eskom would then do the coal qualities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the reason why. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
MR KOKO:   It should have done that for all the 
R 2.3 billion.  Eskom was privileged by Glencore and 
nobody wants to deal with that and I have a problem with 
that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  Thank you, Chair.  So, 
20 
Mr Koko, your response to us raises a couple of things and 
we need to see how to deal with them.  One, is that 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must say, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 194 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Keep an eye on what your plan was in 
the morning in terms of what you wanted to ask him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So...  [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you decide to deal with what has 
arisen from his evidence today in relation to what we were 
dealing with, that is fine.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just saying.  Do not forget what you 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...planned to deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it may well be that – time you could 
deal with that within ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in terms of written questions and 
20 
answers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Some of the penalties we can dispose 
of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in the plan. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 195 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But let us deal with it whilst we are at 
it.  Mr Koko, because we see from CDH’s affidavit that they 
have referred to the period when the penalties were 
deducted and the period when the penalties were not 
deducted.  And to the extent that you say deductions were 
affected, the point to Eskom not being able to calculate – 
to 
verify 
how 
the 
amount 
was 
arrived, 
which 
was 
duplicated, an amount of R 158 million.  A little over 
R 158 million, which had been deducted from OCH... OCM.   
10 
 
But including in the two point one point seven – 
R 2.17 billion and it had to be taken out, ultimately.  What 
do you say to that insofar as you are adamant that 
R 2.17 billion was due and payable when, in fact – and this 
is just the one component of it – there was a duplication of 
over R 158 million? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, let us get the facts right.  Now we just 
have to be factual and talk to the facts and everything else 
will stand on its own.  If you look at – if we are still on 
page... 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can stay there because I will come 
to this – another paragraph of...  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  But if you look at the page – Bundle 18, 
page 133. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 196 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 18, page 133. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The same bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] 
MR KOKO:   Same bundle, Chair.  Same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Same bundle? 
MR KOKO:   Same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Same affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka, when Mr Koko has 
responded to the question that you have asked him.  I want 
us to go back to that paragraph 3.4.3 that you said he had 
not read but let him answer your questions first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So, Chair, in page 133 it is a table and that 
table shows you the penalty – its evasiveness(?) index 
penalty.  Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, I thought I had the bundle 
that was required.  So it is the 18(a) that I have just been 
20 
given. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the right bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the correct bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And – I mean - affidavit.  Page 125 and 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 197 of 383 
 
page 126.  Is that where I should be? 
MR KOKO:   Page 133, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   133? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that table.  Ja, I have got it.   
MR KOKO:   Chair, the table on the first column at the top, 
it is Abrasiveness Index.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well, on mine it is not legible. 
MR KOKO:   It is not legible but I am just trying to lead 
you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   First column? 
MR KOKO:   First column is AI. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Abrasiveness Index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And then the second one the ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Let me – 
Abrasiveness ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR KOKO:   The second one ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...index.  Second on? 
MR KOKO:   Is Calorific Value which is the heat content of 
coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What value? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 198 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Calorific Value. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Calorific Value.  Yes? 
MR KOKO:   That one is the ash content. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ash? 
MR KOKO:   Content. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   And the final one is the Fines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fines? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
10 
MR KOKO:   Okay total amount.  The R 158 million – the 
last column, it is a summation of all their penalties.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   The last column is Total. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Is the Abrasiveness Index plus the Calorific 
Value plus the Ash plus the Fines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
MR KOKO:   The Abrasiveness Index was dealt with in the 
settlement agreement that we have dealt with on April 12, 
20 
2011.  You will remember the same document says barren 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...barren abrasiveness – the rest stays the 
same.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 199 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So the R 158 million that we – Mr Seleka is 
referring to includes the Abrasiveness Index which has no 
dispute(?) at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but does that answer the question? 
EDH ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, what I am saying to you, Mr Seleka 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I ...[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   ...sharing(?) to R 158 million ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me finish. 
MR KOKO:   That is what I am simply telling you.  You 
cannot refer to 158 because 158 ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Hang 
on, 
hang 
on, 
Mr 
Koko 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   ...index ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Koko ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   ...in dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Mr Koko. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us hear what Mr Seleka says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You see, the – Mr Moodley writes 
in his affidavit: 
“On 8 March 2017... 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 200 of 383 
 
 
And for the record, Chair, Eskom Bundle 14(d), 
page 927, paragraph 57.4. 
“On 8 March 2017, Eskom Finance furnished 
us with various invoices for the period of 
March 2012 to February 2015 and advised us 
that they were unable to verify how the 
penalties 
for 
the 
penalised 
period 
in 
the 
amount of R 158 million had been calculated 
and/or what the formula for rationale for the 
calculation was...” 
10 
 
I am not saying that.  I am reading from what 
they are saying and ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And Chair, I ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And in the end result, Chair, it 
turns out that that amount was a double charge, was a 
duplication of what had already been deducted and it had 
to be taken out of ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...to be removed from the R 2.17 
20 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him finish, Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...from the R 2.17 billion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So my question to Mr Koko is this. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 201 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If he was saying:  We were entitled to 
R 2.17 billion.  On what basis do you say so when there 
was this – just one aspect of that – being double charged 
of R 158 million? 
MR KOKO:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Was that double charging, in the 
first place? 
MR KOKO:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know? 
10 
MR KOKO:   I do not know, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   But surely, and this would be things that will 
be ventilated at the arbitrator.  Optimum will come in and 
says you have double charged.  The arbitrator says:  I 
agree with you.  On other issues, the arbitrator will say:  I 
do not agree with you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   But this cannot be used as a reason why we 
should not go to arbitration. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, I thought Mr Seleka’s 
question was not about going to arbitration but it was 
simple about whether you were right in what you said with 
regard to what 158 represents.   
MR KOKO:   No, no Chair ...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 202 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...the 158 represents, it is very clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct]...[intervenes] 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR KOKO:   It is very clear – was the person who was 
delegated to calculate it as calculated it and he is telling 
you ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...that on the basis of interpretation, this is 
the number. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, but what I mean is.  You have 
told me what you say R 158.3 million represents. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I understand him to be saying, in 
effect, that cannot be the true picture because that is 
duplicated. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   No, it was not ...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.  Chair, you will remember this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You will remember this.  If you – well 
recount because that is the amount ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 203 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Eskom gave to their lawyers, CDH of 
this ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   R 158 million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is R 158 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As represented what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As representing part of the penalties – 
the penalties claim of R 2.17 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Saying, in other words, we are entitled 
to claim this amount. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Mr Koko has said to you, many 
times: 
 
We 
were 
entitled 
to 
claim 
that 
amount 
of 
R 2.17 billion.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now my question is.  My question 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says ...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am allowing you to process it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand him, he was saying – 
and this can be confusing – you are saying this amount of 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 204 of 383 
 
R 158 million represents what had already been deducted. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if it had already been deducted, 
Eskom should not be pursuing ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   A claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...a claim against it. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  And if it does, the arbitrator 
...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is wrong. 
MR KOKO:   You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we are on the same page now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, exact page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the question is then.  Why is he 
20 
saying they were entitled to R 2.17 billion as a claim? 
MR KOKO:   Can I answer you, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When, in fact, the portion of it was this 
duplication. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 205 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then it is a question of whether 
R 158 million is included in the ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is Chair. 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is quite simple.  The people who are 
delegated with the authority to calculate this claim have 
come to this Commission to testify that Eskom is entitled to 
tow, one, seven.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR KOKO:   And we are sitting with the same - with the 
affidavit in front of you, page 132.  The person who is 
delegated says in this Commission Eskom could impose a 
further 
penalty 
in 
the 
total 
of 
two, 
one, 
seven 
as 
summarised 
in 
the 
spreadsheet, 
in 
the 
attached 
spreadsheet.  So that is – what more can I say? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  But basically, just to make 
sure that we are on – we understand one another.  You are 
saying that is what they said, but you are saying, actually, 
insofar as they included this R 158.3 million ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR KOKO:   They are wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were wrong? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 206 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But it is a different answer to say, were we 
entitled to two point one seven or not? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR KOKO:   We were entitled to it, we had already 
deducted it, and we cannot deduct it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No.  I mean, I think, then you and 
Mr Seleka are on the same page because ...[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Let me finish, Mr Barrie.  If I 
10 
misunderstand it, I just see it now.  [laughs]   
ADV BARRIE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because at least I think I understand 
what Mr Koko is saying.  So to the extent that the amount 
of R 158.3 million represents an amount that had already 
been deducted by Eskom from the price of OCM for coal.  
Eskom was not entitled to include it in any claim that it 
would pursue.  I think all three of us agreed on that.  Now, 
before I come to you Mr Seleka to say:  Okay what is the – 
what next after that understanding? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me hear from Mr Barrie, he wanted 
to say something? 
ADV BARRIE:   Yes, Chair.  And it is question about 
whether Mr Koko and the Evidence Leader are on the same 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 207 of 383 
 
page.  What Mr Koko pointed out is that the R 158 million 
was the amount that was deducted.  In other words, in that 
respect of that R 158 million, there would have been an 
obligation to, in terms of 3.4.3 of Addendum 3, to provide 
the calculation.  But the real point is that... 
 
He came to the conclusion that the real penalties 
that were payable was R 2.344 billion and that appears at 
the foot of page – and Mr Koko referred to that – of page 
134.  So on a recalculation, the real penalties payable 
R 2.344 billion of that R 158 million was paid which leaves 
10 
you with about R 2.15 billion or R 2.17 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So your understanding is that 
the amount of R 2.344 billion which appears at page 134 is 
incorrect if regard is had to the fact that R 158 million 
should be deducted from that? 
ADV BARRIE:   No, no that is not what - says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he says ...[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE:   He says he did the full calculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE:   So that is, without taking into account, 
20 
what was in fact ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV BARRIE:   That sum still has to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Oh, okay. 
ADV BARRIE:   And we can do it here. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 208 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  So what ...[intervenes] 
ADV BARRIE:   I mean, that is what the developer says.  
That is how he spelt it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  But in the end, I think we are 
in agreement, therefore, that given that, Eskom would not 
be entitled to pursue a claim for R 2.344 billion. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
would 
have 
to 
deduct 
this 
R 158 million ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Correct, correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   And if Eskom does that with the arbitrator, the 
arbitrator must just ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may I just say something?   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I do not think it is 
proper...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...that while a witness is testifying for 
20 
counsel to try and explain the evidence before it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
in 
this 
particular 
case 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am just commenting on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  But in this particular case, I 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 209 of 383 
 
think here is a question of understanding and I think it 
throws light. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under normal circumstances, no.  But I 
think this is a question of understanding and ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I think it certainly has helped me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Chair, it is inquisitorial(?) 
10 
purposes(?)  [Speaker unclear]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair has all the controls.  Chair, what 
I – based on that understanding, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the impression - and I will it put it 
lighter – sought to be created – Mr Koko, then I am facing 
you, that you were entitled to R 2.17 billion as a penalty 
claim against Glencore for OCM, is incorrect. 
MR KOKO:   No, it is not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
No, 
just 
repeat 
that 
proposition, 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That the impression that he seeks to 
create that Eskom was entitled to pursue that claim of 
R 2.17 billion is incorrect. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 210 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because the claim would have had to 
be less by 158 point something million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, on that, I understand him to be 
saying ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says when you got - affidavit at the 
bottom of page 134. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You see ...[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 134. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that total of R 2.3 billion? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he is saying.  If Eskom sought to 
claim this amount from OCM ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...it 
would 
have 
been 
wrong 
...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because before they could claim they 
needed to deduct the R 158.3 million. 
MR KOKO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then what you get out of that is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 211 of 383 
 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Is two point one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is what they were entitled to. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I understand him to be 
saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And that is my wishes(?) to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us assume that is the – what – 
10 
says is the submission to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is incorrect, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   No, it is not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.  Shall we deal it with it 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is wrong with that? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What - show in his affidavit is that they 
did – and one has to read the paragraph before this table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what comes after that.  Now, let us 
read this paragraph.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 212 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because – and it emerges from 
Mr Moodley’s affidavit that Eskom was battling to give the 
correct calculations of the amount.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His battling.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he says then – let us read page 133 
at the bottom of the page.  He says” 
“As 
indicated 
above, 
in 
2015 
the 
request 
to 
10 
calculate the claim for the retrospective penalty 
which is commonly referred to as “the R 2.1 billion 
claim. 
The following table reflects the differences between 
the penalty that was initially applied for per quality 
parameters and the revised penalty that would have 
been applied using the interpretation that was 
agreed with CDH in 2015. 
The table below does not limit the total penalty to 
ton of delivered coal where the penalty amount 
20 
exceeds the total invoice value.  This is because 
the table is trying to illustrate the difference in 
penalty application per quality parameter for that 
which was originally applied when compared to that 
which should have been levied based on the revised 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 213 of 383 
 
interpretation.” 
And, 
Chair, 
you 
know, 
to 
emphasise 
that 
revised 
interpretation because you will see as he carries on in the 
next page: 
“Therefore, the total penalty in the table below will 
appear to be greater under commonly referred to 
2.1 billion penalty.” 
So he has not said this is the claim which …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, he has said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Koko, hang on, hang on. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the next page, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 135: 
“In 
an 
attempt 
to 
understand 
the 
differences 
between the original calculation and the revised 
calculation we took a sample of four transactions.” 
Now he is in the process of doing this and he is explaining 
to the Commission in his affidavit.  
“The four grey shaded invoices in the table above 
were reviewed to determine the major differences in 
20 
application of the original penalty and revised 
penalty calculations.  The reasons for these major 
variances 
will 
need 
to 
be 
obtained 
from 
the 
applicable coal supply unit manager and coal supply 
manager presiding over this contract during the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 214 of 383 
 
period.  The major reasons for the differences were 
found to be related to the following issues.” 
And he gives the reasons for the differences and it might 
important: 
“ Abrasive index..” 
Which (a) the first bullet point.   
“…from March 2012 till August 2013 was supplied at 
the 
base 
un-escalated, 
AI 
penalty 
price 
of 
addendum 2.  The revised …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not want us to spend too much time 
on this unless I know where it takes us in the end.  Mr 
Koko says the correct claim would have been R2,3 billion 
minus the R158,3 million.  Do you understand Mr Nagar to 
say something different and if so, what figure?  And if we 
look at the difference between the figure that Mr Koko says 
and the figure that maybe Mr Nagar says, where does it 
take us, what difference does it make, in terms of what we 
are looking at? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the – you remember that the 
correctness or otherwise of the claim is on its own neither 
here nor there.  The whole question about the claim, as I 
understand it, is whether it was pursued for a certain 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 215 of 383 
 
agenda. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that agenda, if there is a difference 
of 1 million between Mr Nagar says was the correct amount 
and the amount that Mr Koko says, I am not sure if it would 
make a difference, but I just want us to keep an eye on 
where – on the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And, Chair, you come to that 
agenda, if I use that word, by seeing that there were 
concerns raised by the amount or in respect of the amount 
10 
which amount, as Mr Koko says, or which concerns were 
the same throughout but the adjustment only gets to be 
done must later when Glencore OCM is no longer in the 
picture.  Chair, to accelerate it, Mr Sinhau(?) does not say 
2.3 billion, look at page 139 and he will tell you what the 
potential claim was.  Paragraph 7.8.  139, 7.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because those tables are postulating 
to get to the right scenario of an amount.  He says: 
“On or around 13 March 2017 I was requested by 
20 
Ms Daniels to sign a memo as finance support for 
the settlement of the penalty claim.” 
Now that – the settle is at 577 million.  He says: 
“Upon review of the document there was no link in 
the memo to the potential total claim/value that was 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 216 of 383 
 
due to Eskom.” 
And there he gives you the potential claim.  1.1, if I round 
it off, R1.17 billion which …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I round it off, R1.17 billion which he 
repeats in …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where do you get 7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I round it off, Chair.  It is 1.166. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   He will repeat it again in paragraph 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is 1,1 billion, is it not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He will repeat it in paragraph 7.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And I read the last, last sentence 
there: 
“I then signed as supported on 14 March 2017 in 
terms of …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see before that he says: 
“I was also uncomfortable…”: 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    
“…to support the memo as I was not part of the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 217 of 383 
 
settlement negotiations and the memo did not refer 
to any of the calculations that we had performed.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
“On 13 March 2017 I sent an email to Ms Daniels 
attached 
as 
annexure 
SM 
13 
wherein 
I 
recommended a comment to be added to paragraph 
1 under financial implications attached as annexure 
SN1 3A.  The purpose of the comment was to 
provide context to the potential claim/value at hand 
10 
and the potential value that was being given.  The 
purpose was also to link the financial quantum in 
the document to the calculations that my team had 
performed.  Ms Daniels replied ot me on the 
following day being 14 March 2017 wherein she 
wanted 
clarity 
on 
the 
comment. 
 
She 
further 
indicated that she took Mr Singh through the 
document the previous day to finalise the matter on 
the same day, being 14 March 2017.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you will see in the next 
20 
paragraph and Chair I will read the very last sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, it may be important Chair will 
read the other ones because there he repeats this 158 
million which was a duplication, already deducted, he says.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 218 of 383 
 
You see against: 
“Already deducted for the period March 2012 to May 
2015 and that the parties have set out the terms of 
the settlement agreement to be signed between the 
parties and make an order of the arbitration which I 
was requested to sign by Ms Daniels.” 
But this is the one I wanted to bring to your attention: 
“I then signed and supported on 14 March 2017 in 
terms of the calculations as described in the memo 
and to reflect the total amount of the claim of 1.17 
10 
billion.” 
Now that is what he has referred to as the potential claim, 
so – and Chair, that is the one aspect of it, which… 
CHAIRPERSON:   So where does it take us, what is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the potential claim according to Ms 
Nihau (sic) is not what Mr Koko says it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is 2.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, 2.3 in that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Koko says from 2.3 billion you 
must deduct 158,3 million. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So get to the correct claim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what Mr Koko says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the 158 million but you 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 219 of 383 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 158,3 million he says must be 
deducted from the R2,3 billion claim in order to arrive at 
the correct claim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, well which claim is going to arrive 
at, Mr Koko? 
CHAIRPERSON:   2.1.  That is what he said.  I did not do 
the calculations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is not going to be 2.1. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, can I help you, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Otherwise you are going to sit here all night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Because I do not even think Mr Seleka 
understands what he tries to make you understand.  Let me 
do.  Please go to bundle 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15(a) page 138. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that (c) or (b)? 
MR KOKO:   (a). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   (a)? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just proceed, say what it says and then 
we will take it from there. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have given you a table in -  it is my 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 220 of 383 
 
main affidavit which I have been dying to talk to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And it deal with the claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page number? 
MR KOKO:   Page 138. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is bundle 15(a) page 138.  Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am going to try to go through this 
quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It starts at paragraph 490. 
10 
MR KOKO:   490, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you say the heading: 
“Value 
of 
Eskom’s 
penalty 
claim 
against 
OCM/Tegeta.” 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    
“Eskom’s 
R2,17 
billion 
penalty 
claim 
was 
overstated.” 
Ja, okay, continue. 
MR KOKO:    
20 
“The 
fundamental 
point 
of 
difference 
between 
Eskom 
original 
penalty 
calculations 
and 
OCM 
calculations was a treatment of the size and 
parameter in the calculation of a penalty claim.” 
Very important.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 221 of 383 
 
“How do we treat the sizing parameters in the 
calculations of the claim?  I have summarised the 
difference in the table below.” 
That 
has 
been 
confirmed 
by 
Mr 
Sinhau 
before 
the 
Commission.  That is a number that Mr Seleka is talking 
about, the 1.17.  And the point is, I am simply saying Mr 
Seleka is not putting that in proper context and I am trying 
to do that here and if Mr Seleka had read my affidavit he 
would have known that my position is not where he puts me 
in because is here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So, if you go to the table, you will see I put 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says: 
“Penalties deduced in the period March 2012 to May 
2014 158,3 million.” 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but I make it two columns, I say 
penalties including sizing parameters, penalties including 
sizing and penalties excluding sizing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I have got two columns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So I am saying if you stay with the penalties 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 222 of 383 
 
including sizing, the penalties in the period March 2012 I 
put it as: 
“Penalties allegedly due but were not deducted 
between March 2012 and May 2014 is R1.4 billion 
including penalties.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And it is 634 million excluding penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:    
“Penalties due but were not deducted in the period 
10 
June 2014 and May 2015 is 744 million versus 409 
excluding penalties.” 
You will see Mr Gert Opperman’s number is 720. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And then you will see I am saying the Eskom 
value of the penalty claim is 2.17 including penalties and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Including sizing. 
MR KOKO:   Including sizing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   and it is 1.2 excluding sizing and I put an 
asterisk there and say: 
“In the Suzanne Daniels’ memo of 13 March” 
Which Mr Seleka is referring to, that signed value is 1.17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 223 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   So you see whether we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where you stand, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Where the 1.17 raises what Mr Seleka is 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Right, so there is a proper context to that.  It 
is simple, it is clear, do you include penalties? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or do you exclude? 
MR KOKO:   Or do you exclude penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   If you exclude penalties the 2.17 becomes 
1.17, it is as simple as that.  Chair, I need to proceed.  
492: 
“The 
Eskom 
finance 
in 
around 
March 
2017 
recalculated the amount of the penalty claims 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you reading from now? 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 492. 
CHAIRPERSON:   492, okay, ja.   
“Eskom finance in around March 2017…” 
20 
Continue. 
MR KOKO:    
“…recalculated the amount of the penalties owing to 
Eskom to be 117 billion for March 2012 to May 2015 
and they stated that the basis of the calculation 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 224 of 383 
 
could be verified but the interpretation is still in 
question.  What was not in question at the time was 
that the penalties had been calculated to exclude 
the penalties relating to size in parameters.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now of course here you talk about 
penalties and penalties.  The penalties, when you talk 
about excluding or including are the size in penalties. 
MR KOKO:   The size in parameters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because everything is penalties, ja. 
MR KOKO:   yes, yes, when you exclude the sizing then 
10 
get to 1.17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But, Chair, remember, there is no legitimate 
reason why you should exclude them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   There is no reason why they were excluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And this is what I am asking and begging your 
that your investigators should dig deeper into why the size 
in 
parameter 
were 
not 
– 
were 
excluded 
when 
the 
20 
agreement …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Includes them. 
MR KOKO:   Includes them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I need to conclude this because we are 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 225 of 383 
 
on penalties now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I am going to read maybe a bit further, 
paragraph 494, I am saying: 
“The difficulty with the 1.17 billion that remained 
was that it included the 634 million of penalty 
claims 
that 
were 
allegedly 
due 
but 
were 
not 
deducted in March 2012 payments.  The calculation 
of Eskom finance team were the effect that the 
penalty claims excluding sizing parameters in the 
10 
period March 2012 were 792 million.  Only one 158 
million of that had been deducted.” 
That is where the 158 comes from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, 494, the most important: 
“I could be given or find no cogent or valid reason 
why the penalty amount of 634 million was not 
deducted from the payment during the March ’12 
and March ’14.” 
I still cannot find a reason why. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be the – would that be 
because of the suspension that you talked about? 
MR KOKO:   That is what they talked about, they say it 
was suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 226 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so that if that suspension happened, 
this is the amount that was not deducted because of that. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes, excluding sizing parameters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sizing penalties were deducted. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, what I am saying, if you exclude 
sizing parameters the number is 634 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   If you including the sizing parameters to be 
1.4 billion. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   So when they say they suspended, they had 
no authority to suspend the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I just want to finish this.  Paragraph 
496: 
“Ms Daniels was running the arbitration proceedings 
regarding the OCM penalties in which Tegeta had 
become the respondent.  I requested Ms Daniels 
and Mr Vusi Mboweni to try to find the necessary 
20 
supporting documents in terms of which Eskom 
would establish its penalty claim of 634 million 
excluding sizing parameter for the period March 
2012.  CDH had in paragraph 1.6 of the MMK55…” 
Which is a legal opinion, I have it open, I will take you to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 227 of 383 
 
it. 
“…state that Eskom had no such document.  I 
wanted to be assured in particular that Eskom had 
notified OCM of its failure to comply with the coal 
parties’ specifications of the calculations of the 
penalties 
or 
payments 
in 
the 
period 
March 
2012/2016. This is a requirement of clause 9.6 of 
the contract…” 
And that you will find in the MMK55, I will take you to and I 
write in paragraph 4.8 verbatim what 7 4.8 verbatim what 7 
10 
9.6 say, Chair. 
So wall what I am saying to you, on the basis of the 
advice given to me, we will find it in MK55, it is bundle 15.  
It is in 15(b), page 873. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do I have two 15(a)s, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I would not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no, I am sorry, the one 18(a), not 
15, ja.  Okay, you want us to go to 15(a)? 
MR KOKO:   15(a) page 873. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:     Yes.  I sincerely apologise, Chair, 15(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   15(b)? 
MR KOKO:   15(b) page 873. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you must take the 18 as well.  
15(b) what page? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 228 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   873. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is a memorandum from CDH directed 
to Ms Suzanne Daniels, it is dated 10 March 2017: 
“Subject:  Consideration for purpose of settlement 
discussions with Optimum Coal Mine.” 
Chair, I refer you to paragraph 1.3. 
“The issues of concern relating to the claim has 
always been, amongst others, the following.” 
And this issues have – if you read the CDH legal advice, 
10 
you will find the same issues in 2013, same issues in 2014, 
same 2015, they actually cut the paragraph.  They even cut 
the footnote, cut and paste the footnote. 
“Eskom 
compliance 
with 
all 
the 
contractual 
requirements in terms of the CSA and addenda.  
Process 9.6 and 3.4.3 of the first addendum to 
inform OCM on monthly basis of the failure to 
comply with the quality specification including such 
calculations of the penalty to be deducted from the 
month’s invoices.” 
20 
So you will see we have dealt with this before.  You will 
see even the footnote is a cut and paste.  So this memo 
was simply telling me that Mr Koko, you have not complied 
3.4.3 of the first addendum and they did not mention 
anything about 3.4.2 of the first addendum and you did not 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 229 of 383 
 
comply with 9.6 so you – and there no documentations and 
you have got difficulty in your claim and when you do that, 
Chair, and my paragraph on 15(a) 141, you will see I quote 
9.6 verbatim and then I come to the figure of 577.  Now 
577, Chair, if you go back to page 198 on the same bundle, 
15(a) and – Chair, that paragraph 490 becomes very 
important and that table… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your affidavit, I think she has opened 
the CDH letter.  490, okay, I have got it, page 138. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  So that table I tried to summarise in 
10 
simple ways.  So now I said to him) you have not deducted 
penalties since 2014.  So I am going to be consistent with 
that so then I am going to be dealing with column B, it is 
the column on the right hand side, penalties without sizing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, excluding sizing parameters. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, right.  And that is 1.17 Mr Seleka was 
talking about.  So now I am saying penalties allegedly due 
but not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you say 1.7? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have it as 1.2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1.2 that is what is in the table, ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have it as 1.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But you will see my footnote. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 230 of 383 
 
MR KOKO:   This is my calculations, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So they have the 1.17 and I could not find a 
reason of difference between my 1.2 and my 1.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But I did not want to be tied up to 1.7, Chair, 
cannot explain, so that is why I put the same numbers 
there.  So if you say the penalties due were not deducted 
in March 2012 to 2013 is that 624 million excluding sizing 
and that is a value that is affected by clause 9.6 of the 
10 
contract.  So that is the value at risk that we could not 
motivate for.  So I am going to put that to zero, I am going 
to assume I am going to lose that because of 9.6.  The 
number that we are then left with, it is 577, that is where 
we settled on.  That is how I signed off on the 577 million.  
I had no agenda, I was driven by the document before you 
– before me that I am sharing with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  That, Chair, has to 
be looked at against the memorandum provided by CDH 
20 
which, Chair, we traversed during the evidence of Ms 
Suzanne Daniels because they do refer to those clauses 
including 3.4.3, not 2, but 3 which the Chair wanted to go 
back to in that agreement and that is the clause that deals 
with the monthly calculation of the amounts that you 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 231 of 383 
 
notified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well maybe let us talk about what I 
wanted to raise namely what was the point you had in mind 
when you said Mr Koko had not read that part of the 
paragraph that is highlighted or that paragraph. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I did not recall him reading it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I was saying is what was the 
point about it, what was the significance of the paragraph, 
10 
of the clause as you saw it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, thank you, Chair, because it 
is exactly where we are now.  Which is Eskom needed to 
comply still with that in order to provide OCM with how 
they will calculate the penalties and the information as set 
out in that clause on a monthly basis.  It says monthly in 
arrears, so the end of the month after the coal is supplied.  
So that still retained the obligation on the part of Eskom to 
that exercise because what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the effect of not doing that 
20 
exercise? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is then what you see here in 
CDH’s opinion to Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is that: 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 232 of 383 
 
“Eskom’s 
compliance 
with 
all 
the 
contractual 
requirements in terms of the CSA and addenda and 
then they refer to clause 9.6 of the CSA and 3.4.3 
of the second addendum to inform Optimum on a 
monthly basis of its failure to comply with the 
quality specification including such calculation of 
the penalty to be deduced on a monthly basis.” 
They say: 
“It is one of the factors to be noted that the 
enforcement of Eskom’s accrued rights by action or 
10 
arbitration is subject.” 
Now what ultimately happens Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what do they say is the effect 
of Eskom not doing this monthly? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The advice they gave Eskom – the – 
well not the advice, the concern they raised with Eskom 
which is the concern the BTC also raised with those who 
came to BTC ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that in Eskom failing to do that 
Eskom, or the executive seems to have waved the enforce 
– the entitlement to enforce…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   But they are wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whatever…[intervene] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 233 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   That line is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no hang on Mr Koko.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, I am telling what to receive from 
the 
person 
that 
Eskom 
seems 
to 
have 
waived 
the 
entitlement to enforce those penalties.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They raised those concerns, Chairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, to the extent that Eskom had waived 
what the claims for those penalties, failure to comply with 
10 
those monthly - to advise Optimum coal colliery monthly in 
arrears of the manner in which such penalties would have 
been calculated.  Were they saying that that failure, failure 
to do that amounted to a waiver of what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It seems to have been a waiver of 
Eskom’s - either the entitlement or the intention to enforce 
those. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, how do they put it, do you have it 
there in your opinion, I am not sure where it is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The waiver issue was a concern of the 
20 
BTC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the lawyers what do they say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The CDA says, and I am on the second 
opinion. It says: 
“It should however, be noted that the enforcement 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 234 of 383 
 
of Eskom’s accrued rights are action arbitration is 
subject to the following.   
One: 
“Rectification of Clause 3.6 of the first addendum 
as 
Eskom 
and 
Optimum 
has 
opposing 
interpretations relating to the manner in which 
payment reduction should be calculated.” 
Two: 
“Eskom’s 
compliance 
with 
all 
the 
contractual 
requirements in terms of the CSA and addendum.” 
10 
And I have read this one, Clause 9.6 of the CSA and 3.4.4 
of the second addendum: 
“To inform Optimum on a monthly basis of its failure 
to comply with the quality specification including 
such calculation of the penalty to be deducted from 
the monthly invoice.” 
And then three is the prescription of such portions of the 
plane, not state in time, but they raised this concerns, 
Chair. Ultimately…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether do they advise their lawyers, 
20 
they are being paid for this opinion, what was their legal 
advice of what it means what the effect is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the ultimate advice is in the fifth 
opinion, which Mr Koko was reading, in their advice and 
acting on Eskom’s information received from Eskom is that 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 235 of 383 
 
the amount that was claimed - that was not claimed for 
should be abandoned.  That is what ultimately happened, 
then there was amounts regarding sizing specifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us, let us just stop there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That - what does that contribute to in the 
investigation of this because I understood the issue of the 
claim to be, to say Eskom was as against Glencore, Eskom 
was strict in its approach in demanding this high amount, 
because there was a certain agenda namely to pressurise 
10 
OCM to agree to sale to Tegeta.  But when Glencore got 
out of the PHR and it was Tegeta the attitude changed on 
the part of Eskom and it as no longer so strict because 
Tegeta they had, it is part of whatever of the agenda.  They 
did not want to enforce the whole claim against Tegeta that 
is why they settled on a very low amount compared to the 
amount they were pursuing against Tegeta.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I have looked at it slightly 
differently Chair, on the first leg.  On the first leg the way - 
because I have tried to keep it to the facts is that despite 
20 
the concerns raised by CDH, Eskom forced our heads to 
seek to enforce the 2.17billion against OCM. 
Now, what is the reason?  We can then speculate 
the ulterior motives I know that is what the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee has made a finding on, which is what 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 236 of 383 
 
the Chairperson is saying to force OCM out.  But I think 
what I have tried to restrict myself to is the evidence 
before the Chairperson, which is, here are the opinions 
that were given from 2013.  They raised this concerns, why 
did you still forge ahead with the 2.17billion and only 
capitulate when you are now squaring off with Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see, they could have forged 
ahead without an agenda, they could have forged ahead 
because maybe they do not agree with their lawyers, or 
they were taking their chances.  So it becomes important to 
10 
know whether we are looking at the issue of whether they 
were acting in pursuit of some agenda or whether it may 
have just been differences of approaches or differences of 
opinions or not agreeing with lawyers without an agenda. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but if the Chair is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, there is no evidence from any of 
the witnesses, that they did not agree with the lawyers.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That they did not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That they did not agree with the 
20 
lawyers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In fact, the lawyers were raising 
concerns 
saying 
give 
me 
information. 
You 
give 
me 
information so that I can verify the merits of your claim. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 237 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But then those who have come before, 
what have they said about -  if they agreed with the 
lawyers concerns, what did they say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, we know from the evidence of Ms 
Daniels that this concerns, according to well, I led her, I do 
not know about those who were here in phase one that 
these – in her affidavit, that these concerns were raised 
with Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Brian Molefe.  I think she also 
10 
mentions Mr Koko…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember, you are supposed to 
know that evidence in phase one is one of…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think I am going drop dead Chair 
before, the amount of information is so staggering. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but you remember, I said to you 
even if you come after other people, you need to know 
what happened before because you cannot divorce it from 
what you are dealing with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so her evidence is that they were 
20 
shown this concerns but they did not heed the concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but if they do not heed the concerns, 
provided there is no agenda.  How does it get into what we 
are looking at? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the agenda is what you infer, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 238 of 383 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, but what I am saying is why do 
we – why must we bother to look to inquire into why they 
did not follow their lawyer ’s advice for our purposes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yeah I want to put it to Mr – 
because I am not I am not finish, I want to put it to Mr 
Koko let me hear what he has to say because that has not 
been put to him, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before you put it to him I want to 
know whether we should spend time on it, that is my - 
10 
whether we should spend time on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright, let me say to the Chairperson, 
Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Let 
me 
say 
you 
see, 
on 
my 
understanding or as far as this Tegeta, OCM issues are 
concerned.  If it was simply a commercial transaction 
between parties involved in business and whatever I am 
not interested in why Eskom personal did not agree with 
their lawyers, if it remains at that, it is none of the 
Commission's business.  
20 
But if there is an allegation, as I understand it - I 
understand there to be that Eskom in effect was assisting 
Tegeta to acquire OCM and using the penalty, the claim for 
penalties to try and put pressure on OCM/Glencore and 
make it difficult for them to continue operating so that they 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 239 of 383 
 
would then sell to Tegeta, then I am interested. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when it comes to this issue then I am 
saying simply because the relevant people at Eskom might 
not have done what their lawyers said that on its own is 
neither here nor there for me unless it links up with the 
allegation that Eskom or Eskom personal where assist 
being in effect, Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise, they can disagree with their 
10 
lawyers as much as they want I am not interested but if 
that disagreement is not a genuine one, but it is because it 
is part of an agenda, then I am interested. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair because that you only come 
to that conclusion if you add the second leg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is what I want to canvass then 
with Mr Koko in the second leg is exactly when Tegeta 
comes into the picture.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is - how do you then treat Tegeta 
differently from OCM?  So that is what I want to put to Mr 
Koko and he well, as I say put – ask Mr Koko about and he 
can explain himself to the Chairperson, because we have 
not heard his explanation on that because the inference 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 240 of 383 
 
arises only from second leg of it.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
there 
could 
be 
inconsistent 
treatment that is not connected to an agenda.  There could 
be an inconsistent treatment, so the inconsistency could be 
connected with an agenda but it could also not be, it might 
not also be.  So - but we are at 5 o'clock now.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We - there is an evening session.  I want 
to see whether Mr Pretorius is here.  Oh, ja he is here, so 
we have to stop. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have not been asked to comment and 
I have got one-minute comment on what Mr Seleka has 
been saying, because after this we going to be told that we 
must write our responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I want to refer you back to Ms - I want 
to say to you, Eskom acted on advice from the very same 
CDH to terminate the cooperation agreement and the letter 
of demand was drafted by CDH, you saw that and the 
calculations was confirmed by CDH.  
20 
Chair if I can quote Rashavin[?] Moodley’s affidavit 
he says in paragraph 45.5.6 on his advice on the 17 t h of 
March 2015: 
“Should no agreement be reached between Eskom 
and 
OCM 
to 
stain 
prescription 
or 
Eskom 
not 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 241 of 383 
 
institute proceedings every month it would forfeit 
R15million.” 
So that is the motive, that is a motive but Chair I want 
also…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you referred to that part earlier 
as well.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, so Eskom stood to forfeit according to 
the advice of CDH R15million a month, if we did not 
terminate the cooperation agreement, institute arbitration 
proceedings and issue a letter of demand.  But Chair on 
10 
the 16 t h of March 2021, day 361 Ms Daniels was testified 
on this topic and she said to you, you asked and she says, 
Ms Daniels says on page 11: 
“Mr Chairman, the issues were there from the 
beginning in terms of the basis of calculations of 
the claim. You will see from the opinion submitted 
attached on to Mr Moodley’s affidavit from CDH, 
that in 2015, there were already issues before the 
issuing of the summons, before the mention of the 
claim.  I think even Mr Bester testified that there 
20 
was - he was sceptical as to the amount.  He raised 
the risks with Mr Molefe and they were ignored.  I 
was not, there is some grammar issues there.  I was 
not involved in the matter at that time, I recall being 
called into one meeting with myself, Mr Bester, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 242 of 383 
 
Advocate Tulanka[?]  who was the head of legal at 
the time.  Mr Moodley and we - they did explain, the 
three of them explained to Mr Molefe and Mr Koko, 
that, 
you 
know, 
these 
were 
the 
issues 
and 
notwithstanding that explanation from the three 
people involved in the matter, they were either 
meant to go ahead with the institution of the claim.” 
Mr Seleka then asked; 
“Can you recall exactly when was that?” 
Ms Daniels answers: 
10 
“The meeting was in 2015, I think it would have 
been around early 2015 because there was a 
meeting scheduled for Glencore around - about the 
same time.” 
Now Chair, I showed you a memorandum of Mr Tulanka[?] it 
is addendum 12, where Mr Tulanka[?] actually authorises 
contrary to Ms Daniels.  When you asked Ms Daniels in 
December, and I looked for it but I could not find it but I 
know you asked her.  You said to Ms Daniels, but Ms 
Daniels you knew of the opinions of CDH, why did you in 
20 
December 2013 go and ask for another one, when you had 
it already? 
She could not answer you, but what I want to tell 
you again, is that on the time that she says I was briefed 
by Mr Tulanka[?] I was on suspension.  So I could not have 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 243 of 383 
 
been briefed.  So Mr Seleka cannot lie on her history of 
very quickness.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, is not his favourite words.  Mr 
Seleka do you want to say something otherwise, we will 
adjourn and then I think questions will have to be done in 
writing and then answers given. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, well, I just wanted to correct the 
date of Ms Daniels request for an opinion.  I think that was 
in 2015. 
MR KOKO:   2015, December Chair. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, not ‘13.  
MR KOKO:   But when you asked her in 2015 December 
why did you…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Koko, hang on, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, Chair that is what I wanted to 
correct, something else but I think the documents will 
speak for themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  We are going to in terms 
of the way forward or as previously agreed, I think 
whatever questions we had for Mr Koko we will put them in 
20 
writing, that will be sent to his legal team and then Mr 
Koko will then respond to those by way of an affidavit. 
That is one, two also in terms of what we have 
agreed another affidavit may be submitted by Mr Koko's 
legal team, where they will clarify whatever issues Mr 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 244 of 383 
 
Barry may have wish to clarify in re-examination, that is in 
order, Mr Barry? 
ADV BARRY SC:   As you please, Chairman that affidavit 
will 
to 
some 
extent 
be 
simply 
a 
repetition 
of 
the 
supplementary affidavit in many respects, but adding to it 
facts that have come out in these proceedings, and that 
have now come to the fore that we were not aware of at the 
time that that affidavit was presented.  
So the point that I am simply making is there is 
going to be some repetition, but it will make logical sense 
10 
in respect of being by way of reply to what has been raised 
in the questioning of Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Let us fix some deadlines 
by when can you let them have your questions? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and I wanted to explain to the 
Chairperson, because I know that Mr Koko has dealt with 
the issues in his affidavits.  The questions that were 
arising were in relation to put in the version mainly of other 
witnesses, which he has sought to address in his affidavit. 
So I will have to look at his affidavit and see whether is he 
20 
dealing with everything yeah – so it is not your key 
accounts from my side to send him questions when I know 
the themes are already addressed in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so how much time would you, 
need to. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 245 of 383 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I am…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in terms of what you wanted to ask 
him today I guess, did you exhaust that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the submissions 1.6billion it is 
not questions that he did not address in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So in terms of what you wanted 
him to deal with, he has dealt with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In his affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in oral evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not yet, we did not get to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But obviously, he stands by his affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so as that should be the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, if there is something because 
he does not have to repeat everything that is in the 
affidavits, some of the things are non-controversial.  So, 
whatever questions you want to ask would relate to what?  
Putting versions from other people because if those other 
people have put up affidavits, he would have been given 
20 
those affidavits and he would have responded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why would you need to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I mean, the type of questions, Chair 
we would ask which you would not find in his affidavit that 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 246 of 383 
 
one we address, the reason for engaging the DMR 
particularly Mr Duo Repella in the emails, his explanation 
of the submission to the Board.  I know his dealt with it in 
the affidavit the Board has a different view, I mean, one 
would have wanted to know from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we say you have until Wednesday, 
next week, that gives you eight days. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It notionally gives me a – you know 
how I am strictly involved in other matters.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I do not want them to be late 
10 
with their response, you see because we are running out of 
time. So let me give you up to the end of the day on 
Wednesday to let them have it, if there is a serious 
problem you can request an extension but I really want - 
would like you to deal with that because remember, Mr 
Koko was here for the 10 t h day so he has been around.  
So there should not be a lot that has not been 
canvassed and then, Mr Barry, can I then say you file your 
response, Mr Koko's affidavit on or before the 10 t h of June.  
Is that is fine? 
20 
ADV BARRY SC:   Yes, that should be fine, can we then 
assume Mr Chairman that Mr Koko does not have to appear 
here again?  Because what needs to be avoided is this 
thing and then he testifies, then they go back to the same 
witnesses, because I just want to point out I intend to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 247 of 383 
 
retire at the end of 2023.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he will not appear, he will not come 
back to give oral evidence. 
ADV BARRY SC:   So very well, and then there is a further 
aspect about the procedure going on because while sitting 
here, I have heard of the Evidence Leaders say that they 
are going to argue this that and the other and then there is 
the issue in terms of the rules that if we want to put in a 
written submission you have to give us consent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, you may start working if you 
10 
have not yet started already on written submissions. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Are we going to see the submissions 
that are going to be made to you by the Evidence Leaders? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if they are going to make written 
submissions, there is no reason why you should not see 
them but I would not want you to wait for them.  So what I 
would like is that you give us what your own submissions 
are, if and when there’s become available, they should be 
made available and if necessary, you can supplement. 
ADV BARRY SC:   But from the perspective of the rules 
20 
you give us leave to make submissions in writing.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, I am. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Because have that is the requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am, ja.  So I would like to have that by 
20 June, can you do that?  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 248 of 383 
 
ADV BARRY SC:   That makes it a bit difficult, but we will 
try our best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will try your best, thanks. 
ADV BARRY SC:   But it depends on how things obviously 
develop for you, in terms of when you have to bring these 
proceedings, the live proceedings to an end.  Thank you, 
though, we will do our best to serve, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Seleka you want to say 
something? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, something unrelated is the – and 
10 
I 
should 
have 
reminded 
the 
Chairperson 
about 
the 
application to cross examine Mr Koko.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes the application, I completely 
forgot about that, that is the only part Mr Barry that I had 
forgotten. I must decide Eskom’s application so if Mr Koko 
is to come back, it would only be if I granted that 
application, but it would not be out of the Commission's 
decision to say that the Commission wants him back.  
ADV BARRY SC:   Very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to try and look at that 
20 
application and make a decision in the next day or two.  
ADV BARRY SC:   Thank you, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are done Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am done, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Koko, thank 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 249 of 383 
 
you, Mr Barry and your instructing attorney.  Thank you, Mr 
Seleka and your junior investigators, we will now adjourn 
the day session and then now we will resume after 15 
minutes with the evening session.   
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good evening Mr Pretorius, good evening 
everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Evening Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good evening Mr Mahlobo. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Evening, evening Deputy Chief Justice and 
Dada Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair before we begin with Mr 
Mahlobo Dorothy when she gave evidence placed on record 
three documents.  The third was not admitted as an Exhibit 
so may I ask you to admit the transcript of her interview with 
the SSA investigators as YY12.3 it is at page 522.1 and 
following of SSA2(a). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page of Bundle 2(a). 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  522.1 
CHAIRPERSON:  522.1.  This is her interview with? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With whom? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 250 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  With the SSA internal investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It starts from 522.2 actually. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to where?  Is it up to the end – no it not 
up to the end.  Well if you go. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  5. – 522.98. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  And that would be admitted as 
Exhibit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  YY12.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transcript of the interview between 
10 
Dorothy and the SSA Investigators. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Internal Investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Internal Investigators which starts at page 
533.2 and goes up to 522.98 will be admitted as Exhibit 
YY12.3. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MAHLOBO:  My name is Mbangiseni David Mahlobo. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I think start afresh because your 
mic was not working. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MAHLOBO:  It is Mbangiseni David Mahlobo. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 251 of 383 
 
prescribed oath? 
MR MAHLOBO:  No objections. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MAHLOBO:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR MAHLOBO:  So help me God. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Mahlobo the purpose of your 
evidence this evening is to respond to evidence that has 
been led or will be led before the commission in relation to 
two issues.  
 
Firstly is allegations concerning your involvement in 
the operational activities of the SSA and the second is 
allegations concerning deliveries of cash to you in relation to 
20 
the operations of the SSA. 
 
So if I may go to the first topic and invite you to look 
at the affidavit of Mr Y which appears in Bundle SSA02(a).   
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess Mr Mahlobo is represented by the 
same legal team as previously? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 252 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I understand so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to have that on record.  Is that 
correct? 
ADV ADONIS:  Good evening Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good evening. 
ADV ADONIS:   That is correct Lehlohonolo Peter Adonis 
still representing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ADONIS:   The witness. Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to Bundle 2(a) at page 101.  
And I would like to refer you to paragraphs 6.33 and 6.34.  
This is the affidavit of Mr Y.  And if you go – he deals there 
with Operation Lock which involved a safe house and 
protection in regard to Mr Eugene De Kock.  In paragraph 
6.34 he says: 
“The reason for the Chief Directorate Special 
Operations assuming responsibility for Mr De 
Kock who was coded as Mr Lock apparently 
arose from concerns about his continued 
20 
links to right wing groupings.” 
We need not deal with that allegation but the next one is 
important. 
“Minister Mahlobo was reported to have had 
close 
personal 
involvement 
with 
this 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 253 of 383 
 
operation. 
 
Indeed 
Frank 
informed 
the 
investigation 
team 
that 
tensions 
arose 
between Ambassador Dlomo and Minister 
Mahlobo 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
Minister’s 
continued access to Mr De Kock.” 
Do you have any comment? 
MR MAHLOBO:  Well thank you very much Chair DCJ Baba 
[?] and Mr Pretorius.  The last time we interacted before I 
make this comment Chair. 
 
I had made an appeal before and I am going to make 
10 
it.  There is something that I said we should – be careful to – 
not to do it wittingly or unwittingly.   
 
The law does not allow anybody especially when it 
comes to issues of intelligence or counter intelligence.  
When it comes to covert operation that you can disclose any 
of a person.  And whether you look at your National Strategic 
Intelligence Act – whether the Oversight Act is very clear.  I 
will have preferred those who were assisting Mr Pretorius to 
declassify information Chair. 
 
That they should not have used the name of the 
20 
person that is being used here.  But I do not want to get into 
– into those details.  But I want to put it on record because it 
is illegal and the – later on if I am requested to – to give you 
specifics in law the law has not been changed.  It  has not 
been changed because even this commission itself it can 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 254 of 383 
 
discuss 
any 
other 
matter 
or 
policy, 
irregularities 
but 
immediately you start to name people that were involved in 
operation is a big no. 
 
And as I said when we were asked by the ANC and 
President to come here some of the blind spots I must raise 
them and I would prefer that going forward you can refer 
maybe to the project name because the name does not 
necessarily mean what it is written there it is a 00:10:02. 
 
But if you are going to call people’s names (speaking 
in vernacular) problem I will have a difficulty.  But on the 
10 
matter that is been raised on 6.34 I have responded even 
before here.  The Minister has never been involved in 
operations.  Inasmuch as in South Africa there is no law that 
precludes executive authorities Chair to deal with certain 
issues. 
 
In this specific matter the answer it is a big no.  
There are some of the projects we know I will not get into 
their details I will never do that.  There were certain 
instances where there were problems.  And when there are 
problems, problems get to be raised to the Minister or they 
20 
get to be raised to the President or they are raised by 
members of Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.   
 
The Ministries office only came in to assist where 
there was a problem but it never ran its operations.  That is 
the answer I will give.  But if someone Baba [?] started to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 255 of 383 
 
create an impression if you run an operation you are like a 
project manager we are full time running that.   
 
This thing of people coming here and create an 
impression that someone was running this on a daily basis it 
is a big no.  But on this one Mr Pretorius the answer is no 
but I know of this operation there were challenges and the 
office of the Ministry had to come in and do an intervention 
monitor that the disputes that were existed between the 
project manager and the asset I will not call their names and 
the asset they were resolved because there were big issues.  
10 
They were even in the media.  And to do monitoring and to 
do support by the office of the executive it is not illegal.  
That is my responsibility.  But to say we ran the operation it 
is not true. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well the allegation is not that you ran 
the operation Mr Mahlobo the allegation is that you were 
reported to have had close personal involvement with this 
operation.  Do I understand problems arose in the execution 
of this operation and you – and your office did become 
involved in sorting out those problems?  Is that correct? 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:  I think I need to help to Mr Pretorius so that 
we will not spend the whole day about things that we must 
avoid when you want me to help the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What have you got there Mr Mahlobo? 
MR MAHLOBO:  Baba? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 256 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What have you got there? 
MR MAHLOBO:  No, no, no I just want to assist him because 
I do not want to – to get this thing to be long winded.  I will 
make a reference Chair to the Intelligence Oversight Act 40 
of 1994.  You will go to Section 4 and it talks about access 
to intelligence information and documentation.  And it says 
that when you handle information with security you must 
send that information within security guidelines. It also say 
that notwithstanding we shall not be obliged to disclose to 
the committee or any other committee the three things I said 
10 
to you the name or identity of any person or body engaged in 
intelligence or counter intelligence activities.   
ii. Any intelligence information or document in a form which 
could reveal the identity of any source of such intelligence 
information or document if that intelligence information or 
document was provided to such service under the express or 
implied assurance of confidentiality. 
The third point any intelligence or counter intelligence 
method and they underline the word Baba Zondo method 
employed by the service of such disclosure would reveal or 
20 
lead to the revelation of the name or the identity of any 
person or body engage intelligence or counter intelligence 
activities or the activities of the source of any intelligence 
information or document. 
 
I want to put this thing of law on record then come to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 257 of 383 
 
this matter that as far as being discussing operations I am 
now allowed to do it but in this case I am assisting because 
Mr Pretorius when he started an allegation is being made – 
two allegations he said today he wants to deal with. 
 
One allegation Minister for his office involved running 
operations.  That is the theme for today.  And then the 
second theme is us spending monies. 
 
I have responded to 6.34 the answer we never 
handled this operation but there was an incident where there 
were problems and the office of the Ministry came in. 
10 
 
I am not going to talk about the issues of people 
fighting they saying this and this the law does not actually 
allow me to do that.  But to help the commission for me it is 
suffice that we never ran this operation but for your record 
these are one of the intelligence operations that had 
challenges. 
 
When there were challenges where the – an oversight 
responsibility to resolve them and how we did it the 
methodology I cannot discuss it here Bab Zondo. 
 
But as I was saying I am not going to be saying 
20 
whether 
I 
had 
tension 
with 
Mr 
Dlomo 
or 
not 
even 
speculations no.  My answer we never ran this thing and 
there were challenges. My office came in and it is sufficient 
that we came in to be able to assist the project manager to 
resolve challenges. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 258 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that is precisely the question I 
put to you.  Capable of a yes or no answer not at all covered 
by the provisions of the Intelligence Act. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Bab Zondo to assist this process if Mr 
Pretorius is going to have an attitude I can give one back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no  
MR MAHLOBO:  He cannot speak to me like a child Bab [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no let us  
MR MAHLOBO:  I cannot allow it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us carry on.  Nobody wants to be in 
10 
breach of the law but where the law is not going to be 
breached, it is important that answers be given to legitimate 
questions.   
MR MAHLOBO:  Well Bab [?] I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Let us carry on on that basis. 
MR MAHLOBO:  But – but uncriticised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Bab [?] I know intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:  I am trained. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay let us – let us not… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let me put it – let me put one fact on 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The evidence that has been given to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 259 of 383 
 
date including the evidence and pursuant to that operation 
Lock issues has been cleared with the SSA, has been 
declassified and we have clarity on what we can and we 
cannot 
put 
before 
you 
Chair 
and 
we 
have 
acted 
in 
accordance with that.  So Mr Mahlobo you can rest assured 
that we are putting questions to you in accordance with 
evidence that has been cleared.  Either expressly by the 
acting DG of the SSA or by way of reference to declassified 
documents.  So I am going to give that assurance but I would 
like to make comment. 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:  (Speaking over Mr Pretorius.) 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I would like to move on from there. 
MR MAHLOBO:  But I want to come in on the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  No let us finish first.  Let him finish first.  
Mr Pretorius finish. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The question that I put to you before 
your answer now to the Chair was a straightforward 
question.  It was simply were – did you have a personal 
involvement with the operation and I understand your answer 
to be yes and you gave some explanation for it.  That is 
20 
sufficient for our purposes. 
MR MAHLOBO:  That is not my answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MAHLOBO:  You are putting an answer to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you wanted to say something earlier. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 260 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chairperson.  I want to say something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:  You see Bab Zondo it is very unfortunate 
that matters of intelligence must come here but if there is 
criminality it must dealt here.  Matters of intelligence are not 
discussed in this way.  But let me help because there are 
certain things that Mr Pretorius might think he is putting 
them on record they are correct which they are not correct. 
 
You know the last time I sat here I cooperated and 
assisted.  There was one documents remaining.  That 
10 
document had transcript from Project Veza and I said I am 
not going to deal with this document.  And ultimately where 
the law bear without were concluded probably I was 
misunderstood and never understood why I said I cannot 
deal with it. 
 
One of the thing that I must very grateful to your 
office is that this appearance today very clear I was sent 
documentation on time.  There was an indication what are 
the issues we are going to deal with.  I am happy with that.  
And they indicated here because I could see we can go all 
20 
over.  They indicated there are only four witnesses that I 
must respond to.   
 
In as much as Bab Zondo I had a reservation to do – 
to come here and respond to people who have not spoken.  
But I cooperated and I will do it.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 261 of 383 
 
 
But let me just help without taking too much of your 
time but it is an important matter.  You know the issues of 
classification and declassification.  One of the things some 
of these documents are here now. They have been sent to 
me and to my lawyers and if I am not disciplined, I will have 
leaked them. 
 
Guess what?  One of the thing that when you 
declassify you are not allowed by law in handling information 
or documentation to reveal the names of people.  To reveal 
the methodology and to reveal certain things.  You will see 
10 
Bab Zondo here in the transcript itself even in some of the 
people’s affidavits they have actually broken the doctrine in 
law of disclosing people’s names and methodology. 
 
This name that was mentioned at the beginning by my 
learned friend here Mr Pretorius was not supposed to 
happen.  And I will show you even when we go along I am 
shocked 
that 
those 
who 
were 
responsible 
to 
do 
the 
declassification I thought maybe it is an omission but I could 
see that there is a commission. 
 
One day here because someone wants to give a 
20 
particular narrative the name that is being mentioned under 
Project Lock is mentioned by name.  The law says you 
cannot.  Then another person who says more or less a 
similar characteristics that intelligence once worked with 
him.  No, no he is given a code name.  What I am trying to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 262 of 383 
 
do is that in as much as you want answers I will give 
answers to the best of my ability.  But I will disagree that the 
assurances that were given by SSA are correct.  
 
One you do not even – I have not even been 
furnished let me use this word with the declassification 
certificate. 
 
Whoever 
declassified 
there 
are 
certain 
conditions you put a certificate.  I have not been issued.  
The transcript that was supposed to deal with here today 
similarly they have names of people. Some they have chosen 
deliberately not to put them.  Guess what?  They are here.  
10 
They have been disclosed.  What will happen as an advice is 
that in as much as they have given assurance that they have 
declassified 
information 
they 
have 
still 
made 
certain 
mistakes here.  And I will want us when we handle this thing 
as my 00:24:09 leaders we avoid as far as possible getting 
into names, the methodology but ask difficult questions I am 
fine with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
MR MAHLOBO:  And then – but bear with me Bab Zondo if I 
answer the manner I answer it is because the answer is 
20 
mine.  For an example the point that Mr Pretorius was saying 
I had a personal involvement.  We must not twist words.  
Here the allegation made to me I ran operations.  What does 
it mean running operations?  And the answer that I am 
saying put it on record it is a no.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 263 of 383 
 
 
But in this instance I am saying on record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in paragraph 634. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The allegation was that you had a close 
personal involvement with the operation.  I think that is what 
Mr Pretorius sought to establish whether you – what your 
comment is on that. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No the answer is no Bab Zondo.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MAHLOBO:  You see let us not use semantics.  I know 
10 
English.  The allegation that are made by all these people 
that came here because I am responding to allegation even 
in the Rule 3.3 Notices.  You ran operations.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that might be maybe the overall 
… 
MR MAHLOBO:  And you could see here it is being used s 
clarity which is English personal involvement.  Then the next 
question what is the frequency of personal involvement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay look let us – I mean we are all 
agreed that nobody wants to – the law to be breached 
20 
number 1.  Mr Pretorius has made the point that the legal 
team took the trouble to make sure that the SSA could check 
whether information would be disclosed that should not be 
disclosed.  They might not have done their job properly as 
you see it from their side as well they have sought to try and 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 264 of 383 
 
make sure that … 
MR MAHLOBO:  They have not done a good job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as possible the – the law is adhered 
to. But let us proceed and make progress. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mahlobo the question 
I have is not a difficult one.  There may be difficult questions 
later but you have kindly agreed to answer those questions.  
What Mr Y said in his affidavit these are not our words they 
are the words of Mr Y.   
“Minister Mahlobo was reported to have had 
10 
close 
personal 
involvement 
with 
this 
operation.” 
Now if I may conclude.  Is that correct not correct?  It has 
got nothing to do with running the operation it talks about an 
involvement that you had. 
MR MAHLOBO:  You know what Chairperson who is Mr Y?  
Mr Y is a person who is making an allegation here who was 
in Project Veza.  He is not the person who dealt with me.  
How does he come and make this allegation and why should 
I be entertaining that?   
20 
2. These people of Project Veza here Bab Tiyane [?] they 
told you Project Veza is incomplete. They told you that they 
got hearsays – they do not have evidence.  They are still 
investigating.  To let the responding to Mr Y who is actually 
not actually saying that I have a personal involvement as a 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 265 of 383 
 
fact here and spend that time doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I though you already said no that is not 
(talking over one another). 
MR MAHLOBO:  No but I am asking the kind of how 
questions are being asked because everybody who is making 
an allegation be that I had a direct contact with Mr Y  Mr Y is 
putting this as a fact. Should the commission Bab Zondo be 
actually be attending to speculation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no 
MR MAHLOBO:  Because I have given the answer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you see because you were Minister 
of State Security you know that environment more than we 
know it.  The people – some of the people who have deposed 
to affidavits know that environment quite well I would 
imagine.  Now if anybody has information that may be 
relevant to our investigation it is important that they give it 
to the commission before the – so that the commission can 
look at that information before the commission completes its 
work. 
Now 
it 
may 
be 
that 
they 
are 
involved 
in 
an 
investigation 
that 
has 
not 
been 
completed 
but 
that 
20 
investigation might take much longer than the time – the time 
of the commission.  If the information is relevant to the 
Terms of Reference of the commission and they think it is – 
it could help the commission it is legitimate for them to put it 
but it is important that you be given a chance to say but Y 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 266 of 383 
 
never dealt with me so this is not the true position. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But let us - let us do this, so they tell 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   and have a smooth running. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Who was Y?  Y is the guy who never 
came to testify here.  He was in the Project Team.  He has 
comes here.  He speaks about information about what 
other people said.  Let us make an example because I can 
10 
read.   
“The 
reason 
for 
the 
CBSO 
assuming 
responsibility for Mr Something... 
 
I will not call a name. 
“...who was coded(?) as Lot(?), apparently 
rose from concern about his concerned(?) links 
to right-wing groupings. 
Minister Mahlobo was reported to have a close 
personal involved with the operation. 
Indeed, Frank informed the Investigation Team 
20 
that terms and arose between Ambassador so 
and so and Minister Mahlobo as a result of 
Minister 
Mahlobo 
continued 
access 
to 
Mr De Kok...” 
 
Those two sentences are not the same at all.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 267 of 383 
 
Why should we pay those team(?)?  They are not the same.  
It does not talk about involvement.  The person who is a 
third person who is actually going to come and testify 
tomorrow, has not made this allegation of my personal 
involvement.  This person is talking about tension.   
 
And then this kind of a funny(?) investigator 
makes that conclusion to become and actually speculate 
when 
there 
is 
no 
evidence. 
 
I 
will 
not 
waste 
the 
Commission’s time and I will not be back(?) to that.  I have 
given the answer.  We never ran this operation and only 
10 
the time when there were challenges, the minister ’s office 
as part of oversight to deal with those disputes.  That is 
all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So do I understand your answer 
correctly that yes the minister ’s office did get involved in 
order to sort out certain problems that arose in execution 
of the project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   That is the answer. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   Regarding this funny(?) feeling(?), Chair, 
of people who came here, they want us to speculate, follow 
each other, he said this, he said that.  I will not do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us on then to another 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 268 of 383 
 
allegation which appears at page 106 of the same bundle.  
There the allegation made by ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   106. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 106. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But this paragraph? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.48. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Okay.  So I can see.  I am there, 
Mr Pretorius.  I can see. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Now this deals with these 
10 
allegations in this paragraph, deals with Project Tin Roof 
which related to an investigation into the alleged poisoning 
of the former President Zuma.  The allegation is: 
“Project 
Tin 
Roof 
was 
established 
in 
December 2014 at the insistence of Minister 
Mahlobo...” 
 
I will pause there.  Do you have any response to 
that allegation? 
MR MAHLOBO:   The allegation is false.  If someone says 
insistence, Chair, what does it mean?  It means you 
20 
instructed people.  There is no instruction that I gave.  And 
if there was an instruction, the law is clear even if there 
financial 
implications 
but 
the 
answer, 
there 
was 
no 
insistence from me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The allegation continues 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 269 of 383 
 
to the following effect that: 
“Minister Mahlobo had Mahan Thuli removed 
from ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Point of order, Chair.  You have made a 
mistake, Advocate Pretorius.  You cannot mention people’s 
names. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But...  Oh. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Please allow me to ask my 
question.  
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The Chair will stop me.  This has 
been the subject matter of extensive evidence.  It is also in 
the public domain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Mahlobo.  From what you 
have 
said 
and 
from 
what 
was 
said 
when 
the 
SSA 
investigation – evidence started here.  In terms of name, I 
understood that the names could not be disclosed are 
those of people who are operatives within SSA.  I hope I 
am using the right term. Who are ...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Operatives or members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I understood to be the 
position and I was told that those names of such people 
would be replaced with pseudonym names and only those 
who were not – who do not fall within that category. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 270 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   You see, Chair.  The problem you have 
with Mr Pretorius.  It is not your area of specialisation.  
And intelligence, like you know, there is no dispute that 
intelligence has been politicised as far as ’95 until today.  
They will come here to do certain things, to portray certain 
people.  I am saying to you.   
 
There is a second head of judiciary in this 
country.  Even people who are targets, you do not disclose 
their names.  That is why I read the law(?).  I am not 
opening...  I might be – like, the last time I told you I am a 
10 
scientist but I got trained on this thing.  I worked on it for 
more than three years.   
 
Let me tell you.  This thing of disclosing this 
name even if the name has been in the public domain, but 
who are not allowed by law to actually do the wrong thing 
that others have done.  I have a discomfort.  You know now 
that disclosing names of people what kind of a risk you put 
to them.   
 
Do you appreciate that they do even have 
families and enemies?  This Commission cannot make the 
20 
same error on the basis ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   ...on the basis because that is why even 
when I gave the testimony in the beginning, I am quoting 
law. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 271 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   The very law ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go to the law.  Let us go to the 
law.  Insofar as it may say anything other than the 
categories of people that we understood were – should not 
be disclosed.  Are you looking at it?  Or if you have the 
section, Mr Mahlobo, you can mention the section. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I gave – no, see, Chair.  When you are 
reading this thing, I gave you an example of intelligence 
oversight at 40 of 1994.  I quoted for you Section 4 that 
10 
access to intelligence information and documents.  And I 
have read that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But do not read that part only.  Also read 
the National Strategy Intelligence Act 39 of 1994.  And 
understand when you read it, even in the deformations in 
the act, what is counterintelligence, what is this thing 
called covert, covert intelligence because those issues of 
secrets.  I am just saying let us just be careful because 
they view a one-sided approach. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   We are not going to go and get 
another(?) 
opinion 
this 
afternoon. 
 
But 
if 
[speaking 
vernacular] because it is worth it because – discomfort.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you know whether the provision 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 272 of 383 
 
that covers somebody who is not an official of SSA or 
somebody who is not an operative, have you – do you 
recall what provision it is so that we can look at it?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, the ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, did you find anything? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I may just say?  Section 4, which 
I understand is the section that Mr Mahlobo referred to, 
talks to about access to intelligence information and 
documents on the part of the JSCI.  It is referred to the 
committee shell and deals with the circumstances under 
10 
which the committee is entitled to documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It does not deal with the issue that 
you have raised about the names of operatives being 
subject to non-disclosure provisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mahan Thuli is not a person 
covered by the legislation.  It is quite simple. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MAHLOBO:   You see, Chair.  I am dealing with 
20 
...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the fact, Chair, there are 
public statements made to the media by Mr Mahlobo 
concerning this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 273 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, you know what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I do not want to be difficult.  This 
pervasion of Mr Pretorius.  I am saying to you, with 
confidence, is wrong and the advice – those who gave the 
advice from State Security, they know they are wrong.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Number two ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Number two, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Mr Pretorius must not throw statements 
and say Mr Mahlobo made statements in the public domain 
with the name that he is referring to.  Every time I was 
asked about this matter, I will answer this matter, I have 
always refused to comment.  But I am going to help you.  I 
am going to answer it.   
 
But I am going to answer it when you throw the 
name of a person and I sit here and I say I am okay.  I took 
an oath.  I took an oath.  If you avoid(?) the name, I am 
20 
going to answer.  You can – because if - you cannot let 
someone decided to put their in public it makes it right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, let us – let me check with 
your legal team.  Do you know of any provision that 
prohibits the disclosure of a name other of somebody who 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 274 of 383 
 
is not an operative or an official of SSA?  If you do know 
tell me so we can look at that because certainly from the 
Commission’s Legal Team and the Investigators, a lot of 
trouble has been taken to make sure that nothing that is 
done here is in breach of the law and some of the 
documents have been – declassification was sought to 
ensure that there was no problem and the acting DG, as I 
understand it, was involved in rearing some of the 
information or documents.  Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, can we cut this short? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The names involved are known by 
reference to evidence properly given already before the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I really do not think much can be 
gained by Mr Mahlobo becoming involved in an argument 
as to the provisions of the act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine.  But let me hear what 
his – whether his legal representative has anything to say 
20 
on this issue?  Have you got anything to say? 
COUNSEL:   Yes, Chair.  Although you have put me on the 
spot, obviously, a battle that I did not want to enter into. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   There are a bit of legislations. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 275 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, we have said them extensively in our 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   Oh, and from the top of my head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   Other than what my client is really eluding to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   But I think I will take queue [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
COUNSEL:    ...from what the Evidence Leader is saying, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   Because it does not really change the price of 
cheese in China. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
COUNSEL:   Just debating.  It is just going to prolong us, 
otherwise.  But Chair, I take note and we will address it in 
our closing for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
The 
relevant 
provisions 
and 
our 
understanding of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
COUNSEL:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let me put the question, Chair, in a 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 276 of 383 
 
way that does not ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...raise the argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In relation to the alleged poisoning 
of former President Zuma, there was a suspect, okay?  Did 
you have any involvement, Mr Mahlobo, in the removal of 
that suspect from Nkandla and the provision to that 
suspect of protection and maintenance? 
MR MAHLOBO:   That takes us forward, Mr Pretorius.  
10 
Thanks for understanding my discomfort.  I know this 
Intelligence Law.  Firstly, I want to put it on record Chair 
that 
I 
never 
removed 
the 
suspect 
and 
it 
is 
incomprehensible 
that 
you 
can 
actually 
go 
[speaking 
vernacular] and remove someone’s wife.  I never issued 
that instruction but I ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...in English what you have said in 
isiZulu.   
MR MAHLOBO:   My isiZulu [speaking vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  But Mr Pretorius needs the 
20 
translation. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I will gather the words. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am saying Chair, I know that there was 
a suspect on a serious matter of National Security where 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 277 of 383 
 
the Head of State was allegedly poisoned and in as much 
as you are dealing with Mr Y here, we are having other 
people who are making statements there because I do not 
want to be going this way, this way.   
 
The answer here, Chair, is that, firstly there are 
certain things that I must deal with because it has been a 
matter I have always avoided to speak to.  In as much Mr 
Pretorius, you can think I am quoted(?) there.  The 
quotation is always no comment but today I can see you 
want a comment.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no let me answer.  Today you 
want a comment.  I am giving you my comment for the first 
time. Firstly, there is someone who has written an affidavit 
here that I refute, who creates an impression including this 
Project Versa report which Mr Y is speaking on what he 
hears.  One, this operation was not an operation only for 
State Security.  It was the Security Cluster Operation.   
 
Because we must put these things on record so 
that people do not create impressions because they twist 
20 
things.  I know how operatives work.  For your record, it 
was the Security Cluster Operations.  The police and 
Intelligence were involved.  The reason why they get 
involved because someone would ask:  Is it – why do you 
get involved in family matters?   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 278 of 383 
 
 
Any matter where foreign agencies are being 
alleged to be involved to any head of state, it is a National 
Security matter.  And the – that is why it is on public 
record, Chair, that ultimately this matter in as much as I 
am not supposed to go into detail but because it is the 
same like the judges.   
 
These matters of national interest, I will use 
discretion but be guided that I do not break the law.  This 
matter, ultimately, we all know now, that a case was 
opened but then there was a decline for prosecution.  So 
10 
that we can disabuse people who come here and create an 
impression that Intelligence just walk out.  That is one.   
 
Then minister ’s involvement.  Minister Melwa(?) 
gave an instruction for the suspect to be removed.  I have 
never given that but the operators who ran the operation, 
they ran the operation.  Even if I had to give an instruction, 
Chair.  How will I give an instruction to remove someone’s 
wife?  Where do you get that capacity?  [speaking 
vernacular]  It does matter.   
 
And you want to create an impression, there is 
20 
this young man called the minister has the capacity to 
come to your home and take your wife.  The answer is yes.  
And let us not play to the gallery.  Then the issue that is 
also on this point of an instruction to use monies.  Any 
instruction to use money, Mr Pretorius, by the executive 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 279 of 383 
 
authority if it is a directive must be in writing.   
 
If I insist that you must carry that instruction that 
has financial implications and it is going to cause an 
unauthorised expenditure, that office has to write to me 
and say to me now that you have given this instruction, 
please 
note 
that 
this 
instruction 
has 
the 
following 
implications.   
 
Then if I insist to proceed, you will write to 
National Treasury and the Auditor-General of South Africa.  
This story that an instruction was given, including to say 
10 
do these monies, it is a no.  But I do know that a covert 
operation was run with respect to an allegation about the 
poisoning of a former president.   
 
And there was no way Intelligence Services, if 
they have got information, they should not have run this 
thing.  You know now when you are sitting(?)...  Other 
countries’ President has died.  What happened to those 
countries?  Because this is what we are dealing with...  
Why do you get involved in family matters?  Why do you do 
this?   
20 
 
Probably, we should be able to lay the matter to 
rest.  I am commenting for the first time.  And I am also 
dealing with the same issue that has been raised by 
Myriam(?).  Because these people who are dealing with Y, 
but Y is talking about things that gets told by other people.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 280 of 383 
 
 
And I am here to deal with Myriam.  I was not 
going to come and deal with Y but when I deal with Y, I will 
deal with these people who gave me the summons to deal 
with because I do not want to be going back there because 
I know each allegation.  I know what in each annexure is 
there.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right.  If we may, Mr Mahlobo, deal with 
the delivery or the allegations regarding the delivery of 
cash separately? 
MR MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply] 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, separately.  I am not asking 
any 
questions 
about 
that 
now. 
 
If 
we 
could 
just 
concentrate, please, on the issue of Project Tin Roof.  As I 
understand it, you say that that project was not established 
at your insistence? 
MR MAHLOBO:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.   
MR MAHLOBO:   You were saying something about cash.  
What was the issue of the cash? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was saying ...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I will say later.  That will come 
later.   
MR MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I may just move on then, please, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 281 of 383 
 
to paragraph 6.5.2?   
MR MAHLOBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   6.5.2 on page 107. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Pseudonym name is used there but 
the affidavit reads: 
“In 2015, pseudonym, a former SSA member 
was recruited by Minister Mahlobo to mitigate 
and resolve The Fees Must Fall Protest which 
had 
erupted 
across 
universities 
in 
South 
10 
Africa...” 
 
Do you have any comment on that allegation? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, Chairperson, you see one of the 
things that makes me uncomfortable.  Some of the things 
you admit them here as evidence.  You know when 
someone says you recruited someone, does not actually 
give you the details, does not give me the documentation 
to be responding to that.   
 
You know, this government, one of the biggest 
problems are about state capture, were these issues about 
20 
recruitment.  Where is Mahlobo saying here that I actually 
recruited someone?  This is a document that I approved 
and signed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Mahlobo, we will make better 
progress if what is being put to you as having been said by 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 282 of 383 
 
a particular witness is untrue.  You say no that is not true. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, you are correct, Chair, we will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will make progress. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But at the very same time it is wrong that 
everybody can come and say things and do not actually 
link you and then I must be answering this thing, yes, no, 
yes, no.  The answer is no, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But I am saying to you.  Is one of the 
things that this Commission gets criticism for.    
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Anybody can come, you drop someone’s 
name, you do not put any ounce of evidence.  We must 
follow that thing.  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, his evidence is contained in a 
lengthy affidavit and as confirmed by another witness and 
it was a product of an investigation conducted internally in 
the SSA.  But simply, Mr Mahlobo, if I may put to you the 
allegation?  Did you recruit a former SSA member to 
20 
mitigate and resolve The Fees Must Fall Protests? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Let me respond in two ways.  There is no 
evidence 
you 
have. 
 
I 
have 
read 
the 
affidavits.  
Recruitment you advertise.  You interview people.  You 
actually sign documents.  There is no document that says I 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 283 of 383 
 
have done that.  And the – I do not want people to actually 
have a situation where you say you have evidence.  You 
can you have an allegation but there is no evidence.  The 
documents that you have given to me, there are no 
documents that ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   ...minister signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Mahlobo, you are saying recruit 
means what you have said.  I do not know that necessarily 
because if – depending on the situation, you can recruit 
10 
somebody into a particular, you know, group of people 
without any documents.  So when it says recruit, you might 
say recruit in this context would involved paperwork that 
there are situations where somebody can be recruited 
without paperwork.  So ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am simply saying.  I do not think it 
is enough to say when it is said.  Somebody says you 
recruited so and so, to say:  Well, I should not answer it 
unless he can put up documents ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   It is not ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because this is an inquiry.  So 
somebody can say something and you say:  Do you know 
it?  And you say whatever and we ask somebody else.  We 
try and get more information.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 284 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   You, see [speaking vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am responding to Mr Pretorius.  He says 
he has evidence.  I know the word evidence what it means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MAHLOBO:   It means – you start to say:  I have read 
these affidavits.  I have read all these annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, may to the extent that he may have 
said there is evidence, he might mean and he may be 
meaning simply an affidavit because an affidavit is under 
10 
oath.  You know, that is evidence.  If you want – if you talk 
about proof, documentary proof that might be something 
else but once something is under oath but – that is 
evidence but whether you want proof to support that, that 
is something else. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But evidence, Chair, you will agree 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   ...they have adjudicated on many matters 
in our land(?) 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MAHLOBO:   You do not put a speculation.  If you say 
something has happened, even if an affidavit ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, if you have personal knowledge of it, 
that is evidence.  If I say Mr Mahlobo was at the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 285 of 383 
 
Commission on Wednesday evening and I saw him, I do not 
have to go and check whether he signed when he came in.  
I saw you, you see? 
MR MAHLOBO:   We differ, Chair, on that one. 
[laughs]   
MR MAHLOBO:   Let us agree to differ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Here I am recruited my niece’s(?) 
government.  [Speaker is unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is what I am saying, to say if 
10 
you talk about – if you say recruitment in this context 
would include paperwork, that is different. 
MR MAHLOBO:   This person, Chair.  You know, this thing, 
if certain people come here – I do listen to the Commission 
when I find time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’, h’m. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And very interestingly what people come 
and say here when it is convenient and sometimes I must 
comment you, sometimes you put to say a bit – but really, 
really how, where and how.  But sometimes you guys leave 
20 
them.  Here, this person was an employee.  If an employee 
is being recruited by the minister, there will be paperwork.   
 
And the – what I am disputing that there is a 
paperwork of this recruitment of this person for this memo 
that bears my authorisation.  That is what recruitment 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 286 of 383 
 
means because this is a state.  I am not recruiting what 
you would call it – let me use this word.   
 
I am not recruiting an operative for a spy 
because if it is for a covert operation, there are also rules 
around the OD’s, which is the Operational Directives, I 
approve.  How to do them.  If we are going to be use the – 
but not within what is prescribed in law ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   ...we will have a disagreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you ask – let us leave out 
10 
recruit, did you ask, instruct or advise from SSA member to 
mitigate and resolve the Fees must Fall protest?  
MR MAHLOBO:   I never did an instruction but there was a 
covert operation, as you remember in terms of the National 
Intelligence as emailed.  Remember the situation at the 
time.  I checked my affidavit because my affidavit must just 
also not be ignored as if I have responded to some of 
these issues but there is no instruction given here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Did you have any 
20 
involvement in the Fees Must Fall project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   What do you mean? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you direct – firstly, did you 
recruit whether formally or informally whether through 
process or in the absence of process anyone to act as part 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 287 of 383 
 
of the project in relation to the Fees Must Fall protests? 
MR MAHLOBO:    Your records, Mr Pretorius, will tell you I 
was not a project manager, I was not running this project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I did not ask that. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, this is my answer I am giving 
you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, I am listening. 
MR MAHLOBO:   That is my answer. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you answer is that you were not 
project manager? 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am saying you have evidence, I am not 
a project manager, I never ran this thing. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  But, with respect, Mr 
Mahlobo, that is not an answer to the question, so let us 
try and move on, the question did you …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, if you do not like my answer 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, no, let me finish please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Mahlobo, let Mr… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you have any involvement 
20 
whatsoever in the operation of the Fees Must Fall project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I have said to you no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That at least  - we have clarity.  I 
may move on then, Chair.  Chair, I want to put two things 
on record, if I may? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 288 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me hear first what he says. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Okay.  Chair, I was going to seek 
an indulgence from my colleague and yourself, it will take 
about five minutes, I need to confer something with my 
client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, a break. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Which might also assist the 
Commission in how we run effectively and efficiently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I just put two things on record 
10 
quickly just for process reasons, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have checked with the 
investigators that express permission was given by the 
SSA to mention the name of De Kock.  That is the first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second is that the relevant 
section I think my learned friend may have been referring 
to, I am not sure, is in the Intelligence Services Act, not 
the Oversight Act, not the Intelligence Services Oversight 
20 
Act but the Intelligence Services Act, that Section 10.4 
reads: 
“The Director General must as far as is reasonably 
practical take steps to ensure that: 
(a) 
National 
Security 
Intelligence, 
intelligence 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 289 of 383 
 
collection methods, sources of information and 
the identity of members of the agency are 
protected from unauthorised disclosure.” 
That is the section. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Let us take a ten minutes 
adjournment …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairman, before you take the break, that 
is not the section I was referring to, please put it on 
record.  I have my notes here, I know what I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he was referring to your lawyer, 
10 
this is learned friend. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MAHLOBO:   He is saying the section because I have 
all these sections here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you were referring to another 
section. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And these sections, you do not read them 
in isolation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine, ja. 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   But I am not here to give a lecture how 
they work.  During our tea time let me find that we do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take a ten minutes adjournment 
as requested by your counsel. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you, Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 290 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  For the sake of 
completeness, I did mention earlier that the section placed 
on record by Mr Mahlobo as Section 4 of the Intelligence 
Services Oversight Act deals expressly with what the 
parliamentary committee is entitled to and not entitled to, it 
does not deal with the issue germane to this evidence.   
10 
 
If I may then go on, Mr Mahlobo, and refer to page 
111 of the same bundle at paragraph 7.1 and 7.2.  Certain 
general observations are made there by Mr Y and if I may 
just put them to you.  They read as follows: 
“In May 2014 Mr David Mahlobo was appointed as 
the Minister of State Security.  In the period that 
followed the office of the DG became involved in 
covert operations purported to be the “President’s 
Project” allegedly pursuant to a directive from 
Minister Mahlobo.”   
20 
Do you have any comment on that?  Is that a correct 
allegation or an incorrect allegation? 
MR MAHLOBO:   What was the allegation? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The allegation is that the  office of 
the DG became involved in covert operations purported to 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 291 of 383 
 
be 
the 
“President’s 
Project” 
allegedly 
pursuant 
to a 
directive from Minister Mahlobo, is that correct or it 
incorrect? 
MR MAHLOBO:   There is no directive from Mr Mahlobo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Then the second paragraph 
reads: 
“During his tenure as Minister of State Security, Mr 
Mahlobo became directly in operational matters.  He 
instructed 
and 
approved 
the 
utilisation 
of 
retained…” 
10 
Well, let us deal with the first question first.  That is a 
general question and you have dealt with it at your last 
session of evidence and I am not going to go back there, 
but it is the second part of that paragraph that I would like 
to put to you.  It reads: 
“He instructed and approved the utilisation of 
retained earnings to fund CDSO projects including 
projects he was personally involved in.” 
Now let us break that up to make it easier, Mr 
Mahlobo.  Did you ever instruct and approve the 
20 
utilisation 
of 
retained 
earnings 
to 
fund 
CDSO 
projects? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, Chair, to assist.  This evidence was 
led before, if you recall the last appearance on the 9 t h and 
even on the 9 t h the documents you read yourself, there is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 292 of 383 
 
no document that say I have given instruction.  The only 
issues 
that 
you 
have 
in 
your 
documents 
is 
budget 
adjustment that you actually saw that you have led 
evidence before. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, the question is not 
whether there is written evidence confirming the allegation, 
the question is whether the allegation is correct or not, did 
you ever instruct or approve the utilisation of retained 
earnings to fund CDSO projects? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I have answer this question 
10 
before and the answer remains no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And it should not only be a no because if 
we lead this evidence, let us not create as if these matters 
we have not gone before them.  You saw where only the 
Minister signed on an appropriation of budget in terms of 
the law. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on to another – and 
we may come back to that issue in a little more detail 
under another head but let us move on, if we may, to 
20 
another document and you will find that in SSA bundle 2B 
at page 1164.  
MR MAHLOBO:   Where are we going?  Page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   SSA 2(b) Chair. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 293 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 2(b) and page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   1164. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under what?   Bundle 2(b)? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   YY17.  This is the affidavit Sonto 
Gladys Kudjoe.   
MR MAHLOBO:   On page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I want to take you to page 
1164 please.  And the allegations made by her relevant to 
the question that I wish to put to you are contained in 
paragraph 58 to 61 and I will read them paragraph by 
10 
paragraph and you can then say whether the allegations 
are correct or not.  Paragraph 58 reads: 
“It is imperative that not only was there a sabotage 
or defiance by the Chief Financial Officer pertaining 
to the control measures that I had put in place but I 
experienced direct interference from my political 
head who had oversight authority on SAA.  In this 
regards the then Minister would instruct the Chief 
Financial Officer directly in the process bypassing 
me.” 
20 
The question that I would like to put ot you, Mr Mahlobo, is 
during your tenure as minister, did you ever give direct 
instructions 
to 
the 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
and 
…[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   The answer is no. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 294 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The answer is no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Oh, I did not hear that, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there was some noise that happened 
while he was giving the answer but he said the answer is 
no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Then in paragraph 59 the 
allegation is made as follows: 
“The former minister would seeks funds from the 
Chief Financial Officer claiming to be running his 
10 
operations.  This would be under the guise of 
special operations.” 
Did you ever seek funds from the CFO for any operations 
whether they were your operations or not? 
MR MAHLOBO:   The answer is no, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MR MAHLOBO:   There is a process on how funds must be 
run there and if you seek funds. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The allegation continues in relation 
to the point that you have just raised: 
20 
“I must now pause to mention that these operations 
would not be in respect of projects that had been 
approved and funded in terms of the measures set 
out in the standard operation on procedures.  In a 
nutshell, this was undermining my authority and 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 295 of 383 
 
sabotaging the steps I had put in place to ensure 
compliance with internal governance leading to 
complete breakdown of working relations with the 
former minister.” 
Now we can break those allegations up but I would 
understand from your former answer that it would not be 
necessary to do so, are those allegations correct or not? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Remember, I have answered the first one, 
that the rest becomes moot. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes but I take it you confirm that 
10 
they are incorrect? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Paragraph 60 says: 
“As I have already alluded to in paragraph 28 above 
I must emphasise that the interference by the 
executive authority on:” 
And it reads on: 
“The operations of SSA was in direct conflict with 
key policy issues pertaining to division of and 
responsibility as could be found at paragraph 5.1 of 
20 
the PFMA.  Clearly the former minister acted 
outside his mandate as the executive authority.” 
I take it that comment is superfluous in relation to 
questions I ask you because you say that never happened. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 296 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Paragraph 61: 
“The issue of accountability for covert operations 
was a problem and how decisions were taken to 
allocate 
resources 
to 
different 
structures 
were 
sometimes compromised.  Many members owed SSA 
a lot of money and there were consequences for 
their unaccountability hence the review of OD04, 
remuneration of agents and contracts and OD09, 
covert operations to tighten accountability.” 
There is no direct allegation against you there so I am 
10 
going to move on. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, I want to comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you wish, yes. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Through you, Chair.  If you read in my 
affidavit, I will not be able to refer now, that when I came 
to SSA there were challenges, nobody can dispute that, but 
whose responsibility to discipline members below senior 
management?  It is the responsibility of the accounting 
office.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I may ask you to comment on the 
allegation in paragraph 69, which appears at page 1167.   
MR MAHLOBO:   On page 69? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 69, page 1167. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I would not comment, Chair, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 297 of 383 
 
because as we led the evidence before, we indicated in 
terms of what the operational directives, the one that the 
Minister approved, says how projects are conceptualised 
and how projects are approved.  I will not confirm because 
this is not in my ambit to approve or not to approve.  If that 
person says so, they will give you supporting information  
or documents whether they are approved or not, it is not in 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I ask the question that I 
intended to ask?  The question I would like to ask you 
10 
arising out of what is said in paragraph 69 is do you agree 
with the proposition that accessing retained earnings for 
current expenditure was contrary to Treasury regulation 
prescripts and the SSA’s commitments to Treasury?  Is that 
a correct statement? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Can you repeat it again? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The allegation – well, not the 
allegations, the statement is made in paragraph 69 as 
follows and I am going to read it: 
“Accessing 
retained 
earnings 
for 
current 
20 
expenditure was contrary to Treasury regulation 
prescripts and our…” 
And I presume that means SSA. 
“…commitments to Treasury.” 
Is that a correct statement? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 298 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I have not seen any document to 
say how was it in violation of those but when you led my 
evidence the last time you had those documents about 
retained earnings and the submission that were made by 
those officials were made to the approving authority and 
the approving authority in this case, like you saw my 
signature there, was me.  But if a person is the one that is 
making the recommendation to you and come and say later 
on the retained earnings were – there was a deviation.  
Remember, the retained earnings, the retained earnings 
10 
are specifically dealt with in terms of Security Services 
Special Account Act, Act 81 of 1969.  Later on there was 
amendment, Act 41 of – it should be 1994 or 1992, that 
number might be right or wrong, and the secret services or 
intelligence services are allowed, Chair, that if you have 
money credit remaining it gets to be approved by the 
executing authority appointed by the Minister of Finance 
and the evidence you led on that day demonstrated that 
process was followed unless here what is being referred to, 
there is a contrary documentary evidence that I do not 
20 
have it in my possession. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  I am not sure that I 
understood the answer to the question.  Do I understand 
you to be saying that the statement as set out and as put 
to you is subject to a qualification and that permission may 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 299 of 383 
 
be granted to used retained earnings for operational 
expenditure? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Permission is - actually how to use 
retained earnings, or let me use these right words, how to 
use retained earnings is legislated and if there is any 
deviation from that legislation, whoever says so, will give 
that contrary view, but in my possession and the document 
we dealt with, remember we had a long discussion about 
those retained earnings. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, the question is a simple one, 
10 
as I understand it.  Is it correct to say that accessing 
retained earnings for current expenditure is contrary to 
Treasury regulations prescripts, is that correct or incorrect.  
It is not my statement, as I am saying, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No but it is a correct statement?  
That is what I am putting.  You know – you appear to know 
in detail what the regulatory provisions are and the simple 
question that I put to you is this statement: 
“Accessing 
retained 
earnings 
for 
current 
expenditure was contrary to Treasury regulation 
20 
prescripts.” 
Is it or is it not? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, let us do this, Chair, to help each 
other, because I have always – if you try to fragment this 
thing, here we have two statements, one statement is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 300 of 383 
 
talking about projects that have not been approved, that is 
one. 
 
Number two, in the same paragraph of the project, 
someone throws a statement and say that accessing 
retained earnings for current expenditure was contrary, I 
will not comment on something that I do not have here.  
The only thing that I have seen that we discuss here, there 
were two requests to utilise retained earnings and those 
requests were explicit in their own writings to say what was 
it all about and we went through here, those ones were 
10 
approved by the approving authority, which is the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question that Mr Pretorius was 
asking seeks only what you know.  If you know the 
statement to be correct to say as far as I know it is correct 
…[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   This one, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not know, you say I do not 
know. 
MR 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
This 
one 
is 
not 
my 
statement 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, it is not your statement. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I do not know who [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Pretorius is taking a statement 
from the affidavit and seeks to simply establish whether in 
terms of your own knowledge what this person is saying is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 301 of 383 
 
correct or not, you can say I do not know whether it is 
correct of not, you can say I do know that it is correct or I 
do know that is not correct. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am saying, Chair, this statement is not 
explicit to say what they are talking about, I will not know 
but the only thing I am saying on record are the two 
retained earnings that you led on the 9 April here.  But in 
this context I do not know what the person means and the 
person will be better placed what does it mean to say it is 
contrary to… 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, I went ahead of you, which 
paragraph are you on about this? 
MR MAHLOBO:   On 69. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On 69. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 69 on page 1167. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I see: 
““Accessing 
retained 
earnings 
for 
current 
expenditure was contrary to Treasury regulation 
prescripts.” 
20 
What is vague about that, Mr Mahlobo? 
MR MAHLOBO:   But, Chair, I do not know what a person 
is saying, which regulations and how is it contrary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, remember, it seeks – no, no, no, 
Mr Mahlobo, it seeks to establish your own knowledge.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 302 of 383 
 
You either do not know or you know.  All that the person is 
saying is: 
““Accessing 
retained 
earnings 
for 
current 
expenditure was contrary to Treasury regulation 
prescripts.” 
If there is no Treasury regulation prescript that you know 
that is against accessing retained earnings you say I do 
not know any such prescripts.  So I cannot say it is true, I 
cannot say it is not true. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am saying, Chair, I do not know about 
10 
this incident the person is referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, Mr Pretorius is not asking about 
an incident, Mr Mahlobo, he is putting a proposition to you.  
You either you know it or you do not know it.  You either 
know that Treasury regulation prescripts prohibit accessing 
retains earnings for current expenditure or you do not know 
whether they do or they do not.  It is a simple thing. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have to say in terms of 
Section what, in terms of regulation what. 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   But, Chair, Treasury regulations are law. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And the answer you want, it cannot be 
outside the law, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I want your knowledge, what is your 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 303 of 383 
 
knowledge of what the position is.  Do you know that these 
prescripts prohibit accessing retained earnings for current 
expenditure or do you not know whether they prohibit it or 
allow it? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I am saying to you – maybe 
I am not clearer, Treasury regulations, there are many of 
them and I am saying to you what I know about retained 
earnings are governed by the Special Secret Services 
Account Act and …[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   Treasury prescripts. 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, if you are going to say Treasury 
prescripts, Chair, there are many of them, there are many 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Mahlobo, no, Mr Mahlobo.  There 
may be many, there question is whether of those many is 
there one that you know to be prohibiting this?  It does not 
matter that there are many. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I do not know this one, Chair, I have said 
so many times, I have said no and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know. 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   I have said I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes can we move on please, Mr 
Mahlobo to page 1171 of the same bundle at paragraph 
84?   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 304 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   1171.  If I may read the allegation 
to you, Mr Mahlobo.  It reads: 
“As per the instructions of the former minister 
contrary 
to 
commitments 
that 
were 
made 
to 
Treasury and advice to the then minister not to use 
these funds for current expenditure or consumption, 
in 2015 the former minister in cahoots with the 
CFO…” 
That is the witness’s word, not mine. 
10 
“…directed access to the retained earnings of R130 
million of which R90 million was allocated to fund 
CDSO operational projects.” 
I am sorry, Chair, I am told that we need five minutes for a 
technical adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or an adjournment to deal with 
technical issues.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Let us take a short 
adjournment to allow the technicians to attend to the 
20 
technical problem.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.   Mr Mahlobo we 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 305 of 383 
 
are at paragraph 84 on page 1171 of SSA2B, and I am 
going to start to read it again if I may: 
“As per the instructions of the former Minister 
contrary 
to 
commitments 
that 
were 
made 
to 
Treasury and advice to the then Minister not to use 
these funds for current expenditure or consumption 
in 2015 the former Minister in cahoots with the CFO 
directed 
access 
to 
the 
retained 
earnings 
of 
R130million of which R90million was allocated to 
fund the Chief Director of Special Operational – 
10 
Operations, Operational Projects and to clear the 
CDSO budget overruns and R20million for Foreign 
Intelligence.  Subsequently the Minister also asked 
for R20million for his project which he requested to 
be included in the CDSO budget.  As an accounting 
officer I did not know a clue about the Minister ’s 
Project which required funding.” 
Now there is several allegations in that, and perhaps we 
should break them up. Is it correct, that you gave 
instructions, Mr Mahlobo to access retained earnings in the 
20 
amount of R130million? 
MR MAHLOBO:   No such instruction. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ever allow anybody else to 
access retained earnings of R130million? 
CHAIRPERSON:   150 or 130 Mr Pretorius? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 306 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   130, yes Chair sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   130, ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, this person because we are 
not appearing here for the first time.  This is the same 
person who actually wrote to the Minister and actually 
recommended for this budget adjustment and it is very 
puzzling what is being said here and you have it on your 
file. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So are you saying that Ambassador 
Kudjoe in fact wrote to you, in your capacity as Minister 
10 
asking that the retained earnings be accessed in that 
amount of R130 million, is that – do I understand you 
correctly? 
MR MAHLOBO:   The returned earnings that I was asked to 
approve for various reasons because programs were either 
others were not performing, the others are overspending. 
We dealt with the matter here.  The person who advised 
and recommended to the Minister and in those documents 
if I recall them well there was not even a reservation 
written by her that it should not be done. Then surprisingly, 
20 
this paragraph 84 say something else contrary to what is 
on record. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will raise that…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Are you 
directing your answer to the specific figures that are 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 307 of 383 
 
mentioned here or are you talking in general?  
MR MAHLOBO:   I am talking both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you give your approval in 
accordance with the recommendation? 
MR MAHLOBO:   The recommendation for the budget 
adjustment that we dealt with, on the 9 t h of April I did 
approve it and in terms of the legislation that I have given 
you before, because budget adjustment are allowed by that 
legislation and I will not be bothering you with those 
10 
details but it is clearly there in the submission because 
that - those two submissions you saw are clearly indicating 
with what empowers a Minister to consider and what 
empowers the Minister for approval. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And do I understand you to have 
agreed to that the amount involved in your approval was 
indeed the amount of a R130million? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes, the record indicates that the 
recommendation I actually approved for R180million.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and of that amount, is it 
20 
correct that R90million was allocated to fund CDSO 
operational projects? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I do not have a recollection on how it was 
spread about but I know about the total figure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the further statement is made, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 308 of 383 
 
that subsequently the Minister also asked for R20million 
for his projects, which he requested to be included in the 
CTSO budget.  Is that a correct or incorrect statement? 
MR MAHLOBO:   That is an incorrect statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ever ask for any amount 
for any projects that could be termed your project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   The answer is no. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then if we make our on please to a 
new affidavit, YY5 which appears at page 164 of SSA 
Bundle 2A this is the affidavit of Darryl.  
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   It is under undercover what? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 164, oh you want the number 
I will give it to you in a moment. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I want the undercover? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will give it to you in a moment.  It 
is YY5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want the undercover Mr Mahlobo? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Is it what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said you want the undercover.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, we have permission to 
20 
review. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Okay, thank you Chair.  You were saying 
page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 59 sorry, page 164.  This is 
the 
affidavit 
of 
Darryl 
and 
his 
referring 
to 
Project 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 309 of 383 
 
Academia. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Pretorius I thought you 
said Y 
so the pagination in this bundle is not as 
straightforward as the other one.  What is the page 
number? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is 8164 black numbers Chair and 
YY is the cover sheet under which the statement is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, YY5, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   YY5, is the blue marker. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we spoke earlier about the 
project that related to the fees must fall protests and that 
was Project Academia.  I think we are on the same page 
there at least.  What is said in paragraph 59 is the 
following: 
“During my seven months’ tenure at SSA Project 
Academia was established. I did not initiate the 
project myself, however, but was acting on the 
instructions of Mr Dlomo and Minister Mahlobo.” 
Is that a correct statement?  Well, let us deal with the first 
20 
sentence first: 
“During my seven-month tenure at SSA Project 
Academia was established.” 
We need not deal with that, I think it is well known that it 
was, the statement that I wish to put to you is that of 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 310 of 383 
 
Darryl which he says: 
“I did not initiate the project myself, however, but 
was acting on the instructions of Mr Dlomo and 
Minister Mahlobo.” 
In so far as you are concerned, is that a correct 
statement? 
MR MAHLOBO:   It is an incorrect statement, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He goes on to say in paragraph 60: 
“The rationale behind Project Academia related to 
the hash tag fees must fall campaign affecting 
10 
various Universities at the time.  It was felt that the 
situation of unrest and the role of the student 
representative councils in stirring up protest had to 
be 
neutralised. 
Given 
pseudonym 
University 
connections he was identified as having potential to 
neutralise disruptions on student campuses arising 
from the hash tag fees must fall campaign.  I 
realised that he had been sent for training in a 
foreign country to prepare him for his work.” 
In another statement, it was alleged that you recruited that 
20 
person, you have denied that, but we need not go any 
further in that regard.  I would like to go to another 
affidavit, please, that is at page 260 of SSA Bundle 2A 
which is the same bundle.  We can go to page 260, please.  
This is an affidavit of Mr Lloyd Mahlangu, who was 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 311 of 383 
 
instrumental in placing certain information before the 
Special Investigation Unit. If one goes back to page 257. 
MR MAHLOBO:   We are no longer on 260? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry? 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   You are not saying you are at 260. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yeah, I am going to go there in a 
moment I just wanted to introduce the affidavit.  At page 
257. He said, he says: 
“I the undersigned, Lloyd Mahlangu in my capacity 
10 
as director, domestic branch of the State Security 
Agency, state under oath.” 
He says in paragraph two: 
“This affidavit is deposed to in terms of Chapter 2 
and 
Section 
34, 
one 
of 
the 
prevention 
and 
combating of corrupt activities Act 12 of 2004 and in 
terms of Treasury regulation, 12.5.1 issued in terms 
of the Public Finance Management Act, 1 of 1999.” 
In other words, it is an affidavit presented to the Special 
Investigation Unit, as I understand it and if I can then go 
20 
back to page 260, paragraph 14.3.  It reads as follows, and 
again, these are general statements but they are followed 
more particular statements, but I am going to read them 
all: 
“Mr Mahlobo, the former Minister of State Security 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 312 of 383 
 
is implicated in directly initiating and participating 
in intelligence operations in breach of constitutional 
and legal prescripts.” 
Let us just stop there for a moment.  Is it correct to say 
that 
you 
were 
involved 
in 
initiating 
directly 
and 
participating in intelligence operations in breach of well - 
at all? 
MR MAHLOBO:   This guy is lying.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And Chair, as we have spoken before, 
10 
there is a process governing, initiating and approving of 
projects and those policies are there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, well, I think what he is 
saying, in fact I know what he is saying is that, his not 
talking about projects initiated in accordance with legal 
prescripts his talking about projects that were initiated in 
breach of legal prescripts.  Does that affect your answer?  
MR MAHLOBO:   No, Chair, Mr Pretorius, let us help you.  
I am reading his statement, he say: 
“I 
am 
implicated 
directly 
at 
initiating 
and 
20 
participating.” 
That is the first statement and remember when you 
introduced and I am saying his lying under oath and to 
initiate there is a clear policies that I approved myself and 
I have made reference in my affidavit.  And then the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 313 of 383 
 
second part, he says: 
“It is in breach of the Constitution and legal 
prescript.” 
There is no Constitutional and legal prescript that were 
breached. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am just pausing a moment Chair 
to see whether I need to put anything further because it is 
dealt with by other witnesses more directly.  I am going to 
move on to the affidavit of…[intervene] 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   Can I just check, why are you jumping 
this one of money where he lies under oath the boy still 
coming back here? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not coming back; I am not 
asking because I choose to do so.  
MR MAHLOBO:   Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The reason Mr Mahlobo is that 
those allegations form part of a report that he has made 
having sourced other information, and we have that 
information which I can put to you directly.  I do not have 
20 
to rely on his say so of what he was reported to him.  
MR MAHLOBO:   No, but…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I really do not have to give you an 
explanation. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no it is fine I will wait, I am just 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 314 of 383 
 
looking at something interesting where someone put it as a 
fact but proceed, I will follow you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So I would rather put to you a more 
original statement rather than a report Mr Mahlobo.  If we 
may go on then to another affidavit, and that is in YY7 at 
page 310 of the same Bundle 2A.  You have dealt already 
in 
your 
evidence 
with 
much 
of 
what 
where 
this 
witness…[intervene] 
MR MAHLOBO:   We dealt with this witness before. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we have.  So I am not going 
10 
to repeat anything except to ask for clarification in respect 
of one issue Mr Mahlobo.  If you go to page 310 paragraph 
52 and over the page, the following paragraphs, these 
paragraphs deal with matters that were put to you at the 
last hearing and that is the creation of the project which 
involves the creation of a Union to rival the Association of 
Mineworkers and Construction Union, AMCU.  
What would like to ask is whether there was ever a 
meeting at your home, which was attended by yourself and 
certain other people in which you directed that the project 
20 
had run into trouble.   
A certain person who was deployed to run the 
project in conjunction with another now feared for his life 
and you gave an instruction according to this allegation, to 
arrange for funds to be paid for the protection of a 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 315 of 383 
 
particular person.  Did you ever do that? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I need to confirm that like we said 
before, this is one of the projects Chair, that I call them, 
intelligence fail.  That ran into problems and at least we 
dealt with this issue where people were saying I created a 
Union when your documents indicated the Union, when it is 
originally had been made before.  
But there was an incident where a particular person 
referred in that document, had an incident of being 
involved - there was an issue where this person had a 
10 
security threat that was even reported to the police and 
this person has always been in terms of this initiative was 
an asset of the organisation.  
And when there were security problems, I did 
engage with the department to say let them look at it this 
particular matter but I never gave them any instruction, 
because the office of the Minister as always - if people, 
they have problems they come and ordinarily myself, or my 
staff, will be able to find the mechanism to support those 
who are handling the project itself.  
20 
To be able to find each other, I will not recall the 
question of the meeting but I will recall the question that 
this person indeed had an incident and I engaged with the 
management to engage with this person how to support this 
person. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 316 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, yes, well, there is not much 
difference between what you say Mr Mahlobo and the 
statement: 
“Minister Mahlobo required me to arrange funds to 
be paid to this person for him to see to his 
protection.” 
Is that incorrect or correct, just for clarity? 
MR MAHLOBO:   To say I said they must arrange for funds, 
it is a big no, but to attend to the security situation of this 
asset I actually engaged with management to say let them 
10 
handle the matter but to give them an instruction that had 
financial implication I never did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, if we could then deal with a 
different affidavit please, Bundle 2B at page 905 this is the 
affidavit…[intervene] 
MR MAHLOBO:   And just before you go there, and 
remember on I am on record Chairperson that this witness 
without any fear or favour of contradiction I have put it on 
record, this is that pack I have put it on record, do you 
remember that day on the issues of Judge? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one who have just come from 
– is that the one whose affidavit we were dealing with just 
now?  
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes, and I want to keep it on record that 
this is one of the biggest peddlers, peddlers are not are 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 317 of 383 
 
not only outside, but also peddlers they can be also inside 
in the Intelligence Services.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, who is the peddler? 
MR MAHLOBO:   This witness we are dealing with; 
remember I have put it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   His referring to the witness whose 
affidavit we were dealing with just now.  
MR MAHLOBO:   You said, Bundle 2B, now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius, is it 2B? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I hear that Chair, is that Steven? 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes, I did put it on record on the line. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What is a peddler in the jargon 
used by us security operations? 
MR MAHLOBO:   You know, someone who is a peddler, 
peddlers they work in this way.  Some may walk in, some 
they exist and they read, I can read you too.  They give 
you information, in their information that you have there is 
an element of truth and lies and if you do not have the 
ability to do analysis and evaluation, you can actually 
make a decision on the basis of an information that is 
20 
untrue.  
And is not easy, sometimes it is one of the difficult 
things when you are handling intelligence brief. Is it really 
true, did it happen?  And some of the decisions get to be 
made on intelligence, remember how they actually attacked 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 318 of 383 
 
Iraq 
the 
other 
country 
will 
not 
mention 
because 
of 
relationship on the basis of peddling false intelligence.  
And it is not an easy thing to pick it up but you can 
actually be able to do it when you do trend analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the purpose of including some truths 
to  
make you to give it some credence? 
MR MAHLOBO:    Ja, you do, but say it is the very thin line 
and it is always one of the challenges.  You can go on the 
basis of an intelligence information and you give it to a 
10 
principal, the President to make a decision and to find that 
you were given [speaking in vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, fake news, fake information. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Ja, that is the right one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But there is fakeness, there is also the 
truth in between there, and decisions have to be made.  
This is where we talk about some of those things, but there 
are many of them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so as I understand it that a 
20 
peddler is someone who deliberately falsifies intelligence 
information and passes it on for use, is that right?  
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes, remember this in this particular case 
I gave you two examples where certain people will have 
been accused as working for another foreign intelligence 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 319 of 383 
 
services.   
Remember also I had to deal with the question 
where Judges are just wrongly accused, and it is very 
difficult to be Judges these days and where I even gave a 
strong warning that when people want to do it, let them not 
do it under my name, but these are the things and they will 
create it and it will look so legit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The peddling of false information 
under the guise of intelligence can lead to serious 
consequences, I presume. 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   It has led to countries to war, it has 
actually made certain decisions, wrong decisions being 
made.  There is evidence not only - we do have our own 
intelligence 
failures, 
too, 
we 
must 
never 
create 
an 
impression that Mr Pretorius that we do not have our own - 
but there are many examples. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it would seem obvious that that 
would 
be 
a 
most 
serious 
breach 
of 
an 
intelligence 
member ’s duties and in fact, an offense. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well it is and the reality is that we do 
20 
have them all over and South Africa is not an exception.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you come to know that 
Steven was a peddler, that peddled information? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I gave you two examples. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When did you come to know of 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 320 of 383 
 
that? 
MR MAHLOBO:   During my tenure as a Minister. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Steven is still a member of the 
SSA? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Ja, and he - let us make an example.  I 
say to you, there was a time when I was made to say 
certain prominent people are spies and I said to you here, I 
even left the agency.  When we said let us open up a case 
because to work for another country, let us say you are a 
Judge whether a President or a Minister but we are being 
10 
handled somewhere else.  
You cannot do it; the law does not allow you to do 
it. Even today those people of this project is one of those. 
Then he also comes here, like I said the other day about 
the issues of those two Judges that he cannot even recall 
and I told you Chair that I knew because remember, in 
intelligence news, they walk, they come and knock at your 
door.  
And I know that how hard certain people are trying 
to actually undermine the judiciary, for one reason or the 
20 
other to say this one, [speaking in vernacular], and without 
an ounce, they will never stop doing it.  Now, [speaking in 
vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you just said they would say this one, 
meaning a Judge has been bribed, has been paid, given 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 321 of 383 
 
money. 
MR MAHLOBO:   It is not always being bribed, [speaking in 
vernacular], his being influenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  
MR MAHLOBO:  Ten things that would actually undermine 
the responsibility that you have been given for a particular 
office.  Sometimes unknowingly and they happen all the 
time. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  When you learnt that Stephen was a 
pedlar what action did you take? 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:  One of the things that I have always asked 
– remember the matter was being handled by the police – 
the one that I am saying to you.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Did you report to the police that he 
had pedalled false information. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No, no Chair wait Mr Pretorius.  I am 
saying the incident I am talking about that I know it was 
pedalled because over time and time and again this person 
who had produced this thing I said the matter must be 
reported to  the police – a case was opened and every time 
20 
– remember intelligence we cannot arrest people.  We can 
investigate then work in conjunction with the police.  Now 
the police they want this information – they want this 
information until I left the police could not get this 
information – this evidence.  And now I am appearing here 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 322 of 383 
 
again I see now this person is accusing two people as 
judges paid.  That on oath this same person says hey I do 
not know these people I have checked them.  The other 
person says no, no these are the judges.  And at the very 
same time our 00:01:36 of our democracy the other leg 
which is the judiciary.  There is a cloud hanging people 
saying hey, hey this thing about judiciary and these people 
will continue to say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the information that the police 
were asking for which they could not get until you left? 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:  It is an intelligence information Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is intelligence information. 
MR MAHLOBO:  To prove that what you say that indeed 
these people are working this.  This is the same person who 
actually falsified even an intelligence card of another agent 
overseas and say this is a proof that this person is a 
member of this intelligence agency. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What I want to put to you is 
something different.  Mr Mahlobo while you were Minister 
you became aware of the fact that a member of the SSA was 
20 
guilty of peddling false information.  A most serious matter 
that warranted reporting to the police as I understand it.  
Why was he still employed?  Why was disciplinary action 
not taken against him?  Or was disciplinary action taken 
against him? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 323 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chair I am saying this matter of the 
allegations that were made about certain prominent people 
was handled by the police and the police the agents are 
supposed to give them until I left Chair.  But I know that the 
former DG actually did some investigation on this person.  I 
do not know the outcome of that investigation.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But Mr Mahlobo as Minister with 
oversight responsibility you become aware of someone who 
peddles information that is so serious it was warrants a 
police investigation do you in your oversight capacity not 
10 
see it as your duty to ensure that the person is held to 
account?  And was he held to account? 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He is still a member of the SSA 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chairperson Mr Pretorius my answer is 
simple.  I said these serious allegations were investigated 
and the police got involved.  They needed information from 
this person and I have said to you they waited and waited 
and waited until I was changed as a Minister.  But I know 
now that the former DG around the capacity of this person 
20 
did an investigation and I do not have content of the report 
about that particular investigation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well the point I am making to you Mr 
Mahlobo 
is 
not 
whether 
criminal 
investigations 
were 
warranted or not we can investigate that. The point I am 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 324 of 383 
 
making to you that if what you say it true it would seem to 
follow as night follows day that you in your oversight 
capacity would have taken steps to ensure that internal 
discipline was conducted. 
MR MAHLOBO:  But Mr Pretorius do not miss the point.  My 
point is simple.  This person is working in the police.  To 
prove these things that he has manufactured that these 
people are spies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you may be misunderstanding 
maybe in part Mr Mahlobo.  The part about the police might 
10 
be a criminal investigation – might be one aspect.  I think 
Mr Pretorius is more interested in the other part which 
would be within the control and power of the organisation 
disciplinary process.  Now you have said that the former DG 
did some investigation and – but you do not know what the 
outcome is but I think that is what Mr Pretorius is really 
interested in to say as somebody who was attached with the 
responsibility of oversight you ought to have taken whatever 
steps needed to be taken to make sure that internally this 
person was held to account.  I think that is what he is 
20 
talking about. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chairperson we hear each other.  Mr 
Pretorius I do not want to say what he is implying.  I 
understand.  I am saying to you Chair this person we 
continuously urge them to cooperate with the police, give 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 325 of 383 
 
them this information so that the police can indeed prove 
that these prominent South Africans are spies.  And I am 
saying to you until I left that had not happened.  I will not 
have acted when I have left because I am not in the employ 
and the other issue was that why is this person still there 
when the person does not have capacity?  I know that there 
was an investigation about the capacity of this person and I 
do not know the outcome because I was – I was 00:06:52. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well you see we have put this matter 
or Mr – Stephen has responded to the investigators in 
10 
relation to your statement given previously that he is a 
peddler.  He denies it I must put it to you.  But if there were 
– it seems entirely probable that if people knew or 
suspected he was a peddler there would have been 
investigations.  You confirm that internally there was an 
investigation.  He is still a member of the SSA.  One can 
only assume that the investigations did not produce the 
outcome that you claim to be true. 
MR MAHLOBO:  We – you – we – you cannot assume Mr 
Pretorius.  Assuming is one of the things that I have always 
20 
been very careful to speculate with. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Not in this case. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No, no Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You assuming that he is a peddler. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No, no, no.  I – you know what I 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 326 of 383 
 
understand what you are trying to say.  I am saying to you 
we are given here something else.  I am not – I am saying 
to you there is a fact this person ran this operation.  This 
person produced a card and the police so that they can act 
on these prominent individuals that are bringing the country 
into disrepute in terms of espionage I left this person 
unable to do that.  Even today those… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say unable to produce information 
that would prove his report to. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Yes to report so that the police can deal 
10 
with espionage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Because espionage is a serious matter.  I 
left before that thing could be done.  Even today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words based on what you 
understood to be the position he 
should have been 
dismissed? 
MR MAHLOBO:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If or on your approach to say the police 
asked for proof he had no proof. 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:  He had not given the proof, action should 
have been taken and what I am saying to you is that I know 
the 
former 
DG 
of 
Intelligence 
did 
and 
actually 
an 
investigation about the fitness of this officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course – and of course once you – 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 327 of 383 
 
once you say action should have been taken it would seem 
to me that for somebody who is guilty of something as 
serious as that the only action should be dismissing him 
because that person can cause wars – can cause the 
country to .. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Where there to dismissal would be an 
outcome of the process Bab Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I .. 
MR MAHLOBO:  But I understand the gravity even today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The gravity. 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:  Even today state security have never 
concluded that matter and say these prominent people are 
not spies.  And it had been left hanging.  And this is a 
serious matter.  It is the very same issue here in this 
affidavit where someone claimed that the two judges have 
been bought.  And the same team that came here Baba it 
says to you they have no evidence that there are these two 
judges that were being bought.  And it is a matter that those 
that are running intelligence our – they should look at it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well let me just approach it from a 
different angle Mr Mahlobo if I may.  You say the police 
could not find proof. 
MR MAHLOBO:  He could not give the police evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So in other words the evidence that 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 328 of 383 
 
was required to substantiate the allegation was absent. 
MR MAHLOBO:  He never gave them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Was absent.  Do you say that you 
know that that evidence existed. Why did you not give it to 
them? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think Mr Mahlobo is saying Mr 
Pretorius he – he implies that he does not know whether it 
exists or not but what he does know is that the  police 
asked for it and he – this person did not give it to them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  No but the point I am making. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that Mr Mahlobo you come to the 
commission and you make it clear and definite statement in 
the absence of the evidence. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Oh. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let me finish.  In the absence of the 
evidence that he is – Stephen is a peddler.  That is not the 
standard that you apply to other aspects of your evidence.  
As I understand the standard you apply if there is now 
written proof or no external corroborating evidence the 
20 
charge cannot stand. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No Chairperson Mr Pretorius must help the 
commission. 
 
If 
he 
chooses 
to 
become 
a 
legal 
representative of Stephen it is okay.  Because I have given 
you 
two 
examples 
that 
are 
actually 
even 
of 
public 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 329 of 383 
 
knowledge and I know the intelligence brief that actually 
even purported from him that this card actually belongs to 
one of these prominent people.  I am not actually going to 
come here and lie.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no but  
MR MAHLOBO:  And if now he wants to represent him as he 
is taking that line I am out of it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no he has to be fair to you.  He has to 
be fair to the witness who implicates you as well.  He needs 
to be fair to both so that is why he – he has put to him what 
10 
you said about him that is why he said he has responded. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he wants to make sure that all 
sides are heard. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway the evidence is on record 
and we can read it and consider it.  I would like to move to 
another affidavit please and that is at page 905 and 906 of 
Bundle 2(b). 
MR MAHLOBO:  It is under cover.  The undercover they 
help Mr Pretorius to arrive quickly.  You want us.. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You like undercover Mr Mahlobo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It takes me time to get to the cover. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Why?  Thank you.  You need to help me Mr 
Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he will help you just now.   
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 330 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  YY16.   
MR MAHLOBO:  I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to page 905 please.  This 
is an extract from an interview that Frank held with Veza 
investigators and I want to refer you please to the first 
paragraph on page 905.  And what was being discussed 
here was Operation Lock.  The third line – I will read from 
the third line onwards. 
“So when that happened Ma’am that is how 
the Ministry took over the project.  It went 
10 
out of my hand.  I know nothing about it.  
The person was paid from the Minister ’s 
office.  I would draw the money under Ops 
Lock, deliver the money to them at the 
Ministry.  They would sign for it either 
Vukani or Jay they are both pseudonyms he 
would sign for the money.  They would go 
and deliver and bring back the certificate.  
They would take the money and I would take 
the certificate.  I would settle like that.  
20 
There was another project for example Ops 
Justice. There was money being drawn.  
That money started at R1.3 million up until 
R21.8 million.  I used to draw that money.” 
In essence what Frank is saying is that money was 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 331 of 383 
 
delivered to your offices under the rubric of Project Lock, is 
that correct? 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chairperson can I address you?  Before I 
respond here one of the reservation I have is that I do not 
want to deal with these transcripts.  These transcript they 
do not even have the certificate of a transcriber.  Number 2 
even the last time when I refused to engage on that small 
document it is because I was being given transcript of 
Project Veza. 
1. They had no cover to say who is the author for this 
10 
thing.  And if there was a transcript certificate it will 
have been better.   
2. If the transcript certificate those who do transcript like 
they do even for the commission they know the 
obligation that the law places on the accuracy of that 
information.  That is point number 1. 
And I have read these – a number of these ones – these 
transcripts and they are incomplete and I have written notes 
for myself and I said to legal team I am prepared to deal 
with any matter as long as that matter is under oath. There 
20 
is an affidavit.  Whether a person has testified – whether 
the person has not testified.  But if it is under oath I will 
entertain it.  I happen also to know that my legal team had a 
discussion with your offices about an affidavit that I am 
prepared to respond to by Frank.  Not a transcript an 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 332 of 383 
 
affidavit where he puts these things under oath because an 
oath is a serious matter.  That is what I am prepared to do.  
Because even this transcript and the affidavit that you sent 
of Frank of February 2021 I cannot recall the date what is in 
the transcript and what is in the oath are slightly different.  
Well I have learnt – I have learnt that last week when you 
sent me – you send us these notices who is appearing.  
Frank was supposed to have appeared last week and I know 
now that Frank only deposited a signed affidavit last week.  
And so that we do not bring your commission into disrepute 
10 
as a matter of courteous my legal team advise the team 
about this particular matter.  But if you want to deal with 
this matter that is referred there I will request that please 
Frank affidavit and I am going to respond to it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am afraid those decisions as to 
whether you should answer a question or not are for the 
Chair to make not you with respect. 
MR MAHLOBO:  But order Chair I was making a request to 
you not to Mr Pretorius.  I am telling you – you know I have 
been participating here under constraints but because I 
20 
respect you despite some of the challenges.  That is why I 
told you that from time to time when I have a discomfort I 
will raise it and I am raising it to you. If you feel my 
discomfort is unwarranted you will say so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 333 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I am asking a factual question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It devises out of evidence before 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There will be testimony from Frank 
in regard to this.  I am simply asking the question prompted 
by evidence before you of whatever quality whether monies 
for Project Lock were delivered to the office of the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the question? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That seems to be a general 
question that should – you can answer Mr Mahlobo. 
MR MAHLOBO:  You see Chair why I am speaking the 
manner I speak.  I am not oblivious of the other documents 
where this matter is raised and the context are different.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure that I know which other 
documents. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No, no I do have the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:  That was sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Where the so called Project Lock is being 
spoken about.  And the context.  For an example here this 
statement does not say the money was given to the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 334 of 383 
 
Minister. What should I say because it is not given to me.  
Should I account for the two people?   
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I guess that in that event if it 
does not say to the Minister then if it says it was given to 
the office if you know that it was given to the office you say 
yes.  Or if you do not know whether it was given to anybody 
in your office then you do not know. 
MR MAHLOBO:  You know Chairperson that is why when 
you pigeonhole someone you want me to direct me to – this 
matter there is an affidavit to it.  It give the context before 
10 
you rush to the allegation whether monies were given to the 
two people that they are saying here.  And I want to talk to 
that context.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Which affidavit Mr Pretorius is that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am not sure whether we are going 
back to another issue which we will – which we have 
already dealt with which I do not intend to go back to it 
except (talking over one another). 
MR MAHLOBO:  There is an affidavit of February. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The question Chair is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – you say it is an affidavit of 
February. 
MR MAHLOBO:  It has been sent to me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:  That in your summons you sent there is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 335 of 383 
 
this transcript, there is an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (inaudible) 
MR MAHLOBO:  And I am – pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By February. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Ja February 2021. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the month of February. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the month of February. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought – I thought February was the 
10 
pseudo name. 
MR MAHLOBO:  No, no. You see Chair last time I was not 
trying to be disrespectful but I want to say to you in trying 
to help the commission I know what game is being played 
by those who are doing Project Veza.  They want to actually 
pigeon us to a particular narrative.  We will not run away 
from answering questions.  But their narrative cannot be my 
narrative.  And if this commission does not want to give an 
opportunity to clarify this – for an example there is an 
affidavit by Frank and the affidavit by Frank and the other 
20 
affidavits that people are saying here what is the main 
allegation – why am I sitting here? 
 
One of the allegations is that the Minister one is 
involved in operations.  Now they are saying the Ministry.  
My officials are involved in operation.  That the first part 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 336 of 383 
 
which is against the law.  Then the second part it says the 
Ministry and the Minister received monies.  And how do you 
want us to help the commission if we follow only one route 
because I want to answer that question because now they 
are talking about their Ministry.  Then I will come to this 
matter of whether these officials they received money or 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – what you can do Mr Mahlobo is you 
can give an answer to the question but provide the context 
that you wish to provide if you say there is a context to my 
10 
answer.  And then you provide the context. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Well Chair let me give you the answer.  
You helped me by guiding me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:  That particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But perhaps for the sake of clarity if 
I may to mean.  I should clarify what I said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am not even going to clarify what I 
20 
said I should repeat what I said.  Was money paid to the 
Minister ’s office in relation to the execution of Project 
Lock?  That is the question. The Minister ’s office.  Not the 
Minister the Minister’s office. 
MR MAHLOBO:  Chairperson like you guided me I am going 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 337 of 383 
 
to respond the manner you have put it yourself.  Because I 
am not comfortable with that route.   
1. I want to put it on record the Minister’s office never 
ran projects. 
2. My office got involved where there were challenges 
between the Project Managers and the people they 
were managing where there were either matters of 
trust deficit or there were disputes or there were non-
payments.  My office got involved to ensure that those 
issues are being resolved and they had to monitor and 
10 
report whether those issues are resolved. 
That is what I want to put it on record.  Whether during 
assisting on Project Lock they received money or not 
received money I do not know.  But I must be able to 
actually ensure that my officers they do not get to be 
accused the way other people come here and accuse us 
without evidence like they admitted themselves. 
 
Office of the Minister never ran projects. The only 
instances where they got involved is when there were 
challenges.  Like a number of project it will be Lock, it will 
20 
be this issue that you are referring to of the so called union 
and others.  I know that they were helping to solve 
problems.  But they never ran those operations.  How they 
supported those who want to resolve problems they can 
discuss for themselves.  But whether they were given 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 338 of 383 
 
money or not money I am not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right that deals with that issue.  If I 
could just go to page 1011 of the same bundle please.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am also there Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If I may just read to you from an 
interview transcript that was supplied to the investigators by 
the SSA where Frank was interviewed by Mr Mfamadi [?] as 
part of the high level review panel proceedings.  I am going 
to read from the top of page 1011. It reads: 
10 
“And then Project Justice it arose outside 
inside Project Indistinct it was an operation.  
The one that I referred to earlier when I said 
it intended to have an understanding who sit 
were within the justice fraternity.” 
I am reading exactly as it appears on the page. 
“Specifically issue that pertain the judges because there 
was this feeling with the… these judges are being… handed 
by Foreign Intelligent  
Services.  So my understanding of the Project 
20 
Justice was there. 
Unknown Female:   Was it not intended to 
influence decisions of judges?   
Mr Frank:  At a point I can say it was because 
I know for ...[indistinct] Even within Project 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 339 of 383 
 
Justice we are paying a lot of money a month 
and these monies were said to be paid to a 
certain set of judges that were w-h-e-l-e, 
working on high profile cases and so forth, and 
so forth. 
An Unknown Female:   Yes. 
Mr Frank:  But I was not directly involved.  I 
only know because I used to draw money for 
Masanda who gave direct to their office of the 
Minister 
because 
that 
project 
was 
being 
10 
handled direct from that office of the Minister, 
Mr Mfumadi.  It is fine...” 
Now what I would like to ask you about is, not the 
existence of the project, necessarily, but whether money 
for Project Justice was ever delivered to the office of the 
Minister?  That is your office. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, Mr Pretorius we should not run from 
certain of these things.  We have dealt with this matter 
before and here.  We should repeat these things because 
we can also perpetuate things ourselves.  A meeting.  You 
20 
will find time, whenever you interact with Frank, I would 
have received a notice that my people must be here.  
Tomorrow we are looking at him.   
 
And I just wanted to put something for you to 
note as a Chair.  Just look at the statement where it says:  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 340 of 383 
 
What was the issue of Project Justice about?  And the 
affidavit that Frank has deposed.  That, actually, confirms 
that whatever that Project Justice was, it was not about 
buying judges. 
 
And I want to put it on record here because you 
would have heard lies and continue to actually when the 
judiciary is under attack, we continue to actually create 
that impression.  And I still repeat my statement.  During 
my tenure I have not issued an instruction that judges must 
actually be paid or bribed.   
10 
 
And worse.  Even if - let us say, it was done 
which there is no evidence even to say that because we 
never did.  Why would government lose cases?  But it will 
be interesting.  But let me come to the question.  I am not 
aware that monies was given to my office because even 
this – what do you call this thing?   
 
This transcript is not even specifying.  This one 
is talking about my office.  I do not know who in the office 
but it is not me here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it possible that monies for 
20 
Project Justice were then given to your office? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, I do not want to speculate.  
This thing, it does not say who.  You cannot just leave 
money in the office.  There are people.  And this is what I 
was telling you about the incompleteness of some of these 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 341 of 383 
 
transcripts.  Let alone about some of the questions people 
ask where you do not, actually, follow certain serious 
matters.  You just leave them hanging.  I do not want to 
discuss issues of ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Or do you not know? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I do not even want to discuss the issues 
of the quality of the transcript and the investigation of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But few days ago, the Minister was on TV, 
saying that she is going to conduct a foreign sec(?) 
10 
investigation because this what – this thing called Project 
Veza is helping nobody in terms of getting to specifics.  
This is one of the example, Chair.  Like, I say, in my case, 
the answer, as I am saying, I do not know this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but I think you have given the answer. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know whether money was 
given to your office or not. 
MR MAHLOBO:   For this specific case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say it was not given to you? 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  I may just explain to you, to 
allay your concerns, Mr Mahlobo.  Ultimately, all the 
evidence will be considered by the Chair and he will, at the 
end of the day, weigh up the quality of the evidence and 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 342 of 383 
 
come to a decision as to what he can find and not find.  
That is the normal process.  You are participating in that 
process by answering matters that are already before him.  
And I trust you will continue to answer questions that are 
put to you. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No.  Let us help you.  I have full 
confidence in the Deputy Chief Justice and he has my full 
respect but in a democracy, when I see games being 
played, like by these investigators, there is no way I am 
going to help you Chair to pinpoint certain things  You 
10 
know, names of people are being tarnished.  We must no 
runaway from accountability but you throw names of people 
after they have said everything about people.   
 
Sidney was sitting here.  Jafta was sitting here.  
They told you this is what we hear.  And if I was not having 
confidence in you, I was not going to participate.  If the 
President 
and 
the 
ANC 
side, 
I 
respect 
the 
three 
organisations.  The judiciary.  And we are very fortunate 
that they choice a person of your calibre(?).  I respect my 
President, His Excellence Cyril Ramaphosa in the ANC.   
20 
 
I am part of the Top Decision.  But if certain 
things are being done here and you will see this queried, I 
will have to make the remark because the law allows me to 
do.  While I would not shy away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 343 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   But when I see certain things, I would 
raise them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And I have full confidence that as a 
second in command of the judiciary, you will do your best 
to be able to help the country looking at everybody who 
came here, who played games, who did what. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   It is going to be very big work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   And – but you have our full support.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR MAHLOBO:   And we wish you well on that exercise, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  I would like to move on 
then to page 1146.1 of the same bundle and this is the 
affidavit of Frank submitted to the Commission. 
MR MAHLOBO:   One, one...? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   One, one, four, six.  It is right at 
20 
the end of the tab number 16.   
MR MAHLOBO:   Oh.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Can we go to paragraph 
...[intervenes] 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 344 of 383 
 
COUNSEL:   I am sorry to interrupt with my – Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
COUNSEL:   Chair, you will recall, as I have appeared last 
time, that I also represent in this matter ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
COUNSEL:   ...the witness called Frank.    
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
COUNSEL:   And I think during the testimony of my client 
now, who is the witness, he has tried to indicate that we 
have got about two documents purporting to be an 
10 
affidavit.  So I did not have the index to the paginations 
and I am privy to two documents that are presenting 
themselves as affidavit.  If my colleague can just guide 
me?  I can see my colleague, Nozawa(?), normally engage 
with from the Legal Team is trying to whisper something to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  [laughs] 
COUNSEL:   Just to check because there will be an issue 
raised specifically on that particular affidavit.  Hence I am 
asking this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, I am ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it is one dated 16 February 2021, is it 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 345 of 383 
 
not? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
is 
one 
that 
was 
deposed 
to 
...[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the 16 t h ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So that appears from page 
1146.34. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Will that help you? 
COUNSEL:   May I quickly just run next...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
COUNSEL:   ...to my... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, it seems like we disempowered my 
colleague.  So she will not be able to assist me because 
apparently she had to give her copy to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  [laughs] 
COUNSEL:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see.  Ja, Mr Pretorius ...[intervenes] 
COUNSEL:   But on that note, Chair.  Can I just ask 
20 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
COUNSEL:   ..for five minutes so that we do not get to 
interrupt my learned colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 346 of 383 
 
COUNSEL:   But otherwise – because I had the discussion 
before on this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   And though I did not get an assurance but 
there was some engagement on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay let us adjourn for five 
minutes.  We adjourn. 
COUNSEL:   Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe I can indicate that if we come 
to half past nine if you are done that is fine but if you are 
not done then there is always room to put questions in 
writing which can be responded to by way of an affidavit.  
That is something that we can look at as well. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Could I take you please, Mr 
20 
Mahlobo, to page 1146.14?  This is the affidavit, attested 
affidavit of Frank.  Chair, I must point out that we will call 
Frank tomorrow to get him to speak to this but my 
instructions are that this is in fact his affidavit although 
these pages are not initialled.  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 347 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am there, Chair.  
MR ANISI:   I am here, Chair, I can confirm that it is his 
affidavit because I have got an instruction.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, of course, Mr Anisi acts for 
both Mr Mahlobo and Frank.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Paragraph 61.1 deals 
with Operation Justice.  It says: 
“Operation Justice was designed to investigate…” 
10 
MR ANISI:   Just a second, Mr Pretorius, you said 1146.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:   1146.14, that is the page. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   .14. 
MR ANISI:   Okay, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 61.1 reads and perhaps 
before I read from this affidavit I should just mention that 
there is in existence a draft affidavit of Frank that may 
become relevant in tomorrow’s evidence but for the 
moment 
I 
am 
going 
to 
put 
the 
signed 
affidavit 
to 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   We are on 61.1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I may read it, Mr Mahlobo.   
“Operation Justice was designed to investigate, 
confirm or refute the involvement of judges in 
destabilising the state and also that some judges 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 348 of 383 
 
were being handled or cooperated with foreign 
intelligence services and discrediting the office of 
the President of the Republic.  The operation was 
allocated and amount of 1.3 million initially and 
later million on a monthly basis for the purpose of 
the operation.  Such funds were dispensed to the 
office 
of 
the 
then 
Minister 
of 
State 
Security 
Mahlobo.” 
The question I wish to put to you is whether or not the last 
sentence is correct or not, whether you know whether it is 
10 
correct of not.  That is the sentence when reads: 
“Such funds were dispensed to the office of the 
then Minister of State Security Mahlobo.” 
MR MAHLOBO:   The last sentence, Chair, as I said earlier 
on, I am not aware but as I have explained before the role 
of the ministry around when there are challenges, ja.  
Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Were there any such challenges in 
relation to Operation Justice which might have justified 
your office dispensing those project monies? 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I do not want to speculate, Chair, it 
has been long time I left this space but as a matter of 
principle, as I said, my office never an projects but where 
there were challenges from time to time they will come in 
but in this specific case I will not have actually an idea 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 349 of 383 
 
really to say whether there was or not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 61.2 reads: 
“Operation Lock was designed to monitor, evaluate 
and provide logistical support to the subject after 
he was released on parole into the care of the State 
Security.  This operation was also making financial 
payments to the value of R200 000 monthly which, 
at a later stage, was reduced to R30 000 monthly.  
(Not 
sure 
of 
the 
period 
in 
question). 
 
The 
dispensing of these funds was through the office of 
10 
the minister.” 
Again, the last sentence. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, the last sentence, as I am saying, I 
am not aware.  But what I am aware, this one specifically I 
am aware, like we spoke earlier on, there were challenges 
and my office had to come closer to help them but whether 
they disbursed monies ot them or not, I am not aware. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 61.3 reads: 
“Operation Seskona was born out of a consultative 
meeting that took place in the Ministry.  Present 
20 
was the then Minister Mahlobo, the then Deputy 
Minister, Deputy Director General, Mr Dlomo, SSA 
CFO, SSA Budget Control Manager. CDSO Acting 
General Manager, CDSO Head Finance Assets, 
myself…” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 350 of 383 
 
That is Frank. 
“…and other ministry staff.: 
Is that a correct statement? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, this one, Chairperson, I cannot 
recall this meeting but if it was a meeting of this high level 
delegation probably we need to be assisted probably if to 
confirm or not to confirm with the minutes because I know 
that normally my ministry staff, when we call management 
meetings or certain meetings, they will keep records.  But, 
as I said sometime back, Mr Pretorius and Chair, remember 
10 
I struggled to get even a single document from the agency.  
I was only privileged to participate through some of the 
documents they chose to give but those ones that I 
requested, you remember when we were to put a lot of 
letters amongst ourselves about documents, but this one, I 
will not be able to recall whether it took place or not and if 
indeed it took place there should be records for it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Perhaps the next sentence 
would assist in triggering your memory:  It reads: 
“The operation was designed to launch investigative 
20 
operations, monitoring and penetration into the civil 
society movement that was responsible in the 
destabilising and causing disorder in the City of 
Cape Town in the name of protest against lack of 
service delivery.” 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 351 of 383 
 
Do you know anything about that project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, this project, Chairperson, I will be 
very guarded because, you know, you have the beginning 
of a sentence and someone creates an impression of this 
entity as if the only time this entity that we had to look at it 
is because during that time and this entity, if even if you 
can check their records, was registered long, long before I 
even became a minister there.  But I do recall that I got 
intelligence brief about a number of organisations that 
were 
involved 
either 
in 
violent 
protests 
or 
causing 
10 
destabilisation and this entity, Mr Pretorius, is one of the 
entities I will get intelligence brief but the sentence to say 
it was designed to do what, what, what, remember, who 
conceptualises projects, Chair, and our projects, they get 
to be approved is not at my level but the Intelligence brief, 
as a principle, I should receive the intelligence brief if they 
are meant for me but in this instance I did receive 
intelligence brief. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  If we may go over the page 
please to 1146.16, paragraph 61.5, it reads: 
20 
“In addition, an operation code name Commitment 
was undertaken by the Chief Directorate Special 
Operations.  I have no recollection  of the intended 
purpose. 
However, 
I 
remember 
that 
the 
funds 
allocated were to the value of R2.5 million on a 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 352 of 383 
 
monthly basis and were dispensed to the office of 
the Minister and/or at times was given to my 
colleague, Luyanda or Shadow.” 
Both pseudonyms. 
“The operation had the approval of the Minister D 
Mahlobo and Mr Dlomo.” 
Did you know of the operation code named Commitment? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I did receive the intelligence brief on this 
one but to say I approved the project, ministers never 
approve projects in terms of our policies.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you did not approve the 
project, I take it? 
MR MAHLOBO:   No.  But the intelligence brief I did 
receive. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC: 
“The allegation is also made that funds to the value 
of R2.5 million on a monthly basis were dispensed 
to the office of the Minister or at times took another 
route.” 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, he is not specific here, I will not be 
20 
aware whether it was dispenses and dispensed to who in 
my office. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it possible for monies to be 
dispensed to your office or through your office without you 
knowing? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 353 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   What do you mean? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, your office, the Ministry of 
State Security, I take it operates under your command and 
under your supervision and authority and the question is, 
is it possible for monies for State Security projects to be 
dispensed to your office or through your office without you 
knowing it? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Remember, it depends what do you mean.  
You cannot have a situation where if the money is not 
deposited to you – given to you, you must then account, 
10 
you will have to start to ask those things like when you are 
in an evidence to say by who, when, where I was.  And if 
we get into those kind of things and remember how monies 
get to be handled, there is a clear mechanism because one 
of the things that even if there is a view we must accept 
evidence from project [indistinct], which is not scientific, in 
an intelligence and in government there is a tracking 
system, anybody who request, who deliver and approve, 
there is a document management system.  Even when I 
receive my intelligence briefs I will sign for them that I 
20 
have received an intelligence brief, you do not just go 
around and handle certain things, if you do that, you are 
breaking the law and it is going to make it very difficult for 
you even how to account. 
 
And immediately – then that is one part.  Then there 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 354 of 383 
 
is a second part.  Then there is a method, you know, there 
is a method of how cash must be delivered to an asset and 
this thing is called a DLB, a dead letter box where when 
you operate, you do not leave it a – you know, in the olden 
times when people were still - some people were honest, I 
can drop your parcel there and you must be able to pick it 
a particular point, at that point without any contract.  How 
they handled monies and the methodologies is not my 
business because I never handled money and in this 
instance, Mr Pretorius, it will be unfair to say if someone 
10 
brings money to the office, if the money is not brought to 
me, 
I 
cannot 
account 
for 
that, 
Chair. 
 
And 
whilst 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it possible that large sums of money – 
now when I say large, you know, R1 million might not be 
large to you, Mr Mahlobo, is it possible that large amounts 
of money could be given to your office for legitimate use in 
terms of business of your office and you would not know 
that your office received large amounts of money because I 
can take it if it was illegitimate, maybe there is a 
20 
possibility somebody could hide it from being seen by other 
people but if it is legitimate, do you think it would be easy 
for somebody in your office to receive large sums of money 
for legitimate use without knowing? 
MR 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
You 
know, 
Bab 
Zondo, 
there 
is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 355 of 383 
 
somewhere - because unfortunately Mr Pretorius has not 
been kind to also to refer to my own statement, there is 
somewhere in my affidavit – and I have been out of 
intelligence for some time, there is a – you know, let me 
start with how you say it is possible if it is for legitimate.  
You see, the problem that the people of project where they 
are missing a point.  You know, if you want to get these 
guys to account, if you can just give me a minute or two 
without wasting time, to come to a conclusion – to come to 
a conclusion whether something is legal or not legal.  
10 
Firstly, I will have asked a question which is – fortunately, 
I have an experience of being a former accounting officer 
myself, is to say but this project of yours, where did you 
get the authority?  What is the basis in law?  And if that 
basis in law does not fit in terms of the National Security 
structures(?) or the NIE you can say this is an illegal 
counter-intelligence or it is intelligence operation. 
 
Number two, I will ask the next question, who is the 
project manager, did you get the project to be approved 
and what are the resources?   Which is an important step 
20 
whether approval is there before you can say legitimate or 
not legitimate. 
 
Then there always something which is a witness in 
intelligence, Chair.  You know, there is something called 
source index.  Source index is a database.  When we are 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 356 of 383 
 
going to be a source the categories are not the same how 
much we are going to earn and they vary.  If they say I am 
handling a President, because you can handle a President, 
I am handling a judge, I am handling just someone there 
depending also on the risk profile, the money that must be 
paid is not the same.  Then on the basis of that the issue 
is to say whether the amounts of money for this kind of an 
operative, is it commensurate?  You know, if you were a 
professional service provider or a consultant, there are 
rates.  Even honourable Pretorius is sitting here, SCs, you 
10 
are not the same, there is a junior, there is a senior one, 
there are rates.  Did you pay the actual commensurate 
rate?  Those are the things they should have looked. 
 
Then there is an issue, just to conclude, Bab 
Zondo, to your question, then the method on how monies 
get to be handled, as long as you come back and account, 
it is a matter of a method you do not disclose but the issue 
that you must ask, was there value for money?  Was there 
value for money because if, for example, to run an 
operation it has a timeframe and a duration, at the end of 
20 
the day the risk that I was trying to neutralise or the 
operation that I was trying to do certain things, it is still 
there, it means money is being wasted.  But here, as you 
were asking, it is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is possible. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 357 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   It is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is legitimate. 
MR MAHLOBO:   If it is legitimate, it is an approved 
project and then there is an accountability because at the 
end of the day there must be returns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying it is not possible for 
your 
office 
to 
receive 
legitimate 
funds 
to 
be 
used 
legitimately without you knowing because there will – it is 
not possible, you would always know because there would 
be records or you say …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, Chair, it is different.  You 
see, one of the things even when they report in the media 
is not to understand how budget works.  If I am going to 
know that monies are going this way, they must belong to 
my vote item.  You know, even in Chief Justice office you 
know that.  Then there are items.  That the money is not in 
my budget, how will I know because those are handled 
where the budget is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But I guess if it is legitimate money 
it can only come from your budget, I would imagine. 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, if let us say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is legitimate. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, it does not have to be 
legitimate in terms of my office.  I am saying if my office 
has actually done a procurement or procured a service, it 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 358 of 383 
 
must come from my line budget.  But if someone is making 
a claim an allegation like Frank, that he has given 
someone from my office, he should be able to explain to 
you who did he give it to and why did you give to this 
persona and whether this person ultimately accounted for 
the monies or he should be able to answer the question, if 
you are asking to become your post office, did that money 
arrive there?  What were your systems to do that?  Those 
are some of the things but I am not here to look at the 
capabilities of those who were doing the investigation, they 
10 
were looking for something else and if you wanted to direct 
them but in terms of how an organisation …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR 
MAHLOBO:   Whether it has collapsed or not 
collapsed, there will be systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, I am really trying my 
hardest to understand what your evidence is and let me 
stress that Frank will come and he will give his evidence, 
he will be asked questions about his interactions with the 
20 
Commission’s investigators and legal team.  So you can 
rest assured I will do that tomorrow.  For the moment I just 
want to ask you, can your office legitimately be used as a 
conduit for funds for operational projects of the SSA? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I will not agree that you use the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 359 of 383 
 
word conduit because that is something else. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I am asking you that question, 
so on the assumption that I mean what I say by the use of 
the word conduit, I would be grateful if you would answer 
the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, would it be permissible?  
Was it permissible for somebody to use your office as a 
conduit for sending money to somebody? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, it depends, Bab Zondo Buthi, what 
was the context?  Why will someone be asked?  Then they 
10 
will be able to explain those that got involved.  I will not be 
able to speculate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it is possible then in certain 
circumstances, I understand your answer, it is not an 
absolute no, it is not possible for the office of the ministry 
to be used to receive and dispense operational funds of 
the SSA? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, as I am saying, Chair, I will not 
speculate because I do not know the circumstances. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not asked you to speculate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
what 
he 
saying 
is 
that 
he 
understands you to be saying you cannot say the office of 
the Minister could never be used like that, you are saying 
it could depend on circumstances. 
MR MAHLOBO:   [speaking in the vernacular]. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 360 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLOBO:   They way you are putting it, if it is not 
twisted, the way put it is the correct version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Because remember words they have a 
very powerful meaning, Bab Zondo and when I – words – 
we are not on the same 23.33 I should be able to raise my 
…[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
MR MAHLOBO:   But where assist [speaking in the 
10 
vernacular] facilitator, I am happy with the way you explain 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, do you know the 
purpose of Operation Commitment? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I will not even recall but what I 
know that in all operations, depending who is the recipient 
of the information, you will only get what we call it – an 
Intelligence 
brief 
and 
here, 
sitting 
now, 
without 
documentation – remember, I was not given documentation 
20 
by SSA, I do not even know who was the approving 
authority, whether it was approved or not approved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, do you know the purpose of 
Operation Commitment, yes or no? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am saying the purpose will be on the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 361 of 383 
 
conception document. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know it? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chair, I have given you the answer, Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I do not recall the answer. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, I am saying to you without 
document I will not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you do not know? 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, I am saying without document.  Do 
not change my answer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe let us put it this way.  
While you were Minister, during your term, is it possible 
that you knew the purpose at that time but right now you 
would need to be reminded, you would need documents to 
remember or what is the position? 
MR MAHLOBO:   You see, Chair, how intelligence work, as 
long as the counter-intelligence information, the project 
manager will know but if it is a matter related to national 
security like they do and if the report is for me, I will get 
an intelligence brief and I want to confirm that I did receive 
20 
brief.  The intelligence brief will then tell you – they will 
tell you that these are the following things that are 
happening and these are the decision that the government 
must make either at my level or at any other level but 
intelligence brief, I did receive intelligence briefs. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 362 of 383 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In relation to this particular project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But in terms of what its purpose 
was, do you recall that at stage you knew what that 
…[intervenes] 
MR MAHLOBO:   No.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not recall. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would the Intelligence brief have 
10 
stipulated the purpose of the project? 
MR MAHLOBO:   What is an intelligence brief?  The 
intelligence brief …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Mr Mahlobo, we are really stuck for 
time and that is [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no, I am helping you, Mr 
Pretorius, because remember this thing is also beamed(?) 
somewhere 
else. 
 
If 
here 
you 
are 
going 
to 
create 
impression when already our integrity around dealing with 
intelligence in public they are corrected, it is a problem.  
20 
You know an intelligence brief is an information, it does 
not tell you about the sources, it does not tell you about 
the methodology they use, it does not actually tell you 
about the issues about finances, the Intelligence brief tell 
you about the risk, how, what is the rate of that particular 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 363 of 383 
 
risk and it will also be in a position to tell you what action 
has been taken, whether that particular action has worked 
or the decision that you need to make and you know how 
an intelligence brief, when you have got it.  After receiving 
an intelligence brief you see it depending on the level of 
classification and you sign for receiving some of those.  
Then, from there, because that document is only for your 
eyes only then intelligence brief get to be destroyed.  That 
is how it works because they can actually even land on 
wrong hands. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Pretorius’ question is whether 
ordinarily such a brief would tell you the purpose of the 
project. 
MR MAHLOBO:   That is why I took this [indistinct], Chair, 
to explain what is an Intelligence brief.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAHLOBO:   So that someone listening there must 
know what is an intelligence brief.  It does not contain the 
elements they should contain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does not tell you about the purpose of 
20 
the project. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, it does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There has been evidence before 
the Chair as I recall on more than one occasion that the 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 364 of 383 
 
purpose of the Operation Commitment was to pay sums of 
money in millions of rand to the former President.  Did you 
know about that? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I do not know about that.  Those who say 
so, they would probably know but I do not know about that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So do I understand your evidence 
in relation to Project Commitment to be the following, you 
do not know whether money was dispensed to your office in 
relation to Project Commitment? 
MR MAHLOBO:   I have responded to that, Chair. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Am I correct, is my summary 
correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Chair summarised it correctly, I 
agreed with the Chairs summary. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You are not prepared to answer the 
question. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, the Chair helped …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am just asking you, Mr Mahlobo, 
are you prepared to answer the question that I have just 
put to you? 
20 
MR MAHLOBO:   I have answered it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was a question which I put it in my 
way and he said it provided accurately what he wanted to 
convey. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will read the record, Chair.  The 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 365 of 383 
 
second issue is that you do not know of the evidence being 
correct 
or 
incorrect 
as 
to 
the 
purpose 
of 
Project 
Commitment, namely payment of monies ot the former 
President. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I have responded as correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is further evidence by Frank 
that I am going ask, Chair, that fall into the category of 
written questions because I want to deal with another 
topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, that is fine. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Verbally.  He does say in his 
affidavit though, Mr Mahlobo that he delivered under the 
head 
Project 
Mabuya 
certain 
monies 
to 
“a 
relevant 
recipient” and ...[intervenes]  
MR MAHLOBO:   Which page are we at now? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 1146.25 
MR MAHLOBO:   I am on a different page now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see where it says.  
“I was requested to collect and deliver money, 
R2.5million.  I took it to the relevant recipient, and 
20 
they signed for it.” 
I will ask him tomorrow who that is, I just wanted to alert 
you if you had any comment. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I am having a problem here 
...[intervenes]  
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 366 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He also talks of other deliveries of 
money in relation to Project Mabuyo project commitment, 
or operation commitment, and I am going to ask him detail 
of that and I’m offering you an opportunity to comment  if 
…[indistinct -dropped voice] that’s at page 1146.27. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I lost the pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if …[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’ll ask different questions, 
Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s not alleged that it was given to 
10 
him…[intervenes]. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, if it’s not to me, I will not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, the trouble is, Frank may 
identify the recipient, so I don’t know yet…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand that but I’m saying if, 
as things stand, you don’t understand that allegation to be 
that money was given to him, he can’t contribute anything. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well – I’ll deal with it tomorrow 
under another question Chair, I don’t want to argue the 
20 
point now…[intervenes] but I’ve given him a chance to 
comment, that’s all I’m saying.  I want to deal with the 
second topic, very briefly, Mr Mahlobo.  As I understand 
your evidence, the last time around, you were quite and 
unequivocal that you personally never received monies 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 367 of 383 
 
from SSA for operational purposes. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Its correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is some evidence, however, 
from witnesses who say the opposite. 
MR MAHLOBO:   I have seen it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what I want to put to you, 
some of it will be put to you in writing but I what I want to 
put to you is, the evidence of Dorothy which you’re 
probably aware of. 
MR MAHLOBO:   We dealt with it last time, I remember her 
10 
affidavit that there was some issues about clarity.  We 
dealt with Dorothy and I gave you my responses about her. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, she says firstly, that she 
handed money to you personally, although there is a 
qualification and that was an amount of R1.5million to your 
residence in Cape Town.  As I understand it, you deny 
that? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes, I deny it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   She also says that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Pretorius is that a reference 
20 
to 
the 
fist 
time 
when 
he 
said, 
she 
said, 
she 
did 
not…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the qualification is that it was 
in…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In a bag, she didn’t know whether there 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 368 of 383 
 
was money inside …[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   She understood it to contain 
R1.5million but never actually observed the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Yes, the answer is, I rebut it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, maybe – would she have delivered a 
bag to your residence in Cape Town which didn’t have 
money but had something else? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, Chair, you heard the evidence, and 
I was very pleased, the manner you handled the issue and 
10 
I’ve been reading Dorothy – there are a number of 
affidavits here but that incident of Cape Town, I don’t know 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Don’t know it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In summary and because of the 
intricacies of time Mr Mahlobo, I’m going to put to you, the 
evidence in summary.  Dorothy says on three occasions 
she withdrew from the SSA R4.51million.  She then counted 
20 
it at the cashier, put it into bags, signed for it.  She then 
says, she took it to your house in Pretoria, your residence, 
took the money out in your presence, in your study, 
counted it and then left.  I take it you deny that…[indistinct 
– dropped voice]? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 369 of 383 
 
MR MAHLOBO:   I deny it and very interesting I just want 
you, Chair, to point one matter.  My answer it’s a no but 
something very funny here.  There are – probably Mr 
Pretorius when you do your own assessment which has 
been something which has been trying me.  There are two 
affidavits, on affidavit the person claims to be given 
R4.5million over a period of six months  in my house.  
Then the next time the affidavit says, no, no, no its only 
three times and – which is not true, as I’ve said. Then 
there’s something funny, well I thought baba you’d ask that 
10 
question.  How do you count R4.5million, you know, do you 
have a machine to do this, how long did it take, well I know 
it’s implicit to that but it sounded very interesting but 
without wasting your time, Mr Pretorius, it’s a no but those 
were some of my interesting observations when you’re 
doing your job? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Fine, we’ve dealt with Frank’s 
affidavit and to the extent necessary we will put questions 
to you in writing.  I believed that you want to take five 
minutes to make a closing statement but if I may I just 
20 
want to put one more summary question.  There have been, 
either in evidence put to you or in evidence that will be put 
to you in the form of questions for your answer on affidavit, 
nine witnesses – well ten witnesses really that have given 
evidence to the effect that you have played a role in 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 370 of 383 
 
operations that you have actively involved yourselves in 
operations of the SSA, just summarising all the evidence.  
Why would they give false evidence? 
MR MAHLOBO:  Well, you know, Chairperson, one of the 
things that is not actually – well I don’t know because I’m 
not a lawyer to use the word, evidence, but when all they 
sat here those who sat here, they told you it’s a matter of 
hearsay.  There’s a matter that has been raised, Mr 
Pretorius, that maybe I must deal with, that at no point, I 
did an Executive overreach.  Even if you were to do an 
10 
Executive overreach, well this is…[indistinct] operations 
and if it was in an ordinary issue of procuring services 
which is a serious matter where an Executive get’s 
involved in procurement, which I’ve not done so but 
Ministers, we have a very clear – an interest, how is the 
department operating and when you have a clear interest 
on how the department is operating and ultimately, I have 
an oversight responsibility to report in terms of the law.  In 
the Intelligence Services there are challenges, and I don’t 
want to deny that they come from far.  There are 
20 
challenges when you come closer and check about whether 
people are using monies properly or not monies properly 
when you are actually getting complaints and you started 
to sit on people’s heads that these matters must be dealt 
with, there are a number of these lapses.  There are those 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 371 of 383 
 
people that will not want you to get involved in dealing with 
those issues, but the law requires to do so.  
 
There is always something funny because all of 
them, they’re using the word, “involved” in operations or 
using the word all.  You know, it’s impossible, as a project 
manager, I’m not a project manager  that thing requires a 
daily basis.  You’ll look at one affidavit, you might not have 
dealt with the ...[indistinct] of Miriam where Miriam on the 
matter, she was claiming that I was running the project 
myself. In her own affidavit Chair, she says she will only 
10 
communicate with me once or twice in a month, is it being 
operational. Only saying in the affidavit, I only presented 
to the Minister a PowerPoint presentation about this 
operation, only twice, is it being operational and I’m also 
on record Chair.  Where oversight you need to be hands on 
to see and there’s no law that precludes you.  Only law 
that you can’t do Executive overreach, I can’t appoint my 
family members there or my friends without a due process 
and I must declare my interest.  I can’t involve in 
procurement, which is the things I’ve not done. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The question, if I may return to it, 
Mr Mahlobo is, why would up to ten witnesses either 
directly or indirectly seek to claim falsely that you involved 
yourself in the operational matters of the SSA, is there any 
reason why ten witnesses would do it? 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398

MR MAHLOBO:   No as I was saying, Intelligence is 
politicised and you have seen yourself here, nobody can 
deny it.  They get to be having views about who must do 
who, they even have a view who must be a Minister or not 
a Minister.  I even know because I’m not here to – I’m here 
to help the Commission, one of the things that I have 
avoided to do, is to implicate people.  I know that people – 
they even went to former President to say he must remove 
me.  You know, for an example, Pretorius you’ll have a 
situation where people will say to you, which is a well-
10 
known issue.  Mr Mahlobo is a henchman for Mr Zuma. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Former President, why will a President, if 
he had intentions even to get the conference in Nasrec to 
be warned change a very good henchman like Mahlobo on 
the eve of the conference.  I was re-shuffled to Energy on 
the 16 t h of October two months before the elections and 
Intelligence operators, they will come here, they will give 
you some truth and they will also give you some, certain 
lies, and it’s one of the biggest issues, that’s why we must 
20 
support President Ramaphosa, including yourself to read 
Intelligence of the systematic …[indistinct].  One, around 
issues of politicisation that comes far beyond, when 
Intelligence was conceived that even continues today.  You 
can even see today there’s still tensions and at the end of 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 373 of 383 
 
the day, I’m not immune from those particular issues but I 
did on the best of my ability, that was – I’m not saying I 
was the best thing to happen in Intelligence, I tried, 
mishaps happened along the way, we tried to put those – 
people who would be able to judge us over time to say, did 
we do that but all of them who came here, Mr Pretorius, 
they could not demonstrate even the …[indistinct] report, 
even the high level review report, they all came and sat 
here, this is what we’re being told, this is what we are 
being told but when we said, give us evidence, give us 
10 
evidence, nobody gave them evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, lets just deal with that issue, 
very 
briefly 
if 
I 
may. 
 
The 
fact 
that 
there 
is 
no 
documentation to your satisfaction to support a particular 
averment, the fact that someone says, I went personally to 
the Minister ’s office and gave R4.5million – R4.51million to 
the 
Minister, 
the 
fact 
that 
there’s 
no 
supporting 
documentation that satisfies you or report or other official 
documentation, does not render that evidence false. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, you know…[intervenes]. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It’s evidence, it’s the most direct 
form of evidence. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, you know Mr Pretorius, I’m not a 
lawyer, I’ve never studied law, but I’ve operated at the 
highest level, even in administration.  Evidence that is 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 374 of 383 
 
admissible is not a hearsay, it will answer when, where, 
how and so forth but this Commission is not about that but 
immediately you start to venture into that where people 
they are saying here on record, I can’t recall this, I can’t 
recall this, this is what people, they were saying to you but 
despite those reservations about …[indistinct], I said, you 
know what, I will help this Commission because it’s our 
own creation.  Even there is certain constraints I’ve seen 
but I’ll help but let’s not – even if you can go to the Court 
of law, and you go and say these things, you know how 
10 
courts work but I don’t want to get into the juggle of 
debating that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think, maybe if I could just put it 
this way. I think Mr Pretorius is suggesting that even if – 
even if there is no documentary proof or evidence to 
support what they say, your answer is, they are all not 
telling the truth.  So, he’s question is, if they are all not 
telling the truth, it means they are falsely and deliberately 
giving false evidence against you. So, his question is, why 
would so many people all target you to give false evidence 
20 
against you.  He wants you to get a chance to deal with 
that issue. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Chairperson, you are putting it nicely, 
probably I don’t know why you are understanding the way 
you put it.  Chairperson have we ever bothered and asked 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 375 of 383 
 
the question about some of these lapses.  Why will 
someone at a level of a General Manager not follow certain 
systematic things that happen, why would that person do, 
knowingly so.  That’s one issue that I want to leave for 
your own assessment. Number two, only two people, only 
two people here, remember I’m accused, not by ten people, 
someone is accusing me in terms or a report.  Remember 
the other people that we are dealing with it’s not people 
that they have dealt with me.  Therefore, don’t say it’s ten 
but at the very same time Intelligence has a big component 
10 
I’m not going to tell you the strength of numbers. If, out of 
the Intelligence Services only these numbers are coming 
and say this, when you look – I do maths, I do stats and if 
you look at it in terms of the weight, what does it mean?  
I’m saying to you, whether is it me or any other Minister 
that will fall because of the toxic environment that is there, 
only perpetrated by few, depending on the dynamics that 
are happening in the country in the political life of the 
country, you will have problems.  Not – most Ministers that 
have gone there, they all raise issues, and you ask 
20 
yourselves, what’s happening even today they are still 
raising 
issues 
and 
if 
they 
raise 
issues, 
if 
you 
do 
diagnostic, what are we dealing with?  Are we dealing with 
very lousy Ministers, very corrupt Ministers, the answer is 
no, there are fundamental problems there that’s why when 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 376 of 383 
 
the Presidency say, I’m repurposing this thing, including 
the report that you’ll put, you’ll be able to start to lay a 
foundation, going forward, on how to deal with this? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, do I understand you to be 
conceding or saying that there are problems that need to 
be corrected? 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, I’m on record, I said Intelligence 
Services, like any Government Departments their problems 
are inherent. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’d just like to…[intervenes]. 
10 
MR MAHLOBO:   Even during my time they were there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’d just like to wrap this up very 
briefly, if I may.  Seven witnesses have given direct or 
indirect evidence with delivery of cash for operational 
projects to you personally or to your offices.  I want to then 
– that’s just by way of summary.  To the extent that these 
people are operatives why would they come to give false 
evidence, put their jobs at risk, their employment at risk, 
expose themselves to civil outcomes or consequences or 
even criminal outcomes and consequences by giving false 
20 
evidence.   I want to put it to you, it’s, in my view, 
inconceivable that they would do so. 
MR 
MAHLOBO: 
 
 
Well, 
in 
an 
ordinary 
world 
it’s 
inconceivable but in an Intelligence world it can happen 
and I should not be able to speculate – you know, one of 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 377 of 383 
 
the things that I’ve always avoided when I’m here, I don’t 
want to speculate about people’s motives but I’m clear, I 
know the environment I worked in and I know the 
characters and what the issues they were doing but at the 
very same time, I must be on record, in Intelligence there 
will always be robbed elements and there, there are good 
men  and women who do their job diligently but there are 
also politicians there who are actually politicking and 
politics is politics here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I also want to put it to you, finally , 
10 
that either their evidence is simply coincidence, or they’ve 
conspired together to give false evidence before they 
came, either of those are improbable. 
MR MAHLOBO:   Well, yourself, you have said here, I told 
you that this Intelligence Services are not immune from the 
politics of the ANC. I made an example here, that there are 
people both in the Intelligence Services and in the 
movement even everywhere who think that some of us are 
just underhand.  The former President just appointed 
people who know nothing, and we’re just being used.  I 
20 
was not used, I’m conscious, I’m a professional, I ran 
Government Baba Zondo, I ran departments where I got 
clean 
audits 
as 
an 
Accounting 
Officer, 
I 
know 
administration and I know politics. I will not break the law 
wittingly or unwittingly I know but at the very same time, 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 378 of 383 
 
this process tells you about the kind of capacity we have at 
the state, the kind of certain people that give them the 
highest responsibility where they come and do certain 
funny things and they want to find scapegoats, I know the 
law and as I was even saying, because everybody who 
came here, it was about President Zuma this, President 
Zuma this and this youngsters is hired, I even asked a 
simple question to you Chair.  Why will this President 
change a trusted confidant if he wanted to capture the ANC 
Nasrec.  Someone he thought, no, he’s so pliable that he 
10 
can do that.  Have we ever thought, you know these things 
Baba Zondo we must also be careful that this Commission 
must never be seen to be unwittingly playing to the games 
of politics that are happening outside?  You know there 
was an incident, Chairman Zondo, where the country – the 
media said I’m being deployed to become the Minister of 
Energy to conclude a nuclear deal.  Your Commission, 
baba Zondo, I got subpoenaed by your Commission earlier 
on where someone came and made soe funny insinuating 
statement in passing without saying that I signed a nuclear 
20 
deal. I got a subpoena here, when I asked for documents 
to prepare, that subpoena was withdrawn, it said, it was 
sent to me erroneously. I had not signed any nuclear deal, 
but the country knows that I signed a nuclear deal, I was 
the Minister of Energy only for four months.  I only 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 379 of 383 
 
finalised the integrated resource plan for this country, I 
was also able to finalise that we have an energy summit 
where we look at how energy should do that. 
 
Even it was funny where NGO took me to court, 
they say to court that I’ve signed a nuclear deal.  When 
we’re at the doors of the court they said let them produce 
evidence they say, no, no, no, they look at me, they think 
I’m going to do it.  This very same thing this Commission 
did 
where 
people 
come, 
make 
allegations 
without 
substance and you get to be called here.  I was called, 
10 
your records will show it but I’m not holding it against this 
and I’m saying it’s a very delicate balance that this 
Commission must do so that even when we come to use 
this platform for things other than what we are trying to do 
to cleanse ourselves of the issues of malfeasance and 
corruption, that we must fight but at the very same time we 
use other particular platforms to deal with other people. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In fairness to you I must put one 
last question, two last questions and I’m going to put it 
very 
carefully, 
so 
bear 
with 
me. 
If 
it 
were 
to 
be 
20 
argues…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We’ve gone past quarter to ten. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I know but in fairness I must put 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 380 of 383 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If it were to be argues or 
suggested 
that 
you 
had 
every 
motive 
to 
deny 
the 
allegations that have been put in evidence to you because 
you wanted to protect yourself from criminal sanctions, 
what would your answer be? 
MR MAHLOBO:   That’s not true, that’s not true, you know, 
as I was saying you are an inquisitorial Commission, but 
the reality is that if anyone wants to open a case, let him 
do that but at the very same time, why should I actually 
say 
certain 
things 
have 
happened 
when 
they’ve 
not 
10 
happened when people can’t even recall, why should I be 
forced to say that …[indistinct]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The other point I’d like to make for 
your comment is that it appears that you have very strong 
views about the need for secrecy in operational matters, is 
that not a possible reason for denying involvement in 
operational matters? 
MR MAHLOBO:   You know, it’s not that I have strong 
views, just know that Intelligence in South Africa is highly 
regulated that’s why I took the trouble to demonstrate to 
20 
you where people come and create an impression that 
people, they do as they please.  This is highly regulated 
and the issues of secrecy and in terms of the doctrine of 
Intelligence, Intelligence is a trade craft, it works in a 
particular 
way. 
 
It’s 
not 
my 
view, 
it’s 
what 
I 
was 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 381 of 383 
 
implementing in law.  You know if I was sticking to secrecy, 
I was going to come here and become funny when you ask 
me any operational matter, I would have refused to answer.  
The only thing I’ve refused to do is when you started to 
disclose names and identities of people, but I’ve been very 
cooperating here, helping you to deal with matters that, 
ordinarily, I should not.  I would have, even refused, if I 
never respected you and the ANC and President to come 
and discuss Intelligence matters in public because they’re 
not discussed in public. When at the very same time I 
10 
participated in a high level review panel, but I’ve always 
been prepared to come and account, that’s what I’ve done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we must stop now Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair Mr Mahlobo did indicate 
that he would like a minute or two, I think I’ve reduced it 
from five minutes to a minute or two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is here anything you want…[intervenes]. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...to make some closing remarks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there is I hope it’s one or two minutes. 
MR MAHLOBO:   No, no, no Chair, it’s just to convey my 
20 
sincere thanks to you for allowing me the opportunity to 
come 
here 
and 
respond 
to 
a 
number 
of 
baseless 
allegations and being very fair.  You’ve been fair with your 
team, I must also try to thank Mr Pretorius, I know it was 
not personal, we might differ on certain issues and – but it 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 382 of 383 
 
was all in the spirit of getting information.  At the very 
same time we need to wish you well Bab Zondo, it is not an 
easy situation, and we hope that when you conclude this 
work [speaking in vernacular].  We will look at the report 
when it comes at a particular point and then we will see 
because all of us we are trying an effort to help our 
country, but whatever we have done here and people that 
will come please let  us handle the matters of national 
security with the sensitivity it deserves, and remember 
whatever we are doing here we are being watched and our 
10 
relationship 
with 
other 
people 
in 
the 
world 
is 
very 
important, but I hope I never gave you trouble, because I 
came here in spite of some of the administrative barriers, 
the [speaking in vernacular] I must thank my legal team 
there, Comrade Adonias and Comrade Ayanda despite that 
I was not even given money to have lawyers to be paid for 
documents I have subjected myself here as my President 
has expected me to do, and the ANC, we will have to be 
able jointly to find a way to support how to strengthen our 
institution, including Intelligence Services, we will always 
20 
be available to make an input, but at the very same time I 
am very cognisant, I don’t want to rule from the grave, I 
have done my part, I have served my country to the best of 
my ability. 
 
If there were mistakes along the way I will take 
19 MAY 2021 – DAY 398 
 
Page 383 of 383 
 
responsibility, but where people accuse me falsely I will 
ont agree, [speaking in vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No thank you, thank you for availing 
yourself Mr Mahlobo.  We appreciate it and as indicated if 
there are any further questions that Mr Pretorius would 
have liked to put but time did not permit he will send 
questions to your legal team and would ask you to respond 
to them by way of an affidavit, but thank you very much for 
availing yourself, thank you to your legal team for their 
cooperation, thank  you Mr Pretorius and your team, thank 
10 
you to the investigators, thank you to the technicians and 
to the staff, I thank all of you for your perseverance for us 
to sit until this time, and for your cooperation, thank you 
very much.    
MR MAHLOBO:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
MR MAHLOBO:   And I still need to thank Mr Pretorius, 
thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
