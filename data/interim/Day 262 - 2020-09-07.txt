the executives who was suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tshediso Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And in respect of him we will be using 
the bundle marked Exhibit U13 – 13. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be confusing Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is Eskom Bundle 01. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ah indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And inside it it must be having Exhibit 
U13. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  We must just make sure that the witness 
has got the right bundle as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – the witness… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has got the right bundle? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 6 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Has exactly the right bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  No that is fine please 
administer the oath.  You might wish to move your mask as 
you take the oath Mr Matona.  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Please keep your microphone on for the 
moment.  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR MATONA:  Tshediso Matona. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR MATONA:  No. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR MATONA:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, you may be seated.  Mr 
20 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Depending on what is going to happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to your second witness.  It 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 7 of 179 
 
may be that you might spend more time with this witness to 
deal with various matters properly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there is no – if the second witness will 
be rescheduled. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So I – I am just mentioning that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  No I – I appreciate that 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will ask my junior to attend to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  While we proceed with the first witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson I should also draw to your 
attention that this witness has testified in a closed session 
and a transcript of his testimony in the closed sessions is 
contained in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As Item 16 – 16. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  16? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  16 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I will get to it in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have a suspicion that your voice 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 8 of 179 
 
must – might be so soft that the transcribers might not 
hear you clearly and somebody is nodding.  So I think just 
try and raise your voice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will raise it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:    Let me have a sip of water.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there water for the witness there?  
Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson the witness has also 
provided the commission with an affidavit in which event 
10 
much of what is contained in the affidavit Chairperson will 
be confirmed by the witness.  Mr Matona if I may proceed 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Matona thank you.  You have the 
bundle in front of you Eskom Bundle 01 Exhibit U13. 
MR MATONA:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That bundle has an index to it 
with seventeen items to it.  It is a two page index with 
seventeen items.  Can you see that? 
20 
MR MATONA:  I can see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Now you have provided the 
commission with an affidavit which is contained on page 2 
of that bundle onwards.  If you – and when I refer to page 
2 I am referring to the paginated page in the right hand 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 9 of 179 
 
corner which is in a red colour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Um. 
MR MATONA:  I can see it – I can see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure what the arrangement is.  
You would see that there are two paginated numbers or 
numbers of pagination. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are the red numbers and the black 
10 
numbers.  Now for a long time we used to have only the 
red numbers but that changed a few weeks ago and since 
then there has – whenever there are two numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Black and red there has been reliance on 
the black numbers for pagination.  Now that came about 
because what the people preparing the bundles had done 
with regard to the red numbers is that they had paginated 
sections in a bundle independently of one another with the 
result that in one bundle you could get three pages 10 – or 
20 
page 10’s – pages 10 and I said that the pagination should 
be sequential so that from the first page up to the last 
page in the bundle the numbers follow one another. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they started doing the black 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 10 of 179 
 
numbers.  So I am just explaining that so that if that is 
something you understand but there is a reason that we 
stick to the red numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that – that is – that is a special 
deliberate decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I – I understand Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What was prepared for this witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is a bundle that was used in the closed 
session. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And they prepared it without using the 
black numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So for present purposes Chairperson 
we will follow the red numbering because that is the only – 
20 
his bundle and I only have the red numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But yours will have the two numberings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 11 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the red ones are sequential. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The red ones I can confirm they are 
sequential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  No that is fine.  Because the 
whole point is simply that we must not have two 10 pages 
10 and so on and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  It is just that I think 
at the beginning of each bundle it would be important to 
place on record whether we are using red numbers or black 
10 
numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Matona for present 
purposes we will use the red numbering or pagination in 
the right-hand corner of your file.  You follow that? 
MR MATONA:  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Just remember to speak out and 
not 
to 
nod 
so 
that 
the 
record 
can 
capture 
your 
communication to the Chairperson.   
20 
MR MATONA:  Certainly Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So are we saying the 
affidavit is contained on page 2 of this bundle up until to 
page 29 and I am referring to the red pagination? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 12 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Matona you have indicated or stated 
rather in your affidavit and we could simply confirm this on 
record before we get to the other issues.  On page 3 that 
you were appointed at Eskom – you were – I will read it on 
record. 
“I was appointed on 1 October 2014 as 
Chief Executive of Eskom Holdings a state-
owned public company and as an Executive 
Director of its board my recruitment was 
conducted by the Board of Directors of 
10 
Eskom during” 
And you will have to explain to the Chairperson the 
corrections that you made during the closed sessions.  As 
you can see there it says 1994.  Do you see that? 
MR MATONA:  Yes I see that.  It should have said 2014.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  It should read 2014? 
MR MATONA:  2014 that is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“Through a job advertisement short listing 
an 
interview 
process 
which 
in 
turn 
20 
recommended 
my 
appointment 
to 
the 
Minister of Public Enterprises the latter 
then secured the approval of the cabinet for 
my appointment.” 
So save for that correction you confirm what is 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 13 of 179 
 
stated there? 
MR MATONA:  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you have also stated in your 
affidavit that is on – if you turn to page 9 and so you would 
see that I am not reading the zeros before the number. 
MR MATONA:  Huh-uh.  I am on page 9 yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You follow – you refer to – are you on 
page 9? 
MR MATONA:  I am at page 9 that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is a heading there 11 March 
10 
2015.  Can you see that? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You refer to a meeting which takes 
place on the 11 March 2015 convened prior to the arrival of 
the Minister. 
MR MATONA:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That 11 March 2015 you go on to relate 
what happened during that day and I wish to – I wish you 
to turn to page – page 10. 
MR MATONA:  I am with you. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 18.13. 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To paragraph 19 on page 12 where you 
deal with the reasons for your suspension in paragraph 19.  
You see that? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 14 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now would you tell the Chairperson 
when were you suspended at Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  So as the affidavit indicates I was 
suspended on the 11 t h March on the evening of the 11 
March that was at the end of what had been a board 
meeting that had commenced that morning.  But as I 
indicate in my affidavit a board meeting from which I was 
requested to recuse myself together with the Financial – 
Finance Director Ms Tsholofelo Molefe we were requested 
10 
to recuse ourselves from that meeting.  And we were only 
called at the end of the day towards the evening and were 
informed of what had been deliberations of – of the board 
which included a decision to suspend us – or at least 
myself because I was called alone and informed that I was 
– I was being suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Could you tell the Chairperson 
what reasons were you given for your suspension? 
MR MATONA:  Well the reason for the suspension was the 
fact that the board has resolved that there should be an 
20 
enquiry or some kind of investigation into the affairs of the 
company which investigation they had a view required that 
myself and – and of course – you know the other 
executives be absent from the company.  So we would – we 
– the idea was to ensure that we are not – we are not 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 15 of 179 
 
present 
whilst 
this 
enquiry 
was 
being 
– 
was 
being 
undertaken.  So that was the reason.  And of course, as my 
affidavit indicates it is a reason which I was opposed to.  I 
could not at that stage the company required the kind of 
enquiry that had been proffered as the reason why I should 
set aside.  And I might also add Chairperson that all along 
the 
way 
the 
board 
had 
insisted 
that 
there 
was 
no 
wrongdoing on my part.  I had not done anything wrong.  I 
had no committed any misconduct they just wanted me to 
away whilst this enquiry was underway. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So to your recollection was the word 
suspension used in that communication with you? 
MR MATONA:  The word suspension was not used.  The – 
the suggestion was something along the lines that you 
know how can you help us achieve the objective of not – 
you not being here.  You know.  So we – you know – I was 
a bit confused about where this was going.  And I explicitly 
asked so are you – can I come to work tomorrow which 
means the next day – can I come back to work the next 
day?  And at that point they said no, no you know you – we 
20 
would like you not to be here.  Then I said to them, well 
actually can I just go home and think about this?  Can I go 
and think about how I might assist this process?  At that 
point I was told okay we have heard you just give us about 
a moment.  I – then I left the meeting for about half an 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 16 of 179 
 
hour.  I was then called back after half an hour at which 
point, I was served with a letter of suspension.  So I was 
then informed that well listen we have heard you but we 
have resolved to suspend you and I was immediately 
handed that letter right there and then.  So I left that 
meeting having been a suspended Chief Executive of 
Eskom.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you turn to page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that.  You had been at Eskom 
for only about five months eleven days when you were 
10 
suspended, is that right? 
MR MATONA:  That is right.   So from the 1 October to the 
11 March is just a little over five months really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And who was the Chairperson of the 
board of Eskom at the time you served as its Chief 
Executive? 
MR MATONA:  The Chairperson of the board at the time 
was Mr Zola Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and throughout your time? 
MR MATONA:  Throughout my time yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And at the meeting of 11 t h was he 
chairing that meeting? 
MR MATONA:  He was chairing that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The enquiry that you were – that 
was proposed had you heard about it or it is the need for 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 17 of 179 
 
there to be such an enquiry prior to the meeting? 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  So at about the 8 t h which was – I 
remember it was a Sunday evening we – we get a notice of 
a meeting that is being called – a very short notice for the 
next day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  And – and which meeting you know had a – 
a proposed resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  It was a bit peculiar because resolutions of 
10 
the company are prepared by the Company Secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  But – but in fact the Company Secretary 
was drawing our intention to the fact that there is an email 
requesting a meeting and when I went to look at – at that 
email there was this resolution – proposed resolution for 
an enquiry into the affairs of – of the company.  The long 
and short is that then the meeting convened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So -  you were saying the norm is that 
resolutions of the board used to be prepared by the 
20 
Company Secretary? 
MR MATONA:  That is how it should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but was it like that before this 
particular one? 
MR MATONA:  It was like that before. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 18 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  That is what – that is standard practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Invariably or there has been exceptions 
as far as you know/ 
MR MATONA:  As far as I know the – there is no… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There had been no exceptions? 
MR MATONA:  There is no – there is no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  Exception Chair.  And the point about it is 
to ensure that matters that serve for which the board is 
10 
going to take a decision are properly processed through 
you know the administration of the company for which the 
Company Secretary is responsible.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you get to know prior to the 
meeting 
of 
the 
11 t h 
who 
had 
drafted 
that 
proposed 
resolution? 
MR MATONA:  I never got to know who had drafted that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  That – and the issue did not arise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MATONA:  In the meeting that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  What – what was discussed was what is the 
rationale and the whole point about this enquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And – but the notice for a 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 19 of 179 
 
meeting who did it come from? 
MR MATONA:  It – so I was working for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Chairperson or… 
MR MATONA:  I was notified by the Company Secretary I 
think it was at the request of the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And the enquiry it was said 
the enquiry was to look into the affairs of Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that how broad it was going to be? 
MR MATONA:  It was as broad – it was as broad as that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And it was said that you 
should be – you should not be coming to work while that 
enquiry was going on? 
MR MATONA:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But it was said that there was no 
suggestion that you had done anything wrong? 
MR MATONA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay please continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that – before you 
20 
were excused from the meeting of the board did you get to 
know who was sponsoring this resolution or pushing for 
this proposal for an enquiry and also for the suspension or 
is that something you could not tell? 
MR MATONA:   What the chairperson had said in that 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 20 of 179 
 
meeting that was called a short notice on the 9 t h, he has said 
he had been requested by the minister and the president.  
He indicated that, in fact, that he had spoken to both the 
minister and the president and they suggested that such an 
inquiry be...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And the president is a reference to the 
President of the Republic? 
MR MATONA:   President Zuma or president of the country 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he said he had spoken to the president 
and the minister about this proposal. 
MR MATONA:   About this... yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MATONA:   That it be an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Matona, 
then you talked about you being handed a letter of 
suspension.  Let us see on page 328. 
20 
MR MATONA:   Which tab are you referring to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   6.  Item 6. 
MR MATONA:   Item 6.  Yes, I can see the letter of 
suspension yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the letter of suspension? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 21 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   That is the letter.  That is the letter that I 
was handed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now let me read that into the record so 
we can see what was stated.  It is a letter on Eskom’s 
letterhead dated the 11 March 2015.  It is addressed to 
yourself.  It says: 
“Dear, Mr Matona.  Notice of suspension as Eskom 
Chief Executive.” 
 
It reads: 
“I refer you to the meeting of today, 11 March 2015, 
10 
wherein 
we 
discussed 
the 
company’s 
concern 
regarding the serious state of the company and the 
board resolution to conduct an independent inquiry 
into the possibility that the power delivery may be 
compromised 
by 
either 
intentional 
or 
negligent 
conduct. 
Due to the nature of this inquiry and the important of 
it being free of any influence from leadership within 
the 
organisation 
and 
the 
completion 
of 
an 
investigation into these matters, you should be 
20 
placed on suspension without any loss, benefits and 
pay. 
I confirm that you were advised of the nature and 
the extent of the inquiry and that you were afforded 
an opportunity to make representations to the board 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 22 of 179 
 
sub-committee 
why 
you 
should 
not 
suspended 
pending the outcome of the inquiry.” 
 
May I close there?  Because I see the word suspension 
has been mentioned two times in the two paragraphs that I 
have read.  Did you have the opportunity to read this letter 
at the time it was handed up to you? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, I did.  As you can imagine, this – now it 
is coming as a bit of shock where I now sit and I see a letter.  
Besides me the chairperson is sitting, besides me, and I see 
this letter and I see the subject in bold capital letters.   
10 
 
And I just quickly looked through the letter.  And in fact, 
I put it on record that where it says that I have been given an 
opportunity to make representation that in fact I have not 
been given such an opportunity to make representation.   
 
So I took exception to that.  But, of course in the end, I 
accepted the letter.  Ja.  Received the letter as it were.  So 
it was a very imperfect situation, you know, where I got that 
time to apply myself to the issues that are in this letter.   
 
But I could see where the board was going already at 
that stage.  I could see where the board was going. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You could see what/ 
MR MATONA:   I could see where the board was going.  I 
could see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Where was it going. 
MR MATONA:   The board was headed towards suspending 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 23 of 179 
 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR 
MATONA: 
  Ja.  Because I, eventually, in the 
conversation with them where, you know, where I asked 
them:  Should I come to work?  And they said:  No, no, no.  
We are not saying you should come to work.   
 
You know, maybe we make a suggestion and that type of 
thing.  And I said to them:  Well, actually, if it... you... 
someone had used the word you can recuse yourself.   
 
So I said:  Well, actually, I have recused myself in the 
10 
morning and a recusal is a temporary withdrawal.  What you 
are suggesting... because the inquiry was supposed to be 
going for three months.  It is actually that you are 
suspending me.   
 
Of course, nobody kind of, you know, confirmed that they 
knowing people that were suspending until I came back and I 
was formally handed the letter but in fact, I was suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you can recall.  Were all the 
members of the board that day or is something you have not 
checked?  You cannot remember whether it was a full board 
20 
meeting? 
MR MATONA:   The other way was of the board that started 
with the meeting in the morning has since left.  So it was 
only a few members of the board, the chairperson, the 
second present in that meeting where I was handed this 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 24 of 179 
 
letter of suspension and two other board members.   
 
I later heard that they are the sub-committee of the 
board for Human Resources.  It was called People in 
Governance, the committee of the board.  There was a 
committee that I was with.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there... that board meeting of 
11 March, the second meeting of that board, because I think 
that board had been appointed, I may be wrong, it was the 
end of the previous year, or not really? 
MR MATONA:   You are right, Chairperson.  That board was 
10 
a fairly new board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In fact, this inquiry – the issue of this 
inquiry was probably the first substantive issue that that 
board had to deal with.  They had not taken any decision 
previously.  They had, in fact, not actually properly met as a 
board.  That was almost like the first meeting of a new board 
as it were.  You are right. 
MR MATONA:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Let us go into 
20 
that, Mr Matona.  We will come back to this.  You appointed 
effective 1 October 2014 as the CEO of Eskom.  When was 
this board appointed? 
MR MATONA:   This was appointed in December.  December 
that 2014. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 25 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   December 2014? 
MR MATONA:   Ja, 2014.  It was late.  I recall it was late in 
the month of December.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, do you... the Chairperson already 
asked you who was the chairperson of the board.  You said it 
was Mr Tsotsi.  Can you recall the names of the other 
members of this board? 
MR MATONA:   Ben Ngubane was on that board.  And a lady 
called Ms Venete Klein.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is spelt V-e-t-e? 
10 
MR MATONA:   V-e-n-e-te.  Klein.  K-l-e-i-n.  Venete Klein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MR MATONA:   As well as Romeo Khumalo.  And then 
another lady who had in fact been carried over from a 
previous board, Ms T Mabuda.  Those are the names I can 
remember at the top of my head.  And it is largely because I 
subsequently had interactions with some of those people.  
But there were probably another five members of the board.  
We all knew that I quite remember everyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Mr Tsotsi not one of those who had 
20 
sat in the previous board and continued? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was one of those? 
MR MATONA:   He was, yes.  Yes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 26 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was a person ...[intervenes]  
MR MATONA:   He was a carryover from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...previous board as well? 
MR MATONA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The new chairperson of the previous 
board as well? 
MR MATONA:   He had been the chairperson of the previous 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MATONA:   And he has been retained into the new 
board, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I would suppose that by virtue of you 
being the CEO, you would have formed out of the board as 
an executive director? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did this board, which is appointed in 
December 2014, have an induction prior to – after it had 
been appointed? 
20 
MR MATONA:   As is normal practise and a very good culture 
in the – at least the state owned companies that I am 
familiar with and Eskom included, a new board has to go 
through an induction and that board did go through an 
induction in January – at the beginning of that year, 2015, 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 27 of 179 
 
January.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall whether you attended the 
induction? 
MR MATONA:   I did.  I would have because I actually took 
the board through, you know, the strategy of the company 
and some of the challenges that the company had been 
grabbled with up to the time of the appointment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the induction would have taken place 
in February 2015, you say? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Now 
when, 
according 
to 
your 
recollection, was the first board meeting of the board 
scheduled in 2015? 
MR MATONA:   So the regular meeting of the board would 
have been on the 26t h of February, according to the calendar 
because it is a board calendar as it were.  So that was a 
meeting scheduled on the 26t h.  But if I may just go ahead?  
Because that meeting did not happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I... yes, I was going to ask you 
whether, did the meeting take place? 
20 
MR MATONA:   The meeting did not happen.  On the eve of 
that evening, we got a notice from the company secretary 
that he had been requested by the chairperson of the board 
to inform us that that meeting will no longer go ahead and 
the reason for the cancellation of the meeting had to do with 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 28 of 179 
 
the minister, that it was at the request of the minister.  It was 
a request of the minister that that board meeting not proceed 
as it were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And were you given another date for a 
board meeting? 
MR MATONA:   We were not given another day.  So we, you 
know, the meeting was postponed subject to notification of 
when it would convene as it turned out, you know, the next 
opportunity for the board to meet was in that instance of that 
kind of urgent meeting that was called on the 8t h.   
10 
 
It was about a week later, according to my calculation, 
for the meeting that was postponed.  It was a week later that 
we get this notice on the Sunday evening, calling an urgent 
meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So did that meeting – you say your 
recollection is that it was a week later – did that meeting 
take place? 
MR MATONA:   Yes.  The meeting took place on the 9t h and 
this where the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the 9t h of March? 
20 
MR MATONA:   The 9t h of March, correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
MR MATONA:   2015.  Correct.  The 9t h of March 2015.  So it 
was a very brief meeting, I might add because at that point 
when the suggestion of an inquiry and, you know, attributed 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 29 of 179 
 
to the minister was raised, the board members, many of 
them, almost all without exception said:  Well, actually, we 
do not understand.   
 
We have hardly been given sufficient information why 
such an inquiry would be required.  And if it is attributed to 
the minister, we suggest that minister address herself 
directly to the board.   
 
And then of course, the minister then attended the 
meeting that was convened on the 11t h from which I was 
requested to recuse myself.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, so that we understand.  What was 
the purpose of that meeting of the 9t h of March?  What was 
on the agenda for that meeting? 
MR MATONA:   That meeting, we had one item.  That was a 
proposed resolution to allocate an inquiry.  There was only 
one item like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the meeting of the 9t h was intended to 
deal with the proposal of an inquiry? 
MR MATONA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that stage, that is the 9t h, as far as you 
20 
knew, was there a contemplation by anybody that certain 
executives would need to be suspended? 
MR MATONA:   Not at that stage, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not at that stage? 
MR MATONA:   Not at that stage. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 30 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   There was no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mention of that. 
MR MATONA:   ...no indication whatsoever that in fact that 
was an idea consider this part of the proposal to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In respect of that meeting, Mr Matona, 
you say you were notified.  You were given notification of 
that meeting? 
MR MATONA:   Yes.  The notification is the one is spoke to 
10 
earlier that came on the evening of the 8t h, the Sunday, the 
evening of the 8t h to convene a meeting on the 9 t h in the 
morning which meeting occurred but it was very brief.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   Because, you know, the board members at 
that stage, they were taken by surprise.  You know, my 
impression was that they were taken by surprise by this 
suggestion of an inquiry and requested, you know, the 
minister to address them directly which happened two days 
later. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prior to the meeting, were the board 
members, including yourself, furnished with a copy of what 
would be proposed at the meeting? 
MR MATONA:   Can you repeat that question, advocate? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the notification about the meeting of 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 31 of 179 
 
the 9t h, were you furnished with the proposal that would be 
made at that meeting or discussed at that meeting? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, as I indicated, that was attached to the 
email, calling for that meeting a document which was like a 
draft resolution of the company.   
 
Now, the one think I recall that was strange about it, is 
that normally, you know, board resolutions would air the, you 
know, the letterhead of the company, you know, as Eskom.   
 
So this looked like a kind of a draft that had been 
prepared.  It did not – or the kind of normal headlines, you 
10 
know... sorry, letterhead and the format.  The format.   
 
There is a standard format of Eskom Board Resolutions.  
It did not have that.  So it appeared a bit peculiar to me.  But 
anyway.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So then the chairperson asked 
whether the suspension of the executives – and I want to 
repeat that – whether it was contained, that aspect was 
contained, in that proposal? 
MR MATONA:   As I have indicated, it was not.  I certainly 
did 
not 
pick it up that 
part 
of the, 
you 
know, the 
20 
contemplation of such a resolution would be that executives 
will be suspended.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I want to... I would like you to turn 
to page 381.   
MR MATONA:   381? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 32 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think you said 385. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eight, one.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, eight one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eight, one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Mr Seleka, you earlier on 
referred the witness to his affidavit which is at the beginning 
of the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not think you have asked me to 
admit it as an exhibit.  Should we not do that?  As well as, if 
any other documents that are not attached to affidavits, they 
would need to be admitted as exhibits at the right time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I mention that because you have 
referred to:  Is that your suspension? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
you 
were 
referring 
to 
other 
documents.  I do not want us to forget the admission of his 
20 
affidavit.  Do you want me to that now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Shall we do that rather? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you meant to be ready to tell me 
what exhibit number it should be but as – and all the others 
when we get to them.  The affidavit of Mr Tshediso Matona 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 33 of 179 
 
appearing on page – starting from page 2 of Exhibit Bundle 
01 will be admitted.  And let me just also say, it is an 
affidavit deposed to on the 17t h of August 2020.  It will be 
admitted and marked as Exhibit... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I propose to the Chairperson the 
exhibit number? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or get ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you need to tell me.  I see there is – 
you take him on the spine of the file.  I do not know whether 
10 
– probably it should be U13 and the whatever else might 
come later, might have to be ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So following that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...15 and so on and so on.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Let me propose a different one, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because there are files which are 
already U14 and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...U15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We could have Exhibit U13 A, B, C, D. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is actually indeed in order, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Or U Exhibit, U13.1. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 34 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exhibit, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
this 
affidavit 
will 
be 
Exhibit 
U...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   U13.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   U13.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
AFFIDAVIT OF MR TSHEDISO MATONA IS ADMITTED AND 
MARKED AS U13.1 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then as we go along... obviously, it is 
going to be... it would be much more convenient if the 
numbering follows the sequence of the document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
That 
might 
or 
might 
not 
cause 
complication in terms for what you purpose. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is exactly what I am thinking, 
Chairperson.  So that – because the order of the evidence 
20 
may not be in the sequence of the index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we could at the end mark them 
chronologically those exhibits we have referred to and then 
have them formally admitted at that stage. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 35 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With the correct numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In a sequential order.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  There are two ways of doing it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One is to take an adjournment and identify 
those that you are going to need, to refer to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is one.  Two.  Then, decide on 
10 
the sequence.  Maybe the sequence might have to be 
changed or maybe you might stay with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But just be certain how the numbering is 
going to go.  Because another way might be clumsy if we 
mark them as we go along but you end up with Exhibit U13.2 
being right at the end. [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Immediately after U13.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what do you say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think, the Chairperson’s proposal, it is 
rather a more convenient way of doing it, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We could take a short adjournment. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 36 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I would then mark them accordingly.  All 
of them that I will refer to so that as and when I go through 
them, they get admitted into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  I am 
sorry Mr Matona.  We need to do some housekeeping that 
needs to be done just so that everything will smooth swiftly 
thereafter.   
MR MATONA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe 30-minutes might be enough? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, let us take a 30-minutes 
adjournment.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it the bundle has been sorted out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It has thank you DCJ for you 
indulgence.  If we could then admit those that we have, let 
20 
us start with the affidavit of Mr Matona DCJ because we 
have marked them, we have referred to it already and we 
can now accept it into the evidence as Exhibit U13.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have marked the rest but they will 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 37 of 179 
 
be admitted as and when we get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Matona I think we were at the 
meeting of the 9 t h of March and you said there was only 
one item on the agenda for that meeting.  
MR MATONA:   Yes, there was.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have already explained that the 
item was a proposed resolution to initiate an enquiry.  
MR MATONA:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you attend the meeting? 
10 
MR MATONA:   I did.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall what transpired in that 
meeting? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, which stuff I have already dealt with 
briefly earlier.  It was to propose an enquiry on the back of 
a resolution, a draft resolution which had been sent along 
with the communication, the email communication you know 
calling for this urgent meeting and when that meeting 
convened it just so happen that the rest of the board 
members were present.  It did not feel ready, it did not feel 
20 
informed and therefore you know could not proceed to 
resolve as it had been the intention of convening that 
meeting.   
          So 
the 
meeting 
was 
then 
adjourned 
on 
the 
understanding that if it is attributed to the Minister then the 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 38 of 179 
 
Minister would have to – the board members requested the 
Minister to address herself directly.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, well do you know or did you know 
at the time a gentleman called Mr Nick Linnell? 
MR MATONA:   No, I do not know anybody by that name I 
did discover that there is such a name but I had never met 
him before.  I do not even know how he looks like.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am going to refer you briefly to his 
affidavit because he says that he was invited to the 
meeting of the 9 t h of March 2015.  Would you have any 
10 
idea that he was at Eskom at the time? 
MR MATONA:   No, to my recollection he was not present 
in the meeting of the 9 t h neither was any mention of 
someone like him having been kind of invited.  He did not 
feature to the best of my recollection in the meeting on the 
9 t h.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, his affidavit to the Commission 
is on page 367. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka have you moved away 
completely from the letter of suspension or you will come 
20 
back to it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which page must we go to? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 39 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   367.  
CHAIRPERSON:   367.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is under item 8.  The page starts 
with 
an 
index 
which 
is 
titled 
scheduled 
documents, 
schedule of documents.  If you turn the page which is the 
affidavit deposed by Mr Nicholas Q Linnell.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, I am on page 367 and I see this 
schedule of documents.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and if you turn to page 368 there 
10 
is the affidavit.  
MR MATONA:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of Mr Nicholas Linnell.  
MR MATONA:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice is going down Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it down again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, I beg your pardon.  
Chair for the purposes of admitting the affidavit into the 
20 
record we have marked it U13.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one starting at page 371? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At page…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry 368 I was looking at the black 
numbers.   
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 40 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 368 but it has a cover page on 
page 367. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja but the actual affidavit starts on 
page 368.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is Exhibit U13.7.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Exhibit U13? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 7.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said B I think.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 7.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Point 7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Nicholas Q Linnell 
starting at page 368 that is red numbers will be admitted 
and marked as Exhibit U13.7.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  You are there Mr 
Matona?  
MR MATONA:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now there are certain portions of the 
20 
affidavit I want to refer you to so you would see quickly 
just for context in paragraph 5 of that affidavit.  Are you 
there? 
MR MATONA:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Mr Linnell writes I was contacted 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 41 of 179 
 
on 6 March 2015 from Ms Dudu Myeni and asked to travel 
the same day to Pretoria to attend an urgent meeting with 
the President.  At that time, I was well known to Ms Myeni 
who had been a client of mine from time to time over a 
number of years on various projects in her representative 
capacity at Mhlathuze Water Board and South African 
Airways.   
          At this time, I was engaged in a major project at 
SAA similar but on a smaller scale to what would become 
the subject of this deposition.  On arrival at the President 
10 
sometime after midday I met with Ms Myeni no one else 
attended that meeting.  While the SAA met, I might also 
have been discussed in the context of this deposition Ms 
Myeni informed me that the President was concerned about 
the state of Eskom and wanted an in depth investigation 
into its affairs.   
          She had recommended to the President that I would 
be suitable for the role.  Ms Myeni proceeded to brief me 
on 
the 
background 
for 
an 
enquiry 
included 
in 
this 
discussion was reference to some documentation that Ms 
20 
Myeni had.  The President did not join that meeting as I 
understood he was unexpectedly otherwise engaged.  To 
the best of my recollection it was then agreed that I would 
need to travel to Durban on Sunday the 8 t h March to meet 
with the President to complete this briefing and mandate.  I 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 42 of 179 
 
left with an understanding that I would be asked to conduct 
an enquiry into Eskom and I ought to be prepared for that.   
          Now I am going to skip some of those paragraphs 
and go to paragraph 15.  So he says there in paragraph 15, 
I attended the meeting in Durban on Sunday 8 March 2015.  
When I arrived at the presidency Mr Tsotsi and Ms Dudu 
Myeni were there in attendance was also Ms Myeni’s son 
and another person introduced as Jabu.  At that time, I 
knew nothing of Jabu’s role at large.  Now he talks about 
what transpired in the meeting but please go with me to the 
10 
next page 5 of 23, page 371.  Are you there?             
MR MATONA:   Yes, I am there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, paragraph 23 says as the 
matter was urgent, I would travel to Johannesburg the 
following day and be available to the board as and when 
required on the Monday 9 March 2015.  That evening I 
drafted 
a 
proposal 
board 
memorandum, 
proposed 
resolutions and forwarded these to Mr Tsotsi.   
          The email also provided progress guidance notes 
for Mr Tsotsi for the board meeting.  This note emphasised 
20 
the need to inform the board of the Presidents role and the 
key requirements of the proposed enquiry and he refers to 
the attachments we will come to in a short while.  Let us 
see what happens on the 9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just bring the mic a little closer to you 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 43 of 179 
 
ja sorry so that you are loud enough.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  If you turn the page 
paragraph 27 on page 372.  Mr Linnell carries on I went to 
Megawatt Park in anticipation of being called by the board.  
I took with me…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Seleka I keep on looking 
at the black numbers because we have been using black 
numbers for a number of weeks.  Okay 371 red numbers 
that way I know where you are…[intervene]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   My bundle and the witnesses bundle 
10 
Chair will not have the black numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So its 372 the red number.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no I just I sometimes use the red 
ones but then I think in my own mind I go back to the black 
ones because for a number of weeks we have been using 
the black ones and my bundle has got both.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I believe so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we are on 372 red colour, 
paragraph 27 Mr Linnell writes I went to Megawatt Park in 
anticipation of being called by the board.  I took with me 
the senior labour lawyer consultant and his associate to 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 44 of 179 
 
deal with labour law matters if requested by the board.  We 
were however later told the board was not in agreement 
and we left in part I considered that that might be the end 
of the matter.   
          Now Mr Matona that is the same date of the board 
meeting the 9 t h of March 2015 which Mr Linnell refers to in 
the previous passages of his affidavit.  Were you aware 
that he was there?     
MR MATONA:   No, as I have indicated I was not aware of 
this person and his involvement.  I see that there is a 
10 
resolution, the plain resolution shall I say you know he had 
authored, he had authored that resolution I am seeing that 
for the first time here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well let us see because on page 371 
the red number paragraph 24 he refers to attachments.  He 
refers them by means of page numbers of his attachment.  
He says pages 15 to 21 for our purposes that is on page 
381 of the red number.  Are you on that page?  
MR MATONA:   I am on that page.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 381 you will see just below that 
20 
pagination there is a number 15.  
MR MATONA:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think that is what he is referring to in 
his affidavit.  Now the document there it is an email from 
Mr Nick Linnell, it is sent on Sunday 8 March 2015 at 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 45 of 179 
 
6:37pm.  It is sent to ztsotsi@liquifire.biz.  Can you see 
that?  
MR MATONA:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you familiar with that email 
address of ztsotsi@liquifire.biz?   
MR MATONA:   Yes, I have encountered this email before I 
think it was the Chairperson, shall I call it private email for 
his businesses email.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   His what? 
MR MATONA:   His businesses email.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His own business? 
MR MATONA:   His own business, it says there liquifirebiz, 
ztsotsi@liquifire.biz. I assume that it is his business email.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, then you have the subject line 
board memorandum and resolutions 9 March 2015 and 
attachments also in the same name.  And he writes, Dear 
Chair please find a copy of the memorandum and proposed 
resolutions.  If you are happy I would suggest that you 
require the company secretary to adapt to any form 
standards used by Eskom.  
20 
          Could you also review the substance of this to 
ensure that you feel it makes the point adequately.  This 
document would be circulated together with a notice of 
encouraging a meeting for the board to attend at 09:00am 
or 10:00am if you believe it will give members more time to 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 46 of 179 
 
attend. 
 
It 
is 
critical 
that 
the 
company 
secretary 
communicates this notice both in email and variably 
confirming that he has delivered the notice to each 
director.   
          At the meeting it will be important to record the 
directors who are not present whether they received the 
notice because we need to have at least seven members 
present.  Once you get the green light please call each 
director providing them with context.   
          One, the President has engaged both you as 
10 
Chairman and the Minister regarding the current status of 
Eskom.  It is his view that the effect on the economy is 
massively understated.  He goes on to set out other things 
there Mr Matona but let me refer you to the attachments of 
this document, to this email.  Please turn the page and go 
to page 383.  Are you there?                 
MR MATONA:   I am there, yes correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a document there on which it 
is written Eskom SOE 9 March 2015 memorandum.  It is a 
two-page document.  Please tell the Chairperson whether 
20 
you recognise this document? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, so this document is the document that 
I indicated had been attached to the email calling for a 
meeting on the 9 t h of, Monday the 9 t h of March 2015.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you have on page 385 because 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 47 of 179 
 
according to the email there are two attachments went into 
the email.  Are you on page 385?  
MR MATONA:   I am there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Another document on which it is 
written Eskom SOE decision record of the board 9 March 
2015 
resolution. 
 
Would 
you 
also 
please 
tell 
the 
Chairperson whether you are familiar with this document?  
MR MATONA:   Yes.  So this one the paddled memorandum 
as well as the second one paddled decision record of the 
board.  Other documents that were attached their to the 
10 
email that I referred to.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So if we look at this 
documents let us see the contents to determine what was 
sort to be conveyed in this documents.  I will go back to 
page 383 the document target memorandum.   
          The document reads the company has implemented 
rolling restricted supply to all areas for a number of 
months.  Notwithstanding the integration of Madupi Unit 1 
continued mentions and unscheduled shutdowns have and 
will inevitably cause ongoing planned and unplanned 
20 
outages. 
 
The 
CEO 
is 
on 
public 
record 
as 
having 
forecasted that these will continue for as much as five 
years.   
          Madupi and Kusele are years behind schedule and 
tens of billions over budget.  Lost revenue as a result of 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 48 of 179 
 
lost sales arising from supply, not meeting demand runs 
into bullions.  Escalating funding shortfalls have increased 
the interest carrying cost beyond provincial limits.   
          Now Mr Matona as the CEO and being furnished 
with a document, this document at the time were this 
statements in this document reflective of the factual 
position at Eskom?              
MR MATONA:   Ja, so certainly these were matters that 
Eskom was grabbling with absolutely.  So they were not 
new they had been there, they had been building up over a 
10 
period of time which is – and if I may please indicate that I 
did not think that an enquiry was necessary because we 
knew the problems there.  The problems had been well 
established.   
          What was required was solutions, what were the 
solutions to these problems not to enquire into them they 
had been known, they had been there for years prior to my 
arrival.  There is just one small point.   
          I did say that we were focusing on that load 
shedding for a period of time, to come I could not have 
20 
said five years because I was actually optimistic that we 
would resolve the load shedding problem earlier than five 
years.  So I do not know where the five years came from 
but certainly you know based on where I sat understanding 
the nature of the problem the company faced at the time 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 49 of 179 
 
you know load shedding was going to be part of the life of 
the company for a while.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, well the memorandum continues 
Eskom continues obliged to seek increasing funding from 
Treasury. 
The 
forward 
focus 
anticipates 
that 
funding 
shortfalls will continue.  The company is also being 
subjected to public embarrassment relating to tender and 
other expenditure disputes some of which have become 
litigious.   
          These compound current negative perceptions of 
10 
Eskom.  The impact of this failings are numerous and the 
consequential risks extends far beyond the company to all 
South Africans. 
Economic 
capacity 
is 
being 
severely 
restricted across all sectors and curtailed foreign and 
domestic investments postponed or cancelled outright.  
These in turn create a spiral effect with increasing 
unemployment and pressure on the Fiscus.   
          The past response by Eskom has been to offer the 
public little insight to the causes and little guidance to the 
future.  Public announcements are often uninformative or 
20 
silent.  The perception is that there has been a tendency to 
deny and defend.  As a consequence, neither business nor 
the man in the street has any notion of what the future 
holds. 
          Now may I ask you this in so far as you say what 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 50 of 179 
 
was needed was solutions and not an enquiry and Eskom 
as you point out had this issues facing it at the time that 
the 
board 
enquire 
from 
you 
what 
solutions 
you 
contemplated to introduce or put in place.             
MR MATONA:   Well not in the context of this matter as it 
was discussed but I had as I indicated in the induction of 
the board because I recall we had in December as the 
executives had come back from a strategic planning 
session.  Coming out of there we presented all our plans, 
the plans were to deal with these matters as it were.   
10 
          You know for example before I arrived at Eskom I 
had been a Director General at Department of Public 
Enterprises and I had been instrumental in negotiating a 
R23billion bail out.  So we were on course, there was a 
War Room also dealing with these matters.  So there was 
no shortage of if you would like hands at the problem at 
the time as it were.   
          So we were aware – I presented this thing at the 
induction of the board.  On the morning of the 11 t h there is 
a standing item on the board item which is report of the CE 
20 
where I briefed the board on what I have been doing as the 
CE and I have updated them on various matters dealing 
with the solutions that are being implemented at the time.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So which meeting are you referring to? 
MR MATONA:   The meeting that ended up with my 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 51 of 179 
 
suspension.  So I had made a report with an update on 
developments 
around 
various 
matters 
in 
relation 
to 
generation capacity and in relation to the finances of the 
company as well as the report back from the War Room 
because I participated in the War Room that had been 
established. 
 
The 
board 
did 
not 
participate 
so 
we 
participated as an executive on behalf of the company in 
the War Room working with government to find solutions.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you referring now to the meeting of 
the 11 t h of March?  
10 
MR MATONA:   I am referring to the meeting of the 11 t h 
where again I presented to the board what is it that we as 
management were doing to address the challenges of the 
company.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes we will come to that meeting in a 
moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, before that just tell me more 
about the War Room.  What was it, who took part in it, 
what was its purpose, what was it doing?   
MR MATONA:   So in about December thereabouts of 2014 
20 
the cabinet had resolved to establish what it called a War 
Room which would be a structure consisting of three 
different departments who are supposed to be role-players 
in the supply of electricity in the country.   
          You know Treasury, Department of Energy, the 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 52 of 179 
 
shareholder Department Public Enterprises and various 
other departments to work with Eskom at resolving some of 
the challenges for Eskom because the challenges of Eskom 
Chairperson are of such a nature that they are not confined 
to the company itself.   
          Some of them manifests themselves in the company 
but they are related to you know decisions what is 
supposed to be happening in government and the support 
that is required.  So it was a good initiative I thought at the 
time you know that government is coming forward to work 
10 
with the company with Eskom to resolve those challenges.  
So it was chaired by the Deputy President at the time so 
the current President was the Chairperson of that structure 
and it also had several Ministers as well as senior officials 
in government.                
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Did you take part in 
the activities of the War Room?  
MR MATONA:   Of course, I attended every single meeting 
of the War Room at the time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you at any stage have the 
20 
opportunity to report back to the board on the War Room? 
MR MATONA:   Exactly, so specifically the meeting of the 
9 t h as I indicated was an item where you know I had to 
update the board on the CE report.  The content of that 
report was also included of what had been happening in 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 53 of 179 
 
the War Room where I was updating them you know what 
the thinking is in government at the time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that the first occasion that you 
reported to the board on the War Room or its activities?  
MR MATONA:   I think it was the first time because the War 
Room 
convened 
– 
you 
know 
it 
was 
established 
in 
December and there was not really too much activity seen 
after it was appointed.  So most of this would have 
happened in the new year but my first opportunity to brief 
the board was in the meeting of the 11 t h of March that 
10 
would be my first opportunity.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   And well this is a new board according 
to your observation did the board understand the issues 
that you were reporting to it about? 
MR MATONA:   Well, you know, I could not tell, you know, 
if the board understood what I had – the information I had 
presented to them.  What I recall was that, you know, there 
were no questions asked, you know, they accept that 
information was provided and I was not surprised because 
it was – they were going through a learning curve, so to 
20 
speak.  So nobody asked any question or even a question 
of clarification, the information was just received as 
provided. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have mentioned two board 
members remained from the previous board, so I assumed 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 54 of 179 
 
they would have had more knowledge about the activities 
at Eskom and the new members of the board.  Did they ask 
you any questions? 
MR MATONA:   No.  No, I was – to be honest with you, I 
expected that there would be discussion because part of 
the reality at the time was Eskom was in the news, you 
know, there were frequent bouts of load shedding, so I had 
really expected that there would be the more substantive 
discussion of the report I had presented and the matters I 
had dealt with but there was not. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you say no questions were raised 
but were concerns raised with you about the information 
you presented to the board? 
MR MATONA:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not at all? 
MR MATONA:   Not at all. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let us …[intervenes] 
MR MATONA:   And I would presume that the contents of 
the discussion that was had on that day would have been 
minuted.  The minutes would show that nobody asked any 
20 
questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is this now the minutes of the 11 t h? 
MR MATONA:   The minutes of the 11 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   March.  Okay, let us go back to that 
document so we can for the sake of completeness conclude 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 55 of 179 
 
on it, the memorandum on page 383.  The purpose is to 
see what is it that was being proposed to the board, the 
inquiry on the one hand, the suspensions on the other or 
only one item was being proposed.  So let us see what is 
written there further.  I think I am on – in paragraph the 
second from the bottom: 
“Until this moment...” 
Can you see that? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
“Until this moment the board has been entirely 
reliant on the executives for information pertaining 
to these challenges.  It is abundantly clear that this 
in itself is part of the problem.  This board has no 
independent and objective insight into the extent 
that some of our failings might be caused or 
exacerbated by the management failure.  Given the 
abnormal 
risks 
facing 
the 
company 
and 
its 
obligations to the public, this board must know the 
facts, as unpalatable as they might be.” 
20 
So when you read this – well, now you know at this stage 
that the document, as you said, originated from somebody 
else 
but 
at 
the 
time 
did 
you 
know 
that 
that 
this 
memorandum came from somebody else outside of the 
board. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 56 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   No, not at all.  No, not at all, there had 
been no indication as to who was the author of this and it 
came through the communication of the Chairperson so I 
presumed that he would have caused the resolution to be 
drafted in the way that it was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would this, what is written in that 
paragraph I have just read out, have surprised you at the 
time as coming from this new board? 
MR MATONA:   Of course, absolutely.  I mean, you know, 
here is a new board that is really only just starting to take 
10 
off.  Eskom is a complex organisation, the issues are 
complex, 
they 
have 
only 
had 
probably 
one 
or 
two 
interactions 
with 
myself 
and 
so 
when 
I 
saw 
this 
memorandum and the issues, it really made me wonder 
where was coming from and where was this going to.  It 
was quite remarkable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the new board been – had there 
been a chance for the new board to be properly and 
thoroughly briefed by the management about this state of 
affairs at Eskom at the time? 
20 
MR MATONA:   Yes, Chairperson, I have indicated that at 
their induction, so they were appointed in …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   December. 
MR MATONA:   In December, they get inducted in January 
and now we are about to get into business with the first 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 57 of 179 
 
meeting supposedly in February which meeting, as I 
indicated did not happen.  All indications up to then was 
that we were good to go, you know, as a collective charged 
with the oversight of the company at the time. 
 
So this was a bit kind of odd, you know, with where 
I thought we were going at the time in terms of the issues 
that I raised here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Quite apart from your observation you 
can see here that what is being conveyed is a message 
that 
seeks 
to 
express 
a 
board 
opinion 
on 
what 
is 
10 
happening at Transnet. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which are – let me rather put it this 
way, concerns of the board at Eskom. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now did the board raise these 
concerns with you? 
MR MATONA:   No, not at all, not at all.  Actually the 
opportunity  that the board had to raise these matters with 
me was the meeting of the 11 t h which was supposed to be, 
20 
if you like, the regular meeting of the board because as 
opposed to the meeting or the 9 t h which only had the 
inquiry as the only item on the agenda, that the meeting of 
the 11 t h had, you know, the normal business of the 
company which allowed me to report to the board.  But, as 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 58 of 179 
 
I indicated, nobody said to me well, actually we disagree 
with 
the 
information 
or 
contradict 
me 
in 
any 
way 
whatsoever. 
 
I 
concluded 
my 
report 
and 
then 
the 
subsequent item was arrival of the Minister where I was 
then asked to leave the meeting.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Okay, this memorandum 
continues: 
“The board is also in an unenviable position as it is 
known that the executive relationship with the 
shareholder can at times be more engaging than it 
10 
is with the board.  While this board can have no 
quibble with close shareholder relationship this may 
not be a substitute for proper and sound corporate 
governance.” 
So you know what they are talking about there? 
MR MATONA:   I absolutely have no idea. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the executives have a closer 
relationship with the shareholder representative. 
MR MATONA:   It is natural in the nature of the business 
that there would be several interactions that are being had 
20 
with the shareholder department on various matters.  It 
does not substitute for the formal relationship, the formal 
relationship is that the Minister communicates with the 
Chairperson of the board, the CEO of the company 
interacts with the Director General of the company.  Those 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 59 of 179 
 
are 
the 
established 
formal 
protocols 
but 
sometimes 
information - if, you know, is shared freely in other 
interactions with the company, so I – that is my experience 
but I am not sure what this was supposed to be suggesting, 
it seems something has been suggested here but, you 
know, it is not so explicit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the board raise any concern with 
you regard to that? 
MR MATONA:   Not at all, not at all.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please turn the page, page 384.

“Given the severe risk of further outages and little 
independent understanding of the facts, there it is 
critical that the board act immediately.” 
I think the word “there” is a typo or added. 
“It is critical that the board act immediately to 
establish firsthand the causes of these challenges.  
It is recommended that the board urgently authorise 
a mandate and independent external inquiry to 
establish the facts of the current difficulties.  This 
inquiry must be unfettered by management and the 
20 
board and other policy stakeholders.  It must be 
seen to be credible and objective, it must have a 
mandate to be penetrating and unhindered.  The 
board must ensure that it creates the space and 
environment 
within 
the 
company 
and 
amongst 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 60 of 179 
 
stakeholders for the investigators to fulfil this 
mandate unimpeded and without influence.  The 
resolution before the board provides the authority 
for such an inquiry.” 
And we will go to the resolution in a short while.  Let me 
complete the reading of this document: 
“In order to facilitate the urgent and independent 
execution of this resolution a further resolution 
provides the delegation of the selection mandating 
and contracting including terms of reference and 
10 
oversight of the inquiry to a board subcommittee.  
While this subcommittee remains accountable to the 
full 
board, 
the 
subcommittee 
should 
have 
the 
board’s delegated authority to take all such steps 
and 
measures 
as 
the 
subcommittee 
deems 
necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the mandate 
as the board would itself have.  There is, therefore, 
an urgent and pressing need for the board to gain 
firsthand and un-abridged review of the facts and 
their impact.” 
20 
Were these points, Mr Matona, about conducting an inquiry 
that must be unfettered by management and a board and 
other policy stakeholders that must credible, objective, 
must be penetrating and unhindered raised with you during 
the suspension you have referred to – suspension meeting 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 61 of 179 
 
you referred to? 
MR MATONA:   No.  So this – remember this is a resolution 
or set of documents that would have served at the meeting 
of the 9 t h, is the first meeting that has to deal with this.  
These matters were not discussed, the board at the time 
actually said that we do not really understand where this 
inquiry is coming from, where it is going, we do not have 
sufficient information, the motivation behind this.  This 
almost like – it caught me by surprise.  So none of these 
matters were discussed. 
10 
 
They may have been discussed in the meeting of 
the 11 t h, but recall that I had been requested to recuse 
myself from that meeting, so I am not privy to how these 
matters were discussed in that meeting but evidently, you 
know, they may have been discussed, as it were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, having read the document, I see 
that the word suspension is not mentioned anywhere in 
that document. 
MR MATONA:   Exactly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  Now let us look at the resolution 
20 
because this is what presumably the board would then 
have had to resolve, it is on page 385, the document with 
the 
heading 
just 
before 
the 
paragraph 
numbers, 
Resolution, do you see that? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 62 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So paragraph 1 reads that: 
“That this board resolves that there are exceptional 
circumstances 
demanding 
the 
necessity 
for 
an 
urgent 
meeting 
of 
the 
board 
of 
directors.  
Ordinarily, notice of at least seven days is required.  
Due to these exceptional circumstances recorded in 
the memorandum, this board resolves to accept 
short notice and to receive and consider the notice 
and resolutions of this meeting, that this board 
resolves that an external and independent inquiry 
10 
be set up to investigate and determine the facts 
relating to the current technical, commercial and 
structural status and any acts and/or omissions that 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
current 
deficiency 
or 
generating and distributing capacity of Eskom. 
That 
the 
board 
resolves 
to 
appoint 
a 
board 
subcommittee comprising Zola Tsotsi, Chairperson 
of the board, Ms Chwayita Mabude, Chairperson of 
Audit and Risk Committee and Zethembe Khosa, 
Chairperson of People and Governance Committee 
20 
mandated with delegated authority of the board to 
determine the terms of reference of the enquiry, the 
selection 
mandating 
and 
contracting 
of 
the 
independent investigators and the oversight of the 
inquiry.  The subcommittee shall have the board’s 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 63 of 179 
 
delegated authority to take all such steps and 
measures as the subcommittee deems necessary to 
ensure the unfettered fulfilment of this mandate as 
the 
board 
itself 
would 
have 
such 
power 
and 
authority.  And further, without limitation to ensure 
that the environment within the company does not 
hinder or create a perception of hindering the 
inquiry and to take all necessary steps to ensure 
such.  That the board authorises the Chairperson in 
consultation with the Minister and the Minister of 
10 
Finance 
to 
approve 
expenditure 
sufficient 
and 
necessary to fund this inquiry, that this inquiry shall 
be required to present its final report to the board, 
the Minister and the President no later than the 30 
June 2015.  That the subcommittee shall have the 
authority 
to 
deviate 
from 
the 
requirements 
of 
Eskom’s procurement policies and procedures as is 
necessary, 
given 
the 
target 
to 
complete 
an 
investigation within three months (urgency) and to 
appoint such persons or entities to conduct the 
20 
inquiry that are independent of Eskom and free of 
any influence or suspicion of influence of any party 
that might have any effect on the inquiry save that 
the subcommittee shall, if required, provide reasons 
to the Ministry of Finance for any such deviations.” 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 64 of 179 
 
Do you see that, Mr Matona? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know whether were you able to 
identify the proposal to suspend the executives there? 
MR MATONA:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So these documents are presented to 
the board in the meeting of the 9 March.  
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say that was a short meeting. 
MR MATONA:   It was a short meeting certainly. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you recall what – how the meeting 
ended in terms of the way forward, the resolution going 
forward? 
MR MATONA:   So the resolution was the fact that the 
Chairperson would revert back to the Minister with the 
sentiments of the board which was that they really do not 
get it, they really do not understand what is this and that 
expect the Minister to address them directly on the matter, 
so the meeting ended on the understanding that the 
Chairperson would have further conversation with the 
20 
Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And did that happen? 
MR MATONA:   I presume it did because this was the 
Monday, the next day, Tuesday, we get another notice that 
the meeting is reconvening now on the 11 t h and that the 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 65 of 179 
 
Minister would be present. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the meeting of the 11 t h is the one 
you 
have 
been 
referring 
to 
where 
you 
make 
a 
representation of your report to the board? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now that meeting of the 11 t h, when you 
make your presentation, the presentation of your report to 
the board, was the Minister present? 
MR MATONA:   No.  So the meeting was in two parts.  So 
the first part was a meeting of the board without the 
10 
Minister, so it would be your normal board meeting dealing 
with the affairs of the company but of course had been 
informed that the Minister was going to come, you know, to 
take further issues which arose in the meeting of Monday 
and yes, the Minister did arrive.  Did arrive, so we 
concluded the first business – the first part of the meeting 
dealing with the business of the company and then the 
Minister arrived.  It was at that point where then I was 
asked to recuse myself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so after the Minister arrived you 
20 
were asked to recuse yourself? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You alone? 
MR MATONA:   Well – so typically a normal board meeting 
would have myself as the call it executive director so I am 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 66 of 179 
 
an ex officio member of the board and so is the company’s 
financial officer.  By law we are members of the board.  We 
are directors of the board so typically we attend board 
meetings.  Unless the board wants to meet in-committee, at 
which we recuse ourselves.  But that would be something 
that is known in advance, that such and such a meeting 
would happen in an in-committee session at which point 
executives would have to be recused.   
 
So when the suggestion was made for management 
to recuse themselves I thought that it actually meant the 
10 
other members of the executives who would normally also 
attend to assist the board and so I continued to sit in my 
place in the meeting until I was expressly informed by the 
Minister who said no, you, CE as well as CFO, both of you 
should also excuse yourselves from the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I was going to ask you who asked 
you to excuse yourself. 
MR MATONA:   It was the Minister, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you duly obliged? 
MR MATONA:   I duly obliged, I picked up my stuff and I 
20 
left the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you do not know what transpired in 
that meeting? 
MR MATONA:   I do not know what transpired in that 
meeting so we waited, we thought it would be short but it - 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 67 of 179 
 
you know, we - I was waiting in my office for the entire day 
really.  Only later in the afternoon was I informed that 
before I go home the board would like to have interaction 
with me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So who comes to inform you? 
MR MATONA:   The company secretary came to inform me 
that the board requested I not leave as yet because they 
would like to talk to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what followed next? 
MR MATONA:   So I then got called at which point I was 
10 
informed by the Chairperson of the board on behalf of the 
board that they had resolved to undertake this inquiry and 
that they would want – that when the inquiry is underway 
that I am not at work, I am not at the company, so that the 
inquiry precedes, you know, without my interference with it 
and that is when we had that kind of funny conversation as 
to what does this mean because, you know, they are not 
saying I should take leave or absence or that they are 
suspending me, but somehow I must - you know, I need to 
be absent from the company. 
20 
 
So I then said well, are you suspending me?  And 
the answer was no, no, no, actually, not quite, you know – 
because of course I had informed them right there and then 
that I disagree with the idea of an inquiry, I do not see the 
need for an inquiry, there are enough hands at dealing with 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 68 of 179 
 
Eskom’s problems, there is also the war room and we have 
plans underway, as management, to deal with all the 
issues, so this inquiry I do not support.  At which point 
then I was informed that we heard you, give us a chance 
and then upon on my return I was then handed a letter of 
suspension.  That is how – those are the events of that 
day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So you were then given that 
letter of suspension I wanted to go to earlier, maybe we 
can do so now which is on page 327 of bundle U13. 
10 
MR MATONA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am in 328, that letter of suspension. 
ADV SELEKA SC:     The letter starts on page 328, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, may we then – I have 
marked this letter, Chairperson, as EXHIBIT U13.5.  Mr 
Matona, I had read I think the first two paragraphs of the 
letter and we saw there that despite you saying the word 
suspension was not used, the letter explicitly used the 
word suspension.  Do you see that? 
20 
MR MATONA:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what do you say was the concept 
used in regard to you in the discussion? 
MR MATONA:   So it was a combination of recuse yourself, 
step aside.  I am the one who raised the suspension but 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 69 of 179 
 
the board denied it.  They said no actually, that is not what 
they are doing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say it was the Chairperson of 
the board Mr Tsotsi addressing you? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At this point in time? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let us look at the letter, the last 
paragraphs of the letter, paragraph 3 also says: 
“You were advised the board subcommittee was 
10 
considering 
placing 
you 
on 
precautionary 
suspension because of concerns that might pose a 
risk to the influence, free requirement of the 
inquiry.  These concerns have been discussed with 
you.” 
Were they discussed with you? 
MR MATONA:   No.  No because that was one of the things 
that made me wonder, say what kind of an inquiry is this 
that my presence – continued presence in the company 
would make difficult or impede, as it were.  You know, 
20 
nobody said well, you know, your presence would prejudice 
the inquiry in this manner and therefore that is why we 
require you not to be present, you know, it was a general, 
you know, it has to be unfettered, it has to be free of 
influence, as it were, and that was the motivation for the 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 70 of 179 
 
suspension presumably. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, the letter carries on with the 
same concept of suspension in paragraph 5: 
“I 
confirm 
that 
you 
have 
made 
various 
representations 
in 
respect 
of 
your 
possible 
suspension.  We have considered them thoroughly.” 
Is that correct? 
 MR 
MATONA: 
 
 
No, 
I 
deny 
that 
I 
had 
made 
representations.  If you can imagine …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, sorry, they say in respect of your 
10 
possible suspension. 
MR MATONA:   Yes.  So imagine the events of that day, so 
the first time one really gets to know what might be 
happening, you know, where the board might be going is at 
the end of the day, in the evening, actually, that we had all 
been there the whole day.   
So it is late in the day I get presented with this, I 
am shocked, I am confused, I do not know what to do, as it 
were.  I am clear that at least my understanding of due 
process is that I ought to have been given an opportunity 
20 
to inform the board why I think I should not be suspended.  
I had not been, I had not been offered that opportunity and 
so I took this letter and I left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So what do you do thereafter? 
MR MATONA:   Well, I went home, you know, I mean, here 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 71 of 179 
 
I am suspended, I came – I left my house in the morning 
going to work and a normal day, I come back home having 
been suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but in relation to your employer, do 
you engage your employer going forward or do you simply 
stay silent? 
MR MATONA:   No, I have no – actually, I think the letter 
said I shall have no contact with the company whatsoever, 
as it were, I mean that was the understanding that this 
means that I shall have no contact.  In fact they were going 
10 
to take the tools of trade, you know, from me, the laptop 
and cell phone, but what had been indicated was that to 
the extent that there was going to be this inquiry that the 
people conducting the inquiry will contact me.  I was never 
contacted by anybody.  I later heard that the inquiry was 
concluded that no wrongdoing was found on my part but 
nobody, nobody in relation to this inquiry had ever contacted 
me wanting to talk to me about the subject matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But did you contact Eskom?  Did you 
make contact with the Board? 
20 
MR MATONA:  No I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It has been widely reported that you took 
a – your matter to the Labour Court. 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you explain to the Chairperson how 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 72 of 179 
 
did that come about? 
MR 
MATONA: 
 
Well 
as 
I 
was 
contemplating 
my 
circumstances – I mean I had thought this was a brazen and 
irrational act by – by the Board.  It had occurred to me 
actually that  not only was it myself but a CFO – Chief 
Financial Officer of the company and two other executives 
that four of us had been – had been suspended which is 
rather extraordinary.  I had never encountered anything.  And 
kind of suspended not for having done anything wrong.  That 
was the – also the messaging from the company itself.  So I 
10 
was – something had told me that there might be the solution 
– some intervention - political intervention to – to stop this 
but in the end I realised that the only thing that I had was my 
– my legal rights and I chose to exercise my legal rights.  I 
launched a challenge with the Labour Court on an urgent 
basis to have the – to have the suspension set aside. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes and what was the outcome of that? 
MR MATONA:  The Labour Court found that my suspension 
was unfair and unlawful.  The – the remedy I had required 
was that it be set aside and that I be reinstated in my job.  
20 
The Judge did not go as far as rule statement.  She – she 
referred the matter to CCMA and so we then – myself and 
the – the employer of Eskom went through conciliation 
through CCMA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the judgment would that be the one 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 73 of 179 
 
if you turn to page 30 – oh page 31 in fact. 
MR MATONA:  31? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Item 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka.  I think you have 
gone past that letter of suspension.  You have dealt with it to 
your satisfaction is it not? 
MR MATONA:  I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think I wanted to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ask Mr Matona something. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is at page 328 Mr Matona.   
MR MATONA:  Yes.  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Paragraph 5 of that letter reads: 
“I 
confirm 
that 
you 
made 
various 
representations in respect of your possible 
suspension. 
 
We 
have 
considered 
them 
around [01:08:10]” 
 
Is that – was that factually true? 
MR MATONA:  No I expressly took issue in – upon receipt of 
20 
this letter I took an issue with that matter specifically 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  To the extent that under the circumstances I 
did not have an opportunity to make proper representation. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 74 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  This – this was all surprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Because a surprise – one surprise after the 
other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  As it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  You may proceed Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes Mr Matona then 
10 
you talked about taking the matter to the Labour Court.  A 
judgment followed thereafter and I asked you to turn to page 
– it is 30 on the outer but you can go to 31. 
MR MATONA:  Ja I am right there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are right there.  Thank you.  This is 
on the trim lines identified as an ex tempore judgment of 
Judge Witcher J and the applicant there is Tshediso Matona, 
is that yourself? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The respondent is Eskom. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your voice again.  It keeps on 
going down Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – the Tshediso Matona the applicant, 
is that yourself? 
MR MATONA:  Correct that is myself. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 75 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The respondent there is Eskom Holdings.  
Would this be the judgment that was handed down in your 
matter? 
MR MATONA:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson you will mark that for the 
purposes of the record as Exhibit 13.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U13 or just 13?  Exhibit U13? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U13 indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U13.3. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The ex tempore judgment of the Labour 
Court appearing at page 31 starting at page 31 is admitted 
and would be marked as Exhibit U13.3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. So Mr Matona 
your – your matter was not found to be urgent but you say 
the judgment did say you were treated unfairly.  Your matter 
then went to the CCMA? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then he asked you before going to the 
CCMA what relief did you seek at the Labour Court? 
20 
MR MATONA:  I – I applied for the Labour Court to find the 
suspension to have been unfair and unlawful and that to the 
extent that the Labour Court had found as such that a 
suspension be certified and therefore in a sense I – I was 
wanting – I was claiming my job back. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 76 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And at the CCMA what relief were you 
seeking? 
MR MATONA:  Well the matter had been – had been sent to 
CCMA by the Judge and so we engaged – Eskom and myself 
engaged in the CCMA process until a point where the – the 
CCMA – the Commissioner allowed Eskom and myself to 
engage directly to interact directly outside of the process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But what relief were you seeking? 
MR MATONA:  Well I mean the – my – the relief still – I was 
still hoping I could – I could get my job back.   I was still 
10 
hoping I could get my job back but the interactions that I was 
having with Eskom seemed to suggest that that was another 
opening option.  They were not open to any new option of – 
of me getting my job back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now who were the people representing 
Eskom in your – at the CCMA or in the discussions or 
negotiations? 
MR MATONA:  So it was the – I think the Chairperson at the 
time was now Doctor Ben Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MATONA:  And he was supported by two board members 
being Venete Klein who I have referred to and Mr Romeo 
Kumalo.  That was the delegation that – of Eskom that I had 
been interactive with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was Doctor Ben Ngubane, Mr Romeo 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 77 of 179 
 
Kumalo. 
MR MATONA:  And Mr Romeo Kumalo and Ms Venete Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Venete Klein. 
MR MATONA:  Venete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Venete Klein. 
MR MATONA:  Venete Klein.  V-e-n-e. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The way the – those are the ones 
representing Eskom in the negotiations with you? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  But the – the question 
Mr Matona was at the CCMA who from Eskom was present? 
MR MATONA:  So as I said the first appearance – our first 
appearance at the CCMA Eskom was represented by Mr Ben 
Ngubane – sorry Doctor Ben Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were there lawyers also representing 
Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  So – so Eskom had lawyers on the 
matter.  I think it was Bowman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No that is fine. 
20 
MR MATONA:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That is fine. So Doctor Ngubane is 
there from Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  Doctor Ngubane is there from Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At the CCMA? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 78 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So at the CCMA what transpires? 
MR MATONA:  So – so the – so the proceedings did not go 
far because Eskom asked for a postponement.  They 
requested the Commissioner to say they would like a 
postponement and the reason was because they – they 
needed to engage with the shareholder – the Minister – 
shareholder representative as to – to give them a mandate – 
negotiating mandate in terms of what they could offer as 
relief or at least – ja what concession they can make in the 
10 
process as it were they needed to consult.  That was the 
reason 
for 
requesting 
a 
postponement 
and 
so 
the 
postponement was granted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the CCMA process at that stage the 
conciliation process or had you gone past the conciliation 
process and were about to begin the arbitration process? 
MR MATONA:  It was still at the conciliation stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Conciliation process. 
MR MATONA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So did you – did they come back to you 
after asking for that postponement in order to meet with the 
shareholders? 
MR MATONA:  So – so they did not come back to me.  So we 
had another date in fact as we – as we left so – so they got 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 79 of 179 
 
a postponement, we got a date and when that date 
approached – I cannot remember quite what the sequence 
was whether we actually went for the second time at the – at 
the CCMA.  I think we did because – because we were then 
– they then requested to engage directly with myself.  So we 
requested the Commissioner to allow a direct conversation 
between myself and the – and Eskom and that is exactly 
what happened thereafter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were you legally represented? 
MR MATONA:  Yes I had lawyers in my case yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So when you say the request was to have 
an interaction with yourself are you referring to you and a 
legal team and Eskom and its legal team on the other hand? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And? 
MR MATONA:  Ja.  So – so I – so we had a meeting and – 
and the indication that was stated very clearly was that they 
– you know the option of my return to Eskom was off the 
table. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So who is saying that? 
20 
MR MATONA:  It was the – the delegation.  I cannot quite be 
certain but I think the interlocutor at the time was Mr Romeo 
Kumalo.  He was speaking – representing the – representing 
Eskom to say – to say that you know – you know let us talk 
but you know the idea of – of you going back to Eskom is off 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 80 of 179 
 
the table.  This is the – the explicit mandate that they got 
from the shareholder so they are speaking on behalf of the 
board and speaking on behalf of the shareholder that I you 
know – they can do a deal but it is not going to be going 
back to my job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I just want to hear that clearly.  Just 
try and put the way it was put to you by whoever from the 
Eskom board?  What you have just said I think it amounts to 
saying you going back to your back to your job was out of 
the question.  Just put it the way they put it as you recall? 
10 
MR MATONA:  Yes so – so they said the option of you going 
back to Eskom is off the table.  So we are not talking about 
any – an outcome which would include me going back to 
Eskom.  So this – this was effectively a separation 
negotiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  You know I had now actually entered the 
separation – a separation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you recall who exactly in the Eskom 
delegation articulated that position or is that something you 
20 
cannot recall? 
MR MATONA:  I seem to recall that – that the person who 
was speaking on behalf of Eskom on the specific issue was 
Mr Romeo Kumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Romeo Kumalo? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 81 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  Hm.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Continue.  Maybe I see we are – it is 
four minutes past one – but it is an important topic so maybe 
let us go on and see if we can for the next ten or fifteen 
minutes then we take the lunch break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So what is your – what 
was your response Mr Matona to that which had been 
articulated to you that is your return being off the table? 
MR MATONA:  So I – I now reach a point where I have to 
determine you know how much – how much of a fight am I 
10 
still willing to put up on a matter like this?  And something 
had said to me that perhaps this is – you know you have to 
just cut your losses, leave this thing you know.  Ja just leave 
this thing you know.  And so I – I then accepted the – a 
severance from the company with a twelve months’ pay of 
what a CE – CE salary was at the time.  And I just – I just 
left the matter I cut my losses I did the deal with – with 
Eskom.  I had realised that I mean it was going to cost me 
financially to – to fight this matter legally.  Eskom – Eskom 
was – was financing the matter from its own coffers.  I was 
20 
financing the matter from my own pocket.  So you know the 
odds were against me. So I – I took a separation from 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So did that happen on that occasion? 
MR MATONA:  So we – we had – we had the first meeting 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 82 of 179 
 
and 
which 
is 
where 
they 
kind 
of 
– 
you 
know 
they 
communicated that position.  I went away.  I consulted with 
my legal people.  We evaluated our options and on the 
second interaction I think we were now talking the terms of 
the separation and they – you know they offered twelve 
months 
which 
was 
consistent 
with 
– 
with 
the 
legal 
provisions.  If you are not – you know you are – I was 
permanent employee of the company.  If you are a 
permanent employee you know the minimum would be twelve 
months. 
 
You 
can 
negotiate 
more 
and 
I 
did 
try 
10 
unsuccessfully.  As opposed to when you have a contract you 
have a five year contract then they – you know they can pay 
you out your five year contract.  But in my instance CE’s of 
Eskom are permanent at least at the time they were 
permanent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did you say you had two meetings to 
discuss that is after the first postponement? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the conciliation process? 
MR MATONA:  Yes 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then there were two meetings? 
MR MATONA:  There were two meetings yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The second meeting is where agreement 
was reached, is that right? 
MR 
MATONA: 
 
The 
second 
meeting 
is 
where 
they 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 83 of 179 
 
communicated the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is it – well would the – would the first 
meeting be where they asked for a postponement of the 
CCMA process?  Which one do you regard as the first 
meeting? 
MR MATONA:  So – so outside of the CCMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  I think we had two meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MATONA:  Outside of the CCMA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
After 
the 
CCMA 
process 
had 
been 
postponed? 
MR MATONA:  After the CCMA process had been – had been 
postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At the first meeting they articulated 
their position? 
MR MATONA:  So at that first meeting they – that is when 
they put their position that they – you know almost like what 
a mandate – whether to negotiate a mandate is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They wanted your negotiating position? 
20 
MR MATONA:  No.  I am saying they communicated what 
their negotiating position was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MATONA:  The negotiation is that look you are not going 
back. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 84 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR MATONA:  To Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that after they had according to them 
– according to what they told you was it after they had 
consulted with the Minister or was that the position they 
articulated before they talked about consulting the Minister? 
MR MATONA:  I – I – well the consultation with the Minister 
was the grounds for requesting a postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  So by the time they come I presumed  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the first meeting. 
MR MATONA:  That they have – that – in the first meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  I presumed that – actually that is what they 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  They said this is the position we are here – 
this position is – is the position of a shareholder as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  That is how they put it to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is where they said going back to 
your job is off the table? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What else did they articulate in that 
meeting of importance obviously? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 85 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  They said ja well you know they were sorry 
that the process – you know the matter could have been 
dealt differently you know.  They understood that you know it 
had negatively impacted me in terms of my reputation and so 
on and you know they apologised for that to the extent that 
they say that it could have been dealt – dealt with differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  As it were but you know we were – we were 
there at that point you know there was water under the 
bridge. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did they indicate at that first meeting 
that they were looking at giving you money for you to go 
away because getting your job back was out of the question?  
Did they indicate that already even if they did not specify the 
amount? 
MR MATONA:  You mean at the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the first meeting. 
MR MATONA:  At the – well yes – well the principle – there 
was a principle that said that well you know we can then look 
at how to compensate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Is that when you said you wanted to 
go and reflect on the present situation? 
MR MATONA:  Exactly. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 86 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is how the first meeting ended? 
MR MATONA:  Exactly yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then another meeting was arranged? 
MR MATONA:  Another meeting was arranged and now that 
was a meeting, I had made a decision that look I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not going to fight this thing. 
MR MATONA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And – and at that meeting an 
agreement was reached in terms of which Eskom was going 
to pay you a years’ salary or remuneration – the equivalent 
10 
of a years’ remuneration and you would resign? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Now let us go back to the first 
meeting.  When they told you that the – when they told you 
that going back to your job was out of the question bearing 
in mind that on the day – on the 11 March they had said to 
you your suspension did not indicate that you have done 
anything wrong.  Did you confront them to say, why – why is 
it not on the table because you told me that I have done 
nothing wrong? 
20 
MR MATONA:  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  What – what did they say? 
MR MATONA:  Like I did.  I – I could – the point I could – I 
could establish was that the – you know they did not have 
any confidence in me, they did not see me as part of the 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 87 of 179 
 
future of the company as it were.  So it was a bit – it was a 
bit strange but in the end you – you are dealing with – we 
are dealing with people who you can see that do not quite 
see you in the – in the position and I you know I actually did 
not know why because as you say they – they had indicated 
that and reassured me that it was not because of anything 
wrong I had done.  Ja so in a sense you know I kind of 
concluded that there is no chemistry between myself and this 
board so I am better off probably not – not working with 
them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had not had much time to work 
with this board, had you? 
MR MATONA:  No I had not had much time.  In fact, it 
became in December it was really two months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  As it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and after the board had been 
appointed the first meeting was that of the 9 t h that they had 
or was then apart of induction was there another meeting? 
MR MATONA:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So apart from induction that was the first 
meeting? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next – on the next meeting 
two days later. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 88 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They wanted to suspend you? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you had hardly worked with them? 
MR MATONA:  I had hardly worked with me absolutely 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know what factual basis they may 
have had not to want you to continue in your job at that 
time?  Did you know why they would not want you to 
continue in your job in circumstances where they did not 
10 
know you? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a board.  Maybe some individuals but 
as a board that had little – hardly anything to do with you? 
MR MATONA:  Absolutely.  I could not establish – I could not 
establish exactly what was the – the reason.  It seemed that 
between the Monday meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Monday like the 9t h? 
MR MATONA:  The 9t h.  It seemed that between the Monday 
meeting and the 11t h something had – something happened. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
MATONA: 
 
Followed 
the 
board 
took 
a 
complete 
somersault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  If I may say that. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 89 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Because on Monday they cannot engage with 
– they say they do not have enough information.  They 
cannot adopt a resolution of this nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  On – on the 11 t h two days later they – they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are quite clear. 
MR MATONA:  They accepted inquiry even decide on 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MATONA:  So – so I – the only – the only conclusion I 
could make was that this – this was something from outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  There had been – there had been some 
intervention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  From outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About which you knew nothing? 
MR MATONA:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About which you knew nothing? 
20 
MR MATONA:  Which I – I did not know anything about yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  Ja.  It was a bit – it was a bit odd and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when they said the – in the first 
meeting that is now the representatives of the board when 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 90 of 179 
 
they said that going back to your job was out of the question 
did that make it clear to you – that you were not wanted 
back? 
MR MATONA:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I still – I still 
maintained a little hope that sense will prevail that they 
could see that this was not a sustainable thing.  The damage 
and the ramifications for the company were so – were so 
huge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  I think there was – I think there was general 
10 
outcry around those events which actually led to even a 
downgrade of the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  I – I had thought that the impact was of such 
a nature that it would persuade them otherwise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  But – but of course that was not to be in a 
sense that they – they still wanted to proceed with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  Wherever they were going to but without me 
20 
being there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  And you had only been in the 
job at Eskom for five months and a few days after? 
MR MATONA:  Five – just a little over five months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Since then have you been able to 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 91 of 179 
 
make sense of what happened?  Since then have you been 
able to come to some conclusion based on whatever 
knowledge or your analysis of the situation of what happened 
to you that has made you to come to a conclusion as to why 
you were not wanted?  Or have you not been able to do that? 
MR MATONA:  To be honest with you the events that then 
followed at Eskom after my ouster from the company which 
was the you know where Mr Molefe was then appointed as 
well as other changes that happened and some of the stuff 
which was [01:33:50] of the allegations you know around 
10 
various matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  Made me suspect that it is probably because 
you know I was – I was removed to make way for some of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  Obviously you know just on the face of it I 
have not facts other than what I have seen being reported 
about the goings on at Eskom after my departure from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But during the negotiations leaving aside 
20 
the fact that on the 11 March the board has said your 
suspension did not mean that you had done - they had 
thought you had done anything wrong – leaving that aside.  
During the negotiations did anybody from the Eskom board 
ever say to you, this is what you have done wrong?  This is 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 92 of 179 
 
why the – you are going back to your job is out of the 
question? 
MR MATONA:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody said that? 
MR MATONA:  Nobody said that.  You know I – Chairperson 
some of the individuals who were involved – people that I 
know… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not speak too far away from the 
microphone ja. 
MR MATONA:  Sorry.  Sorry.  I said some of the people who 
10 
are involved are people that I – that I know that I have had 
professional interaction with certainly someone like Doctor 
Ben Ngubane.  The Chairperson of Eskom at the time as well 
Mr Tsotsi are people that I had come to be acquainted to 
professionally and – and it pained me why any of them could 
not have said let us find – if there is any reason whatsoever 
that I should not be there let us find a different way you 
know of dealing with it.  Not the drama you know that with 
which this thing – which as I indicated they – they said they 
were sorry for this and well you know it could not have been 
20 
done differently you know.  But – so up to today I do not 
know precisely why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they never said to you you are not 
performing your job properly.  They never said to you… 
MR MATONA:  No. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 93 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually, they never said to you they had 
no confidence in you or did you they say? 
MR MATONA:  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:  They never said that. 
MR MATONA:  They actually never said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Because if they said so I would have asked 
them on what grounds? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  You know as it were. So none of that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you – and you were only five 
months into a five year contract, is that right? 
MR MATONA:  Five months – well I was a permanent 
employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you were not  - you were a permanent 
employee? 
MR MATONA:  I was a permanent employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  But you are right in counting it a good tenure 
at least first tenure of a CE is five – is five years. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  That is what I imagined you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  That it is coming from government as a DG 
you know. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 94 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  You work on five year terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  So I was hoping that I would at least be at 
Eskom for five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MATONA:  But I had only been there for five months you 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Seleka.  I earlier on 
said we would take a ten minute – fifteen minutes on that 
10 
point but I… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is an opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I realised that we may be close to finishing 
with his evidence but I may be wrong about that.  Do we 
need to sit and finish so that when we adjourn, we are done 
or – but that would depend on how long you will take or 
should we adjourn for lunch and come back?  How long do 
you think you will – we will take? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I should take about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should not be – you should not be 
20 
rushed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have got to do justice to the issue.  But 
you have a better sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no my estimation is I could take 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 95 of 179 
 
about an hour Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so maybe let us take the lunch 
break then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not know if you might want to ask 
something before, we go or everything can wait until… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It can wait until. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can wait okay.  We will take the lunch 
break.  It is now twenty-three minutes past one we will 
resume at twenty-five past two.  We adjourn. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
MEETING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we proceed I just have one more 
question 
for 
Mr 
Matona 
with 
regard 
to 
what 
the 
representatives of Eskom said during the negotiations of the 
separation settlement.  You said they said to you that the 
position that going back to your job was not on the table.  
20 
Was their position – the position of the board as well as the 
position of the shareholder? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  Now you had worked as the 
Director General of the Department of Public Enterprises and 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 96 of 179 
 
therefore would have been familiar with the role of the 
Minister in that situation as well as the relationship between 
the Minister and the board and their respective roles is that 
not so? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the situation which prevailed 
where you had been suspended as I understand by the board 
whether you were reinstated or not did not the Minister have 
a role to play on that issue or was that supposed to be a 
decision of the board and the board only?  Or must they 
10 
consult the Minister or what is the position?  Or is the 
position 
that 
the 
Minister 
had 
the 
final 
say 
as 
you 
understood the position? 
MR MATONA:  The – there is a slight irregularity in as far as 
that is concerned.  Typically, the board has the full mandate 
to take decisions in the interest of the company.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  That is first and foremost their primary 
judiciary responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MATONA:  Of course, to the extent that the matter 
involved the CEO of the company.  It is reasonable to expect 
that the board would have consulted with the Minister as it 
were.  But that is not what they were saying.  They were 
saying that they – the position that they are conveying to me 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 97 of 179 
 
is their position as well as the Minister’s position.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Ja that is the way they put it to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you view that as different from 
saying that position was their position as the board as well 
as the position of the Minister which they obtained through 
consultation with him – with her or was it him? 
MR MATONA:  It was her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Ms Brown. 
MR MATONA:  It was her at the time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Well recall I indicated that even – even in the 
negotiation at CCMA in the conciliation they had requested a 
postponement in order that they would consult as they 
indicated – the shareholder with regard to you know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What they offer. 
MR MATONA:  What they could offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  Exactly. Which again I found a bit odd but of 
course it was what it was that the board felt it important at 
20 
all times to involve the Minister in – well to invoke the 
Minister’s name as it were.  That kept on arising at different 
points.  So – so in the end I just took it that it was the board 
and the Minister united in – in a position to have me 
removed ja. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 98 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And the appointment of the Group 
CEO for Eskom I guess it might be the same with Transnet 
and so on for Eskom the power to make that appointment is 
it – does it lie with the board or does the board recommend  
and the Minister or cabinet makes the appointments? 
MR MATONA:  The power rests with the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The power lies with the board? 
MR MATONA:  The power lies with the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  To make the appointment that is what would 
10 
normally happen across the board in the private sector in the 
public sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  With the exception that in the public sector 
because it is a state owned company the board would say to 
the shareholder. 
Dear Shareholder we have conducted a search for a CEO.  
We 
have 
identified 
the 
following 
three 
names. 
 
Our 
preference is name X.  We ask for your concurrence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
MR MATONA:  As it were.  And the Minister would then take 
that through internal decision making in government which – 
which does involve cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Excuse me.  So in a case such 
as that of a suspension of a CEO the power to settle that 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 99 of 179 
 
matter would lie with the board but the board could consult 
the Minister – the shareholder representative? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understand the position? 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  I think the reasonable – the reasonable 
thing would be for the board to say to the Minister, Minister 
we – we have come to such and such a position for these 
reasons as it were.  We therefore want to bring you – bring – 
make you aware as it were that the board – that is a decision 
of the board.  That is how I would view it Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the time you were appointed as Group 
CEO for Eskom you had worked with Minister Lynne Brown 
for some time in the Department of Public Enterprises, is it 
not for about two years or a year and a half? 
MR MATONA:  No.  I worked with her because I think she 
came in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Just after the elections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The elections ja. 
MR MATONA:  Of 2014 so I had overlapped with her for 
20 
about three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATONA:  About three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I am sorry. 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 100 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay about three months. 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So prior to that you did not – the two of 
you did not know much of each other? 
MR MATONA:  We knew each other because she had been a 
government – a public representative as it were in the 
Western Cape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but in terms of working and so on you 
had not worked together? 
MR MATONA:  No.  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  So she would have been my boss like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Like previous Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Under whom I served. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So when she came to Public 
Enterprises was the process which led to your appointment 
at Eskom already underway or did it start after – it was 
underway? 
20 
MR MATONA:  It was underway.  She found it in its 
advanced stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Stage yes. 
MR MATONA:  As it were – correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So she also did not know you 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 101 of 179 
 
much in terms of work?  What your abilities were and so on? 
MR MATONA:  Not – not extensively because in the overlap 
– in the three months overlap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  She might have had some idea but she 
might not have been able to speak authoritatively about how 
you were as DG or she might have been, what do you say? 
MR MATONA:  No she had gained an impression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  Because she arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MATONA:  Almost in my hands as it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  You know I had briefed her.  I took her 
through the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  And so on and so forth.  And I can recall the 
day when she – she spoke about this kind of process where 
she said to me that you know I am – I am busy bonding with 
you and now you are going to be leaving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MATONA:  To which I said, well Minister you know it is 
not a reflection on you it is a process that has been 
underway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.   And when you left the 
Department of Public Enterprises had your contract as DG 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 102 of 179 
 
come to an end or was it cut short so that you could go to 
Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  It still had about a year so it is normally five 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  I had sat for four or five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  So [00:09:54] everybody here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So basically – well she may have got an 
impression of how she was likely to work with you in the 
10 
three months or so but for all intents and purposes all these 
people who took this position that being allowed to go back 
to your job was out of the question did not know you much in 
terms of work? 
MR MATONA:  No.  Not at all – absolutely not at all.  As I 
indicated some like you know Doctor Ben Ngubane had 
known me before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  I had to – dealings – professional dealings 
with him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  With him. 
MR MATONA:  And in fact I can also still recall him saying, 
oh you know we are really excited to find – you know that 
you are here and we are going to work together.  This is – 
this was in December when they… 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 103 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In December. 
MR MATONA:  When they arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When the new board arrived? 
MR MATONA:  When the new board arrived you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  To say you know we continue the good – the 
good work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where had you worked with him? 
MR MATONA:  So I – I was also a Director General of 
Department of Trade and Industry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Prior to being Director General Public 
Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  At the time he had been placed – posted as 
an Ambassador to Japan I think it is Japan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  And – and so trade – so I was also 
responsible for Trade Promotion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MATONA:  You know.  And he was going – he was doing 
a project that required the department’s support. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  And it was a very important project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Project. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 104 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  I supported him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  And he was very pleased. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  With that experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  And that – that created a bit of a relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  You know between me and – him and I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how long had it – did you have that – 
10 
did you have that interaction with him?  A year, two years, 
three years or … 
MR MATONA:  When the project was a couple months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MATONA:  It was a – it was an Expo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR MATONA:  So you know which involved displays of South 
African goods. So it was a bit of a big complex project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – are you able to say that your 
impression is that during the time that you had cause to 
20 
interact with him in regard to that project while you were at 
the Department of Trade and Industry that he had a good 
impression of your abilities? 
MR MATONA:  Absolutely.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 105 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:  He was – there was great, goodwill. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  On – great respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Mutually between him and I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  And – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Well Mr Matona 
there is a media article I would like to refer you to they are 
10 
simply begging on the questions the truth person it has been 
asking you.  It is a media article on page 321 of the bundle 
in front of you.  321 that is Item 5.   
MR MATONA:  Item 5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja you found it?  Mr Chair we will mark 
that as Exhibit U13.14 – U13.14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 321. 
CHAIRPERSON:  321. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are there Mr Matona? 
20 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is an article by AmaBhungani titled 
New Eskom CEO Matona is weak say ex colleagues.  Now 
there is a mixed reaction about your appointment – the 
article is dated 22 August 2014.  But we need to see what 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 106 of 179 
 
the Minister said about you or is said to have said about you 
at the time.  Turn the page to 322.  The last two paragraphs 
do 
you 
see 
that 
one 
starting 
announcing 
Matona’s 
appointment? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I want to read that. 
“Announcing Matona’s appointment Brown 
said that he would continue work he had 
started at the Department.  Mr Matona has 
been closely involved in providing oversight 
10 
to 
Eskom 
and 
the 
other 
state-owned 
companies in the Department Portfolio for 
the past three years.  In recent months he 
has 
played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
the 
inter-
departmental task team comprising of the 
Departments of Public Enterprises, Energy 
and National Treasury which have been 
working with Eskom to formulate a solution to 
the immediate challenges facing Eskom.” 
 
Now if I read it excluding the other paragraphs it 
20 
reads: 
“In recent months he has played a key role in 
the inter-departmental task team which have 
been working with Eskom to formulate a 
solution to the immediate challenges facing 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 107 of 179 
 
Eskom.” 
 
Were you aware of this at the time? 
MR MATONA:  Ja I remember seeing this article at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is back on – way back in – on 22 
August 2014. 
MR MATONA:  Ja.  This was part of the media reaction to my 
appointment.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So at the time the Minister believed that 
you having played a key role in the inter-departmental task 
team which was working with Eskom you could assist in the 
10 
formulation of a solution to the immediate challenges facing 
Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  And Chairperson I had already alluded 
to this role which I had played prior to going to Eskom which 
resulted in a decision to allocate – I think it was a first 
support on a bail out from [00:17:56] to Eskom on account of 
the financial challenges.  So it was company that I was 
familiar with – familiar with some of the core challenges as it 
were.  So it was you know Eskom was no stranger to a very 
large extent.  Obviously, there were things I did not know 
20 
which I discovered when I got there.  But in general terms 
you know I – I knew the company.  I knew the issues and I 
think this is – this is a correct – this would be the – an 
accurate reflection of the sentiment of the Minister at the 
time.  So when I saw these words it resonated with you know 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 108 of 179 
 
the way I thought she perceived me.  After all if she did not  
- if she did not believe what she said here she would not 
have taken forward the you know the recommendation for my 
appointment to Cabinet as it were.  So she took that to 
Cabinet because – and I presume she had also consulted 
you know politically you know in terms of this appointment as 
it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at the time for your appointment as 
CEO – Group CEO of Eskom Minister Lynne Brown had to 
take your name to the Cabinet? 
10 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
say 
to 
the 
Cabinet 
she 
was 
recommending 
that 
Cabinet 
should 
approve 
your 
appointment? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And which would mean she thought that 
you would be up to the job at Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now between the time you started as 
Group CEO of Eskom I think it was said on the 1 October or 
20 
November? 
MR MATONA:  1 October correct Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1 October between that time and the time 
when you were suspended on the 11 March 2015 had the 
Minister had occasion to express any reservations about you 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 109 of 179 
 
having been appointed – expressing any reservation to you 
or had she complained about anything that she thought you 
were not able to do properly as Group CEO of Eskom? 
MR MATONA:  Not at all – not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She had never? 
MR MATONA:  She had never done that.  And because we 
had worked together before there was in a sense an open 
line of communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  I would typically for example where load-
10 
shedding was to be – was to [00:20:52] I would call her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And notify her. 
MR MATONA:  And say Minister please do not be surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MATONA:  We have reached this stage where we now 
have to deal with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATONA:  So – so the relationship was cordial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so as far as you knew she – you 
expected her to still form the same view as she had held 
20 
when she took your name to Cabinet 
MR MATONA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the board itself I know that we said it 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 110 of 179 
 
had hardly worked with you had it prior to the 9 t h expressed 
any concern about anything on your part prior to the 9t h 
March? 
MR MATONA:  None whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATONA:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And prior to the commencement of the 
meeting of the 11t h March had the Board or the Chairperson 
or anybody ever expressed any dissatisfaction with your 
performance or reservations about your abilities? 
10 
MR MATONA:  None whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue.  So Mr Matona let me – 
let us carry on on that line.  If the board were to say, well we 
suspended him because he was giving unreliable information 
to the War Room.  What would be your reaction to that? 
MR MATONA:  That would be absolutely incorrect as it were 
and I know that there is something which was put out there 
you know as a justification for a suspension.  But up to today 
20 
if you asked anybody would you indicate – what specific 
information inconsistency is attributable to Mr Matona I do 
not know.  Nobody said well here you are this – you said this 
on such and such a day and then you came back and said - 
and said something else at a later stage.  Nobody had done 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 111 of 179 
 
that.  To a point where I ended up concluding that it is 
possible that they had got understand information that there 
has been submitted and this is – refers to the War Room you 
know the information that was submitted to the War Room.  
The – there was a lot of complexity both in terms of the 
operations which is the generation and the finances of the 
company.  They change on an on-going basis as it were.  So 
the information naturally evolves and changes and if you 
wanted information today it would have to be as of the point 
where you require it.  And it will be different to the previous 
10 
sort of iteration.  I imagine that maybe this is what is 
inconsistent, unreliable information was about but again I 
cannot – nobody said well, as a – here is the evidence he 
said this today and this is what he said the next day.  So I do 
not buy – I do not buy that argument as it were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well there is another allegation by 
a member of the Board.  If you go to Item 10 in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Item 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go to divider number 10? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  You will submit it – submit it now 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is – are you there Mr Matona? 
MR MATONA:  I am. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 112 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you speak to far away from the 
microphone, I cannot hear you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  469? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  469.  Yes and page 469 you will see it is 
an affidavit.  It said a statement but it is commissioned of Ms 
Veneta Klein.  For the purposes of identification Mr Chair an 
admission into the record as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the statement that starts at 469 and 
10 
goes up to 518? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It goes up to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or have I combined two statements? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The other one is an annexure to the first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this – this the first one goes up to 491? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is the one that you … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For record purposes we have marked it 
20 
Exhibit U13.8.  Now Mr Matona you have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to have no pen here.  I had two 
pens before lunch and it looks like I did not come back with 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 113 of 179 
 
– thank you.  You are asking that this statement starting at 
469 be admitted as Exhibit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U13? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm?  U13? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U13.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point 8? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 8 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the statement by the Venete 
Klein starting at page 469 is admitted and will be marked as 
Exhibit U13.8. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Matona you 
have already indicated that or testified that she was one of 
the board members? 
MR MATONA:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now if you go to page 482 I just want to 
draw my attention to a paragraph.  All two paragraphs in her 
… 
MR MATONA:  482 correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  482 it is actually her affidavit.  So in 
paragraph 4 – in paragraph 45 she says: 
20 
“Mr Matona referred his matter to the Labour 
Court Johannesburg for an order to set aside 
his suspension and allow him to return to 
work.  This application was brought on an 
urgent basis and was opposed by Eskom at 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 114 of 179 
 
the same time Mr Matona had lodged an 
unfair 
labour 
practice 
dispute 
with 
the 
permission for conciliation mediation and 
arbitration.  The Labour Court found that 
there 
was 
no 
basis 
for 
urgency 
and 
dismissed the application in this regard.  It 
nonetheless found in favour of Mr Matona in 
respect 
of 
procedural 
fairness 
of 
the 
suspension and referred the matter to the 
CCMA for proper handling of the issues prior 
10 
to it being heard at the Labour Court.” 
 
Now the paragraph I want your comment on follows 
and she says: 
“My reason for supporting…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I missed the page number now 
where you are reading. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  56.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then she says: 
“My 
reason 
for 
supporting 
Mr 
Matona’s 
departure was that he did not appear to have 
a 
handle 
on 
the 
turnaround 
of 
the 
organisation which was particularly critical at 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 115 of 179 
 
that point in time.  Doctor Ngubane met with 
him and discussed his possible departure 
from 
Eskom. 
 
An 
agreement 
was 
subsequently reached with Mr Matona and he 
exited the services of Eskom.” 
 
That first sentence that in her view she supports ... 
because he did not appear to have a handle on the 
turnaround of the organisation.   Your reaction to that? 
MR MATONA:   Well you know if I had the opportunity to ask 
Ms Klein the question would be on what basis ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The factual basis of her statement? 
MR MATONA:   Exactly, exactly, she had basically only 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes the bold statement. 
MR MATONA:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she makes a bold statement. 
MR MATONA:   She makes a bold ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no motivation given for it. 
MR MATONA:   Absolutely you know so as I have indicated 
by the time we had a meeting of the 11 t h of March which is 
20 
the meeting that concluding with my suspension that would 
probably have been at least the second time of that time, so 
there’s – she would not have had any basis to form any 
substantive impression of the nature to warrant such a bold 
conclusion, that’s what I will say. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 116 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But more importantly is the question 
also whether did she express that view to you? 
MR MATONA:   Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The turnaround structure that she is 
talking about – ja – or she says he didn’t appear to have a 
handle on the turnaround of the organisation.  Now how the 
organisation would be turned around was that set out in 
some document that you found in existence when you joined 
Eskom or would there have been a document that you put 
together to say this is how we will handle the turnaround 
10 
MR MATONA:   We had in fact as I have indicated, since I 
had been at Eskom from October in the five months the main 
thing which had preoccupied probably entirely my time is the 
turnaround of the company.   Work had been done prior to 
that, so this was not a question of starting from nothing.  
Work had been done, good ideas had been developed, good 
solutions had been developed that needed to be taken 
forward, so we took all of these, consolidated them with the 
benefit of the support of government through the war room 
and had elaborated a turnaround, a turnaround strategy 
20 
which I presented to the Board on their arrival in the 
induction and as I indicated I spoke to the key issues of the 
turnaround in the meeting of 11t h in my report to the Board. 
 
Now let’s say Ms Klein did not agree or find any 
shortcomings in what I said she – nobody commented, 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 117 of 179 
 
nobody said anything to the information that I had submitted, 
so you know it is a bit disingenuous for her in this affidavit 
after the fact to make such an assertion as she has made 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was she part of the people at Eskom who 
would have had the opportunity of engaging with your 
proposed strategy, turnaround strategy or not? 
MR MATONA:   Correct, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and had she participated actively in 
that process? 
10 
MR MATONA:   To my recollection she had been there 
throughout all of the meetings of the Board up to that point, 
she had been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   So she would have heard me speak about 
the challenges of the company and what we propose to be 
done about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and she never raised any issues 
about there being anything wrong with your strategy or your 
ability to handle it.  
20 
MR MATONA:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.   Right let’s 
move on then, dealing with the aspect of your settlement 
negotiations with them.  Two Board members have submitted 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 118 of 179 
 
affidavits to this Commission, one of which is this one we’re 
dealing with, and in the next page, page P – page 483, 
paragraph 57 Ms Klein carries on to say with regards to Mr 
Koko I was present at a meeting with him, he was the one 
executive who was not interested in leaving the employ of  
Eskom.  He indicated that he wanted his job back.  With that 
in mind I want to take you to another affidavit which is on 
page 542, that’s item 12, page 542.  It is an affidavit of Dr 
Ngubane.   
 
For the record Chairperson the affidavit is marked 
10 
Exhibit U13.11 and we ask that it be submitted into the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one for Dr Ngubane? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chairperson.  Dated 4 August 
2020.   
CHAIRPERSON:   U13? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   U13.11. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the affidavit of Dr Baldwin Sipho 
Ngubane will be handed in and marked as Exhibit U13.11. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Are you there 
20 
Mr Matsona? 
MR MATONA:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I also want to refer you to a paragraph in 
Dr Ngubane’s affidavit on page 555.    
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 119 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 4.28, I am going to read 4.28 
and 4.29, it says: 
“Whilst the inquiry was pending Mr Matona had filed 
a labour dispute with the CCMA against Eskom.  
Following the conclusion of the inquiry Mr Matona 
negotiated and settled the dispute out of court and 
left Eskom.  This process was handled by the P & G 
Committee, I was not involved with it.” 
In the next paragraph he says: 
“Prior to that I have been tasked by the Board to 
10 
attend the CCMA proceedings which Mr Matona had 
instituted 
against 
Eskom. 
 
During 
one 
of 
my 
interactions with Mr Matona at the CCMA I suggested 
to him at my own initiative that he should consider 
returning to his position.   However Mr Matona was 
too upset with the whole saga and made it clear to 
me that he would not return to Eskom.” 
Any reaction to paragraph 4.2.9 Mr Matona? 
MR MATONA:   No, that is not true ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   For ease of reference let me take you 
20 
point by point, so you have already testified that Mr 
Ngubane, Dr Ngubane, I beg your pardon, was one of the 
officials who represented Eskom at the CCMA? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now he says during his interactions with 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 120 of 179 
 
you he requested that you consider returning to your 
position. 
MR MATONA:  No, I deny that, there is no such a thing.  He 
never did, remember he is the – he is the one who had 
requested a postponement on the basis that he needed to 
consult with the Minister which postponement was granted, 
so I never had any such conversation with Mr Ngubane, I 
deny that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well that’s him suggesting to you that 
you should consider returning to your position.    
10 
MR MATONA:   If I may Advocate, I mean Chairperson this 
sounds irrational, here is the Board that has ...[indistinct] Mr 
Ngubane was a member, takes a decision which to my 
knowledge was a unanimous decision, I have no record of 
him having defended the decision to suspend me and then a 
few weeks, weeks he has changed his position, he is of the 
view that I should go back to work, it does not make sense.   
So this is – there cannot be any basis to such a claim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well I thought as you testified you did 
say that you had taken your dispute to the Labour Court and 
20 
to the CCMA for the relief you have stated this morning 
which was to get your job back. 
MR MATONA:   Exactly.  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well why – are you able to say whether in 
making this statement Dr Ngubane must be mistaken if he 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 121 of 179 
 
thought he ever expressed that you should consider going 
back, or you think that he knows that the statement is not 
true but nevertheless makes it, or are you not able to say? 
MR MATONA:   I am unable to say Chairperson the basis 
upon which Mr – Dr Ngubane, sorry, has made a claim that 
he suggested to me.  I would definitely have remembered.  I 
would definitely have remembered if he had made such a 
suggestion, I would have grabbed it, because at that point I 
was aggrieved, I needed my job back and my dignity restored 
so I would have grabbed that opportunity so there is no such 
10 
a thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you have gone to court and 
CCMA to precisely achieve that, get your job back, that is 
why you had engaged lawyers for whom you were going to 
pay out of your own pocket to get the job back so if he had 
mentioned that maybe you should consider going back you 
are likely to have an interest in that. 
MR MATONA:   I would have, I would have because for a 
start it would have probably suggested a change of heart on 
the part of the Board and it would have probably suggested 
20 
that maybe they made a mistake so maybe I could work with 
them, so I would have gone.  The only reason that I decided 
to move on was because I realised that I was never going to 
work well with this Board, I was never going to get the 
necessary support that a CE requires from a Board that had 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 122 of 179 
 
taken the sort of action that Eskom Board did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   But could it be that, 
Mr Matona, what you have just said is what he is saying in 
the last sentence of that paragraph, that Mr Matona was too 
upset with the whole saga and made it clear to me that he 
would not return to Eskom. 
 
Now remember that sentence presupposes that he 
made the suggestion, which he said he did, in the previous 
sentence. 
10 
MR MATONA:   Ja, I can see this, that I was too upset.  
Yes, I was upset but I was not too upset to even walk away 
from my job if I could get it back, certainly not to that 
extent. 
ADV SELEKA SC: So I think, you know, to go back to the 
Chairperson’s question earlier, what one is trying to 
determine from your testimony and what we see here, you 
had said to the Chairperson Mr Romeo Kumalo said to you 
there is no way of you going back but we see the statement 
by one of the persons you have said that Ngubane was 
20 
present in your settlement discussions, he is saying well, 
the suggestion was made by him for you to consider 
coming back.  Now we would have to be able – the 
Chairperson has got to be either to say you either have no 
recollection of him saying that or that you know he did not 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 123 of 179 
 
say that.    
MR MATONA:   I know he did not say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, did you say he was one of the 
Eskom representatives present when you were told going 
back to your job was out of the question? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that he – oh well – now he says 
in the paragraph concerned that – that is 429. 
10 
“During one of my interactions with Mr Matona at 
the CCMA, I suggested to him at my own initiative 
that he should consider returning to his position.” 
So there was the first meeting, there was the second 
meeting.  It was at the second meeting that you were told 
going back to your job was out of the question. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it cannot be that one.  It cannot be 
that he said that – it cannot be that it would be that one 
and it could not be the second one.  So the question would 
20 
be whether prior to the first meeting maybe when the 
conciliation process was postponed at the CCMA whether it 
might have been during that time. 
MR MATONA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say at no time did he ever [inaudible 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 124 of 179 
 
– speaking simultaneously] 
MR MATONA:   At no stage whatsoever, ja, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Let us go back to 
paragraph 4.28, he says: 
“Whilst the inquiry was pending Mr Matona had filed 
a labour dispute with the CCMA against Eskom.  On 
the conclusion of the inquiry Mr Matona negotiated 
and settled the dispute out of court and left Eskom.  
This process was handled by the P & G committee.  
10 
I was not involved with it.” 
Now was he involved or not involved in the conclusion of 
your settlement at Eskom? 
MR MATONA:   No, he was.  He was.  I distinctly remember 
at least two of those meetings outside of the CCMA where 
Dr Ben Ngubane was present even though, as I indicated 
earlier, the person who was doing talking on behalf of 
Eskom was Mr Romeo Kumalo but a delegation of Dr 
Ngubane, Mr Kumalo and Ms Klein, those are the people 
that I had interactions with.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, we have a copy of your 
settlement agreement with Eskom on page 330, that is item 
7, for your ease of reference.  It will start on page 331, 
Chairperson.  It also has to be admitted.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 125 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, we have marked it 
EXHIBIT U13.6. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
EXHIBIT 
U13.6, 
the 
settlement 
agreement between Eskom Holdings SOC Limited and Mr 
Tshediso John Matona appearing at page 331 is admitted 
and marked as EXHIBIT U13.6. 
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN ESKOM AND MR 
MATONA HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT U13.6 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. I should point 
out before going into what I need to show you, Mr Matona 
10 
and Chairperson that the copy in the file is not a signed 
settlement agreement. However, there is a file prepared in 
the Commission which has a signed settlement agreement 
ongoing to that leaf, Chairperson, to use that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But are the same?  Identical? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is used – it is contained in a bundle 
that will be used during the course of the week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will provide Mr Matona with it, to 
have a look at it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And compare it with the one in his file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The signed was belatedly received 
from Eskom. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 126 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hence there is nothing in his bundle.  
Mr Matona, what has been handed up to you is also titled 
settlement agreement.  It indicates that it is a settlement 
agreement between yourself and Eskom.  What I was 
pointing out, the last page of the copy in your bundle is 
unsigned, but the one I have handed up to you is signed.  
Please have a look whether the signed document is the 
settlement agreement that you have signed.       
MR MATONA:   I am sorry, Advocate, this is not the copy 
10 
of my settlement agreement because it bears the name of 
Mr Ben Ngubane.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    Oh sorry, this one?  It had an extra 
page which was incorrect. 
MR MATONA:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see why, Mr Matona, sorry, the 
pages are back to back. 
MR MATONA:   The pages are back to back? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   Okay because I see this one still has the 
20 
front page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go to the front page. 
MR MATONA:   Okay, let us see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where it is written settlement 
agreement. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 127 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   Okay.  I see that – yes, yes, that is right.  I 
think it is put together with Mr Marokane’s agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just follow the page numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second?  Is there a spare sanitizer 
that you could give to the witness so as and when he is 
given documents he can sanitize? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MATONA:   Ja, I see a page – the signature page that 
has my signature so this would be the copy, ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC: Let us start at the beginning where the 
page – the covering page with Settlement Agreement on it  
so that once you have looked at it we can hand it up to the 
Chairperson.  Ja, I think there is a bit of a mix-up, Chair.  
The flagged one, Mr Matona... 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The flagged one, put it aside, the 
flagged page. 
MR MATONA:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC: Put it aside. 
20 
MR MATONA:   I am looking for the – the one I had 
previously did have on the cover my name. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
MR MATONA:   But I now have part of my agreement with 
my signature.   
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 128 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, with your permission may 
I ask the investigator to help him find it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MATONA:   I am missing the cover page.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   I am missing the cover page, I think – no, I 
think it is – ja, I think it is fine, I am only missing the cover 
page.  Thank you, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you have the settlement agreement 
page? 
10 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the next page is table of contents. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then you have – now I am using 
the paginated – not paginated but printed page number.  
Page 1. 
MR MATONA:   Page 1 at... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Below the red pagination. 
MR MATONA:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  “Whereby the parties agree as follows. 
20 
1. Interpretation” 
The next page, you do not have that?. 
MR MATONA:   Interpretation, correct, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is paragraph 1.2.3, written Mr T J 
Matona. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 129 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    1.2.3. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “Means Mr Tshediso John Matona.” 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, paragraph 1.2.6 reads: 
“The termination date means 31 May 2015.” 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then paragraph 2, recordal.  It reads 
in paragraph 2.1: 
10 
“Mr T J Matona is employed by Eskom.” 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that?  Go to the next page, 
it should be – should start with paragraph 2.2. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “The parties have mutually agreed to 
terminate this employment contract.” 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that? 
MR MATONA:   Correct.. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So your name again appears at 3.1: 
“By mutual agreement Mr Matona...” 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   3.4, Mr Matona agrees that appointing 
a nation of employment. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 130 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   3.4? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   3.4. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  3.5 also Eskom will give to Mr 
Matona on or before 15 June. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next page, paragraph 4.3, the next 
page ...[intervenes]  
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 4.4. 
10 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next page it has clause 6 
confidentiality. 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Clause 7 statements.  
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And there is your name again Mr T J 
Matona shall not make any written or oral statements. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then paragraph 8, breach or clause 8. 
20 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next page clause 9, non-variation. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next page, clause 10 notices and 
domicilium. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 131 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And 10.1 each party chooses the 
address set out opposite its name below as its address. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that.  Then the first address is 
Eskom, Megawatt Park. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then there’s provision for your address 
Mr T J Matona.  This one doesn’t have your address, does 
that one have your address? 
10 
MR MATONA:   No, this one too doesn’t have my address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall completing it by filling in 
your address? 
MR MATONA:  I will not recall but I signed it because it 
has got my signature, so ...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let’s go to the next page, clause 11, 
do you have it? 
MR MATONA:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is general and then in clause 12 
signature.  
20 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you on the signature page? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recognise this document. 
MR MATONA:   I do. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 132 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When was it signed? 
MR MATONA:   When? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When, date of signing. 
MR MATONA:   Date, I have it signed on the 15 t h of May, 
that is  the date that is reflected on it here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You signed it on the 15 t h of May? 
MR MATONA:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which year? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we now know whether ...[intervenes]    
MR MATONA:   15 t h of May 2015. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we now know whether the unsigned 
copy that I have is exactly the same as the signed 
settlement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or do we not know that?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well I know I have checked them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the intention is to rely on the 
signed copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ultimately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what I will have to do for the 
Chairperson is to have copies prepared of the signed 
document in order to replace the unsigned. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 133 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Matona who signed the document 
on behalf of Eskom? 
MR MATONA:   I beg yours? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who signed the settlement agreement 
on behalf of Eskom. 
MR MATONA:   On behalf of Eskom it is Zithembe Khosa, 
acting Chairperson of – Acting Chairman of the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shall we hand up the document to the 
Chairperson?  I beg leave to hand up, do you need a cover 
10 
page, do you need a cover? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the signed copy? 
MR MATONA:   There’s a page missing here, ja, this has 
got my name and it’s got ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where must this fit in? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will mark it Chairperson I think we 
have already identified it, there’s U13.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The holes on the front page are on the 
wrong side it seems.  Does somebody have a punch so I 
can punch it on the right side.  The right side will be the 
20 
left side of the page.  We can move on while somebody is 
sorting this out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed sir, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once it’s ready we can attend to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Matona you said you signed on the 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 134 of 179 
 
15 t h of May 2015. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you know the investigation 
which Dr Ngubane refers to in that paragraph we’ve read 
whether it did take place.   
MR MATONA:  I can’t be sure for a fact because as I 
indicated I was supposed to have been also interviewed as 
part of the investigations but I was never interviewed, I 
had no opportunity whatsoever to make any input but I 
believe the investigation was undertaken and concluded 
10 
and a report of the investigation was published by Eskom?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well the date 15 May 2015 is the date 
when you signed, it was publicised in the media and I want 
to refer you to the media article.  In April 2015, this is 
before you signed your settlement agreement, the media 
article had something to say or to report on what was said 
by Minister Lynne Brown.   
I am going to hand it up, it is also contained in a 
separate bundle but not in your bundle, it will be used in 
due course in the Commission.  Chairperson I have two 
20 
copies, I beg leave to hand up one to the Chairperson and 
to you Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have just found something but I 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 135 of 179 
 
think I found ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the back to back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If it is taken out of the file it confuses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I may use the pagination at the top 
of the page, page 613, 614 and 615.  613, 614 and 615.  
Chairperson we could also admit it as an exhibit in this 
bundle of U13 or we could keep it in U16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is it again, it is an 
10 
article? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a media article ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   From what application, do we know? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is from Politi.org. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is publicised on the website, 
Politi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Okay, to it is 613, 614, 615, you 
would like it to be admitted, does it start at 612, is that 
where it starts, or just start at 613? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   612 should be omitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   612 should be omitted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should be omitted Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I will draw a line across okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 136 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it should start at 613. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   613, 614 and 615. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and it is to be Exhibit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be Exhibit 13.15 
CHAIRPERSON:   The article entitled “Brown moves to 
stabilise Eskom leadership with appointment of Molefe as 
Acting 
CEO” 
dated 
17 t h 
April 
2015 
and 
written 
by 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The date is 17 April 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, written by Terence Prima Media 
10 
Africa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This I think will be marked Exhibit 
U13.15. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 15, thank you.  Mr Matona you 
see that media article? 
MR MATONA:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you familiar with it, have you seen 
it before? 
MR MATONA:   No I don’t recall seeing this article before. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well the headline reads “Brown moves 
to stabilise Eskom leadership with appointment of Molefe 
as Acting CEO”, can you see that?  
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then there’s a photo there of 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 137 of 179 
 
Minister Brown at the time, the catch phrase below the 
photo says “Minister Lynn Brown in foreground with Brian 
Molefe far left and Deputy Minister Bulelani Magwaneshe 
at the Eskom announcement”, and on the right hand side of 
the photo is written Public Enterprises Minister Lynn Brown 
announced 
that 
Transnet’s 
Brian 
Molefe 
had 
been 
seconded as Acting CEO of Eskom with immediate effect.  
The article itself reads: 
“Brown said the appointment form part of the 
Government’s 
effort 
to 
stabilise 
the 
Eskom 
10 
leadership following the suspension of four senior 
executives, 
including 
CEO 
Tshediso 
Matona.  
Speaking 
at 
Megawatt 
Park 
on 
Friday 
Brown 
indicated that although the suspensions of Matona 
and the other executives were due to be lifted in 
less than three months she wanted Molefe to remain 
at 
Eskom 
for 
at 
least 
a 
year 
to 
oversee 
a 
turnaround 
process 
as 
he 
had 
done 
at 
both 
Transnet and the Public Investment Corporation.” 
May I pause there and ask you by this time you are still on 
20 
suspension? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By this time your matter is still pending 
at the CCMA. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 138 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know that the Minister had 
made this decision at the time? 
MR MATONA:   I did eventually hear because it was well 
publicised that Mr Brian Molefe had been seconded from – 
well, moved, I think from Transnet to Eskom, so I knew 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this article you said was written on 
the 17 t h, it is dated 17 April 2015, does the article say on 
what date this announcement by Minister was made?  Was 
it made on that date, was it made on the previous day?  Do 
10 
we know? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It does not seem to indicate that, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    But you can make it out, the article is 
dated the 17 t h, it says: 
“Speaking at Megawatt on Friday…” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we can check …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have to check what day of the 
20 
week the 17 t h was.  So probably it was a few days before 
the 17 t h, it was either the previous day or a few days 
before.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am told it was the same day, the 17 t h 
is a Friday. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 139 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was a Friday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of April, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MATONA:   The same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  So – yes, continue, Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So looking at what is attributed to 
Minister Lynne Brown at the beginning of that article, 
namely: 
“Speaking at Megawatt on Friday, Brown indicated 
10 
that although the suspensions of Matona and the 
other executives were due to be lifted in less than 
three months she wanted Molefe to remain at 
Eskom for at least a year to oversee a turnaround 
process as he had done at both Transnet and Public 
Investment Corporation.” 
So three candidates had been identified to replace Mr 
Molefe at Transnet - that is something else.  Later on: 
“Brown stressed that she had no intention of 
unfairly discriminating against Mr Matona, was only 
20 
appointed to the position in late 2014 but she 
needed 
the 
skills 
and 
experience 
that 
Molefe 
possessed immediately.  I need that support now, 
she said, reporting that Molefe’s secondment had 
been canvassed and endorsed by President Jacob 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 140 of 179 
 
Zuma, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and the 
Eskom and Transnet boards.” 
And then: 
“She did not discount Molefe and Matona working 
together for a period.” 
But – so she says, according to the article: 
“She also did not discount Molefe and Matona 
working together for a period, “I would like Molefe 
for the full year to actually work in turning around 
Eskom and if that means with Mr Matona beyond 
10 
three months time, we will find another title for 
him.” 
Would you agree that it seems that if what is attributed to 
her is what she said, by this time she was clear that if you 
were to continue at Eskom they would have to find another 
title for you but you would not be CEO. 
MR MATONA:   I think it is implied …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is implied. 
MR MATONA:   It is implied by the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Statement. 
20 
MR MATONA:   By the statement, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   And if you link it back to the position of, 
you know, I cannot go back to my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 141 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   Ja, they will kind of tie up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is strange, however, is that – 
or rather, what she seems to be saying or revealing is that 
she believed Mr Molefe has some skills and experience 
that she thought Eskom needed and what is strange is, if 
that was the issue, why were you not approached to 
discuss the issue properly?  Why were you suspended in 
circumstances where it is not clear exactly what you were 
suspended for unless it was some illegitimate reason. 
MR MATONA:   Absolutely, you know, Chairperson, and it 
10 
turns out that Mr Brian Molefe is someone that I know very 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   Recalling the CEO of Transnet and when I 
was Director General.  Of course, we also go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   And so I know his abilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   And, you know, I would not fault him, as it 
were. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   For his suitability for the role. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   I think the question was the circumstances 
in which he was brought as it impacted in particular.  I 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 142 of 179 
 
think it was untidy to say the least. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, I can 
confirm that the 17 t h was a Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now these pages of this article, must 
they go where those page numbers are supposed to go?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, they will have to change when they 
10 
come into this file, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we will regularise …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are going to put them separately so 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will regularise in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 And 
then 
while 
we 
are 
that, 
Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What will be important then, if the page 
20 
numbers that we have used, namely – been talking about 
the article, 613 and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If that is going to change, somebody will 
have to make sure that in the transcript where 613 they put 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 143 of 179 
 
the correct… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The correct, indeed, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I have a copy of the settlement 
agreement that is signed, this is single sided, Chairperson, 
so it should not pose the problem of the double sided, 
when it is outside of the file.  So I beg leave to hand it up.  
Let Mr Matona first look at it and you will hand it up to the 
Chair.  Is that the correct one? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, this is now correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
MR MATONA:   Can I just hand it up? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask this, Mr Matona, going back t 
the article at page 614, it says at the bottom: 
“Brown also announced that the terms of reference 
of the so-called “deep dive” probe of Eskom’s 
finances, maintenance protocols, diesel costs and 
coal supply and costs had been finalised by the 
board., the four executives were suspended in mid-
March in order for the investigation to proceed on 
20 
an unfettered basis.” 
So this paragraph seems to suggest that it refers to the 
same inquiry that was contemplated at the meeting of the 
11 t h March. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 144 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that this inquiry had been completed 
by the 17 April. 
MR MATONA:   No, actually on the contrary, Chairperson, 
it says that the terms of reference, only at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, oh, oh. 
MR MATONA:   The terms of reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is it the terms of reference that had 
been finalised? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the inquiry. 
10 
MR MATONA:   Ja, it appears that it hadn’t started by 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, no, no.  No, that is why I 
was wondering how could have been finalised so quickly.  
Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Matona, 
there is a – you have provided the Commission with 
correspondence because I am talking of this terms of 
reference.  You had provided the Commission with what 
you and your attorneys had addressed as a letter to the – 
20 
to Eskom.  Can we look at that while we are dealing with 
the terms of reference.  You see what you sought from 
them, meaning from Eskom, that is on page 654, item 14, 
for your ease of reference.  Item 14. 
MR MATONA:   644 you say? 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 145 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 654. 
MR MATONA:   654.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you identify the document to the 
Chairperson? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, so this is the letter that was sent to 
Eskom by my attorneys in the legal challenge against my 
suspension.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the document is on Chewable 
10 
Thompson and Hansom  letterhead attorneys dated 18 
March 2015.  So this is seven days after your suspension 
which was on the 11 March. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The letter is addressed to Mr Zola 
Tsetse, Chairperson Eskom Holdings.  This reads: 
“Dear Sir, Mr Tshediso Matona’s Suspension.  We 
act on behalf of Mr Tshediso Matona who is 
employed as Chief Executive at Eskom, our client.  
Our client’s suspension and the letter specifying the 
20 
basis on which the suspension was effected refer.  
We advise as follows:   
Reasons for the suspension.  It appears from the 
notice of suspension dated 11 March 2015 that our 
client 
has 
been 
suspended 
for 
the 
following 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 146 of 179 
 
purpose.  Due to the nature of the proposed 
independent inquiry and the importance of it being 
free from any influence from leadership in the 
organisation 
and 
in 
the 
completion 
of 
an 
investigation into these matters, your client should 
be without any loss of benefits and pay.  Apart from 
this purpose, no other reasons for this suspension 
have been provided.  In particular no allegations of 
misconduct on the part of our client had been made.  
In the circumstances, our client was suspended 
10 
without a fair reason.  Moreover, our client’s 
suspension 
has 
caused 
him 
irreparable 
harm, 
aggravated no doubt by the unlawful and unfair 
manner in which the suspension had been effected.  
In addition, our client’s suspension has been placed 
in the media with confusion as to the basis for the 
suspension creating an atmosphere of wrongdoing 
when none exists.  This has affected our client’s 
personal and professional life and has caused him 
irreparable harm and will continue to cause him 
20 
further harm if it is not undone.  We have no doubt 
that you are aware of the legal principles and the 
jurisprudence that govern suspensions and in the 
circumstances will agree with us that Eskom has 
clearly not met the legal threshold for substantive 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 147 of 179 
 
fairness in relation to the suspension.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to go to the real issue, you 
want to raise a [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MATONA:   That portion was meant to do exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go the next page, Mr Matona.  
Under the heading “The Inquiry”, paragraph 4 says: 
“Without prejudice to our client’s rights in relation 
to his suspension and in light of your assertion that 
an independent inquiry would be conducted into the 
10 
possibility 
that 
the 
power 
delivery 
may 
be 
compromised by either intentional or negligent 
conduct please advise who will conduct the inquiry, 
what is the nature of the inquiry, is it an internal, 
external, professional, forensic or other type of 
investigation?  What are the terms of reference of 
that 
inquiry, 
what 
kind 
of 
process 
will 
the 
investigator or the investigation team undertake in 
order to conduct the inquiry?  When will the inquiry 
commence and when will it be concluded?” 
20 
Now you specifically asked there, or your attorneys on your 
behalf, about what the terms of reference were of that 
inquiry.  You see that on paragraph 4.3. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you given the terms of 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 148 of 179 
 
reference? 
MR MATONA:   No.  The inquiry or purported inquiry itself, 
as I gathered at the time, got into a space of extreme 
uncertainty as to the terms of reference when it was going 
to start, whether the investigator was properly appointed, 
the result of which it was delayed, as it were, and frankly, 
Chairperson, I lost really any interest in that inquiry, it was 
neither here nor there for me except of course that when it 
was concluded, it again confirmed that no particular 
wrongdoing had been found on my part. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, there was a response to your 
attorney …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from – I am sorry, apart from 
finding that there had been no proper wrongdoing on your 
part, did it say anything about your abilities as CEO? 
MR MATONA:   No, not to knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you were able to read it, you 
know what it said. 
MR MATONA:   I actually was never furnished a copy of 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   In the end, because I exited Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you find a copy in one or 
another - in this age of technology or not? 
MR MATONA:   I have not been to establish that, 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 149 of 179 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To find a copy. 
MR MATONA:   I need to draw the Chairperson’s attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
subsequently 
became 
a 
form 
of 
controversy around the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The report. 
MR MATONA:   The report.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   Which version, you know?  In the end there 
were several versions, you know, some which appear to 
10 
have been – what is the word, redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   Certain aspects of the report removed from 
it, as it were.  There was controversy which I am sure the 
Commission might be interested to look at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   What is important is that when it was 
released by Eskom in the media, one of the statements 
that had been made was that no wrongdoing had been 
found and I had subsequently been contacted by the 
20 
media. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   To ask me how I felt about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   Ja.  And my position was that I had always 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 150 of 179 
 
been innocent right from the word go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   So it did not come as surprise that nothing 
had been found against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So when they released it this was 
made clear that no wrongdoing on your part had been 
found. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I guess if anything had been found, 
namely whether you were not – had not performed properly, 
10 
that would have been said. 
MR MATONA:   They would have said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  For the 
record, Chairperson, we will ask that the letter be admitted 
as EXHIBIT U13.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter from Cheadle Thomson & 
Haysom Incorporated Attorneys addressed to Mr Zola 
20 
Tsotsi, Chairperson of Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd dated 18 
March 2015 is admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT 
U13.9. 
LETTER FROM MR MATONA’S ATTORNEYS TO ESKOM 
HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT U13.9 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 151 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Matona, 
back to this media article, you were busy with U13.15.  I 
have read the bottom – the paragraph at the foot of the 
page, 614: 
“Brown also announced that the terms of reference 
of the so-called “deep dive” probe of Eskom’s 
finances, maintenance protocols, diesel costs and 
coal supply and costs had been finalised by the 
board.” 
Now I have asked you whether did you become aware at 
10 
the time of this media report. 
MR MATONA:   No, not at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is now on the 17 April 2015, a 
month after you had requested what the terms of reference 
were.  Now Minister Brown is said to have said they are 
finalised.  Were you ever provided with a copy? 
MR MATONA:   I was never provided with a copy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The paragraph further reads: 
“The four executives were suspended in mid- March 
in order for the investigation to proceed on an 
20 
unfettered basis.”  
You turn the page, just flip the page over to page 615, it 
reads: 
“The delay in finalising the terms of reference that 
arisen as result of former Chairperson Zola Tsotsi 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 152 of 179 
 
who resigned on March 31 having to sought to draft 
the terms alone.  He had also not followed correct 
procedure in appointing Nick Linnell to oversee the 
investigation.” 
Now I know that I have asked you about Mr Nick Linnell, 
now here it is alleged that a proper process was not 
followed in his appointment.  Have you – or may I say, 
during your suspension, at a time immediately following 
your suspension, did you become aware of Mr Nick Linnell? 
MR MATONA:   No, not at the time.  I did, however, pick up 
10 
this name because it was featured in the media as a 
person who had been drafted in by Eskom to do various 
things linked to our suspension, linked to the inquiry.  I 
eventually knew this – which is a point I was making to 
you, Chairperson, that there was a bit of controversy 
around this.    
 
But the thing, now that we are here is, as we can 
see, we were suspended for a purported inquiry whose 
terms of reference, whose scope, probably to raise here, a 
lot of things had not yet been decided about this inquiry, as 
20 
you can see.   You know, so – and yet the board saw it fit 
to suspend us.  I find that curious, I could not help the 
opportunity to point that out, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were suspended on the 11 
March and on the 17 April, that is just over a month later.  
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 153 of 179 
 
Mr Molefe was announced as seconded to Eskom. 
MR MATONA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, how far are we from 
finishing?  We have gone past four o’clock.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let me – maybe 15 minutes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then we are done.  Mr Matona, then 
you, as you say, signed a settlement agreement and you 
left Eskom. 
10 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now you talk about in your affidavit an 
occasion where you meet with the former President, Jacob 
Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before you get to that 
because I suspect that might the last topic. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we go back to his settlement 
agreement?  Have we put it in or is it separate? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, we have not put it in.  Have you got 
your settlement agreement, Mr Matona? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is on page 330 …[intervenes] 
MR MATONA:   I do not know if …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Item 7. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 154 of 179 
 
MR MATONA:   7, it is 7, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Item 7. 
MR MATONA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am just having a look here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 331. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I note that in clause 3.5.2 of the 
settlement 
agreement 
– 
we 
have 
not 
admitted 
the 
settlement agreement, hey?  I see I have not made any 
note. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it to be dealt with later? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the reason is we want this one, 
this copy, Chairperson, to replace the unsigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one which is already in the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine.  Ja, 3.5.2.  There 
Eskom undertook to give you a favourable reference 
regarding your employment with Eskom and said they 
would not issue any other references to third parties 
without your consent and agreement regarding the contents 
20 
thereof.  That seems to suggest to me that they had no 
problem with any conduct on your part and maybe also in 
regard to your performance.  Is that how you understood 
that as well or not necessarily? 
MR MATONA:   No, precisely the point, Chairperson. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 155 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   It says here that they would provide a 
favourable reference which means that they will represent 
me properly, as I should. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   In terms of my competence and my 
integrity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   Because that - you know, nothing had been 
found against me, as it were.  This is what this clause – 
10 
that is how I understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   Of course, I have never had to go and 
request Eskom for any references. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And 4.3 talks about some – I 
do not know whether it is pension benefits that you would 
have been entitled to if you had stayed on for a further ten 
months or so, is that right? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just talk to that clause and tell me what 
20 
that benefit was about? 
MR MATONA:   So I was caught up in a double jeopardy 
where I left the employ of government and in that sense 
kind of short-changed my pension but on the promise of a 
more rewarding role as CEO of Eskom. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 156 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   And now that also had become almost, you 
know, upset, as it were.  And so the minimum – in addition 
to the package that the top-notch package was to make 
good the difference – call it a penalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   The pension penalty which Eskom agreed 
to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   To restore me to the position I would have 
10 
been had I stayed – had I continued in my position as 
Director General. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So a settlement agreement was 
really – was made on the basis that you had done nothing 
wrong and, in any event, before the settlement agreement, 
they had also said you had done – you had not done 
anything wrong. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.                                              
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Matona, if 
20 
you will go to page 342. 
MR MATONA:   342? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MATONA:   Correct., I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Explain to the Chairperson what is that 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 157 of 179 
 
document? It seems to be an annexure to your settlement 
agreement.  
MR MATONA:  Yes, so because the matter was a subject of 
public interest, media interest, I had also agreed that 
Eskom and myself will issue a media statement, which 
statement Eskom drafted and I looked at it and I was 
comfortable that the statement could go as drafted and 
hence it is attached to the agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the document is marked annexure 
A, official communication and it reads: 
10 
“Eskom and its Chief Executive, Mr M J Matona...” 
Is that yourself? 
MR MATONA:   I think there is a typo on my initials, ja.  
But the correct initials are to follow.  T J. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   T J. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see the third line has T J. 
“...have 
mutually 
agreed 
to 
part 
ways 
on 
an 
amicable basis.  It is expressly noted that no 
misconduct is alleged by Eskom against Mr T J 
20 
Matona.  Mr Matona believes that the agreement to 
separate is in the best interests of Eskom to allow 
the board to pursue its plan of the company under 
the current leadership.  Having considered his 
contribution at Eskom and his vast professional and 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 158 of 179 
 
leadership experience, Eskom is of the view that Mr 
Matona can still play a vital role for South Africa 
whether he is commercial business or the public 
service. 
 
Eskom 
thanks 
Mr 
Matona 
for 
his 
contribution during his term at Eskom.” 
That is the end of the document.  So it reiterates that no 
misconduct is alleged against you. 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see that last part which says: 
“Eskom is of the view that Mr Matona can still play 
10 
a 
vital 
role 
for 
South 
Africa 
whether 
within 
commercial business or the public service.” 
That seems to express a sentiment that was expressed 
also in the settlement agreement between the government 
and Mr Pikoli when they settled his matter.  You will recall 
that he was suspended in I think September 2008 before 
President Mbeki was recalled and there was an enquiry and 
chaired by Dr Ginwala and it made certain findings which 
included the finding that he was – he had integrity but I 
think – I cannot remember whether it said he should be 
20 
taken back.  I think it may have said he should be taken 
back.  Ja, I think it said he should be taken back but I think 
by the time it completed its work – I do not know whether 
President Mbeki was still there or whether it was President 
Motlanthe, he was not taken back, the matter – the report 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 159 of 179 
 
was sent to parliament and parliament decided not to go 
along with the inquiry’s outcome that he should be taken 
back and that was because I think – or some concern about 
some security-related issues I think about whether in 
seeking to prosecute certain people or somebody, he had 
appreciated, failed to appreciate the security risk and he 
then challenged that in court, the resolution of the National 
Assembly and ultimately the matter was settled but when it 
was settled, I think one of the clauses was that he was 
suitable to be appointed to any senior position within 
10 
public service and I think the settlement agreement that 
was concluded between President Zuma and Mxolisi had a 
similar clause as well.  I just make that observation, it is 
interesting.  You might not be able to say anything but if 
you want to say something you may do so. 
MR MATONA:   The only thing I can say, Chairperson, is 
that at a personal level, as well at a public level, one can 
never fully know the extent of the damage that something 
like this does to one’s reputation, as it were.  And so to the 
extent that this commitment which Eskom made freely of 
20 
their 
own 
volition 
helps 
to, 
I 
mean, 
ameliorate 
the 
situation, it is welcome.  But at the end of the day, I think 
what matters is the fact that up to today no one has found 
that I have done anything wrong that warranted the sort of 
action taken by Eskom Board against me. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 160 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course what seems to be a common 
feature among all the three settlements that I have 
mentioned namely your settlement with the government, Mr 
Nxasana’s settlement with the government and Mr Pikoli’s 
settlement with the government, is that none of you 
appeared to have been found to have committed any 
misconduct, certainly with you, certainly with Mr Nxasana 
and I think certainly with – I think also with Mr Pikoli.  
There was just something that was said about whether he 
had appreciated certain security risks in approaching 
10 
certain matters the way he had approached but all of these 
people appeared to have been pushed out by government 
in circumstances where a lot of people would not be able 
to find what they had done wrong.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ja.  Sorry, Chair, I 
wanted to pursue something in your questioning.  Mr 
Matona, I was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice has gone down again, Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Matona, I was about to refer 
20 
you or to ask you about what you referred to as the 
meeting you had with the former President Jacob Zuma in 
your affidavit and a quick way to deal with it is to refer you 
to the page number which is on page 21 of your affidavit.  
Page 21.  Now if you may please, and be brief in your 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 161 of 179 
 
explanation to the Chairperson, how that meeting came 
about. 
MR MATONA:   So I have now settled with Eskom, I have 
moved on from that episode, contemplating my future, I get 
a call from the office of the then President Jacob Zuma, 
indicating that he would like to meet me.  Now I might also 
say that I – in the aftermath of the events at Eskom I had 
requested to meet him, you know, as …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had to...? 
MR MATONA:   I had requested to meet the President. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, after you had exited Eskom. 
MR MATONA:   Well …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or before? 
MR MATONA:   After my suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, during your suspension? 
MR MATONA:   During, ja, just to deal with that crisis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MATONA:   Of my suspension.  I put out a request, I 
had not had a response.  Eventually, I did not meet the 
President around that at that time.  I got a call to say that 
20 
he would like to meet me which is about June or July, I 
cannot be precise of the time, but I recall that it was after I 
had settled with Eskom and in a sense, you know, the 
matter had been laid to rest.  I suppose could say the 
matter had been laid to rest, in that way.  I got a call and I 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 162 of 179 
 
subsequently went to see the President, you know, I think 
a few days later. 
 
I had not been told what the purpose of the meeting 
was, I said to the lady when she asked me are you 
available, I said to her of course, if the President wants to 
meet me I have to be available and we had a meeting.  It 
was just the two of us, as it were.  
 
He asked me how I was doing and I indicated to him 
well, you know, that I was doing well, you know, as well 
can be under the circumstances.  I had been contemplating 
10 
my future, I did not have a job at the time.   
 
He went on to say to me that well, you know, what 
happened at Eskom, you know, has got absolutely nothing 
to do with you, it is not a reflection upon you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that?  What happened at 
Eskom? 
MR MATONA:   In other words, my suspension from Eskom 
was not a reflection upon me, as far as the President was 
concerned.  That is what he said to me and that – because, 
I had - you know, I have worked with him over the years in 
20 
government from when he was the Deputy President.  I 
have had lots of interactions with him so we knew each 
other personally and he had said that, you know, the 
events at Eskom was not a reflection upon me and that he 
personally still held me in high regard and that the whole 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 163 of 179 
 
of government still held me in high regard. 
 
You know, I had served this government from day 
one from, you know, 1994.  Probably now the longest – one 
of the longest serving senior public servants, as it were. 
 
So I kind of appreciated where he was coming from.  
What he did say was that, you know, I got caught up in the 
middle of a spaghetti, those were the words he used, you 
know?   Of course …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand what he meant by 
those words? 
10 
MR MATONA:   I did not understand what he meant and 
part of the reason is because I had waited, you know, for 
him for quite a while and, you know, he was rushing, you 
know, there were other meetings prior to my appointment 
with him and I got a sense that he was rushing but we sat 
for about 20 minutes.  I did not understand what he meant, 
you know, he kind of – caught you up in a spaghetti.  I 
knew that there was a lot of turbulence at Eskom at the 
time, you know, operationally turbulence, operationally 
load 
shedding, 
but 
certainly 
turbulence 
in 
terms 
of 
20 
government, you know, the board was – the board at war 
with itself.  It is the board that I found there, you know, 
there was a lot of infighting within the board.   
So anyway, you know, he then said to me they would like 
me to come back to government, to come back to public 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 164 of 179 
 
service, they did not want to lose – the government did not 
want to lose me to public service, as it were.  I think he 
just wanted to establish where my headspace was and he 
said that he would give me a call again at a later stage, so 
I left the meeting, we never got an opportunity speak again 
over that conversation, as it were, that’s the events that 
I’ve captured here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so that’s – according to your 
affidavit that’s around June/July 2015? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say the President – and now 
I’m reading from your affidavit, page 22, paragraph 54, it 
says, 
 
“The President further said”, 
 
Are you there, are you there Mr Matona? 
 
MR MATONA:   Yes, I’m there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “The President further said he and  
Government 
still 
held 
me 
in 
high 
regard. 
He 
indicated that my exit from Eskom did not need to 
result in the loss of my expertise and services in 
20 
the State.  He encouraged me to consider returning 
to public service when an appropriate opportunity 
availed”, 
 
And then you say you left the meeting, paragraph 
55, the end of it, the last sentence says, 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 165 of 179 
 
“He concluded by saying that he would contact me 
again in the subsequent due course but that did not 
happen”. 
 
Paragraph 56, 
“I did not have discussions with the President as to 
his involvement in my suspension or the reasons 
behind the suspension.  Other than expressing my 
disappointment and disapproval in the manner in 
which I was treated pertaining to my suspension”, 
 
May I ask you, Mr Matona, did you suspect that the 
10 
President knew about your suspension or had anything to 
do with it? 
MR MATONA:   No it’s not something that I can say I 
suspected but it was something that was in the media 
space, I think, that the Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi, in one of 
the interviews he conducted at the time, did bring the name 
of the President into it and as you recall, Chairperson, 
even at the beginning of this inquiry, you know, the name 
of the President had been raised but as to the precise 
conspiracy, I could not have known and it’s something that 
20 
– I guess it’s still out there, I mean, I know other people 
have testified about it as it were.  I personally, I wouldn’t 
have known that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I’m asking that question because of 
what you said the president said to you, that your 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 166 of 179 
 
suspension 
at 
Eskom 
is 
not 
a 
reflection 
on 
your 
professional character or abilities, why would he say that? 
MR MATONA:   Why would he say that?  I don’t know, I 
really don’t know, I mean I thought that – one thought I had 
was that – the whole thing was very embarrassing, it was – 
I mean everybody who looked at this thing and I just 
imagined if I were the honorary citizen viewing this thing 
as it unfolded would have – it really put Government in a 
bad light, you know, a lot of Politicians, Ministers, so they 
were very embarrassed about this.  So, I took it that it was 
10 
an expression of, almost, you know, remorse at what had 
happened 
to 
an 
extent 
that 
him 
and 
I 
knew 
each 
other…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mostly on his part? 
MR MATONA:   Mostly on his part yes, that’s how I – 
here’s a President that calls you to say all of these things, 
you know, I didn’t ask, I didn’t know what he was going to 
say when I met him, only to find that, that’s what he said, 
so…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   An expression of remorse, however, 
20 
would suggest that a person did something which he now 
appreciates is incorrect and he shows remorse, are you – 
you understand that to be…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words, he would be saying – he 
would be feeling sorry that you were suspended or that he 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 167 of 179 
 
may have had a part in your suspension, is that what 
you’re talking about, was that your feeling of what he was 
expressing?  
MR MATONA:   No I could sense a sense of remorse about 
the events without any suggestion or any inkling that he 
could have had anything to do about it at that stage, I 
didn’t know that he had anything to do about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without any suggestion that he was 
saying suspension should not happen? 
MR MATONA:   Without – because what the Advocate is 
10 
saying is that, it may be that he had a hand in it and now 
that, that happened in the manner, he felt remorseful about 
it.  I’m saying, I can confirm the remorse, I don’t know 
whether that reflected – the basis of the remorse was, the 
fact that he had been involved because I never asked him 
and the issue never arose. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Mr Matona.  Page 23, the 
last paragraph there, page 23. 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well you do say, just before that,  
20 
“I did not discuss with the President whether he had 
any 
hand 
in 
my 
suspension 
or 
the 
reasons 
therefore.  57 says, I had in the meantime been 
looking 
for 
a 
job 
and 
around August 
2015 
I 
responded to an advertisement for the position of 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 168 of 179 
 
Head 
Secretariat 
in 
the 
National 
Planning 
Commission.  I was interviewed by a panel of 
Cabinet Ministers and subsequently recommended 
for appointment to Cabinet around September 2015 
in accordance with the applicable process”. 
 
Are you still in that position, Head of Secretariat? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, I’m still in that position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So your suspension is 11 March 2015, 
you separate with Eskom in May – 15 May 2015 and June, 
July, August, September, four months later you were 
10 
employed as the Head of Secretariat in the National 
Planning Commission, is that correct? 
MR MATONA:   That’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say, it’s an appointment to 
Cabinet. 
MR MATONA:   It’s an appointment that was approved by 
Cabinet. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
And 
this 
National 
Planning 
Commission, where is it located? 
MR MATONA:   It’s in the Presidency. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, it’s in the Presidency? 
MR MATONA:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so, who was the President at the 
time? 
MR MATONA:    It was President Zuma. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 169 of 179 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And do you work close with the 
President as the Head of the Secretariat? 
MR MATONA:   Yes, the Commission is an advisory body - 
advisory body to that – to the President. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, you got to meet with him again? 
MR 
MATONA: 
Well 
probably 
once 
before 
he 
exited 
Government. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you recall when, did he exit? 
MR MATONA:   2018. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   2018? 
10 
MR MATONA:  I stand to be correct, time goes so quickly.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that’s three years later.  
MR MATONA:   Ja, when the President exited, isn’t it 2018, 
2018 I think? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja I can recall on that, is that when he 
was recalled? 
MR MATONA:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson that concludes 
my questions to Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The rest of his evidence is contained in 
his affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got him to confirm the 
transcript of the – the contents of the transcript when he 
was interviewed, as true and correct, has that been done, 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 170 of 179 
 
then we must do it, if…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think we should do it now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what we can do is, whenever that – 
we have got such a transcript it can be done at the 
beginning when the witness starts so that we don’t forget 
about it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, thank you Chairperson.  Mr 
Matona, that item 16, it’s on page 669, I think I showed you 
a copy this morning. 
MR MATONA:   You showed me a copy and part of the 
10 
issues that needed to be corrected who was in reference to 
Dr Ben Ngubane…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Seleka, I see here, I think 
we should not confirm it now, I see it’s got Chairperson and 
registrar and so on, it could cause confusion that it was 
done here, so I think, firstly, it should be labelled, not as a 
hearing but rather as an interview. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As an interview of the witness by the 
relevant members of the legal team of the Commission and 
20 
I think that then, don’t have Chairperson in order to avoid 
confusion just have the name of whoever is speaking there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They have it right in the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We start at the bottom of the page, 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 171 of 179 
 
they started at ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so, I think also for registrar find 
either the name of the person or some other title just so 
that there’ll be no confusion between a transcript from this 
hearing and a transcript of the interview and then what you 
can do, after those corrections have been made and any 
other that Mr Matona wished to make after all of those had 
been 
made, 
you 
could 
actually 
have 
an 
affidavit 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s exactly…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja an affidavit by him refer it  - to which 
the transcript can be attached as Annexure which will say 
that the contents of the Annexure are true and correct to 
the best of his knowledge and – ja.  So, let’s not do it now 
but you can do it that way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson, that’s perfectly 
in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, counsel for Mr Matona, is there any 
intention to re-examine the – I thought there was or there 
wasn’t. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It’s an attorney Chairperson, I’ll let him 
address you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you intend to re-examine? 
MR MOPELI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, okay alright.  Mr Matona, thank you 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 172 of 179 
 
very much for coming to give evidence in the Commission 
we appreciate it, you are now excused. 
MR MATONA:   Thank you Chairperson. 
COUNSEL:   Chairperson, just a moment, may I address 
you shortly, just two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Matona may be excused ja.  
You’re excused, you must just wait until Mr Seleka has 
indicated if he’s done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
we had scheduled a second witness for today, Mr Nick 
10 
Linnell who was – who is in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He had requested his testimony to be 
via video link, however, he communicated with my junior 
this morning that he was indisposed, so he has a medical 
issue, although he had indicated to us that he is prepared 
to testify with that condition I had an opportunity to speak 
with him on the phone and establish whether he was fine to 
proceed on that basis, in the condition he’s in.  My 
assessment was that we couldn’t proceed with him in the 
20 
situation he finds himself. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes 
so 
that 
too, 
make 
another 
arrangement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will have to make another 
arrangement for him…[intervenes]. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 173 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, not that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Other than that, tomorrow we proceed 
as scheduled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, tomorrow we plan to have one 
witness? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There’s one witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We may have a second witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think don’t – if you can, don’t 
line up the second one. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and we could start maybe at – maybe 
we could start at half past nine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, nine thirty Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja nine thirty tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was counsel who wanted to 
address me, yes okay but if it’s brief and you are able to 
20 
address me from where you are, after putting on the – 
switching on the…[intervenes]. 
COUNSEL:   Yes I can.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
COUNSEL: 
 
I 
just 
ask 
to 
be 
seated, 
this 
chair 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 174 of 179 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s fine. 
COUNSEL:   If you stand in the chair it is probably 
uncomfortable for purposes of articulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that is fine. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, I’m for Ms Lynne Brown and my 
presence here today is purely by chance, my schedule, I 
was here to listen to listen to Zola Tsotsi, as per the Rule 
33 invitation.  Now, being here, I listened to the evidence 
of Mr Matona and my client is mentioned, we’ve not been 
10 
given that Rule 33 Notice and my client, I don’t think, is 
even listening.  Now, I don’t have the script to follow the 
evidence with insight, it just put us in a bit of a difficult 
position on that score, I don’t know how it came about but 
we are where we are, at the back foot as far as evidence of 
Mr Matona relates to my client in particular – in light of the 
disclosures that came through today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, 
yes indeed some reference to Mrs Lynne Brown has come 
20 
up during the evidence of the witness but that arose from 
the explanations and testimony given by the witness in the 
process of his testimony.  I did indicate to my learned 
friend that I will notify him belatedly about a witness but 
will give him time to prepare what he needs to do for his 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 175 of 179 
 
client. So although a notification is belated the time for 
them to canvas whatever gets to be said, will still apply. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well basically, to the extent that you 
might wish to make some or other application under the 
rules, the time periods would have to be computed from the 
time you received them, you receive the notices.  If you 
have not received a 33 Notices, the time, I think is 14 days 
would have to be calculated from the time you received 
them but I think – but I think what you are saying is, any 
reference to Ms Brown – Ms Lynne Brown, wasn’t in the 
10 
statement of the witness, it came from elaboration during 
the evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It wasn’t expressly in his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not expressly ja, you understand 
that? 
COUNSEL:   I do Chair, in fairness to my learned friend he 
did indicate he will give me notice but I honestly did not 
believe it related to Mr Matona’s evidence for today but I 
must just point out that there were these two documents 
that could not have come out today, there were two 
20 
statements, one when Mr Matona was appointed in August 
and there was also reference to the one on 17 April, those 
did not arrive from the witness Chair, the spontaneity of 
the mentioning of Ms Brown, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja can I leave it to both of you to sort 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 176 of 179 
 
out how to address whatever there may be outside of the 
forum. 
COUNSEL:   I’m happy to do that, I’m sure we will come to 
a – we’ll work out an agreement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
COUNSEL:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, I think there was somebody 
else 
who 
seemed 
or 
indicated 
they 
wished 
to 
say 
something. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For Mr Tsotsi. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, they must sanitise first. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Gcebetsha? 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   ... placed on record that we – though 
my client only received the statement of Mr Matona this 
morning 
and 
so 
with 
the 
time 
that the 
Commission 
commenced 
with 
his 
testimony 
we 
had 
not 
had 
an 
opportunity to peruse it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the way, who do you represent? 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Mr Tsotsi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi, okay. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Who, I understand could possibly be 
your next witness tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Hopefully, after Mr Linnell whatever 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262 
 
Page 177 of 179 
 
position is adopted as far as his testimony concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Whatever the case may be, we have 
come to conclude that Mr Tsotsi could be considered in 
terms of your Rules as an implicated person…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, just raise your voice. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   We have come to conclude that Mr 
Tsotsi, in terms of your rules, could be interpreted to be an 
implicated person thus we are seeking to apply to cross-
examine him and I think it would be fair, if at all possible 
10 
that, that cross-examination occurs before Mr Tsotsi is led 
in his evidence in chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure I understand 
properly.  As I understand it, you may apply for leave to 
cross-examine but you are not sure whether you will, is 
that correct? 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   No, no we are certain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will apply for leave to cross-examine 
who? 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Mr Matona. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Matona, oh okay, alright and you 
made another point. 
ADV 
GCEBETSHA: 
 
 
I 
was 
simply 
sketching 
the 
background Chairperson, that we were not privy to the 
document, which is the affidavit.

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Otherwise we would have made the 
application, formally, ahead of my submission now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Now, noticing that Mr Matona is being 
recused and my client is likely to take the stand as soon as 
possible, we thought we must bring to the attention of the 
Chairperson.  In the break – lunch break, I had mentioned 
or earlier on to Mr Seleka that once we have made that 
conclusion, we would alert him, which we did, so we beg 
10 
your leave.  If there is a procedure to follow, we’ll follow it 
but the timing might necessitate that we bring it at this 
point and leave if it pleases you then proper arrangements 
can be made that maybe tomorrow, we start with that 
cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The application for leave to cross-
examine Mr Matona, that will be lodged in due course, is 
that right? 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   I need your guidance Chairperson 
there’s an issue of timing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well you can – I think in terms of 
the rules you may apply within – you should apply within 
14 days from the date you receive a Rule 33 Notice, you 
may apply within 14 days. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Agreed. 
07 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 262

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Which, in far as Mr Matona’s evidence 
we did not receive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but arrangements, if the application 
is granted, arrangements can be made for Mr Matona to 
come back. 
ADV GCEBETSHA:   Wonderful, thank you very much, we 
just thought we must place this on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, no that’s fine.  I think there’s 
nobody else who wanted to say something we are going to 
10 
adjourn for the day and tomorrow we’ll hear the evidence 
of Mr Tsotsi at half past nine, we start at half past nine, we 
adjourn.
