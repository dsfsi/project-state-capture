PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 07 DECEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson this week the 
commission from the Eskom work stream will be leading 
evidence on what we have referred to as the transections 
10 
and it is mainly the Tegeta issues emanating from some of 
the evidence that was led in phase 1 in regard to the pre-
payments decisions made by the board. 
 
Just by way of introduction in regard to that 
Chairperson back in 2015 and 2016 Eskom did some 
decisions – took some decisions in regard to a company 
called Optimum Coal Mine.   
 
This mine Chairperson was at that time in some 
challenging position in regard to mining and the provision 
of coal to Transnet – to Eskom I beg your pardon and it 
20 
was seeking to negotiate better deals with Eskom. 
 
There was some cooperation agreement concluded 
in 2014 which was to serve before the board. That 
cooperation agreement with an addendum to the coal 
agreement that existed at the time in order to amend the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 4 of 249 
 
terms of the agreement in regard to pricing served before 
the BTC in April. 
 
The BTC did not make a decision Chairperson it 
referred the matter to the board.  The timing is important 
because this matter was referred to the board on the 23 
April 2015. 
 
The board did not make a decision on the issue 
rather it decided to refer it to the newly seconded Mr Brian 
Molefe the announcement of whom was made on the 17 
April 2015 by Minister Lynne Brown to second him. 
10 
 
The gains that had been made in the negotiation 
process with Optimum saw the beginning of the end of that 
process Chairperson as Mr Molefe then terminated the 
cooperation 
agreement, 
terminated 
negotiations 
agreements, insisted on Optimum continuing to provide 
coal to Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja as I recall one or other previous 
witness who testified on the matter – on the transaction I 
think may – it may have been I think probably it was Mr – 
Is it Ephron from… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ephron. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ephron. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that they had – they had reached an 
understanding with various officials or structures within 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 5 of 249 
 
Eskom who supported the proposal they had made for an 
adjustment I think on the price of coal.  And there was a 
memorandum that was placed before the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which had the support of management. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when that matter came before the 
board Mr Brian Molefe had joined Eskom about three days 
10 
before 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And his arrival saw a complete change of 
attitude on the part of Eskom towards the deal that had 
been proposed and been supported by various levels of 
management. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he adopted quite a hard line towards 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Towards Optimum. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe it was justified to do so 
maybe it was not but I do recall that part of the evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there seemed to have been – he 
seems to have taken a very hard line. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 6 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Towards them.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  Yes indeed Chairperson.  
So there the board on the 23 April 2015 does not decide 
the matter.  It refers to Mr Molefe who had just arrived and 
in fact in the same meeting you see the board making its 
first decision in regard to the secondment of Mr Molefe. 
 
The approved the secondment which was effective 
to start effectively on the 20 April 2015.  And the handling 
of 
the 
matter 
then 
leads 
to 
the 
termination, 
the 
10 
enforcement of the 10.1 billion penalties which I might add 
while 
referring 
to 
them 
Chair 
once 
Tegeta 
obtained 
Optimum – acquired Optimum the – the penalties of 2.1 
billion they get settled with Tegeta at R599 million but 
there are still deductions to be made to that amount.  
 
The payable amount ultimately is only R255 million 
to be paid over 20 months Tegeta still defaults on that 
amount.  It pays hardly half of that and immediately 
thereafter it goes into business rescue. 
 
So Eskom although it used the – a huge amount 
20 
against Optimum it reduced it significantly when Tegeta 
was the owner of the mine. 
 
And then by the decisions regarding pre-payments 
which are made in favour of Tegeta and the narrative is 
that there are pre-payments made on an urgent basis. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 7 of 249 
 
 
The first one by Round Robin, the other one by 
telephone conference were made on an urgent basis for a 
different purpose – an ulterior motive. That motive being to 
assist Tegeta in the acquisition of Optimum. 
 
There will be two submissions in respect of both 
decisions made and we will deal with the motivation 
contained in those submissions and the witnesses will be 
asked questions relative to the validity or otherwise of 
those motivations Chairperson. 
 
We have that – that is the evidence and the 
10 
elements of it will unfold Chairperson during the evidence 
of the various witnesses this week.  I think that sums up 
what we have to do this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may wish as you proceed with the 
evidence of various witnesses you may wish to try and 
identify areas that are really not in dispute that have been 
testified to by other people and focus on those where they 
are – there may be disputes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If possible. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes I am – ja – with that in mind 
Chair the persons that will be called mainly today are 
those that – I mean this week are those that for lack of a 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 8 of 249 
 
better word implicated in the masterminding of these 
transactions.  Thank you Chair. 
 
So the first witness this week Chairperson is Ms 
Suzanne Daniels.  She was the Company Secretary in 20 – 
from October 2015 at Eskom and she is ready to take the 
oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do remember to raise your voice you 
have a soft voice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do remember to raise your voice. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the first witness is Ms Suzanne 
Daniels who was the Company Secretary from October 
2015 at Eskom and she is ready to take the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Suzanne Margaret Daniels. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
20 
prescribed oath? 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 9 of 249 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
say, so help me God. 
MS DANIELS:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Welcome back Ms Daniels.  Thank you 
for coming back.  Alright.  You may proceed Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank – thank you Chair.  Thank you

10 
– 18 Exhibit U34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Daniels affidavit is found on page 
236. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Daniels looks like she wants to 
say something. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes please Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  May I please make a few remarks it will not 
take long before we start? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay five minutes, ten minutes? 
MS DANIELS:  It should not be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few min – okay alright. 
MS DANIELS:  It should not be that long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay go ahead. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 10 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:  Thank you Chairperson. Thank you for the 
opportunity to make a few remarks before I deal with the 
questions. 
 
I appreciated right from the start that going public 
with my disclosures on state capture at Eskom would bring 
both positive and negative feedback.  Since making my 
disclosures I have been maligned and attacked as a 
disgruntled opportunist seeking some form of redemption. 
 
What is particularly galling is that the parties who 
have set out to crucify me and paint me as the villain are 
10 
part of the crew who in fact are beneficiaries of the 
proceeds of state capture. 
 
What I did not realise is how close being a whistle 
blower is to being a scapegoat.  It would appear from my 
treatment that unless you are a whistle blower who has 
made exactly zero mistakes you are likely to become an 
object of scorn. 
 
Very few whistle blowers are pristine.  Very few of 
us carry a halo and yet we try to do the right thing and 
expose wrongdoings even when some of the exposure may 
20 
have affect our own reputations. 
 
When I made my disclosures I admitted to the 
errors I have made and explained their contents.  My 
admissions are a mark against my name that has served 
those with far greater culpability in the wrongdoing at 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 11 of 249 
 
Eskom very well. 
 
There are people with greater power than me.  
People who unlike me benefitted from their actions.  These 
are people who now use Suzanne Daniels as a scapegoat 
for their wrongdoing. 
 
I have nothing.  I have lost everything.  I may not 
be able to work in my profession again.  Financial and 
professional ruin is often the lot of whistle blowers.  Not to 
speak of death threats and constant fear.  My daughter is 
now abroad because of the threats we received. 
10 
 
When 
the 
drivers 
testified 
here 
before 
the 
commission Mr Chairperson my blood ran cold when they 
repeated the messages they received. 
 
I received those same messages verbatim only 
difference was mine was anonymous.  The other threats I 
mentioned the last time I testified.  I watched Mr Koko’s 
testimony here before the commission last week and I was 
stunned at how matters unfolded.  He made a number of 
spurious allegations that went unchallenged as they did not 
make their way into his affidavit. 
20 
 
Chairperson Mr Koko has sought in this commission 
to insinuate and it was I rather than him who was the link 
between Mr Essa’s designs and various nefarious decisions 
at Eskom. 
 
However smoothly he talked anyone who knows or 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 12 of 249 
 
has dealt with Mr Koko knows this to be untrue.  Listening 
to him seeking to advance his version with selective 
anecdotes and unrelated events I could only think of the 
remark of a prominent former investigative journalist.  I will 
put his remark a little bit more delicately.  
 
He said Mr Koko was Mr Essa’s indentured servant.  
Or maybe pet comes closer to the original remark because 
they communicated all the time like a boss micromanaging 
an underling. 
 
And those of us lower down the chain of command 
10 
were all prevailed upon or manipulated or misled in various 
ways to ensure that Mr Koko’s true principles were 
satisfied. 
 
I have alerted the commission and other institutions 
to the extent of Mr Koko and Mr Essa’s communications 
which proves the depth of their relationship.  I do not have 
this proof myself in the form of call logs or memory caches 
or data usage.  I do not have the power to obtain those 
kinds of records. 
 
But the commission presumably has the power to 
20 
obtain these records and thus to readily corroborate what I 
say about Mr Koko being the true conduit for Mr Essa and 
Gupta instructions into Eskom. 
 
In addition evidence of emails, overseas trips and 
meetings 
at 
the 
Saxonwold 
compound 
have 
emerged 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 13 of 249 
 
through various sources and I wish to make particular 
reference to Mr Koko’s testimony before the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee. 
 
In that testimony Mr Koko confirmed  
1. That he knew Mr Essa. 
2. That he had visited Mr Essa at his offices at Melrose 
Arch. 
3. That he had actually had a meeting with Mr Essa to 
discuss the Trillian payments. 
So other Eskom rollers have – sorry – other Eskom role 
10 
players have testified here like Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein 
and I am sure more will appear in the coming days all were 
in the positions of power far greater than to that which I 
ever held. 
 
The all had far more to gain than me whether 
financially or by way of power from the bad decisions made 
at Eskom.  By virtue of my role these decisions flowed 
through – flowed past or through me and for this reason I 
am a handy scapegoat for some of them. 
 
What also unites these people is the treatment at 
20 
this commission.  While their testimony with all due respect 
Chairperson attracted mainly geniality and chuckles and 
questions that provided a platform for their version to 
credibly emerge my own prior experience here is different. 
 
My testimony plainly provoked incredulity in you 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 14 of 249 
 
very pointed cross-examination and even statements that 
indicated 
free 
judgments. 
 
These 
are 
obviously 
my 
subjective views Chairperson and I do not want to play the 
victim. 
 
I welcome the interrogation and I accept that you 
may descend into the arena however when my accusers or 
higher social and political rank than me do not also get the 
same hard ball questions this leaves a bitter taste in my 
mouth. 
 
Their stories plainly provided the same openings for 
10 
interrogation and an impeachment and yet none who faced 
insistent requests that they concede that their versions 
conflicted with their duties or common sense.  You have an 
extremely difficult job Chairperson and I ascribe no ill-tent 
or personal biased to you at all but we cannot have a 
situation where witnesses on different scales of the same 
dispute of facts receives such a disparate treatment from 
the bench which is my impression of my situation.  
 
To conclude my own evidence about Mr Koko’s role 
and the suspected role of other people in facilitating Mr 
20 
Essa and the Gupta interests of Eskom here at Eskom can 
be corroborated by me. 
 
But I hope that just as much as the commission has 
quite inter-harshly interrogated my version of events it will 
also energetically use its powers to corroborate my version 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 15 of 249 
 
also. 
 
Thank you for listening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Daniels we both the evidence 
leaders and myself want to be fair to everybody but we 
accept that people will have their views about whether we 
are fair or we are not fair and as for me while I care that 
people see that we are fair I am not going to try and make 
sure that it is their kind of fairness that I use.  It is 
fairness as I understand it that I will use – that I have 
always understood that I will use. 
10 
 
You and other people might think differently both in 
regard to the evidence leaders and in regard to me but we 
will always – I certainly will always follow fairness as I 
understand it which might differ from your fairness as you 
expect it – to understand it and somebody else that will 
stick to the fairness as we understand it. 
 
When it comes to the questioning of witnesses there 
are various factors that – that count.  Today you might be 
questioned in a certain than which is different from the way 
you might be questioned three months later.  When certain 
20 
investigations 
have 
been 
completed 
that 
were 
not 
completed when you appeared for the first time there are 
various factors that – that come in.   
 
 
So – but as I say the public and individuals who are 
implicated or not implicated are free to have their own 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 16 of 249 
 
understanding of whether we are being fair to witnesses 
and to implicated persons.  But as I say I am not going to 
change anything just because somebody might think this is 
fair or not fair.  I have a certain understanding of fairness 
that I am following and that is the fairness that I am going 
to use. 
 
As 
I 
say 
if 
you 
appear 
today 
you 
might 
be 
questioned 
in 
a 
certain 
way 
because 
of 
certain 
circumstances. 
 
Maybe 
the 
investigation 
into 
certain 
matters in which you are alleged to have been involved 
10 
have not – has not been completed.   
 
When you appear later on and that investigation has 
been completed you might be questioned in a different way.  
Or certain information might not have been confirmed at a 
certain time and at a certain time it is confirmed then you 
are confronted with it. 
 
 
But we – we are not going to try and follow 
anybody’s program.  We will follow only the commission’s 
program of how we do things. 
 
But throughout we remain committed to do the best 
20 
we can to be fair to everybody as we understand fairness.  
Okay.  Alright. 
MS DANIELS:  Thank you Mr Chairman as I said thank you 
for allowing me to speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Seleka I do not know if you want 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 17 of 249 
 
to say anything arising out of Ms Daniels’ remarks? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Chair I might add that to – what the 
Chairperson is saying Ms Suzanne Daniels – Ms Daniels it 
also depends on the level of a person’s involvement in 
what we find in the investigation.  As the Chairperson says 
the manner of pursuing questions against an individual 
witness tends on what the evidence is and what it points in 
regard to the individual witness. 
 
So I concur with the Chairperson on that point. 
MS DANIELS:  It is not intended to be a debate Mr 
10 
Chairman I – sorry I – it was not intended to be a debate or 
anything I was just expressing my subjective view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For some reason I struggle to hear you; I 
do not know why in terms of what you are saying.  Just try 
again. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay.  I was not intending it to be a debate 
Mr Chairperson it was just my subjective view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, no, nobody wants… 
MS DANIELS:  I do not concede… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody wants it to be a debate. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said something and I said something 
so that you know what my position is and the evidence 
leader said what he had to say and we move on. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay thank you. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 18 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Daniels the 
bundle in front of you contains an affidavit on page 236 – 
now you follow the page numbering on the top left hand 
corner – page 236.  Between tramlines is affidavit on 
transactions. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I am there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that.  This affidavit runs up to 
page 267. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I am there. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  There is a signature there by the 
deponent do you confirm that to be your signature? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I confirm that is my signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On 30 November 2020. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is the correct date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you confirm the affidavit to be your 
affidavit then? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson it is part 
of the Reference Bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you refer to a Reference Bundle 
but the bundle I have with me is Eskom Bundle 18.  I do 
not know what Reference Bundle is supposed to mean. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes Eskom Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reference Bundle is normally used for 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 19 of 249 
 
documents other than affidavits. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well as legislation and things like that.  
So I am not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair.  Let us go with Eskom 
Bundle 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is Exhibit U34 and we could mark the 
affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret Daniels as Exhibit 34.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  34 without the U or U34.1? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U34.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  The affidavit of Ms Suzanne 
Margaret Daniels starting at page 236 is admitted as 
Exhibit U34.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You nevertheless might wish to consider 
whether that writing there that says Reference Bundle is 
correct or whether it will just cause confusion? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Because 
a 
Reference 
Bundle 
will 
20 
normally not … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will not include affidavits and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 20 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Daniels a great deal of the evidence 
on the Tegeta matter was led in phase 1 of the commission 
and I would like you to tell the Chairperson and as we go 
along 
we 
will 
indicate 
what 
has 
come 
before 
this 
commission so that it does not have to be traversed. 
 
But we would like you to indicate to the Chairperson 
in regard to the Tegeta matter in 2015 when do you first 
become involved or faced with this matter? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman I first become involved in the 
developments that would culminate in the decision by the 
board say at the 1.68 million to Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  And that was in and around November 
2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think I cannot hear you also. 
MS DANIELS:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You need to adjust your microphone. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a problem. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it hot – can we switch off the air 
conditioner?  Will it be hot for people? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja the… 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 21 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or shall we switch it off for the – for a 
certain time and if there are complaints then we can switch 
it on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not see the Reverend here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think somebody will – or put it down a 
bit not – because it also makes some noise.  Okay alright.   
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I became involved in the 
developments that we had that culminated in a decision by 
the board to prepay R 1.68 billion to Tegeta in and around 
November 2015. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What was your position in the 
company at the time?  Where you company secretary? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman.  At the time, I held the 
position 
of 
Company 
Secretary 
to 
which 
I 
had 
been 
appointed on the 1s t of October 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In November 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In November 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   October 2015.  I had to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You became Company Secretary in 
20 
October? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your involvement in the matter was in 
November.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 22 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe Mr Seleka because we have 
got to also assist the public to follow what is happening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be necessary to just through 
Ms Daniels inform the public what this whole transaction was 
about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, before we proceed. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Ms Daniels from the evidence 
that was led.  The Commission understand that the Eskom 
Board were – was considering the – it took part in discussion 
that had to do with the acquisition by Tegeta or Oakbay of 
Optimum.   
 
Optimum was, at the time, providing coal to Eskom in 
terms of a Coal Supply Agreement that dated back to 1983.  
The mine had exchange hands over time and at this time and 
point, the mine was owned by Glencore. 
 
Glencore owned Optimum Holdings.  Optimum Coal 
20 
Holdings which was a holding company of Optimum Coal 
Mine.  
 
Now 
during 
this 
time, 
these 
discussions 
between 
Optimum and Eskom to renegotiate the agreement, as I did 
in my opening address, did say.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 23 of 249 
 
 
Oakbay and Tegeta at some point, tendered to buy 
Optimum.  They tendered to purchase Optimum for the price 
of R 2.1 billion.  It would appear from the evidence that 
Optimum – or rather, Tegeta and Oakbay did not have the 
funds to procure their position. 
 
As a result of which, we see steps taken within Eskom.  
They seem to be independent of what is happening in regard 
to this transaction.  There are urgent steps taken in 
December 2015 to approve a prepayment of R 1.68 billion for 
Tegeta.  And the reasons are given to be an emergency 
10 
supply of coal.   
 
That prepayment is agreed to by the board but the very 
next day, it was changed into a guarantee.  But the decision 
for a guarantee, does not go back to the board.  It is done by 
the CFO, on the face of it, in the terms of this evidence. 
 
And 
it 
would 
appear 
that 
the 
guarantee 
of 
that 
R 1.68 billion issued by Eskom in favour of Tegeta was a tool 
used by Tegeta to show the business rescue practitioner of 
OCM Optimum Coal Mine that it has the necessary funding to 
pay for the purchase of the mine. 
20 
 
That is the one transaction.  Some four months later, we 
are now in 2016, April 2016 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are going to ask her to confirm, you 
might need to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   To ask... 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 24 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   To ask her because by the time you are 
finished, she may have forgotten. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You might get her to confirm how 
much of what you have said is in accordance with her 
understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Oh, Chair now I get – I get the 
Chairperson’s idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you, Ms Daniels, recall those facts. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairperson that is in accordance 
with how I understood happenings to have unfolded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now could you tell the Chairperson 
then what role did you play in the build-up to the decision 
made by the board on the 9t h of December 2015 regarding 
the prepayment of R 1.68 billion? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairperson, I think the first point of 
entry for me was a meeting of the 24 t h of November 2015.  
Mr Koko asked me to attend a meeting.  It was between the 
Optimum – he said it was between Eskom and the Optimum 
20 
Business Rescue Practitioners and his specific request was 
to ask me to take minutes because it was going to be a 
particularly important meeting.  Can you hear me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  So this meeting took place on about...  
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 25 of 249 
 
In fact, it takes place on the 24t h of November.  The record 
shows, 24 November 2015.  At this meeting, I played no role.   
 
There were – I, other than to take minutes, and I 
compared my notes with Ms Nteta, who was the Coal Supply 
Manager.  She was also present.   
 
For me, at this meeting, it was my first encounter with 
the 
Oakbay 
representatives, 
Mr 
Nazeem 
Howa 
and 
Ms Ronica Ragavan were present together with Mr Twala.  
They represented Oakbay.   
 
Mr Marsden was there from the Optimum Business 
10 
Rescue Practitioners and there was also a representative 
from Glencore but I could not recall his name but it is in the 
minutes that he was there, and Mr Shaun Blankfield.   
 
For me the meeting was significant in – it was at this 
meeting that Mr Koko raised expectation on the part of 
Eskom that for the sale of Optimum Mine as a – that the sale 
of Optimum as a single entity would not be acceptable to 
Eskom. 
 
In the structure that Mr Seleka explained, there was a 
holding company and Optimum Mine was actually run as a 
20 
subsidiary of Optimum Coal Holdings.   
 
So there were other resources in the Optimum stable 
and Mr Koko mentioned these.  He emphasised that, you 
know, that it would be more acceptable to Eskom that 
Optimum Coal Holdings become the object of the sale. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 26 of 249 
 
 
Amongst them, was Koornfontein Mine which was also 
another source of supply to Eskom.  They produced high-
quality coal at this stage.   
 
At the point of this meeting Mr Chairman, to the best of 
my knowledge, you know, the matter had not actually served 
before the board in the manner brought here with the 
acquisition of Optimum Coal Holdings.  
 
So this was a new event.  In fact, it was also new to the 
Oakbay representatives because they pointed out that they 
did not have a mandate to discuss that and that they would 
10 
have to go back to their and they would discuss it with the 
Business Rescue Practitioners later that day, which I 
understand... 
 
In the minute it said at 17:30 – I am not sure if that 
meeting happened in – at that time but they needed a 
mandate to discuss it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Ms Daniels, is it correct that prior to 
that point or up until that point, the sale that had been 
negotiated was in regard to the acquisition of Optimum Coal 
Mine (Pty) Ltd? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   That was my understanding from the meeting 
Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what you are saying is, Mr Koko was 
then expanding the scope of the acquisition to include OCM 
Coal Holdings, the assets belonging to OCM Optimum Coal 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 27 of 249 
 
Holdings? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what was the response from 
Mr Howa? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it Mr Howa who responded? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Howa responded that they did not have a 
mandate to discuss the purchase of Optimum Coal Holdings 
and that they needed to reconvene with the Business Rescue 
Practitioner.   
10 
 
In my notes it said that he would have to get a mandate 
from his board to discuss it with the Business Rescue 
Practitioner. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So just take us then to what 
happened next, after this? 
MS DANIELS:   The next time I get involved is on about the 
4t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is about the 4 t h...? 
MS DANIELS:   Of December 2015.  My apologies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   24t h of December 2015? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And what happens there? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Koko then requested me – he was Group 
Executive Generation – he requested me to assist him with 
the drafting of the correspondence to the Director General of 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 28 of 249 
 
Mineral Resources and the document should have been titled 
Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd, our supply to Hendrina Power 
Station.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you had worked this time? 
MS DANIELS:   I cannot recall.  I was at the office at that 
time.  I think the 4t h of December might have been the Friday 
afternoon. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Mr Koko is requesting you to do 
what? 
MS DANIELS:   To draft correspondence for him. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Did you do that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And it is correspondence to what 
effect? 
MS DANIELS:   It was really – set out in broad terms what 
he wanted to say to the Director General.  He wanted to 
make the Director General aware of the challenges Eskom 
was facing in respect of the coal supply to Eskom.   
 
And the other supply risk that Eskom was facing and he 
was not clear on the type of assistance that he wanted the 
20 
DMR to lend to Eskom. 
 
And what I can say is, what initially started out as a 
reference 
to 
Hendrina 
ultimately 
included 
the 
supply 
challenges faced at Amot and Komati Power Station as well.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Please turn to page 270 in your 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 29 of 249 
 
bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two, seven, zero Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   270.  Ms Daniels, can you identify the 
document? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what is it? 
MS DANIELS:   This is the letter addressed to Dr Thibedi 
Ramontja, the Director General of the Department of Mineral 
10 
Resources 
and 
it 
was 
signed 
by 
Mr 
Koko 
on 
the 
6t h of December 2015 and this was the final version of the 
letter that I had prepared. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you what? 
MS DANIELS:   That I had prepared.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you had prepared for Mr Koko. 
MS DANIELS:   For Mr Koko, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So Dr Ramontja has testified 
before the Commission.  So the letter is common course.  
Did you understand what Mr Koko sought to achieve by this 
20 
letter? 
MS DANIELS:   It was not clear at the time Mr Chairman 
what he sought to achieve.  It was – ja, he just – end of the 
letter was:  I request your assistance in this regard.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did he – did you ask him what 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 30 of 249 
 
assistance he sought you to obtain from the DMR? 
MS DANIELS:   At the time, he did not really answer the 
question.  I did ask him but he did not answer the question.  
CHAIRPERSON:    
ADV SELEKA SC:    
He just wanted the put the information before the DMR. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, should I read certain salient 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...points of the letter into the record? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So the letter reads – 
it is addressed to Dr Thibedi Ramontja:   
“Dear Dr Ramontja.” 
 
And it is Optimum Coal Mine, is the subject line, Coal 
Supply to Hendrina Power Station. 
“As you may be aware, Eskom has been involved in 
a legal wrangle with the above supplier from August 
this year.  
In rather dramatic fashion, the company was placed 
20 
under business rescue and Eskom was faced with 
intermittent veiled threats of liquidation while at the 
same 
time, 
the 
Business 
Rescue 
Practitioners 
reportedly 
sought 
to 
constructive 
engagement 
between the parties.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 31 of 249 
 
From Eskom’s perspective, it was expected that at 
Lemko Operation, Optimum Coal Mine would enjoy 
far more support on the condition of funding for 
limited time periods that was on offer.   
Optimum supplies, one of Eskom’s key contributors 
to the National Power System, as Hendrina Power 
Station is a stalwart in the Eskom fleet, supplying 
approximately 200 00 Mega Watts to the National 
Grid. 
Lemko was fully aware of the dynamics and history 
10 
relating to the nature of the Coal Supply Agreement 
and its structure when it concluded the sale with its 
previous owner.   
At the latest meetings of the parties, the Business 
Rescue Practitioners together with the Glencore 
representative, indicated that Optimum is being 
rescued and that it would honour the contract in its 
current form with no amendments. 
They further advised that they will follow the 
contract 
loot 
to 
process 
the 
Eskom 
claim 
of 
20 
R 2.2 billion. 
They made it clear that they are not insisting on the 
extension of the Koornfontein Coal Supply Contract 
with Eskom.  They insisted that the extension of 
Koornfontein 
Coal 
Supply 
Contract 
is 
at 
the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 32 of 249 
 
discretion of Eskom. 
Eskom is perplexed by the turnabout, given the 
events of the past few months and that the blatant 
disregard that Optimum displays for the impact that 
the threats of liquidation has on the precarious 
balance 
of 
electricity 
security 
and 
commercial 
viability.   
As at Lemko Operation, Optimum surely cannot be 
perceived to be acting in the national interest.” 
 
Let me read the next – the second paragraph on the next 
10 
page.  It says: 
“While Eskom has issued requests for proposals to 
the open market, the tender submissions indicate 
that we will not have sufficient volumes to meet the 
requirements for Amot.   
Based on previous test, Eskom can confirm that the 
coal qualities at Optimum are suitable for Amot’s 
burn requirements and will pass the necessary 
combustion tests. 
Based on Optimum’s current mine plans, there 
20 
should be sufficient coal volume to serve both power 
stations. 
 
Therefore, 
Optimum 
becomes 
highly 
sought after source for Amot as well.” 
 
In the second last paragraph, he says: 
“The risk of security supply for Hendrina Power 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 33 of 249 
 
Station, Komati Power Station and Amot Power 
Station is of such key national interest that we 
thought it appropriate to bring it to your attention, 
this upcoming adversity facing Eskom will require 
some form of intervention on the part of the 
Department of Mineral Resources to assist Eskom in 
leveraging the necessary key-authorities to assist 
me, assuring resolution to the course of supply 
situation and certainty going forward. 
I would request your assistance in this regard.   
10 
Should you require any more information, please do 
not hesitate to contact me.” 
 
So Ms Daniels, you say you then assisted him in drafting 
this letter? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We know from the evidence presented in 
Phase 1 that there was a response to this letter from 
Dr Thibedi Ramontja. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you aware of that response? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just briefly.  Your recollection of what 
the DMR’s response was. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you looking for that response? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 34 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, please. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us see what – on page two, six...  
Page 276.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 276. 
MS DANIELS:   My apologies.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just briefly what the response was.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes, he spoke about the transfer of the 
mineral(?) on an urgent basis.  It also spoke about a 
financial provision due to the historical liabilities and its 
10 
holding levels for Optimum Coal Holdings, and it then spoke 
about driving transformation.  I think I just need to real the 
whole sentence.   
“In return for the new owners honouring the current 
contract up to 2018 and for driving transformation, 
we would like to propose that consideration be made 
for some prepayment to be made for up to one year 
of coal supply, understanding the upfront capital 
injections to be made, ...[indistinct] to meet coal 
prior requirements from these mines.” 
20 
[Speaker not clear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  In a nutshell, what has become 
apparent is that this letter has been used as a basis for the 
board decision in regard to the prepayment. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 35 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  We can see from your affidavit that 
you took part in the drafting of a submission that was given 
to the board in regard to that prepayment request for a 
prepayment decision. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that I confirm in my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson how did 
your involvement come about? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, roundabout the – I think it was the 
7t h of December 2015, I received a call from Dr Ngubane, 
who was the chairman of the board at the time, with an 
10 
instruction 
to 
convene 
a 
meeting 
and 
this 
was 
the 
executives, 
Mr 
Koko 
and 
Mr 
Singh 
in 
preparing 
the 
necessary documentation for circulation of the board.   
 
At that stage, he was not specific as to what the 
contents of the submission was going to be about but he told 
me to speak to the executives.  The correspondence between 
the DMR would eventually become part of that board 
submission pack. 
 
After the call with Dr Ngubane, Mr Koko did request me 
to 
prepare 
the 
necessary 
paperwork 
for 
the 
board’s 
20 
submission and consideration, and it was headed...  I am 
just trying to... 
 
I am just trying to find the copy on the...  It was the – 
the title of the submission was: Pre-purchase of Coal from 
Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 36 of 249 
 
 
So in this, I started interacting with Mr Koko and 
Mr Singh to get the necessary information.  And there were a 
couple of drafts of the submission.  And so, as the Head of 
Generation, Mr Koko needed to provide the coal supply 
implications 
while 
Mr 
Singh 
provided 
the 
financial 
arguments, et cetera. 
 
So that is the information I then used.  And while we 
were drafting, the changes were communicated, either I sent 
it by email or telephonically to Mr Koko and Mr Singh 
respectively.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, in regard to the email, we have 
asked whether you could provide us with those emails. 
MS DANIELS:   I did not ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could you obtain the emails? 
MS DANIELS:   I did not have all the emails Mr Chairman.  
What I did have, I think, we compared what the Commission 
has and what I have.  So it shows the various drafts.  Where 
there are not replies, that is when I say, you know, there 
were telephone exchanges.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I just missed what you said about 
20 
Dr Ngubane.  I could not hear you properly there.  He gave 
you a call...? 
MS DANIELS:   He gave me a call roundabout the 
7t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 37 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   And he asked me to convene a meeting of 
the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Because this is what I want to tell 
you.  In his affidavit, Dr Ngubane says in regard to this 
meeting you are about to go in to: 
“The Company Secretary, Ms Daniels requested an 
urgent meeting on the basis of the letter Mr 
Matshela Koko had written to the DG of the 
Department of Mineral Resources.” 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Chairman I would not call the 
10 
meeting.  The meeting would be...  I mean, as the Company 
Secretary, the meeting would be the prerogative of the 
board, the chairperson. 
 
So I would – Dr Ngubane definitely called me to say 
that:  Please, assist the executives and convene this 
meeting.  They will provide the information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So convening this meeting, was not your 
initiative. 
MS DANIELS:   No, it was not my initiative. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So a submission is prepared.  
20 
You prepare the submission.  Assist with information, you 
say you obtained from Mr Koko and Mr Anoj Singh.  And 
where does it get to be submitted? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 38 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just go back to the two versions.  Your 
version and Dr Ngubane’s version about who said there 
should be a meeting of the board should be called.  You say 
that he instructed you to convene a meeting of the board.  
And according to Mr Seleka, he says ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Requested an urgent meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...requested an urgent meeting of the 
board.  And you say you did not request a meeting of the 
board.  And as I understand you, you say you did not request 
because it would not be up to you whether there should be a 
10 
meeting of the board.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be that you suggested as 
Company Secretary that there was a need for a board 
meeting and you left it up to him whether he went along with 
the suggestion because I guess it is a suggestion you could 
make. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Under 
normal 
circumstances, 
yes 
Mr Chairman, I may have been able to do that but at this 
stage, I did not have enough information.  You know, when 
20 
he called me, all that he said is that, I would need to 
convene 
a 
board 
meeting 
and 
that 
I 
would 
get 
the 
information from the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS DANIELS:   And you know, given the time of the year, it 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 39 of 249 
 
would have been very difficult to do unscheduled meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  You see, he carries on 
further and just listen to the picture of things ought to be 
painted here.   
“So Ms Daniels request an urgent meeting on the 
basis of the letter Mr Matshela Koko had written to 
the DG of the Department of Mineral Resources on 
6 December 2015 and the undated response of the 
DG and the copies are attached. 
10 
The 
Company Secretary (he 
goes on to 
say) 
presented 
the 
memorandum 
dated 
8 December 2015, dealing with the urgency of the 
matter.” 
 
And he attaches a copy as well.  So the impression 
created – and maybe he will clarify when he is here – is that 
you called the meeting, you then presented the memorandum 
in regard to that. 
 
Well, I suppose this memorandum is the submission that 
we are referring to here but it seems to be something that, 
20 
on his version would have come from you, in your initiative, 
calling a meeting in submitting this memorandum. 
 
Did you sign the memorandum? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not sign the memorandum 
Mr Chairman.  It was signed by Mr Singh in his capacity as 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 40 of 249 
 
Chief Financial Officer and it was signed by Mr Koko as the 
Group Executive for Generation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So what did ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  The Chief Executive of – the 
Group Chief Executive of Eskom and financial officer or 
financial director.  They were ex-officio members of the 
board, is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What about the company secretary, is 
the company secretary also an ex-officio member of the 
10 
board or does he or she simply attend to – facilitate 
recordkeeping and so on? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I think that is one conception 
that one needs to debunk, the company secretary is a not a 
member of the board, has no voting powers.  My function 
was to ensure the smooth – so it is a very high level 
technical clerical role in one aspect and it would ensure 
that the meeting is run sufficiently, that they run smoothly, 
that the minutes are taken and that meetings are convened 
at the request of the Chairman particularly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The company secretary would provide 
basically a resource to the board. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To make the work of the board easier, to 
make sure that records are kept properly and also advise 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 41 of 249 
 
the board on some legislative matters? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I had been asked, you know, in the 
course of my – in my duties to get – obviously either 
advise on governance issues or obtain legal opinion, 
etcetera, which came later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
Just 
for 
completeness on that your statutory duties in Section 88 of 
the Companies Act, I am sure you will recall them, Ms 
Daniels, some of them is to ensure that the minutes of all 
10 
shareholders’ meetings, board meetings and the meetings 
of any committee of the directors of a company or of the 
company 
audit 
committee 
are 
properly 
recorded 
in 
accordance with this Act.  Now they are found in Section 
88(2) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008.  Ja, it is a list of 
five, six, seven duties including you to avoid – I mean, to 
provide 
the 
directors 
collectively 
and 
individually 
of 
guidance on their duties, responsibilities and powers, 
making them aware of the law and matters affecting the 
company. 
20 
 
So here is a submission prepared by you with – 
well, with information from the CFO and Mr Matshela Koko.  
What is the purpose of the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   Can I refer to the submission? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you can tell us from your 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 42 of 249 
 
recollection.  I will assist in regard to the – where you find 
the submission, if it is, page 281. 
MS DANIELS:   I think, in just high level terms, Mr 
Chairman, it was to negotiate and conclude the pre-
purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was to...? 
MS DANIELS:   What the submission says, it was to 
negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement 
for the proposed owners of Optimum Coal Mine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I think your mic is again not right 
10 
and …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Did you hear me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just continue, I am looking at the 
beginning of the submission.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Seleka, just continue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now that 
submission is on page 281, you confirm that is the 
submission? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where I am looking. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is: 
“Executive summary round robin submission to 
board of directors.” 
Title of the submission: 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 43 of 249 
 
“Pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine 
(Pty) Ltd.” 
Do you see that, Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Can 
you 
explain 
that 
to 
the 
Chairperson?  It is a pre-purchase of coal from Optimum. 
MS DANIELS:   So in essence it was to prepay for coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So who – so the intention here is to 
make a submission to the board motivating for the board to 
prepay for coal from Optimum. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not from Tegeta. 
MS DANIELS:   Not from Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now paragraph 2 says: 
“Resolution required  It is hereby resolved that the 
request from the Department of Mineral Resources 
is hereby noted.” 
And what request are they referring to? 
MS DANIELS:   This was the request to consider payment 
of R1.7 billion upfront, as you would have seen in the letter 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You mean the letter on page 276? 
MS DANIELS:   The letter on page 276, it says: 
“Propose 
for 
consideration 
be 
made 
for 
some 
prepayment to be made up to one year of coal 
supply.” 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 44 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let us go to page 276 please.  The 
last paragraph in that letter, which is undated, it says: 
“Financial provision due to historical liabilities at 
OCH level is estimated at R1.7 billion.  The amount 
still has to be confirmed through a process which 
will involve the parties concerned.” 
I do not know whether anybody at Eskom or board level, 
yourself, did you understand what that statement meant 
about 
financial 
provision 
due 
to 
historical 
liabilities, 
estimated at R1.7 billion. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   From my understanding and experience, Mr 
Chairman, of coal contracts, this was the provision that 
needed to be made for environmental rehabilitation.  So, 
you know, as miners progress in the mining they have to 
make provision for rehabilitation at the end of the mine and 
as concurrent.  So that was my understanding of this 
sentence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But does it bear any relevance to the 
proposal to do a pre-purchase or prepayment?  
MS DANIELS:   I think …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also, there seems to be no reference to 
any rehabilitation, is it not? 
MS DANIELS:   No, there is no reference but, you know, 
having looked at the documents now, with the benefit of 
hindsight, that was the hook that was used to motivate for 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 45 of 249 
 
the prepayment because you would then see …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What, the rehabilitation?  What was the 
hook? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, it talks about R1.7 billion and then it 
talks about providing support for the project to succeed 
and then it talks about: 
“In return for the new owners honouring the current 
contract and for driving transformation, we would 
like to propose that consideration be made for some 
prepayment.” 
10 
So in a convoluted way, Mr Chairman, what it was saying is 
that they have got this liability, they need some help with 
operations, so please help them, if I can just put it in 
colloquial terms.  Or please give consideration to helping 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  That file you 
have has Dr Ramontja affidavit, but I will read to you what 
he says in regard to this 1.7 and maybe that is where the 
rehabilitation come from.  He says: 
20 
“The letter further addressed itself to the historical 
liabilities of Optimum which were estimated R1.7 
billion.  The department would be privy to certain of 
the 
liabilities. 
 Any 
company 
or 
entity 
which 
embarks on mining is supposed to provide financial 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 46 of 249 
 
guarantees to the department to make provision for 
finances 
to 
rehabilitate 
the 
environmental 
degradation which may be caused by mining.” 
Now I should add that Dr Ramontja testified before the 
Commission that he did not write this letter.  In the 
affidavit he explains a paragraph which he did not write 
and he refers to finances – make provision for finances to 
rehabilitate the environmental degradation.  But it still 
begs the question, what does that have to do with a 
prepayment or a pre-purchase that was being motivated in 
10 
the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   In my submission this had nothing to do 
with the prepayment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you apply your mind to it at the 
time and maybe enquire as to why the board should be 
made to rely on this letter, because that is the first part of 
the submission under paragraph 2. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, at the time I really did not 
interrogate the letter to that degree.  I have had the benefit 
of hindsight and you will see it in my affidavit of sitting 
20 
down and, you know, actually looking at the – also at the 
request of the Commission and the questions, looking at 
the submissions and releasing that it actually did not make 
any sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we go back to that submission 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 47 of 249 
 
under Resolution Required.  They require... 
“It is hereby resolved that a request from the 
Department of Mineral Resources is hereby noted.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is the resolution, where is 
the submission again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   281, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   281. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   281. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And paragraph 2.1.2: 
10 
“The Group Chief Executive...” 
Is that Mr Anoj Singh? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes at the time the Group Chief Executive, 
Mr Singh was acting, Mr Molefe was off sick. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “The Group Chief Executive together  
with the Group Executive for Generation…” 
Who is that? 
MS DANIELS:   That was Matshela Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “...and Chief Financial Officer...” 
MS DANIELS:   That was Anoj Singh. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Anoj... 
“...are hereby authorised to negotiate and conclude 
a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed 
owners of OCM (Coal Supply)” 
Now what …[intervenes] 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 48 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Tegeta. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So is that consistent with what is said 
under the title of the submitted because the title says: 
“Pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine 
(Pty) Ltd.” 
From the entity.” 
MS DANIELS:   No, that is not consistent. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but say more, is it conflicting, is it 
10 
the same entity or what is going on here? 
MS DANIELS:   Sorry, Mr Seleka, I did not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, by the way, did you prepare the 
submission?  Who prepared the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   I drafted versions 1 and 2 and  - well, each 
version would be sent to Mr Koko and Mr Singh.  They 
would come back additions.  This final version that was 
signed, there were additions that I did not make but it was 
already signed off by them.  So there was no opportunity  
to change things.  You will see that one it is signed by the 
20 
executives I do not second-guess them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, thank you, Chair.  Okay, so there is 
that – it is a confusion or inconsistency and it goes on.  
Let us see, paragraph 2.2: 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 49 of 249 
 
“Executive Summary and Conclusion” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you move on, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Daniels, your earlier versions of the 
draft, was there any different between it – or those drafts 
and the ultimate paragraph 2.1.2? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not – I do not have that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can have a look if there is 
something that will refresh your memory. 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure we have …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not think we have your draft 
versions.  
MS DANIELS:   In the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In your affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because this is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have got them or you do not have 
them? 
MS DANIELS:   I do have them but they are not in the 
bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are they in another bundle, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, we do not have them, the 
Commission does not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, have you got them somewhere? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do have them somewhere. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 50 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, does the investigator have them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The [indistinct]16:38 
MS DANIELS:   No, I think we did have it in our 
consultation, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
okay, 
we 
can 
proceed 
while 
somebody 
is 
looking 
for 
them. 
 
But 
what 
is 
your 
recollection or you cannot remember? 
MS DANIELS:   I would not remember the minutiae of the 
detail.  I think it would be, you know, unfair to put them 
before you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will wait until we have got the 
drafts.  Proceed, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So, Ms Daniel, I 
wanted to go to the paragraphs under 2.2: 
“Executive Summary and Conclusion” 
Says: 
“Eskom faces a supply risk of coal to the Hendrina 
Power Station of 5.5 NTPA by OCM as a result of 
business rescue proceedings.” 
Was that correct at the time? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   No, it was not correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “:There is a potential proposal from the  
business 
rescue 
practitioner 
supported 
by 
the 
Department of Mineral Resources.” 
Can you explain that to the Chairperson?  So the business 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 51 of 249 
 
rescue practitioner had made a proposal and that proposal 
was supported by the Department of Mineral Resources.  
Do you see that statement, 2.2.2? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I see that but that – that was not 
reflected in the correspondence in that way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so if one takes this paragraph, on 
the fact of it, it means that there is a proposal on the table 
by the business rescue practitioners of OCM and that 
proposal is supported by the DMR.  So that means what 
follows should be Eskom accepts that proposal. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the end result should be that the 
transaction that is motivated here would be concluded with 
the business rescue practitioners because they are the 
ones who made the proposal which the DMR supports. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Looking at 2.2.2. 
MS DANIELS:   Just looking at 2.2.2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Which then is still a puzzlement 
why 2.1.2 is worded the way it is worded because it 
20 
envisages a pre-purchase from a different entity. 
MS DANIELS:   But – ja, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And 2.2.3 says: 
“The solution relates to a pre-purchase of coal to 
the value of R1.68 billion which mitigates supply 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 52 of 249 
 
risk.” 
So you read that with 2.1.1.  Says we are facing supply 
risk, therefore this is the solution and it seems to be the 
solution based on the proposal in 2.2.2, let us pre-
purchase coal to the value of R1.6 billion which mitigates 
supply risk.  Counterparty risk is mitigated by a session of 
the coal to Eskom.  The funding of the – a pre-purchase 
will be made by an inventory working capital, reduction of 
54 days for approximately 40 days.  I do not understand 
that, that statement.  
10 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I am having the same 
problem hearing, I cannot hear Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you cannot hear me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe go closer to the microphone 
maybe, Mr Seleka. 
MS DANIELS:   Sorry, you fade in and out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did I fade in and out? 
MS DANIELS:   Apologies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So which – where would you like me to 
repeat?  2.2.4, I was saying I do not understand that 
20 
paragraph, I do not know whether it should detain us.  We 
can move on. 
MS DANIELS:   I think the executive summary is explained 
in sort of Section 3 and then I also analysed in my 
affidavit.  So I think if your questions are does this make 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 53 of 249 
 
sense, as I said in my affidavit, it does not make sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It what? 
MS DANIELS:   It does not make sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In what way?  In what respect?  Well, 
you know, let us do this first.   
MS DANIELS:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you, just in a nutshell, explain to the 
Chairperson, this submission is about, as they say, a pre-
purchase of coal from Optimum and it seems to be based 
on what they say, it is a proposal by the business rescue 
10 
practitioner which proposal is supported by DMR in respect 
of, what they say, is a risk to the supply of coal to the 
Hendrina Power Station.  What is the solution to that risk?  
Let us do a pre-purchase or – ja, they call it a pre-
purchase of coal to the value of R1.6 billion. 
 
Now on the fact of it – well, on the one hand it is 
relevant so the submission looks at Optimum (Pty) Ltd, the 
business rescue practitioners, and he talks to that.  
 
On the other hand, and tell me if I am correct 
because I am explaining this so that we understand it, on 
20 
the other hand, that paragraph, which is 2.1.2 says it is a 
pre-purchase. 
“To negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal 
agreement for the proposed owners of OCM.” 
Now that is a different entity.  That will be Tegeta.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 54 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that explanation correct? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is a succinct way of looking at it, 
Mr Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then am I correct that one then is left 
with a confusion.  Is it correct that one then is left with a 
confusion? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is - says to the identity of the 
party with whom this transaction is meant to be concluded. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes because OCM, Optimum Coal Mine 
business rescue practitioner is used quite loosely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at one o’clock.  Those drafts, 
have they been found?  Do they have 2.1.2? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 443. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do they appear at 443?  Oh yes, I can 
see 2.2 seems to be same as 2.1.2 but maybe not exactly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, we are looking at 2.2.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you compare 2.2 at page 444 
and 2.1.2 up to a certain point they seem to be the same 
20 
but what appears at 2.2 at page 444, there seems to be 
something else that has been cut off, excised, but it would 
appear, Ms Daniels, that even in your own draft you had 
written that the Chief Financial Officer – oh, you did not 
put in the Group Chief Executive but you said: 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 55 of 249 
 
“The Chief Financial Officer together with the Group 
Chief 
Executive 
for 
Generation 
are 
hereby 
authorised to negotiate and conclude an agreement 
with the new owners of Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) 
Ltd.” 
That is where they stopped.  You continue and said: 
“In 
regard 
to 
the 
prepayment 
to 
secure 
the 
[indistinct] 26.43 price for a period of 12 months or 
up to a limit of 1.68 billion whichever is the lesser.” 
Can you see that? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it would seem that whoever settled 
that submission might not have initiated that wording and 
that that wording may have come from you.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The wording I am referring to… 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is: 
“…to negotiate and conclude an agreement with the 
new owners of Optimum Coal Mine.” 
20 
That is the part I am talking about which Mr Seleka had 
drawn attention to in regard to the document at page 281. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair, but I do want 
to point out that I actually explain in more detail and it is a 
bit clearer that it is the new owners of Optimum Coal Mine. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 56 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I thought that was precisely Mr 
Seleka’s concern, that when you look at the – it was to be 
a pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine and I think 
Mr Seleka’s point and Mr Seleka must tell me if I 
misunderstood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka’s point I thought was one 
would expect that the negotiations were going to be with 
Optimum Coal Mine and not with the proposed owners of 
Optimum Coal.  He was saying it is strange that 2.2 and 
10 
2.1.2 on the final submission says that these officials of 
Eskom mentioned there were being authorised to negotiate 
with the proposed owners instead of saying they must 
negotiate with OCM.  That is the point he was making. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  What do you say – why did you write 
that, what was the rationale behind...? 
MS DANIELS:   Those were my instructions at the time, Mr 
Chairman, and the manner in which I phrased it here 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   I said those were my instructions at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From whom? 
MS DANIELS:   From Mr Koko and Mr Singh.  And 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 57 of 249 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why – did you ask him why the 
submission should talk about the officials of Eskom being 
authorised to negotiate with the proposed owners of OCM 
instead of negotiating with OCM itself, did you raise that 
issue with him ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   I don’t ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it wouldn’t have made sense to 
you. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja I don’t think I raised the issue at the 
10 
time Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but why wouldn’t you have raised it, 
it doesn’t make sense. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, it is against the backdrop of the 
meeting of the 24 t h of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so what was in that meeting that 
could make one understand this. 
MS DANIELS:   There was mention, or the premise of the 
meeting at the time was the purchase of OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   So that was the only link at this time in the 
process of drafting, because there was discussions about 
buying OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean well it may well be that if you 
have an agreement with somebody and somebody else is 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 58 of 249 
 
likely to take that entity over there might be cause to talk 
to the proposed owners with regard to the future, it may be 
that that is it, but one would normally have expected that 
since the proposed owners were not owners as yet that the 
negotiations would be with the supplier, you understand 
that? 
MS DANIELS:   I understand that, and you know in 
retrospect one would say you now that should have been 
the position.  I think because of the meeting of the 24 t h of 
November, you know just the letter of DMR aside, if you 
10 
look at it, the discussion at that meeting was the parties 
were already undertaking a due diligence, they wanted to 
complete this by a particular date in the future but as it 
progressed you now those documents were not – these 
documents then don’t support that, and that’s why I am 
saying with the benefit of hindsight when you look at the 
documentation provided to support his position they don’t 
really tie up, and that’s what I say? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka I think we must take the 
lunch adjournment.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is about eight minutes or nine minutes 
past one we will adjourn and resume at ten past two.   
 
We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you chair. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 59 of 249 
 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, thank you DCJ.   Ms 
Daniels we were dealing with the submission that was 
prepared.  Now we are at a stage of the preparation of the 
submission, 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
submission. 
 
This 
submission is prepared in order to be submitted.  Now we 
need to know from you is it to be submitted to the Board 
10 
for discussion and decision making? 
MS DANIELS:   It was because it was a Round Robin it 
was decision making. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, there was not going to be a 
meeting of the Board? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it subsequently became a Round Robin 
discussion, I mean a Round Robin approval because 
members of the Board were not available to meet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, this submission – I’ll come back 
to it, is being prepared on the 7 t h of December 2015. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That Round Robin decision took place 
when? 
MS DANIELS:  I sent out the documents on the 8 t h of 
December.  
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 60 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the Board members? 
MS DANIELS:   To the Board members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the Round Robin decision was 
made? 
MS DANIELS:   On the 9 t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the Board members had one day 
notice? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or one day opportunity to consider 
what was being submitted to them? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I request that – I’m sorry Mr Seleka, 
there is first that the – in the submission contemplated the 
Board 
would 
note 
from 
the 
Department 
of 
Mineral 
Resources was the request from Dr Ramontja’s letter – in 
Dr Ramontja’s letter that Eskom should play an active role 
in providing support for the project to proceed? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did that mean, do you know? 
MS DANIELS:   No, not at that stage, it just looked like 
20 
consideration for the pre-payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which of these paragraphs did Dr 
Ramontja say he did not put in his letter, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He didn’t draft the letter, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At all? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 61 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so the letter was given to him, he 
found it on his desk, and he said he read it, it made sense 
to him, he says because the DMR would sometimes 
intervene to help, especially where jobs are at risk and he 
signed the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s a letter that he received from 
Eskom and I think it must have been Mr Koko as well, 
where he did not authorise a response, I think but 
somebody else in DMR, if I recall correctly, prepared a 
response that was supposed to be sent off only after him 
10 
authorising it, so it must be another letter because this one 
has got his signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His signature yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, so Ms Daniels we were just 
trying to plot the timeline from the drafting to the 
submission or circulating of the submission to the Board 
members 
and 
to 
the 
decision 
making 
by 
the 
Board 
members.  So, they get the submission from you on the 
8 t h? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And when you send a submission to 
them what do you indicate in terms of when the decision 
should  be made? 
MS DANIELS:   I think it was the next day by midday if 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 62 of 249 
 
possible. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And can you recall on the 8 t h, when do 
you – time wise, when do you send the submission to 
them? 
MS DANIELS:   It was in the afternoon. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, they would have had to have 
considered it overnight? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Make a decision. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By Round Robin on an R1.6billion? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Pre-payment? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did any one of them raise concerns? 
MS DANIELS:   There were two Board members that sent 
questions, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what were – who are those? 
MS DANIELS:   That was Ms Viroshini Naidoo and Ms 
Mariam Cassim. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what were their concerns? 
MS DANIELS:   I think in Ms Viroshini Naidoo’s case she 
approved the submission, the first line of the email said I 
approve but please ensure that this goes to the IFC, which 
is the Investment and Finance Committee, is it within – you 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 63 of 249 
 
know make sure that we adhere to the PFMA approvals and 
does this need DPE approval, which is The Department of 
Public Enterprises.  Ms Cassim had issues – her questions 
were around the financial construction which I sent to – 
and the coal pricing which I then sent to Mr Koko and Mr 
Singh for reply. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Did they reply?  
MS DANIELS:   They did reply, and I sent the replies that I 
received to Ms Cassim on the morning of the 9 t h of 
December. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that in his affidavit Mr Koko says, 
in regard to the drafting of the – oh no that’s the letter, I 
think he confirms, asking you to draft the letter on the 4 t h 
of December 2015, that’s the letter you draft, and it goes 
to the DMR. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The drafting of the submission itself, 
you say is on the 7 t h.  So, let’s – we were going through 
the contents of this submission and what we see, on the 
face of it, is the convolution and confusion in regard to the 
20 
identity of the entity with whom to do this transaction.  If 
you recall, and I would like you to explain this to the 
Chairperson,  what was in the mind of – or what was 
explained to the Board when this submission is presented, 
what is explained, is the purpose for which this submission 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 64 of 249 
 
was made? 
MS DANIELS:   I think the covering note just said, this is 
for the pre-purchase of coal – pre-payment of coal in cash 
for the amount of R1.68billion from Optimum to Optimum 
Coal Mine and the supporting documents would have been 
the submission and the letters between Mr Koko and Dr 
Ramontja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, now that explanation, where does 
one find it, is it in an email or is it in this submission? 
MS DANIELS:   It’s in this submission and …[intervenes]. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About the pre-payment to Tegeta? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I think it was the pre-payment to 
Optimum Coal Mine that I said not Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To Optimum Coal Mine? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You’re saying it’s in this submission?  
MS DANIELS:   Well, it says Optimum Coal Mine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, well there’s two things here, I’ve 
said the entities are seemingly confused – well not 
confused but it’s confusing in regard to the identity of the 
20 
entities to conclude the transaction with.  What I want to 
understand, is your explanation to the Chairperson, what 
was explained to the Board, is the purpose of this 
submission, what is the Boar told and I appreciate that the 
Board is receiving this, is it by email? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 65 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Board is going to decide by way of 
a Round Robin, correct? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the Board is not going to have a 
meeting to discuss this documentation submitted for it? 
MS DANIELS:   No, not at all…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, they’re going to, individually send 
you, in their approval of this documentation without having 
sat together to discuss it?  
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, what is explained to the Board, 
when this document is submitted to it? 
MS DANIELS:   This is the submission for decision, it 
concerns the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal 
Mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words, there is nothing else 
of any consequence that the Board was told other than the 
contents of the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so if anyone wants to know, what 
was the Board told, it’s what’s in the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   It was in the documents that I sent out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there was no discussion outside of 
the document? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 66 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, okay.  Why was it not necessary 
to let a matter involving such big amounts – such a big 
amount be decided by way of a Round Robin without the 
benefit of a proper discussion among Board members? 
MS DANIELS:   I think, Mr Chairman, at the time, given the 
time of year, it was practicality you know ostensibly but 
there was a rush to get a decision, so the instruction was, 
send out the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whose instruction was that? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   There was a request from the office of Mr 
Singh, the Chief Financial Officer, to send it out by Round 
Robin and, you know, that’s also when I also prepared the 
documents on that basis, I also sent it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, what was explained as the 
reason for the urgency? 
MS DANIELS:   There actually was no explanation for the 
urgency other than, there’s a threat to security of supply. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was there documentation relied upon 
20 
to validate that claim of the risk of coal supply? 
MS DANIELS:   No, not at this submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that the only kind of factor relied 
upon is that OCM has gone into business rescue? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 67 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But does business rescue – a company 
being in business rescue prevent it from trading? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it does not and more particularly if you 
bear in mind that there had been a commitment at the 
meeting of the 24 t h of November that the supply would 
continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and isn’t it that, regarding what 
I’ve just asked you, that Tegeta itself was acquiring coal 
from OCM or Optimum Coal Mine in order to supply to 
Eskom. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that appeared from the documents, I 
did not have direct knowledge of that at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You didn’t have direct knowledge of 
that? 
MS DANIELS:   No but it does – that was the contractual 
arrangement if you look at the documentation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so what I’m saying is, if Tegeta 
could buy from this mine, Optimum Coal Mine, no doubt 
Eskom could continue doing so, directly from the mine? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, I mean, it had a contract. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the reason that it was under 
business rescue was no reason at all for the purposes of 
this pre-payment? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, you know, we have seen, and I 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 68 of 249 
 
want you to just explain to the Chairperson, the evolution 
of this document with the amendments that get to be done 
to it, were you aware whether this document went outside 
of Eskom for commentary by some third party and, that is 
during the drafting process and then came back to be 
finalised with the changes that were made and given to you 
to submit to the Board? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman, during the consultation 
with the Commission’s investigation team, I was presented 
with emails between Mr Eric Wood and The Businessman 
10 
email and I think it was Mr Koko and Mr Singh.  My 
version, two of the documentations actually went outside of 
Eskom, it came back signed -well when I received it, it was 
signed.  If you look at the discussion that happened 
between the parties it was changed from a submission to 
the 
Investment 
and 
Finance 
Committee, 
there 
was 
information added, the financial constructions were added 
and it then came back to me signed, both by Mr Koko and 
Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, if I may, in regard to this 
20 
particular aspect I’d like Ms Suzanne Daniels to turn to 
page 443, that’s where we were relative to the first and the 
second version of the draft but now, I wanted to view it for 
a different purpose, 443, are you there Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am there. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 69 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Something catches my eye on page 
444, I see that – is that what you refer to as your first 
draft? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, this is the first draft on the 7 t h of 
December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the heading under Executive 
Summary is Round Robin submission to the Investment and 
Finance Committee, IFC? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So why is that I thought this was a 
10 
submission to the Board? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, when I received the 
instruction it was my view, at the time, that this was – the 
Investment and Finance Committee is the Committee of the 
Board which deals with financial matters and it needed – 
and a decision of this nature, I thought it go to the 
Investment and Finance Committee before it goes to the 
Board and that is why I started out preparing the document 
to the Investment and Finance Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that your decision as opposed to an 
instruction to you from somebody else? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it your decision? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 70 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had you been instructed as to – to whom 
you were supposed to address the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   No, not at that stage, I was just given the 
content.  You know when – in Eskom, the terms Board was 
used very loosely you know, so we’re going to do a 
submission to Board, and they wouldn’t specify in detail.  
So, my assumption, in the first instance was that this 
would go through the Investment and Finance Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the reference to the Board, what do 
you say about it? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   I said it – you know, in Eskom it was quite 
a loose term when we had discussions, like you’d hear, it 
was decided by the Board when it was actually a sub-
committee of the Board.  So, when I started out with the 
draft, I started out on the assumption that it would first go 
to the Investment and Finance Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now, how did that 
get to be changed? 
MS DANIELS:   When it came back in version – I think it 
20 
was version three, it was already, the signed, the final 
version it came back and to the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, that’s the version one is your 
page 444, is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That’s correct. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 71 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the email – your email to Mr Koko 
is on page 443.  So, you say to him, 
 
“For your review and sign-off”, 
 
That’s Monday 7 December 2015 at 15h16. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So, the document you’re sending to him 
is on page 444.  
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the heading, it reflects to be 
submitted to the IFC and it requires, on page 447 
10 
paragraph 4,  
“Other 
approvals 
required, 
Public 
Finance 
Management Act obtained from National Treasury 
and Department of Public Enterprise due to tenure 
and contract value”. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then on page 448 there’s an email 
again from you to Mr Matshela Koko, it says: 
 
“Version 2 – V2”. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, this is still addressed 
20 
to the Investment and Finance Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s at 15h58, so you turn the page, 
the document is still addressed to IFC and it still has a 
requirement of Public Finance Management Act on page 
452, paragraph 4. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 72 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It’s sent off to him, then you turn the 
page to 453, again still on the 7 t h of December 2015 at 
16h40.  Now, please explain to the Chairperson, identify to 
the Chairperson what you see there? 
MS DANIELS:   There’s an email from Businessman to Eric 
Wood who says: 
“I want the PFMA approval part removed, I also 
think it should be full Board not IFC because over 
R1.5billion”. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What exactly is he saying? 
MS DANIELS:   What he…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let’s start with this, has he seen 
your summary or your document, the submission? 
MS DANIELS:   It appears that version 2 was attached to 
that email, Mr Chairman, if you look at what it says in the 
attachments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no I accept that, I want you to 
confirm. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I confirm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That he has seen that he has seen it? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I can only confirm from what he 
writes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
No, 
I 
accept 
that, 
based 
on…[intervenes]. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 73 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Based on what he said, he must have seen 
what I had written. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And is he making submissions – is he 
making suggestions of what to be removed and what to be 
amended? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, that – I wouldn’t say those are 
suggestions I think those are more like instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he says he has identified a part 
that he says should be removed? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he says that it should not be 
addressed to the Investment and Finance Committee it 
should be addressed to the full Board? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Did you – do you 
know how the draft submission would have landed with Mr 
Eric Wood and Businessman? 
MS DANIELS:   I only know that from the emails that I’ve 
been shown. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You only know from? 
MS DANIELS:   From the emails that I’ve been shown from 
the investigating team. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, my question is, do you know it 
would have gone to them, this document? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 74 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, it was either forwarded from Mr Koko 
or Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you say that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The investigator doesn’t have an email 
to that effect. 
MS DANIELS:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s why I’m asking whether, do you 
know? 
MS DANIELS:   Oh okay, no I don’t know then how it got to 
them but that’s my assumption. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, so far what we see from the emails 
is that it is you and Mr Koko exchanging the draft. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, either you or he could have sent it 
out? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you send it out? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you aware of this email at the 
time? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   No, I was not aware of the emails at the 
time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so I want to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the Businessman email? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson, infoportal1. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 75 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, infoportal1, were you not aware of it 
at that time? 
MS DANIELS:   I’m talking about the email exchange, Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but the email address you were? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  When did you become aware 
of the email exchange? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
The 
investigators 
showed 
me…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the Commission. 
MS DANIELS:   Of the Commission and in 2018 as well, 
Amu Bongani sent me some questions, I think that was the 
first time I became aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In? 
MS DANIELS:   2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2018, okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, then – well on the draft on 
page 454 I see still there’s IFC, so IFC hasn’t been 
removed and on page 457 under paragraph 5 it still has a 
20 
PFMA, National Treasury required, approval required.  So, 
it seems by this time, it hasn’t come back to you? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it hasn’t. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you, in fact, do the changes from 
IFC to Board, did you, ultimately, do those changes? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 76 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does your final draft – well who made 
the final draft? 
MS DANIELS:   The final draft came back signed from – 
first from Mr Koko and then from Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Signed? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that came to you, turn to page 486. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I’m there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there, yes please identify the 
10 
document? 
MS DANIELS:   It’s an email from Matshela Koko to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But this is now on Tuesday 8 
December 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 16h40.  
MS DANIELS:   At 16h40, that’s correct 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, by this time, this document has not 
been submitted to the Board? 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Its forwarding to you, the email below. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the email below is also from Mr 
Matshela Koko, Tuesday December 8, 2015 at 3h57pm it 
sent to – or addressed to Mr Anoj Singh and the subject is 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 77 of 249 
 
the 2015/12/08 RRR Optimum Coal Mine Pty Ltd final and 
then he says, 
“Boss 
please 
receive 
the 
attached, 
signed 
documents, best regards”, 
 
There at the top then it gets forwarded to you. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the document on the next page? 
MS DANIELS:   That is the document, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the last one then is a Round Robin 
submission to Board of Directors. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   To the Board of Directors, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No longer to IFC? 
MS DANIELS:   No longer to IFC, that is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that paragraph 4 of PFMA 
requirement? 
MS DANIELS:   Has now been removed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the document is signed by Mr 
Koko on 8 December 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the document or submission you 
20 
finally circulated to Board members? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether Mr Singh also 
signed it, I see he didn’t sign on this one, is there another 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 78 of 249 
 
copy that is signed? 
MS DANIELS:   The next copy is the one that I used 
because it contained Mr Singh’s signature.  If you look at 
page 492, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And then you’ll see that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m looking at 497. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that’s the document, I then, used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I want to go slightly back – a little 
10 
back, I see on…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, just for my understanding what 
was the ranking between the CFO and Group Executive 
Generation? 
MS DANIELS:  The CFO was the Executive Director on the 
Board, the Chief Officer – Group Executive Generation was a 
member Exec – of the Executive Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the? 
MS DANIELS:  Executive Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes – was the CFO not part of the 
20 
Executive Committee? 
MS DANIELS:  As well but in terms of – when you think rank 
the CFO would rank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is confusing me because you have – 
we looked at an email a few minutes ago where I think Mr 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 79 of 249 
 
Koko addressed an email – ja at page 486 to Mr Singh and 
addressed him as Boss. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now at 497 Mr Koko appears to be the 
last one to sign in terms of what I take it to be hierarchy? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  I think just to put it in context Mr 
Chairman at this point in time Mr Singh was acting Chief 
Executive Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that Mr Koko. 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Singh because Matshela Koko is writing to 
10 
Anoj Singh and calling him Boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – you say Mr Singh was acting as 
Group CEO? 
MS DANIELS:  Ja Mr Molefe was off sick at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but on this document he did not sign in 
that capacity at 497? 
MS DANIELS:  No, no he signed as Chief Financial Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as Chief Financial Officer when you 
20 
compare to Group Executive Generation that is what I am 
asking what is the hierarchy? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two of them? 
MS DANIELS:  There would have been a hierarchy.  The 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 80 of 249 
 
Chief Financial Officer is actually a bit higher than the Group 
Executive Generation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well it is does not make the sense that 
one has got over the time.  One has seen that usually the 
highest ranking official would be the last to sign after 
everybody has made recommendations and then the last – 
the highest ranking official then makes the decision. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas here – ja you have the Chief 
Financial Officer before Mr Koko.  Okay so I guess you – 
10 
there is nothing you can – you can say about it? 
MS DANIELS:  Well you know at this stage I think if you just 
look at the emails Mr Koko signed first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  If you look at the emails in terms of the time 
Mr Koko signed the document first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they – were they on the same level 
or were they not on the same level or is that something you 
would not know? 
MS DANIELS:  It is difficult. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chief Financial Officer and Group 
Executive Generation. 
MS DANIELS:  It is .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was one of them higher than the other 
in terms of the company hierarchy? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 81 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:  In terms of the – in terms of the company 
hierarchy the Chief Financial Officer would be higher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  Slightly higher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  Than the Group Executive Generation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Ja Ms Daniels because even 
the draft is in that order.  Mr Singh is first and then Mr 
Matshela Koko is last which is what the Chairperson is 
10 
saying.  Normally the – the junior people will sign first and 
pass it on to the most senior person who will be the last to 
sign.  After the document is submitted to him and it is 
explained this is what it means and he is satisfied then he 
signs.  That is the point he made.  But you would have 
known who is senior – more senior than the others surely.  
Ms Daniels seeing as the Chief Financial Officer would have 
been more senior? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is what I am saying the Chief 
Financial Officer is more senior but I – I did not actually – if I 
20 
look at this now Chairman I did not really take notice of the 
manner in which the document – the signatories were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us go slightly back to page 459?  
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 82 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:  Please say the page again for me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 459.  So it is after that email from 
Businessman is I want – I want – now this man wants it.  It is 
not may I suggest – I want the PFMA approval.  Part 
removed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I thought you said 459? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair I was saying it after that email.  
Let us go to 459.  Let us go to 459?  459 it is on the 8 
December at 7:43 it is an email from Mr Koko to Mr Anoj.  
Now there we see Ms Daniels is the third version – version 
10 
3.  Do you see that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he writes: 
“FD 
please 
receive 
the 
soft 
copy 
as 
discussed.  Warm regards.” 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well you are not copied there so you – 
would you have had knowledge of this exchange? 
MS DANIELS:  No not that I can see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then there is the – I am not sure whether 
20 
this is version 3 on page 468 because he still has IFC and 
he still has paragraph 4.  But it did not come to you?  Well 
you are not copied in that email. 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And go to page 464.  There are emails 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 83 of 249 
 
there and the bottom one is the one we have read between 
Mr – the one of Mr Koko to Mr Anoj Singh where he says: 
“FD please receive the soft copy.” 
That is at the bottom. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then we go up and the middle of the 
page there is another email from – it is Polly. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now I cannot pronounce that name 
Visenet. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  No really the Mr. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“On behalf of Anoj Singh.” 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 8 December 2015 11:03 am and it is 
addressed 
to 
Boitumelo 
Mapasa 
now 
at 
Regiments 
– 
[00:07:08] at Regiments.  Subject it is the same subject 
Optimum Coal Mine Pty Ltd V3 and it says: 
“FYI – for your interest.” 
So what is happening here? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  This is going from the office Polly is the 
Executive or was the Executive assistant to Mr Singh and 
this looks like it is going from Polly to someone at 
Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Polly is an employee at Eskom? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 84 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This time – is a PA – well I do not know 
is he a PA – is she? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes she was as you can see it says here 
Executive Assistant. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Executive Assistant. 
MS DANIELS:  Office of the Chief Financial Officer Mr Anoj 
Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see.  So sending the document to 
Regiments. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now does Regiments have anything to do 
with this document? 
MS DANIELS:  Not at this stage but you will see later when 
it comes back from – when it comes back signed the – the 
financial verifications section Regiments is included as the 
party who did the financial verification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Financial certification. 
MS DANIELS:  Verification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Verification. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  By – by independent parties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Give us the page number? 
MS DANIELS:  You will find it on page 491.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh under paragraph 3.7? 
MS DANIELS:  3.7.  My apologies you will see Regiments 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 85 of 249 
 
Capital Propriety Limited added in there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now let us go back to page 64… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the point you were making about 
page 497? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is 491 – 497 yes.  He is saying under 
paragraph 3.7 
“Regiments 
Capital 
Propriety 
Limited 
is 
indicated 
there 
as 
verification 
by 
independent party.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ms Daniels let us go back to page 
464.  And now did you know about Regiments as you go back 
to page 464? 
MS DANIELS:  Not in this context Mr Singh because I – Mr 
Chairman because they did not have any input into the 
document to my knowledge. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Ah because I see on page 463 under 
the paragraph 3.7 verification by independent party they say 
not applicable there. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But what was to be verified if there was 
anything to be verified?  What does that entail? 
MS DANIELS:  Usually if – usually if in submissions if there 
had been an external evaluation whether it be financial, due 
diligence you know where an external party say for instance 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 86 of 249 
 
a Deloittes or somebody was consulted we would then in 
submissions indicate who had been provided – who had done 
the verification. And that is why it says if applicable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was it applicable here? 
MS DANIELS:  Not to my knowledge. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay but just think about it. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Here is a submission for a pre-payment 
to be made. Eskom wants to make a pre-payment R1.6 
billion.  What need – what – how does verification come to 
10 
play – come into play there? 
MS DANIELS:  Not – not really. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I want you to help us understand. 
MS DANIELS:  Ja.  Not really Mr Chairman because the 
basis for the – the basis for the submission was there is a 
supply issue and that Eskom would be the only qualified 
entity to say there is a supply issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So this document is sent to 
Regiments on the 8t h remember you said you would have 
sent the document to the board members on that day for a 
20 
Round Robin resolution the next day.  I do not know how 
much of 
verification 
– 
how 
much is 
required in the 
verification process? 
MS DANIELS:  Well given the time came near Mr Chairman 
there would have been not much that they could do. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 87 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So let us – let us move on.  I see 
on page 469 this – at the top of the page – at the bottom is 
the same emails we have read – at the top you get Boitumelo 
Mapasa which is the one at Regiments on the 8 December 
2015 and she sends the email to Eric Wood and cc’d 
Mohammed Bobat.  Did you know these persons and – sorry 
just before you answer it seems to be forwarding version 3 of 
the document received from Polly.  You see that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know Mr Eric Wood and 
10 
Mohammed Bobat? 
MS DANIELS:  No I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know them after this transaction? 
MS DANIELS:  I met Mr Eric Wood as I testified the last time 
Mr Chairman at Mr Essa’s offices where he introduced 
himself.  Mohammed Bobat I think I met at one of the COCTA 
Round Tables that we had with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Turn to page 474.  There is another email 
there.  474 you see that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I see that. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Mr Mohammed Bobat Tuesday 8 
December 2015 at 12:28 and it is sent to Fahima Badat that 
is the version 3 on the face of it.  As it appears did you know 
Fahima Badat? 
MS DANIELS:  No I did not. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 88 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Anytime thereafter? 
MS DANIELS:  No I did not meet her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you do not know this person at all? 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You would not know in which company 
she is? 
MS DANIELS:  No I do not, not from here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You turn that page then there is an 
executive summary which on the face of it would have been 
what was being exchanged and it has some track changes 
10 
from track changes and one of which is on page 478 and 
there is a comment there against paragraph 4.  The comment 
says: 
“Looks like he wants this out”  
Paragraph 4 which says  
“Other approvals require the Public Finance 
Management Act.” 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I can see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that.  So whoever included this 
comment here seems to have known what Businessman 
20 
wanted. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is what it looks like. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And on page 480 please identify the 
document? 
MS DANIELS:  It is an email from Fahima Badat to Anoj 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 89 of 249 
 
Singh and copying Eric Wood and Mohammed Bobat and 
here it says: 
“Subject 2015 RRR Optimum Coal Mine Pty 
Limited final.” 
And it reads: 
“Dear Anoj, please find the Optimum Coal 
Mine board memo.  Thank you, Regards 
Fahima Badat.” 
And this looks like a Regiments signature – Regiments 
Capital signature. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that 15:28 – twenty eight minutes past 
three and it was sent to them from Polly the Executive 
Assistant of Mr Anoj Singh on the same date at 11:03 am – 
three minutes past eleven.  Just before half past three they 
send back the document and they say it is final.  You then 
get it from Mr Koko signed by him – well he first sends it to 
Mr Singh. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes he does. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 486.  Just shortly after that 3:57 
pm.  Then the board makes a decision on this. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well it has… 
MS DANIELS:  The next day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I may have lost you Mr Seleka. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 90 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page are you now with the board – 
whether the board made a decision – what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh the page for the board decision.  I 
have not reached there yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I thought  maybe you were at that 
page ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No you are – you are on track Chair.  Ms 
Singh – Ms Daniels – I beg your pardon.  You then – do we 
have your email to the board?  But anyway you send this 
submission to the board.  It seems to be in the evening of 
the 8 December because only at 16:44 – oh sorry at 16:41 
when does it come to you?  It comes to you… 
MS DANIELS:  It comes to me at  
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 16::40. 
MS DANIELS:  16:40. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that 486? 
MS DANIELS:  And then 16: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 91 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that at 486? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 486 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email from Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It comes to you and then at 492 – at 492 
you get the one signed.  What are you – what is this – what 
is that email at page 492? 
MS DANIELS:  492 is the signed document by Mr Singh with 
the covering email by Ms Barnard from his office which says: 
10 
“Hello Suzanne can you please assist with 
the Round Robin to the board?  Kind Regards 
Maya.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well is this not the first time you are 
getting a request for a Round Robin by the board? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct. For the board not the .. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not for the IFC. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Oh I see the difference. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the document has now changed 
from IFC to the board. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Businessman said I want it to 
be submitted to the board. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 92 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not IFC. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It comes from Maya Barnard.  Please tell 
the Chairperson who is she? 
MS DANIELS:  Maya Barnard was the General Manager in 
the office of the Chief Financial Officer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of Mr Anoj Singh. 
MS DANIELS:  Of Mr Anoj Singh yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this is now the final signed 
10 
document? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you are being asked to assist with a 
Round Robin to the board. 
MS DANIELS:  To the board that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now on page 498 we see that same email 
from Ms Barnard – Maya Barnard but then at the top of the 
page is your email.  On the 8 December 16:44 you write the 
email to Ms Maya Barnard to Mr Anoj Singh but I think you 
just replied to all of them because they are all in her email. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I replied to all and asked if the Chairman 
has been notified or do I have to request him to allow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh.  Now explain this because I thought 
the Chairperson had asked you to convene – to assist in the 
drafting and to convene a board meeting on the 7t h the day 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 93 of 249 
 
before? 
MS DANIELS:  But – yes he did ask for a meeting.  This is 
different because it is Round Robin so I just wanted to make 
it sure and all along we had been doing a Round Robin to 
the IFC now we doing a board submission.  A full board 
submission rather than a board sub-committee submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So was there a response to your email?  
I see you have turned the page to 499.   
MS DANIELS:  I think... 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  I think Ms Barnard and I spoke Mr Chairman 
rather than emailed given the time of the day and then I see 
Mr Singh did respond: 
“Please ensure that attachments referred to in the memo are 
also circulated.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but he is not answering your 
question? 
MS DANIELS:  No, no that is why I am saying I think that Ms 
Barnard and I spoke. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You think you would have had a 
20 
telephone. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Talk with her.  So thereafter you have 
sent that to the board? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I did.  I am just not sure of the time.  But 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 94 of 249 
 
if you – ah here it is.  If you go to page 524 Mr Chairman.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  524.   
MS DANIELS:  I sent it out at – on Tuesday evening at 
17:52. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is an email Tuesday 8 December 
2015 at 17:52 well that is eight minutes before six.  And it is 
sent to board members.  Subject is Urgent Request to 
approve the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Pty 
Ltd. 
“Good evening board members, the Chairman 
10 
of 
the 
board 
hereby 
requests 
that 
you 
consider the attached submission together 
with the attachments included in this email 
for your approval [00:24:09] non-approval.  
Kindly forward your signed resolutions by 
12:00 tomorrow 9 December 2015 to the 
office of the Company Secretary.” 
So we are on the 7t h today – the 7 December 2020.  This is 
the anniversary of these exchanges here five years later.  
And did you get the approval from the board members? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I did Mr Chairman.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you did say Ms Verushni Naidoo 
raised a concern – well not a concern said:  I am approving 
but wanted the matter to be referred to IFC. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes she did. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 95 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was that done? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I did so.  I then convened a meeting for 
8:30 on the 9 December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 9 December you convened an IFC 
meeting? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So when would they have been notified 
that there should be a meeting? 
MS DANIELS:  I called them immediately after Ms Verushni 
Naidoo’s email because I think it was on the same – it was in 
10 
the same time period.  Later in the evening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 8t h? 
MS DANIELS:  On the 8t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see there are emails on page 537.   
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chairman if you look at 5 – actually 
545 Mr Verushni Naidoo responded at 6:30 in the evening.  
Oh no sorry I have got [00:26:10]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you say 545? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No my apologies I got the sequence 
incorrect. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I have referred you to 537 – 537. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she has mentioned quite a few 
pages.  545 was one of them is it not? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes okay.  Mr Seleka is referring me to 537 
which is much easier. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 96 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So should we go to 537? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  I think it is a duplication of the 
documentation later on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it a duplication?  Ja you can pick up 
the sequence – let us see – okay are you looking for the 
email where you notifying the IFC members? 
MS DANIELS:  No your question was about Mr Verushni 
Naidoo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Questioning so she sent an email that 
10 
evening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I think it was the page you had 
referred the Chairperson to. 
MS DANIELS:  Oh was I correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  My apologies – my apologies Mr Chair it is 
just a lot of documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so that was page – well I see it on 
page 4 – I mean 549. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 549 where she writes to you 8 
December at 19:30 it says: 
“Hi I confirm my support the Round Robin kindly 
ensure  
1. All governance issues are complied with in 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 97 of 249 
 
the PFMA and other statutory regulations as 
they will require consent from DPE that IFC 
committee 
has 
approved 
the 
purchase.  
Session contracts are in place for the coal.” 
2. So two is the one that IFC committee has 
approved the purchase.  Do you still need 
me to sign the document?  I do not have 
access 
to 
a 
printer 
just 
now. 
Regards 
Verushni” 
Is that the email you were looking for? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  That is the email I referred to Mr Chairman 
and this is what I then used to convene the meeting the next 
morning at 8:30.  I called the – the board members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just one point before I move on.  Was it 
your email where you asked is the Chairperson aware of this 
to Mr Singh and Mr Koko and Boitumelo.  But then you when 
you send an email to the board members you say: 
“It is the Chairperson’s request.” 
Is it because you knew the Chairperson had now agreed that 
that is the route to follow? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I would have phoned him in between. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  The reason I am asking you that is 
because you saw in his affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This morning he says you convened that 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 98 of 249 
 
meeting. 
MS DANIELS:  No I would not have convened the meeting 
out of my own volition.  But because it was a Round Robin 
Mr Chair I would have phoned him and said this is now a 
Round Robin you had asked for the meeting may I go ahead? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So on page 550 Kassiem or Kasim.  I 
think you have referred to this earlier.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did.   
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
And 
it 
was 
also 
on 
the 
8t h of December 2015 at 21:28. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Twenty-eight minutes past nine.  And 
she is writing to you and Mr Anoj, asking questions there.  
You say these questions were answered? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, they were answered.  I see we do have 
the emails with the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 552. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   552. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is where I am.  They came the next 
20 
morning and I then forwarded this to Ms Kasim.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, is this – is this email – because you 
need to identify it first – is this email an answer to 
Ms Kasim? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, this is the answer.  On 552, this would 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 99 of 249 
 
be the answer to Ms Kasim’s questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it comes on the 9t h of December at 
nine minutes past nine.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When did IFC meet? 
MS DANIELS:   At 08:30 the morning on the 9 t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And for how long did they meet? 
MS DANIELS:   I think that meeting was about half an hour. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And how did the meeting take place? 
MS DANIELS:   It was a telephonic meeting. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the meeting was no in person? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it was not in person.  It was a telephone 
conference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did anyone of them complain about the 
short notice, extremely short notice given? 
MS DANIELS:   No, there were no complaints. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who are the members of IFC? 
MS DANIELS:   The members were Mark Pamensky who 
recused himself because he was the Director of Oakbay.  
Mr Pat Naidoo, Ms Venete Klein and I think Mr Khosa.  
20 
Mr Zethemba Khosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Did you arrange the telephone 
conference? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did arrange the telephone conference. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now the outcome – just give me the time 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 100 of 249 
 
again.  Date? 
MS DANIELS:   I think it was at 08:30. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So this – if you took about 30-
minutes, these answers would have come after the fact. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The outcome of IFC, what was it? 
MS DANIELS:   The outcome of the IFC meeting was 
recommend approval to the board, to approve the pre-
purchase of Optimum Coal.  I mean, the pre-purchase 
payment to Optimum Coal Mine.  My apologies for... 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did you keep the minutes of IFC? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us see.  Turn to page 584.  Or 582.  
It seems to be the same thing.  Let us see.  You will tell me.  
Page 582 has a watermark Draft on it and then there is 584.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you look at the two – the documents 
on those two pages? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the one is the draft minute that I sent 
out and then the...  My apologies.  Page 582 is the draft that 
I sent out and 584 would be the minutes approved as signed 
off by the chairperson of that meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So I see that then...  Ja, the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 101 of 249 
 
meeting, 9 December 2015 and at 08:30.  And it ended, page 
586, closure. 
“There will be no further issues.  The chairman 
thanked all for attendance” 
 
And the proceedings ended at 09:00. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So they have approved...  Anything more 
on this IFC outcome? 
MS DANIELS:   There was only that motivation that I include 
in my – the salient points in my affidavit about Mr Naidoo 
10 
who is the chairman of the meeting, setting out the reasons 
for the motivation for approving the recommendation to the 
board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you say it is in your affidavit? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us see.  Chairperson, it is on page 
286.  Page 286.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You found it Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say the salient points.  Anything of 
significance 
here 
you 
wish 
to 
draw 
to 
Chairperson’s 
attention?  Sorry, the document, just for purposes of 
identification is dated 9 December 2015.  Eskom Board of 
Directors, IFC proceedings, December 2015.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 102 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The title is:  Round-Robin Resolution.  
Title of submission:  Pre-purchase of coal from OCM.  At the 
bottom end is:  Thank you.  And the name appears there:  
Chad Naidoo.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I think the most salient point 
for me the business case for pre-purchase of coal which is 
paragraph 3 on page 286 where it says: 
10 
“The business case for pre-purchase of coal for both 
Hendrina and Amot to be robust and strong, the 
cash flows are managed and absorbed by good 
industry 
management 
of 
stockpiles, 
to 
reduce 
holding days so there is no risk to electricity 
production and the profitability of the proposal is 
noted.  The actual gain should be ring fenced and 
reported when it is realised.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which paragraph number were you 
reading from? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   I was reading from paragraph number three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Number three.  Well, let me read this 
document Chair very quickly.  The document says: 
“Resolution as submitted is supported and approved. 
Salient points from noting and highlighted in yellow 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 103 of 249 
 
on the attached submission document: 
1. OCM and the Companies Act, the BOD...” 
 
Well, I suppose that is the Board of Directors? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“...approved and will support and allow OCM to 
migrate from the status of business rescue to that of 
a growing concern.” 
 
Now OCM here cannot be Tegeta.   
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because Tegeta is under business 
rescue. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“...to migrate on the status of business rescue to 
that of a growing concern. 
Their full rights, responsibilities and accountabilities 
will be as per the Companies Act. 
20 
They plan to use the pre-purchase proceeds to 
address their now liability and liquidity challenges. 
This will be a positive development, both for OCM 
and for Eskom, which will address the present day 
contractual obligations and create a platform for the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 104 of 249 
 
future sustainability of mutual trade, business and 
job continuity for fellow South Africans. 
2. 
Despite 
of 
the 
proposed 
solution, 
OCM 
undertakes 
to 
increase 
their 
transformation 
accountability and responsibility from 30% to 51% 
ownership.  This is a positive development.  It is 
noted and acknowledged.” 
 
And I will leave three which I have read.  Paragraph 4 
says: 
“4. 
The 
positive 
outcome 
from 
the 
joint 
10 
management solution of Eskom and OCM is noted 
and acknowledged as a national achievement. 
It allows for business continuity and security of jobs, 
the 
security 
of 
electricity 
production 
and 
two 
national key-point power stations, Hendrina and 
Amot.  I am sure South Africa and customers will 
send their appreciation and all our customers. 
5. 
A further recommendation is that the chairman 
of 
Eskom 
and 
chairman 
of 
Glencore 
jointly 
communicate its achievement to South Africa and 
20 
the international community. 
Thank you.  Pat Naidoo.” 
 
Now Glencore is not Tegeta? 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Glencore was the owner of Optimum 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 105 of 249 
 
Coal Holdings. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which was a holding company of 
Optimum Coal Mine. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you see this note? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this note related to Glencore? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Optimum? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in the mind of IFC, this resolution for 
the prepayment of coal was in relation to Optimum? 
MS DANIELS:   To Optimum Coal Mines, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And not Tegeta? 
MS DANIELS:   Not Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the board see this? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did send it to the board subsequently. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I have seen the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee, Ms Viroshini Naidoo says she never 
20 
received the IFC outcome from you. 
MS DANIELS:   No, I would have sent it out because she 
specifically asked for it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She specifically asked for it? 
MS DANIELS:   I mean, she specifically asked for the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 106 of 249 
 
meeting.  So I would have sent the minutes of the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Ms Daniels, this meeting of IFC 
ends at nine ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Nine o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   09:00.  When do you receive...  Well, 
there are two questions in my mind.  One is, when did you 
send to the board?  You had sent to the board...  Ja, on the 
8t h. 
MS DANIELS:   On the 8 t h in the...  On the 8t h in the evening 
Mr Chairman. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then there was Ms Naidoo saying:  
Let IFC look at this. 
MS DANIELS:   Let IFC look at this.  I convened that 
meeting.  The documents had already gone out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when...  Or you want to answer first?  
Let me give you a chance to answer. 
MS DANIELS:   So I sent out the draft minutes immediately 
because I was typing as we were talking and I sent – it 
20 
would have probably would have been within the hour of the 
9t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Now, can you recall?  When do you 
receive a response from the board members in regard to this 
particular submission?  And I am now talking now the date 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 107 of 249 
 
and the time.  
MS DANIELS:   Well, effectively, Mr Chairman, the approval 
started arriving on the evening of the 8 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, I am missing there? 
MS DANIELS:   I said, effectively, the approval started 
arriving on the evening of the 8t h because the first approval 
was actually from Ms Naidoo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, the one where she approves 
herself? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That is on the 8t h? 
MS DANIELS:   On the 8t h, in the evening.  And then, I think, 
Dr Ngubane on the morning ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 571. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then if she approved and she asked 
that it be considered by IFC, it would have been a formality 
for her to receive if the outcome from IFC? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because she has already registered their 
20 
approval. 
MS DANIELS:   She has already registered the approval.  I 
see that Dr Ngubane sent his approval at 08:34. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 9t h? 
MS DANIELS:   On the 9t h, yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 108 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the day thereafter, after the 8t h. 
MS DANIELS:   And actually, Dr Naidoo also approved the 
resolution on the 8t h of December at 22:56. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, that is page 569. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he approves four minutes before 
eleven at night.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane sends his approval at 08:34 
the next morning.   
10 
MS DANIELS:   That ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   IFC is in session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Did you say his approval is at 
569? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His is at page 571. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Thanks.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The one at 569 is Dr Pat Naidoo’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And then the one of Mr Romeo 
Khumalo. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   That is at 572 Mr Chairman and that is 
approved at 09:05. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page 572.  Did Ms Pat Naidoo also 
approved this? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is what I said to you, Dr 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 109 of 249 
 
Naidoo...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.  Sorry.  Mr Mark Pamensky. 
MS DANIELS:   No, Mr Mark Pamensky recused himself 
because he was a director of Oakbay at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So even at board level, he did not take 
part in the voting? 
MS DANIELS:   No, he did not take part in the voting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the approval. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then by the time IFC is...  Well, I do 
10 
not know whether they deliberated on this.  They are busy in 
a tender conference and the chairperson is Mr Pat Naidoo 
because Mr Mark Pamensky has excused himself.  Mr Pat 
Naidoo has already sent you his approval the night before.  
He is chairing IFC the next morning but the decision is 
already made. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So what happens to this 
R 1.68 billion? 
MS DANIELS:   It then becomes...  It was approved in the 
20 
first... It first was approved by all the members and it then...  
I am not sure how it happened Mr Chairman but it then 
became a guarantee discussion.  The approval was for 
prepayment of cash payment to OCM.  And then the 
discussions on the 10t h, started around converting this into a 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 110 of 249 
 
guarantee.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Just before that conversion.  What 
did the board decide on the execution of its decision to 
prepay OCM and Dr Pat Naidoo suggesting, let us do a joint 
statement.  Chairman of Eskom and chairman of Glencore.  
How is that – or was that executed? 
MS DANIELS:   No, the joint statement was not executed 
Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what did the board decide on the 
execution of the prepayment? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   The prepayment was approved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was...? 
MS DANIELS:   Approved.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  How did they execute it now? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, that was left up to the Chief Financial 
Officer, the delegation.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, what was the board resolution?  
Maybe I should ask you that. 
MS DANIELS:   It was approval of...  I just need to get it.  So 
it was...   
20 
“The Group Chief Executive together with the Group 
Executive for Generation and Chief Financial Officer 
are hereby authorised to negotiate and conclude the 
pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed 
owners of Optimum Coal, OCM.” 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 111 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Give us the page number, please? 
MS DANIELS:   This is...  I am reading from page 577. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   577.  Thank you. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
“The agreement shall be subject to the necessary 
regulatory approval having been obtained by Eskom 
and 
the 
supplier, 
respectively, 
as 
and 
when 
necessary. 
The Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorised to 
take all the necessary steps to give effect to the 
10 
above including the signing of any consents or any 
other documentation necessary or related thereto.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So was that done? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that was done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is to execute on the prepayment? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does this not execute on the 
prepayment? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am asking whether that execution 
20 
was done?  Was the prepayment made? 
MS DANIELS:   No, the prepayment in cash was not made. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what happened? 
MS DANIELS:   Then the cash payment was converted to the 
issuing of a guarantee, the performance guarantee in favour 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 112 of 249 
 
of Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know who did that? 
MS DANIELS:   That was at the instruction of Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the instruction of...? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Singh.  Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Singh, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did he instruct you? 
MS DANIELS:   No, this was via the Group Treasury 
Department in Eskom.  There was a memorandum prepared.  
I am not sure how the conversation went Mr Chair.   
10 
 
But there was – I was copied in on subsequent emails 
and you now started having to monitor what was happening.   
 
There was a memo in which Ms Henry motivated, that it 
was safer to do a guarantee than a cash payment.  And this 
was approved by Mr Singh on the 10t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is exactly the next day? 
MS DANIELS:   The very next day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did that, what do you call it, conversion 
for a lack of a better word, from a cash to a guarantee go 
back to the board? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   It all went back to the board in ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, did it go back to the board on the 
9t h? 
MS DANIELS:   No, it did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you wanted to say, it went to the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 113 of 249 
 
board, when? 
MS DANIELS:   In 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the significance of converting it 
from – converting from cash to guarantee as you understood 
it, if you do understand it? 
MS DANIELS:   In my understanding, it was better risk 
management for Eskom to – effectively, it would have been 
giving cash to a supplier.  So from a risk management 
perspective and from a cost perspective, this was a better 
option. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was it not interesting that that 
conversion was thought of at the level of execution as 
oppose to the level of the decision being taken by the board?  
Nobody in the board thought:  Let us rather a guarantee 
rather than cash.  This came out later on, on the instance of 
Mr Singh. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, there was very little question at board 
level Mr Chairman.  I mean, other than the two ladies who 
asked questions about, you know, the coal pricing and the 
financial constructions, there was really no discussion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was the board that was appointed 
at the same here, is that right?  In March ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   This is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
same 
board 
that 
suspended 
executives? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 114 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the chair had been appointed...  
What, December? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   December ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   December 2014. 
MS DANIELS:   27... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   I refer to this, the Ngubane Board in my... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   I referred to it as the Ngubane Board in my 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, the guarantee – the cash is 
converted into a guarantee.  And I hear you venture an 
answer about the safety relative to that but the question is.  
In whose favour was the guarantee issued? 
MS DANIELS:   As I said, the guarantee was issued in favour 
of Tegeta Exploration in 2015 and not Optimum Coal Mines. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also, is the position not that once the 
guarantee has been put in place, has been secured?  You 
cannot undo it or can you undo it?   
 
In other words, if you discover something and say:  No, 
no, no.  We should not have agreed to this, or whatever.  It 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 115 of 249 
 
is too late.   
 
In other words, is your earlier answer actually correct?  
If you give cash or give a guarantee, can you stop the bank 
after you issued the guarantee from actually paying out? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, there was an underlying 
clause by agreement that was put in place, that had to be – 
there were suspensive conditions in that agreement.  But 
from the guarantee perspective.   
 
So those – there were performance – the guarantee is in 
the 
bundle 
of 
documents 
– 
but 
there 
were 
certain 
10 
performance related, terms and conditions in that guarantee.   
 
You will hear that it was, you know, that it expired on the 
31s t of March.  So there was a measure of...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was subject to some conditions? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So it would be paid if certain 
conditions ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Conditions were met.  But those conditions 
were not met. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Daniels, which underlying 
agreement is that?  Which are the parties to the agreement? 
MS DANIELS:   That is Tegeta and Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  But does it matter?  Because the 
approval of the prepayment is made in relation to Glencore 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 116 of 249 
 
and OCM.   
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The guarantee which piggy backs on the 
approval is suddenly made in favour of Tegeta. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now go back to the first resolution which 
relates to the prepayment before OCM. 
MS DANIELS:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is the underlying agreement 
between Tegeta and Eskom matter for that decision. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   No, not for the purposes of the decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is why...  You want to carry on? 
MS DANIELS:   I just want to say, not for the purpose of the 
decision.  You know, it was really ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   It did not matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So if it does not matter, it makes 
everything about the guarantee irrelevant.  Irrelevant to the 
decision made by IFC and the by the board on the 
9t h of December 2015. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That guarantee is irrelevant. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not made by the board.  It not made 
by Eskom.  It is made by Mr Anoj Singh. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 117 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he is making it in favour of a 
completely different entity. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, that guarantee is on page 
599. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the entity in favour of whom the 
guarantee was made if from the entity which was going to 
get cash before the guarantee was introduced? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was Mr Chairman because the 
10 
guarantee is in favour of Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   And the prepayment of cash was to Optimum 
Coal Mines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So it is a completely different thing. 
MS DANIELS:   Completely different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not mandated by the board? 
MS DANIELS:   No.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then this guarantee would have been 
20 
given for an ulterior motive or purpose. 
MS DANIELS:   That is the only conclusion that one can 
draw, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, we have learnt from the evidence 
that the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, that it would 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 118 of 249 
 
have been issued to assist Tegeta to show that it has the 
money to pay for the price, by the purchase price of OCM. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It...  Did you know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This is a few months after Mr Anoj Singh 
has joined Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   The...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He has not even finished the year. 
10 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
His 
appointment, 
his 
permanent 
appointment was only confirmed in October 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is he not effective 1 August 2015?  I 
think it is effective 1 August 2015.  I am not sure. 
MS DANIELS:   I just remember …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He acted first.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He acted for some time. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was appointed. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I just remember …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   When Brian Molefe started, joined in 
April 2015 and acted as Group CEO.  Mr Singh came 
about, what, three months after that, two months, three 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 119 of 249 
 
months to act. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is seconded to act effective 1 
August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1 August, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this is August.  September, 
October, November, in December this is what is happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In that six – that’s three months, ja, a 
little over three months now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And before he arrives who was acting as 
10 
Financial Director, was it Ms Dlamini? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Nonkululeko Veleti. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Veleti?. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, Chair.  Is that correct, Ms 
Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I am just not sure if she resigned at 
some point, but… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I cannot recall exactly when. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   I cannot recall exactly when she resigned, 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   But she resigned in that year. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 120 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   But I remember that I completed the 
appointment of directorship forms and things like that in 
October of 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is [indistinct] 01.52 because 
we have done – the 1.6 billion prepayment approval which 
is taken on short notice, the next day is converted into a 
guarantee by the CFO, all on his own, and in favour of a 
different entity than the one contemplated in the previous 
board decision.  Then there is the prepayment of 659 
million, I believe that is the next thing you deal with in your 
10 
affidavit.  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is common cause the board 
made that decision, Ms Daniels, I think you have – your 
part is relating to the Chairperson, to the Commission, the 
role played in the build-up to the making of that decision 
because it also starts with the submission and now we are 
on – we are now in April 2016 and you can tell the 
Chairperson briefly what happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From which page in her affidavit does 
20 
she deal with that topic? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is from page 255, through the 
whole 
file. 
 
Chair, 
while 
Ms 
Daniels 
goes 
there 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got it. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 121 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  There is an affidavit recently 
submitted to the Commission by Mr Pierce Marsden who 
was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we do that, go there, we deal 
with that, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the guarantee… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have we reached the end of that part? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have, I have. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I just wanted to read a portion from his 
affidavit which relates to the statement made in Dr 
Ramontja’s letter about the rehabilitation – well, it is 
actually made in his affidavit about rehabilitation. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  And he says: 
“The 
business 
rescue 
practitioners 
were 
never 
engaged by Tegeta by the prepayment or about the 
guarantee that Eskom issued in favour of Tegeta for 
R1.68 billion for purposes of supplying coal.  I do 
20 
not know what the 1.7 billion contained in the DMR 
letter is reference to.  The reference is not a 
reference to the amount owing to the creditors of 
OCH 
and/or 
OCM 
nor 
to 
the 
funds 
held 
for 
rehabilitation purposes and nor for any capital 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 122 of 249 
 
expenditure.” 
That is just what wanted to place on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, yes, I had asked a 
question, we are going now into the prepayment of the 560 
– no, 659 million. 
MS DANIELS:   659 million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Beg your pardon.  Again you were 
asked to do a submission. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman, I was approached by Ms 
10 
Nteta who was the Acting General Manager Field Sourcing 
and she asked for assistance – she needed to get a 
submission to the board tender committee.  So this was 
around about the 8 April, it was the – I think it was a 
Friday and I said to her, the board tender committee is 
sitting on the 13 April and if you needed to get a 
submission in, you know, you need to get it very quickly.  I 
had just done a pack of late submissions so I was saying 
to her listen, please hurry up if you want to get to that 
meeting.   
20 
We – she asked for my assistance and we worked 
together.  By the Monday she had - you know, we had this 
skeleton of a submission.  Mr Mabelane then also asked for 
assistance to get it done. 
The understanding at that point was that this is 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 123 of 249 
 
going to the meeting of the 13 April, which was the 
Wednesday and this was about – there was a coal shortage 
at Arnot and that they needed to – the procurement 
processes were not getting done in time and they needed 
to secure coal.  So that was the basis on which we worked. 
Late the Monday afternoon I had left the office and I 
still did not have the submission so I was a bit nervous 
because having such late submissions to the board tender 
committee I would always bear the brunt no matter if it was 
the executive’s fault, the company secretary also got the 
10 
tongue lashing in the meeting. 
It was then only later that Mr Khoza, who was the 
board tender committee Chairperson, phoned me, that was 
around 7.30 in the evening and he said to me that we 
needed to convene a meeting that evening and I asked him 
what was this about because, you know, we have a meeting 
48 hours, can it not wait until then?  He said it was about 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, the meeting was meant to be 
when? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   The 13 April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 13 t h? 
MS DANIELS:   13 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three zero. 
MS DANIELS:   One three. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 124 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   One three, yes.  And Mr Khoza was 
phoning you on what date?   
MS DANIELS:   On the 11 April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 11 t h. 
MS DANIELS:   And this is in the evening of the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The meeting on the 13 t h was going 
to be a meeting of the board tender committee. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair.  So this was 
not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now he wanted you to convene a 
10 
meeting of the same committee on the evening of the same 
day on which he called you. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely the 11 t h. 
MS DANIELS:   The 11 t h and it is already 7.30 p.m. in the 
evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And this meeting that he wanted 
you to call, was it going to take the place of the meeting on 
the 13 t h or was it going to be an additional meeting?  So 
there were going to be two meeting, in other words or not? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   This was an additional meeting, a special 
meeting, as we called them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   And this would be to just consider one 
particular topic. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 125 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   He said to me that there was an emergency 
- you know, that there was an emergency at Arnot Power 
Station and that this is why this meeting was now urgent.  
When I said we have 48 hours to the next meeting, it can 
wait. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so he wanted the meeting of the 11 t h 
to deal with what? 
MS DANIELS:   There was emergency supplies at Arnot 
Power Station, once again a security of supply issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And he said the operational people told 
him that it was urgent.  At the time I did not have any 
document yet and I then called Mr Mabelane, who was the 
official responsible and I received a submission and it was 
closer to 8 p.m. in the evening when I got that and with the 
request because I asked him to give me a reason to 
convene a meeting.  So it was to discuss the emergency 
supply at Arnot Power Station. 
 
So when I called all the board members – the BTC 
20 
members.  These were Mr Khoza, Ms Naidoo, Ms Carrim 
and Ms Mabude and they all indicated that they were 
available, full meeting.  I sent out the documentation and I 
convened the meeting – I think it was nine o’clock that 
evening.  Ms Mabude was the only one who indicated that 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 126 of 249 
 
she will be a bit late for the meeting but she attended.  I 
sent. 
 
I sent out the submission documents once received 
from Mr Mabelane.  There were once again questions from 
Ms 
Naidoo, 
Viroshnee 
Naidoo, 
which 
I 
sent 
to 
the 
executives and said look, these are the questions that you 
are going to need to answer.  The meeting went ahead at 
nine o’clock …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, one second.  Mr Seleka, we are at 
three minutes past four.  Let us take an adjournment, we 
10 
can continue, and if that is fine with everybody, maybe 
until about quarter to five or thereabouts and then I will be 
ready to start the evening session. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With – for another witness.  So let us 
take a short adjournment now of ten minutes.  Let us 
resume at quarter past. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is in order, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   Ms Daniels there’s 
a question which I recall I needed to ask you and that is in 
regard to the guarantee.  Remember the guarantee is made 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 127 of 249 
 
on the 10 t h of December 2015.  Do you know how 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  Positively Mr Chair I do remember, I nodded 
my head, my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was there any agreement in writing 
between Eskom and Tegeta relative to the guarantee? 
MS DANIELS:   As I said Mr Chairperson the underlying 
agreement that we were working on was a co-supply 
agreement, which was supposed to be between the three 
10 
batches of coal from Optimum Coal, so that was the 
agreement that we were attempting to put in place at the 
time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay when you say underlying you 
mean 
the 
guarantee 
would 
have 
been 
issued 
in 
contemplation of that agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or on the strength of that agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or on the strength of it.  
MS DANIELS:   I think on the strength of that agreement is 
a better way to put it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now did you take part in the drafting of 
that agreement? 
MS DANIELS:   We – yes I did, I engaged the services of 
Cliff Dekker Hofmeyr to assist, I think we received a 
suggested 
two-pagers 
from 
the 
Primary 
Energy 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 128 of 249 
 
Department, I am not quite sure how it happened, but there 
was a two pager agreement in place that we went through. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who, who asked you to draft the 
agreement? 
MS DANIELS:   As I said Mr Chairman I can’t remember 
how exactly that came about.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, on page 7, 73, page 7, 73. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There are emails there, can you just 
quickly identify them to the Chairperson.   From bottom up. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   There is an email Mr Chairman from myself 
to Mr Anoj Singh and it says letter agreement to get an 
Eskom execution copy, and then I say: 
“Hi Anoj, 
Herewith the agreement as amended. 
Regards, 
Suzanne” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, well is that the agreement on 
page 774. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, this is the agreement on 774. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It runs up to page 776, it is unsigned 
so that is a draft. 
MS DANIELS:   It is a draft yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Anoj, the email above yours? 
MS DANIELS:   The email above mine is from Mr Anoj 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 129 of 249 
 
Singh to Mr Eric Wood, and he forwards the agreement as 
is to Mr Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is on 10 December 2015 at 4:26, 
twenty six minutes past four. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then there is an email above? 
MS DANIELS:   There is an email there in reply from Mr 
Eric Wood to Mr Singh which says: 
 
“Any luck with the guarantee draft. 
 
Regards” 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that email is on the 10 t h December 
as well at 16:42, and the subject line is letter, agreement 
Tegeta Eskom execution copy.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now what was the time, I said 16:42, 
it’s twenty to five, late afternoon, then please turn to page 
724.   
MS DANIELS:    Can I have it again Mr Seleka please, I 
didn’t hear it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   724.  Are you there? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please identify the document. 
MS DANIELS:   It is an email from Businessman to 
Matshela2010 and there’s a two pager between, the subject 
is two pager, the body of the email says: 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 130 of 249 
 
“Two pager between Tegeta and Eskom salient 
points.  Eskom will provide bank guarantee for 
1.68billion.   CP for release and Section 11 
approval 
from 
DMR 
Competitions 
Commission 
approval.  Tegeta will supply from OCM as the 
contract but for the 12 months prepayment January 
2016 to January 2017 will give a 5% discount off 
the 154.   Tegeta will supply from Koornfontein as 
per contract for the same period at the original 380, 
not the requested increased tariff.  At the end of 
10 
each month starting end February 2016 Eskom shall 
deduct 140million from amounts due to recoup the 
1.68billion.  Tegeta receiving prepayment for two 
months supply but Eskom can use monies owed 
from all three mines, Brakfontein to recoup the 
140million a month.  Therefore if Tegeta does not 
deliver full volume from OCM to Kroon the payments 
due for Brakfontein can be clawed.   Any amounts 
due over the R140million for each month shall be 
payable to Tegeta.  Two pager almost as addendum 
20 
to the supply contracts.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes this email is on the 10 t h of 
December 2015, and it is at fifteen minutes past twelve, 
after midnight, is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That’s what it looks like and then it is sent 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 131 of 249 
 
to me at 7.31. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, that is what is confusing me 
because it is 10 December 2015 at just after half past 
seven sent to you, that will be 10 December in the 
morning.  
MS DANIELS:    But I think this is – if you look at the time 
it is GMT+2, so it might be different time zones, that could 
be the explanation I think.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so this is an email from 
Businessman 
to 
Matshela 
email 
address 
2010, 
10 
Matshela2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is not his Eskom email address 
hey? 
MS DANIELS:   No that is not his Eskom email address Mr 
Chairman but that is his personal yahoo address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Email address.   Yes but did you know it 
to be his personal email address or you are just saying 
because it has got his name?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I know that it is his personal email 
address. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is an email above from 
Matshela2010@yahoo.com sent to you, Suzanne Daniels, 
forwarding the two pager. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 132 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you know that you know that you 
received this from Mr Koko? 
MS DANIELS:   I don’t recall the email specifically Mr 
Chairman but yes it has my name on it so I accept that it 
was sent to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So would this have preceded the 
drafting of the coal supply agreement, what you have 
referred to as the underlying agreement?  
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure about the timing, this seems 
to be at 7.31 in the morning, I do recall that I had 
10 
instructed Mr – Cliff Dekker Hofmeyr on that day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just turn the page to 725, see whether 
that doesn’t relate to what you are talking about. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes it does because it is the 10 t h 
December 8.42, I speak to Rochelle Moodley about the 
Optimum Eskom fee purchase. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So what were you asking there? 
MS DANIELS:   Here I ask please call me, I need your 
assistance 
in 
drafting 
this 
agreement, 
urgent 
time 
pressure, I need the draft by twelve o’clock. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I see that the attachments is 
instruction two pager between Tegeta and Eskom, which 
seems to be similar to the emails on the previous page 
which also is the subject of a two-pager. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 133 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So does it mean that Businessman 
would have attached a document to his email address, 
which is two-pager, forwarded to your by Mr Matshela 
Koko, which then gets forwarded further to CDH, Mr 
Rishaban Moodley of CDH.   Is that what is happening 
here? 
MS DANIELS:    I think that is what it would mean Mr 
Chairman, I can’t remember precisely, it is five years ago, 
but I did send if these attachments were there then I did 
send them.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And if one looks at the body of the 
email – well I don’t, maybe he didn’t attach anything, 
Businessman on page 724, if you look at the body of his 
email he says two-pager between Tegeta and Eskom 
salient points, Eskom will provide bank guarantee for 
R1.68billion.  This is Businessman and then he writes CP – 
what does CP stand for, CP for release is? 
MS DANIELS:   Condition Precedent. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay condition precedent for release 
is one, Section 11 approval from DMR, two Competition 
20 
Commission approval.  Now let’s pause there for a 
moment, let’s go to page 726.  Could that have been the 
document annexed to your email to Mr Moodley of CDH? 
MS DANIELS:   That could be Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it says ...[intervenes]  
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 134 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it looks like Businessman instructs 
Mr Matshela Koko and Mr Matshela Koko instructs you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you send it to the attorneys, I need 
your assistance in drafting this agreement, so page 726 
says two-pager between Tegeta and Eskom, salient points.  
That’s exactly what Businessman wrote, two pager between 
Tegeta and Eskom salient points.   Eskom will issue bank 
guarantee in favour of Tegeta for R1.6billion on signature, 
so that is the same bullet point as his except on signature 
10 
is there, a faction effective date, and then CP for release 
is which is also how he wrote it.  The first bullet point 
under there is Section 11 approval from DMR which is 
exactly the same as his.   Next bullet point is Competition 
Commission approval which is also the same as his, and 
there are other aspects added to the draft, notarial bond 
on future coal company secretary to issue letter of comfort 
that that shares have been transferred and issued to new 
owner, and lawyers letter of comfort that the CP’s have 
been fulfilled, do you see that? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are the rest of the bullet points the 
same as the one in Businessman, ja it seems to be the 
same. 
MS DANIELS:  It seems to be the same.  
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 135 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you look at the last bullet point 
Chairperson any amount due over R130million for each 
month shall be payable to Tegeta.  The one above that, 
therefore if Tegeta does not deliver full volume from OCM 
or Kroon the payments due for Brakfontein can be clawed, 
exactly the same.  Go to the one above, Tegeta receiving 
prepayment for two mines supply but Eskom can use 
monies owed from three mines, Brakfontein also to recoup 
the R140million a month. Exactly the same.  So somebody 
else was drafting his own terms for Eskom, for you guys. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Yes he was.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you see this email which was 
forwarded to you by Mr Matshela Koko on page 724?   Is 
this email being forwarded to you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes it has been forwarded to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Did you express any view, 
not view but was this of any – did it raise any concern to 
you that it is an email from Businessman that is assuming 
you don’t know who is Businessman, does it raise any 
concerns for you, questions, queries, where does this come 
20 
from? 
MS DANIELS:   Not at the time Mr Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Why not? 
MS DANIELS:   I really just took it and looked at the top 
and went and did the agreement. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 136 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well would Mr Matshela Koko have sent 
you this type of documents or instructions without any 
discussion with you first as to what they really related to 
and why they – it was necessary to include them in an 
agreement or guarantee?    
MS DANIELS:   He probably would have called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And discussed with you? 
MS DANIELS:   And discussed with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but this time did he? 
MS DANIELS:   I really don’t remember, you know just 
10 
given the way that it happened there he may have but I 
can’t [audio cuts out]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you see if he didn’t discuss 
them with you before he sent them to you my intimation is 
to think that you would have been surprised where is he 
getting all of these things without discussing them with you 
and that you would have wanted to discuss with him before 
even sending to Mr ...[indistinct] or whoever, but did you 
discuss with him these terms, these issues before you 
instructed attorneys to assist you. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   I really can’t remember the specific phone 
call of that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Koko says that the two of you 
were very close and 2015 is all within the years that he 
says that the two of you were very close, he said when he 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 137 of 249 
 
was giving evidence last week that in township lingo you 
were tight. 
MS DANIELS:   [laughing] that is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You confirm you were very close? 
MS DANIELS:  We were close at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes at that time, so one would have 
expected that he would have discussed these things with 
you and if he didn’t you would find that strange and maybe 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   I would have probably found it you know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And say where does this come from, you 
haven’t discussed this with me. 
MS DANIELS:   H’m that’s correct Mr Chair but as I sit 
here today I cannot remember that, you know those 
particular phone calls, there were lots of phone calls 
between us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MS DANIELS:    The fact that I acted on the email I can 
say there must have been a conversation, but because I 
don’t have an independent recollection as I sit here today, 
20 
but judged on what I did there must have been a 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   Ms Daniels this is in 
December 2015 did you have an idea in December 2015 as 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 138 of 249 
 
to who Businessman was or could be in December 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   I am just trying to place, Mr Chairman I 
think I had my suspicion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You had your suspicion? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What was your suspicion? 
MS DANIELS:   That given you know the nature of what 
was being discussed that this could be Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why wouldn’t you have sought to confirm 
whether that was so? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chair I think if I look at the – what I 
witnessed in that year ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You look? 
MS DANIELS:   What I had witnessed in that year, 2015 
and knowing what Mr Essa was capable of I would have, 
you know I was quite careful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were Company Secretary at the 
time, you were a lawyer, you had an opinion, you advised 
on contracts isn’t it?   Or that was your previous position 
or you still did that when you were Company Secretary in 
20 
terms of contracts, you were no longer involved in advising 
on contracts but you had the knowledge. 
MS DANIELS:  No, I had the knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what this was about was 
connected with contracts? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 139 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you realised that there is this 
Businessman who is effectively instructing Mr Koko to do 
certain things about contracts or guarantees and Mr Koko 
in turn instructs you to give effect to that.  Surely that 
should have concerned you to say well who is this person 
that I don’t know within Eskom who is giving instructions 
and I am supposed to carry out the instructions. 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
I 
think 
Mr 
Chairman 
I 
sort 
of 
compartmentalised it in terms of this is coming from 
10 
Matshela Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would have seen from the 
emails 
isn’t 
it 
that 
originally 
it 
comes 
from 
Mr 
Businessman? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am – and you didn’t know anybody 
within Eskom whose email address was Businessman? 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would have thought it must be 
somebody from outside. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that should have worried you. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes it did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would have been, you would 
have been concerned whether the affairs of Eskom were 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 140 of 249 
 
now being dictated to by forces outside of Eskom and you 
would not have wanted to be part of that isn’t it? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct Mr Chairman but at that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore once that was the thinking 
you would have – one would expect that you would 
confront Mr Koko, more so he was close to you at the time 
so you would have no reason to fear that maybe he 
wouldn’t take it positively.    You would have – you should 
have raised the issue with him to say but where are you 
10 
getting these ideas from, because you are not getting them 
from within Eskom. 
MS DANIELS:   I should have Mr Chairman but at that 
stage I did not.  I really did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you accept that it would be 
strange if you didn’t raise the issue and yet being aware 
that it seemed that forces outside of Eskom were giving 
instructions as to what Eskom officials should do? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that I accept you know, it is just that I 
want you to take into consideration the mood at the time, 
20 
you know.  Yes it may be so that Mr Koko and I were close, 
but the fact that we had experienced what we did, that 
closeness was already waning, it wasn’t at that point, 
remember this is now December 2015, it is not at this 
stage where I can say hey what is going on here. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 141 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he said your relationship soured 
between the two of you, the relationship between the two 
of you only soured in 2017 if I recall correctly. 
MS DANIELS:   No that is why I am saying that is incorrect 
you know because you will remember last time I said to you 
that’s incorrect, he is conflating the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On your version when did it sour? 
MS DANIELS:   It started late 2016.  I had already you 
know started trying to be mindful of what I witnessed and 
mindful of you now the rush – witnessing what the Board 
10 
had done, that there definitely was outside influence.   You 
know I cannot sit here and tell you there wasn’t.   You 
know that would be just nonsense.   
 
Mindful of that I started putting the distance and I 
think it was late 2016 when we started having, we started 
getting all these questions from about the first quarter of 
March, I mean the first quarter of 2016, about you know 
the Gupta affiliations, the connections and all of those 
things, and in that process the distance, I tried to keep the 
distance 
but 
it 
also 
maintained 
the 
professional 
20 
relationship, so I think when Mr Koko uses a particular 
incident which is really, it started way before then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course earlier than December, I think 
at the latest if I am not mistaken from your previous 
evidence here, in September of 20 – I think 15 I don’t know 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 142 of 249 
 
if it was 14 but I think 15 or it must be 15 because Dr 
Ngubane only joined 2015 was the first calendar year that 
he was a member of the Board, from your previous 
evidence you recall that there were emails that came in 
from – if it was not Businessman it was Infoportal, and 
there is a dispute between yourself and Dr Ngubane, you 
said in effect – I am putting it in my own words, this person 
sought to communicate with him and you were just given 
instructions by Dr Ngubane, I think he says he pushes the 
blame to you that you were the – you would be the person 
10 
who knew about this person but that email address Mr 
Seleka was either Businessman or Infoportal isn’t it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Chairperson so where the name – it is 
essentially the same, so where you see the email address 
it is Infoportal, but then sometimes you see the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Other times you see both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Businessman then infoportal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is the same email address? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the same Chair. 
MS DANIELS:  It is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the point Ms Daniels is how – how 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 143 of 249 
 
can you in December when you see this Businessman, this 
email address that sends email to Matshela Koko and he is 
saying – sends instructions to you.  So how can you still not 
raise the issue when that is not just the first time you had 
another occasion or other occasions about the same email 
address?  Unless of course the other scenario is if you knew 
then obviously you did not raise anything? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman I suspected at the time – I did 
not have concrete evidence and that ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that suspicion is the one that should 
10 
have driven you to ask.  That is part of the point. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I – I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did it not drive you to ask? 
MS DANIELS:  You know asking the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Matshela Koko.  Mr Matshela Koko who 
is this person that is sending us this – sending you 
instructions and you send them to me because obviously this 
is somebody outside of Eskom?  Who is this – what is 
happening?  Why did you not ask that? 
MS DANIELS:  Well I think I – I really did not want to – to 
20 
cause any trouble for myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not cause any trouble for 
yourself with Mr Koko he was – the two of you were tight. 
MS DANIELS:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if it is.. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 144 of 249 
 
MS DANIELS:  Just remember I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were close. 
MS DANIELS:  I want to just – I want to dispel that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
MS DANIELS:  Because – I want to dispel that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you agreed earlier on. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five minutes ago. 
MS DANIELS:  We were but not that close but I would now 
be able to be in a position to say to him – hey? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but Ms – you cannot say if there was 
not something that you suspected to be something wrong.  
You cannot say that you would not have been in a position to 
raise it with Mr Koko? 
MS DANIELS:  Yoh Mr Chairman I mean – I think you would 
have to – you would have to understand the mood of Eskom 
at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but at least at the level of wanting to 
understand.  You say I do not understand who is this 
Businessman?  So it cannot victimise you for that.  He 
20 
cannot.  You are just enquiring.  Who is this person?  I see 
that you pass on to me instructions that are given to you by 
somebody that seems to be outside of Eskom. 
MS DANIELS:  Ja look at the time I just did not want to 
upset the applecart and you know what now when you look 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 145 of 249 
 
back at it I should have done so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you accept it or do you not accept that 
the other possibility of course is for somebody in your 
position not to raise the issue was if they knew who – 
exactly what was going on? 
MS DANIELS:  No I accept that proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that proposition. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I am not going – I am not going to argue 
with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  You know but I just wanted to please 
understand that the mood was very, very different to the 
ordinary corporate environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  And especially if you know you want to give 
the appearance of being friendly.  Because I had witnessed – 
remember I had now sat in on a number of sort of 
purportedly closed meetings and I had seen how these 
people operate.  And it was not – I mean Mr Koko was the 
only one who came back.  And here we have Mr Singh, we 
20 
have Mr Molefe, we have Mr – Dr Ngubane and they all seem 
to be in the same circle you know.  And the limited – at that 
stage the limited exposure that I had had to the board 
members you know they had acted quite ruthlessly when 
someone questioned things.  You know.  So for me it was 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 146 of 249 
 
just – I would ask you – yes I accept I should have done 
more.  There is no way I can say to you you know I should 
not.  With the benefit of hindsight if I were a co-sec today I 
would certainly do things differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka I see we have gone beyond 
quarter to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you want one or two questions to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To finish for the day that is fine. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair because relative to Dr 
Ngubane Ms Daniels he was saying you told him he is 
Richard Seleke and you said he was the one who told you 
that is Richard Seleke.  I am wondering what is Mr 
Matshela’s version going to be?  I understand he says you 
gave him the email. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I think that – I think you would find that 
even in his – I am not sure which version of his  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Affidavit. 
MS DANIELS:  Affidavit or you know – he says that I told him 
20 
that is that is the chairman’s address.  I mean the records 
clearly show it came from him you know.  So I would really 
dispute that.  I did not at any time say to him that this was 
the Chairman’s address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Quickly you know the email 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 147 of 249 
 
exchanges 
ultimately 
also 
goes 
to 
explicit 
Mr 
salimessa@gmail.com page 752 as well as page – well let us 
deal look at 752.  There is Mr Anoj Singh on 10 December 
2015 3:14.  That is fourteen minutes past three. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  
“Please find above attached.” 
And that email seems to have been forwarded – oh it goes to 
Eric Wood of Regiments and Eric Wood at the top of the 
page forwards it to salimessa@gmail.com.   And you turn to 
10 
page – and that is the last one 768 at 14:13 you – 10 
December there was a lot of activity on the 10 December.  
You send to Mr Anoj 
“Hi Anoj herewith the agreement as amended.” 
At the top the email above yours he forwards it to Eric Wood 
of Regiments at 4:26 pm.  Eric Wood on the same day he 
forwards it to salimessa@gmail.com at 16:36.  So this is how 
third parties outside of Eskom kept in the loop of what is 
happening.  But more than that in fact they start their thing 
and they are kept in the loop – the develop – internal 
20 
development in Eskom.  Is that a fair assessment? 
MS DANIELS:  That is a fair assessment I mean we cannot 
argue with this Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  If you did not stand up based on 
your duties I suppose you knew them very well as a 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 148 of 249 
 
Company Secretary.  This board who was going to advise it if 
you were silence who was going to advise this board? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman I did get a bit bolder as time 
went on.  So when – when I was asked to advise I did so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you wait until you were asked to 
advise or did you advise as you saw the need? 
MS DANIELS:  When I saw the need and both Mr Chair when 
I was asked to advise we put in place a program of director 
training etcetera you know so I continued to do the – the 
duties that I was engaged for.  So it was a combination. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ms Daniels I want to conclude with 
this.  I saw another email there where you tell Mr Anoj Singh 
that you have not put the expiry date for the fulfilment of 
conditions of the CP’s.  That expiry date was ultimately 31 
March 2016.  Who placed that date? 
MS DANIELS:  I think it was… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For the fulfilment of the… 
MS DANIELS:  I think I got those – I think I got those dates 
from him Mr Chairperson because the – we did not have 
20 
them in the – in the agreements we drafted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were you aware that at the same time as 
this was happening that Tegeta had signed an agreement 
with – in fact it signed on that day the 10 December 2015 
signed an agreement with Optimum or Glenco for the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 149 of 249 
 
purchase of Optimum Coal Holdings and that that agreement 
was subject to [00:10:40] conditions. 
MS DANIELS:  I was not aware of that at the time Mr 
Chairman.  I later became aware when that came out in the 
media. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you know what was the date for the 
fulfilment of those conditions? 
MS DANIELS:  I think it was… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well when you became aware? 
MS DANIELS:  I think it was March – it was the end of 
10 
March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It coincided with the same date. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  31 March 2016. 
MS DANIELS:  It did – yes it did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja that will lead us to the pre-payment on 
your return. 
MS DANIELS:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you Ms Daniels you will come 
20 
back – another date will be arranged. 
MS DANIELS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For now you are excused thank you. 
MS DANIELS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have not seen the next evidence 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 150 of 249 
 
leader but I am sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well I understand that.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he is here I can… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I can see him.  Ja okay.  I will take a short 
adjournment to enable them to set up and then we will go 
into the evening shift.  Okay we adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Chaskalson.  Good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are we ready? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are Chair.  It is Mr Holden. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he is continuing with his evidence.  
Good afternoon Mr Holden. 
MR HOLDEN:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The oath that was applicable Friday, 
20 
it continues to apply, oath or affirmation.  Okay, alright. 
PAUL EDWARD HOLDEN:   (s.u.o.) 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Holden, 
today we are going to be talking about the kickback 
payments made in respect of the locomotive contracts from 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 151 of 249 
 
Transnet and we are going to be talking about payments to 
Tequesta and Regiments, Asia.   
 
Before we get there, I wonder if we could just go through 
the cast of characters so the Chair has a sense of who we 
will be referring to in due course? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, just for the record.  Mr Chaskalson, if 
you could confirm again what bundle we are still using? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are using FOS-6 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Flow of Funds, Bundle 6.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair, to give you a sense of 
where we are to be going.  The locomotive’s contract were 
paid in two different stages.  They started out being paid 
through entities called JJ Trading and Century General 
Trading which were part of the World Windows Group and 
those payments were made generally in the UAE.   
 
And then at a certain point, they shifted to Tequesta and 
Regiments, Asia which were more directly integrated into the 
Gupta enterprise as opposed to the World Windows Group 
20 
that was just laundering for them.   
 
And Tequesta and Regiments, Asia payments were made 
initially in Hong Kong and then we can see that they moved 
back into the UAE at a later stage.   
 
Although sequentially, the JJT and CGT payment started 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 152 of 249 
 
first, we are going to just do it in reverse order.  So we will 
talk today about the Hong Kong payments to Tequesta and 
Regiments, Asia and then tomorrow we will go back to the 
World Windows Group and JJT and CGT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Just to introduce some of the 
characters and companies we will be referring to today.  
Mr Holden, can I ask you to go to your report at page 175 of 
the bundle? 
MR HOLDEN:   Is that the bundle there? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody will bring it to you Mr Holden. 
MR HOLDEN:   Can I just have the page number again, 
please? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   175.   
MR HOLDEN:   I am there, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there you list the people to 
whom you are referring in your report.  Under A, Individuals 
Gupta Family, most of the names are familiar but can you tell 
the Chair who you have under Paragraph V, Kamal Singhala? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  I would actually like to cross-
reference it against the person, if I can? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sure.   
MR HOLDEN:   If I can just locate that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [No audible reply]  
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 153 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, Kamal Singhala which I described at 
FOS-6 290 which the ...[indistinct] person [speaker not 
clear].  He was AJ Gupta’s son and he was also a director of 
VR Laser alongside Salim Essa.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And have you seen reports of his 
wedding? 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, I have. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you tell the Chair what you 
read in the reports of that wedding? 
MR HOLDEN:   We see that a certain amount – well, a 
10 
particular individual was hired for that wedding who will be – 
who were identified receiving funds from Regiments, Asia at 
a certain point.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you date that wedding 
and place it or...? 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, the wedding took place in Turkey.  I just 
need to double check the article again.  I think it is in 2015.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct.  Then the next 
person I would ask you to explain to the Chair is Aashika 
Singh. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  Aashika Singh was an 
Indian National.  She was an employee of Infinity Media 
which was a Gupta enterprise company or at least we can 
track one payment to her which is recorded as a salary 
payment.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 154 of 249 
 
 
The relevance of Ms Singh in this regard is that at a 
certain point at Tequesta and Regiments, Asia which acted 
as the primary conduit through which being paid, Salim Essa 
stepped down as the sole director and he was also replaced 
– he was then replaced by Aashika Singh.   
 
And I am sure as we will get throughout the testimony, 
there is also an indication that she was present at a 
particularly notable gathering in Dubai. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you just mentioned Tequesta 
and Regiments, Asia, I think, talking about them a lot.  Can 
10 
you briefly tell the Chair who they were? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  Tequesta and Regiments, 
Asia were two companies that were formed in Hong Kong.  
They were from – what we can gather from the company 
information records in Hong Kong, they were registered by 
an online company formation agent who specialises in the 
creation of companies in offshore tax havens.  They were 
initially registered with Salim Essa, the sole director, a 
position they held until 2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we have come backwards and 
20 
forwards to the World Windows Group.  Can you just again 
tell the Chair briefly what the World Windows Group was and 
what its relationship to the Gupta enterprise was? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  The World Windows Group 
is conglomerate companies, headquartered in India.  At the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 155 of 249 
 
time of the matters under consideration here, the World 
Windows Group head by a man by the name of Piyoosh 
Goyal.   
 
The Gupta Leaks shows that from at least early 2010 
onwards until at least mid-2015, there was quite an intense 
and a lucrative business relationship between the World 
Windows Group and the Gupta enterprise and that included 
the World Windows Group operating two companies by name 
of JJ Trading and Central General Trading, both of which 
were acted as money laundering vehicles form which 
10 
kickbacks from suppliers in relation to Transnet contracts 
were received and dissipated to Gupta enterprise companies. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you mentioned Piyoosh 
Goyal.  Chair, you might remember, he was the man whose 
name was on the email with – to which the Transnet Cranes 
Tender Report was forwarded.  We discussed that last week. 
 
The other World Windows Group individual we will come 
across today is Rupesh Bansal.  Can you tell the Chair who 
he is or what we know about him? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  He is a bit of a mystery 
20 
figure.  What we do know about it – the extent what we know 
about it is included in a very limited amount of information 
appearing 
in 
companies 
house 
filings 
in 
...[indistinct] 
[speaker not clear] companies of houses, the UK version of 
CIPC here.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 156 of 249 
 
 
There is a company by the name of WW Ventures in 
which Mr Bansal appears as a co-director with Mr Goyal.  
That ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just stop you at that point?  
Can you go to page 869.63? 
MR HOLDEN:   I do not have an 869.63 in the bundle I am 
afraid. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, do you have an 869.63? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does not look like I have got 869 and 
after that, it is 870. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, this is a...  Let’s make into 
a...  I think the documents are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Coming my way? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Coming down in a second. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  [laughs]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I must apologise.  Could we 
ask for a five minute adjournment, just that we can sort out 
your files and the witness’s files? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take a five minute adjournment. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry about that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem.  Yes, let us continue. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 157 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We were talking about Rupesh 
Bansal and you had mentioned a company called WW 
Ventures Limited and I had asked you to go to Annexure DD 
which is at page 869.63.  And sorry Chair...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are now using a different bundle, 
hey? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Your bundle has now been split 
between two files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it would be bundle FOS-6A and 
10 
FOS-6B.  This is at the start of FOS-6B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I am just trying to think of what 
we are saying to the record to make sure that somebody who 
keeps on following Bundle 6 does not get confused. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I will have to refer to A and B each 
time I mention a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But for record purposes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Any number in FOS-6 that is 
20 
above 869 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...will be in Bundle B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle B, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   869 and below is Bundle A. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 158 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, so basically, Bundle 6 has now 
been split into two bundles, 6A and 6B. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  So going forward, there 
will no reference to just Bundle 6.  It will either be Bundle 6A 
or Bundle 6B. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, so this is now Bundle 6B, 
869.33.  It is point 63.  Can you identify that document to the 
10 
Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  This the Companies House 
filing for WW Ventures Limited which is a company with 
registration number 07629898 which is registered in the UK 
with a specific address, Settler Floor, Heathrow, Cube 9, 
Arkwright Road, Collin Brook, Slow, Middlesex, England, 
SL30HJ. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you direct the Chair to 
Mr Bansal’s role in that company? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  He appears at the following 
20 
page, which is Bundle 6A, FOS-06-869.64.  It indicates the 
company director one is one Mr Rupesh Bansal with a 
service address of 29 Woodcraft Crescent, Axe Bridge, 
Middlesex, England, UB10 9JB.   
 
It provides certain information about him below which 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 159 of 249 
 
indicates that he was – he is usually a resident in England.  
He is a British citizen and his date of birth is the 
18t h of October 1974.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go over the page, 
can you tell the Chair who the second director is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  The second director is 
Mr Piyoosh Goyal.  His service address is 9 ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We do not need his details.  Just 
his name.   
MR HOLDEN:   [laughs] 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair, that will be at page 
869.65 of Bundle 6B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, Mr Bansal is going to appear 
in connection with a very important email.  Can I ask you to 
go to page 419 of Bundle 6A and explain to the Chair what 
that email is? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   419, Bundle A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   6A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 419, né? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Holden, can 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 160 of 249 
 
you start at the bottom of the page which is where the 
stream starts and explain what this email is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  At the bottom, you can see 
that the original email is sent from Rupesh Bansal at the 
email address replyrb@googlemail.com.   
 
It is sent to a Yang(?) Minu(?) which his address is 
yangminu54642@qq.com.   
 
It is sent on the 6 t h of January 2015.  And as we can see 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, before you go further 
10 
Mr Holden.  Chair, can I just ask you to make a note of that 
email address of Mr Yang Minu because we will find it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, thank you.  But it includes 
546.42, hey? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  That is what will make it easy to 
get clarity. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  The date you give for this email 
Mr Holden, is it because you are able to read that language?  
20 
[laughs] Or that writing there because I cannot see.  I can 
see the year.  I do not see the month.  Ja, I think you said 
February. 
MR HOLDEN:   It is January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, January.  Oh, that is the one? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 161 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR HOLDEN:   And there is a six after the address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is it 6 January? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And going up the stream, what 
happens to that email? 
MR HOLDEN:   What we see is Yang Minu from that address, 
which we have just identified, sends an email to an address 
10 
called Businessman of which infoportal1@zovo.com.  He is 
forwarding the message on the 7t h of January 2015 and the 
body of the message just reads:  “Dear sir.  For your 
interest.  Regards.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And are you able to identify who 
Businessman is? 
MR 
HOLDEN: 
 
 
Certainly. 
 
I 
understand 
from 
the 
Commission’s investigations that Businessman refers to 
Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And to whom – and going up to 
the top of the trial. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  Finally we have an email from 
Businessman sent on Sunday, the 22 nd of March 2015 to 
Ashu Chawla and it provides a subject forwarded which has 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 162 of 249 
 
two Chinese photos and then thereafter, it indicates there is 
an 
attachment, 
attached 
by 
email 
with 
the 
name 
of 
finalcsr2015workings.xlfx.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then ask you to turn to the 
following page, which is Bundle 6A, page 420?  And is that 
the attachment...  Oh, sorry.  Where did you find that email? 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, the email was located within the Gupta 
leak profile. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the document that we see on 
page 420 of Bundle 6A, what is that? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  That was the document in an 
Excel spreadsheet that was attached to the trials of emails 
we have just seen.   
 
Effectively, what this Excel spreadsheet works out is the 
number of or the value of kickbacks to be paid on certain 
Transnet contracts, in particular, what they refer to as the 
359 Project, the 100 Project and the 95 Project which refer 
to the 95 Locomotive Project, the 100 Locomotive Project 
and the 359 Locomotive Projects.   
 
And it indicates the total amount that have already been 
20 
paid 
to 
various 
individuals, 
to 
various 
companies, 
in 
particular JJT and CJT, under the terms of those kickback 
arrangements and what remains to be paid.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We were going to go through it in 
some detail but while we are here, why do we not just go 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 163 of 249 
 
through it now?  If you can explain to the Chair how that 
spreadsheet works? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  What you have at the very 
top line of the spreadsheet is a heading providing an 
indication of what project is being referred to.  So 359, 100 
refers to the 359 Project and 100 Project and then 95 Project 
and then the total. 
 
Underneath that, it provides a particular Rand value for 
each locomotive within that project.  So each loco value for 
the 359 Project is R 50.48 million, and for the 100 Project it 
10 
is R 44 million and for the 95 Project it is R 28.28 million.  
 
And underneath ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What does R 50.48 million represent? 
MR HOLDEN:   Apologies Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does R 50.48 million represent in 
respect of 359 Project? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So the 359 Project was the supply 
of 359 locomotives and each – the R 50.48 million refers to 
the contract price of each locomotive within that contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I would have thought it was 
20 
much more than that but...  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is per locomotive Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, per locomotive. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Ja, I think that is important to – 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 164 of 249 
 
per locomotive. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just explain to the Chair 
how each one of these projects seemed to, what we have 
been calling the 1064 Purchase? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you say that.  So I guess, 
strictly speaking Mr Chaskalson, because it was one contract 
for an X number of locomotives.  It is not accurate to say 
R 50.48 million is the contract price because the contract 
price includes all the 359 Locomotives or whatever, is it not?  
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, I just want that for myself 
to...   
MR HOLDEN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
alright. 
 
So 
that 
is 
– 
the 
R 50.48 million is one locomotive? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HOLDEN:   And then the line below that, you can see it 
indicates Chair project value. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   Which then gives a total value of that 
particular contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of that contract.  Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   And that is the value of the contract as 
signed between the particular Chinese manufacturer and 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 165 of 249 
 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.   
MR HOLDEN:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Chaskalson wanted you to 
explain something and I interrupted him. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  We talked a lot about the 
1064 Project but these are component parts of that project.  
Can you explain to the Chair what...  Well, they are not all 
component parts in that project.  Can you explain to the 
Chair how these fit in with the 1064 Project and what kind of 
10 
locomotives there are and who the purchaser is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  I will just have to double check my 
notes and make sure that I get it exactly right.  We have a 95 
Locomotive Project and I am trying to just remind myself 
whether that is an electrical or diesel locomotive project 
which I will reflect very shortly. 
 
Chair, as far as I recall the 95 Locomotive Project 
reflects a 95 diesel locomotives.  They were purchased by 
Transnet.  And they were purchased from China North Rail, 
CNR, Hong Kong. 
20 
 
The 359 Locomotive Project refers to the purchase of 
359 electrical locomotives.  That was part of the original 
larger 1054(sic) Contract and those are purchased from 
China South Rail, Hong Kong. 
 
I should mention Chair that for the purposes today, that 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 166 of 249 
 
at a certain point after June 2015, China South Rail and 
China North Rail merged into a single entity which is 
referred to as CRRC.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I think you referred to the 
1054 Project.  I presume you meant to say the 1064 Project. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The 100 Project? 
MR HOLDEN:   The 100 Project refer to the provision of a 
hundred diesel locomotives.  And as far as I can see from my 
notes, I have – that was a contract that was signed with 
10 
CRRC. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, let us come back to that 
because there will be... I think the Chair may have heard 
evidence about the decision by Transnet to fast track a pre-
purchase of a hundred electrical locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think so. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because – extensively because 
the 1064 procure was being ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I did, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But anyway.  Let us go further 
20 
down the table so that we understand the numbers in it.   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  At the third line, we have 
the project value which we have already mentioned.  The 
first value is of the 359 Project.  It gives the value as 
R 18.122 32 00,00.  And on the 100 Project it is given as 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 167 of 249 
 
R 4.4 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, I think you are confusing 
millions and billions. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if you can start again. 
MR HOLDEN:   Sure.  It is R 18.122 32 000,00 in the first 
column under 359.  And the 100, it is R 4.4 billion.  And the 
95 Project, it is R 2.686 60 000,00.  And then we have a total 
figure 
for 
all 
of 
those 
contracts 
together 
which 
is 
R 22 152 232 000,00.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR HOLDEN:   Thereafter, we have an entry which says total 
receivables will be from CSR which stands for China South 
Rail.  For the whole project, it is 20% for 95 and 21% for 359 
and 100. 
 
What they propose, it will become a little bit clearer 
below, is the portion of the total project value that CSR 
intended to pay over to JJT and CJT of which 15% was to go 
to CJT. 
 
And so CJT and JJT, for their particular fees for money 
20 
laundering, and the remainder of that was to go to the Gupta 
enterprise.   
 
So what we have here at that fourth line, is effectively a 
calculation of the total value of kickbacks to be paid on 
these three contracts.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 168 of 249 
 
 
The 
total 
value 
under 
the 
359 
Project 
is 
R 3.805 687 2 000,00.  The 100 Project would be a total 
kickback of R 924 million.  And the 95 Project, it would be 
R 537.32  000,00.  And then the total amount would be 
R 5.267 007 2 000,00.   
 
So that was the total amount that would be paid out to 
the various recipients of kickbacks in relation to this 
contract. 
 
The line below indicates the amounts that have already 
been paid by the data of this particular working sheet, which 
10 
at that point, which you can see it is a CSR has paid on the 
6 t h of January 2015, which, if the Chair recalls, was the date 
on which the email was first sent by Rupesh Bansal. 
 
And it gives a figure of US Dollars for the combined 
figure 
for 
the 
359 
and 
the 
100 
contracts 
of 
107.203 921 million Dollars.   
 
And then under the 95 Project it provides a figure of – it 
is a little bit difficult to read without the decimal point in 
place but it is fine but as far as I can see it is 
16.699 028 9 million US Dollars. 
20 
 
And then the total figure combined of those two amounts 
is 123 903 822,89 US Dollars.  That was the amount that was 
already been paid under the terms of these kickback 
arrangements.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just read that note in red 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 169 of 249 
 
that explains how one reaches that figure – how that figure 
of 123.903 million Dollars was reached? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  The line reads:  Note:  CSR paid 
at different time when it was due.  And CSR applied various 
project rates, ZAR/USD which stands for South African 
Rand/US Dollar.  At the time of the payment, JJT/CJT 
received all in US Dollars. 
 
What this refers to Chair is that the amounts were to be 
paid to CJT and JJT and those notes related to Tequesta and 
Regiments.  After certain milestones payments have been 
10 
made by Transnet.  Usually related to a particular number of 
locomotives. 
 
At that point, there was a Rand figure that was 
calculated that needed to be paid based on the Rand figure 
that was paid by Transnet to CSR or CNR and that was then 
converted to a Dollar amount and the Dollar amount was 
then transferred to CJT and JJT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then in the next row, receivables 
from CSR. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  This breaks down Chair the way in 
which the amounts, the kickback have been calculated.  
What we see here is under the 359 and 100 Projects, it 
indicates that 21% is total receivables.  That is the total 
amount to be paid to CJT.  2% advanced success fees.  That 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 170 of 249 
 
is 2% of the contract value to be paid as a success fee and 
19% receivables on actual basis that is due from CSR.   
 
And there Chair, what that means is 90% of each 
milestone payment that is made from Transnet to CSR.   
 
Under the 95 Project it is a slightly easier calculation.  
They just refer to 20% of total receivables.  And then it gives 
a figure to the right which is R 5.267 007 200 000,00.   
 
What this indicates Chair is that, very simple, that for 
the 359 and the 100 Projects, China South Rail was intended 
then to pay a total of 21% of the price paid by Transnet to 
10 
JJT and CJT.  And on the 95 Project it was intended to pay 
20% to CJT and JJT.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the total amount that it would 
pay? 
MR HOLDEN:   Again, that is R 5.267 007 200  000,00 
Dollars(sic).  Apologies.  Rand, not Dollars. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then the next line, what does that 
refer to? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  What this line indicates is it 
refers to JJT/CJT and expenditures.  The effect of this is to 
20 
describe the fee that was to be paid to JJT and CJT for 
carrying out certain – for receiving the funds and then just 
repeating them. 
 
It says here out of 2%, under 359 Project and 100 
Projects indicates, out of 2% success fee, 1% success fee 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 171 of 249 
 
for JJT and 1% expenditures, which we understand to mean, 
1% of the total contract value would be paid on the granting 
of the contract to JJT and 1% would be paid to the Gupta 
enterprise. 
 
Out of 19% CSR receivables, which is the 21% total 
contract value minus 2%, JJT receives 15% and expenditure 
is 85%.  So on this contract, JJT receives 15% of 19% and 
additional 1% of the total contract and the remainder is paid 
over to the Gupta enterprise. 
 
At the following line it says out of 20% receivables, CJT 
10 
receives 15% and expenditure is 85%.  This again indicates 
that a part of the total project value, CJT would take a 15% 
share of 20% share of the contract value, while the 
remainder of the 20% would be paid over to the Gupta 
enterprise. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Next line. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So the next line then provides a 
Rand figure breakdown.  The amounts that will be accruing 
to JJT and then under expenditures, what we understand to 
be the Gupta enterprise. 
20 
 
Under the 359 and the 100 Projects as a combined 
figure, we have R 3.862 577 880,00.  And for JJT, we have 
R 867 109 320,00 .   
 
Under 
the 
95 
Project, 
we 
have 
an 
amount 
of 
R 456 722 000,00.  I just want to make sure that is a 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 172 of 249 
 
hundred percent correct.  That is correct.  So it is 
R 456 722 000,00. 
 
And then of that, then CJT was to receive its own 15% 
which is equal to R 80 598 00,00.  And then the final row 
gives a total across those three contracts.   
 
It is total expenditures i.e. the total amount that he paid 
to the Gupta enterprise under these calculations, would be 
R 3.908 250 008,00.  And for JJT and CJT, it will be 
R 947 747 707 320,00.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The next line on expenditures? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So expenditures then explains the 
– it effectively repeats to an extent of – to some of the 
previous lines.  It indicates the specific amounts that will be 
paid to the Gupta enterprise here.   
 
So under the 359 and the 100 Projects, they were 
intended to be paid a 1% success fee which is...  I must 
double check I have got the correct decimal places here.  It 
is 21 903 000  Dollars.   
 
And it says 85% of remaining receivables would be...  I 
have 554 132... 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think that is 55 million. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair.  If I may, I might just 
get a pen to mark the decimals to make it slightly easier to 
read? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Somebody should just assist 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 173 of 249 
 
you with a pen.  Oh, you have got one? 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay he has got it.   
MR HOLDEN:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is quality Chair.  That is 55 430 2097,75 
Dollars under the 359 and 100 Projects.  And then under the 
95 Project, we have an amount of 40 194 917,45 Dollars 
which was supposed to be paid to the Gupta enterprise. 
 
And then we have a total amount in US Dollars of 
10 
90 614 118.20 Dollars.  So that is the total figure that was 
supposed to be paid – remained to be paid to – that was to 
be paid the Gupta enterprise in relation to these three 
contracts. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then the next line, which I 
imagine gives the JJT/CJT total payment...  Well, payment 
breakdown.  Maybe if you can just tell us what that total 
figure to go to JJT and CJT would be? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So at the far right, we have the 
total figure and that is 33 289 705,68 Dollars. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then the bottom line which is 
crucial for letting us know what had actually been paid at 
that stage and what was still to be paid. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  We have notes in red.  And the 
first note reads:  1.  JJT/CJT in total have to receive – and 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 174 of 249 
 
let me just make the decimal point marks again.  It is 
R 5 267 7200,00.   
 
And it says CSR has made several payments using 
applicable forex rates to transfer ZAR.  That is South African 
Rand into applicable US Dollars.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Underneath.  Just keep reading 
through that – until the bottom of the table. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  It says:  Request CSR to inform 
that in total how many ZAR (South African Rands), CSR 
(China South Rail) has transferred in applicable exchange 
10 
rate for which JJT/CJT received in total 123 903 822,89 
Dollars until now.   
 
Then at point 6, as the above ZAR amount, which was 
used to transfer US Dollars, 123 903 822,89 Dollars.  This 
can be deducted from the total receivables ZAR which is 
R 5.267 billion.  This figure will give the balance due as total 
from CSR. 
 
The above balance X amount in ZAR repaid by CSR in 
future to JJT/CJT and JJT/CJT have to account the 85% 
towards expenditures. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So whatever remained after the 
deduction of the Rand equivalent of 123.9 million Dollars 
from the total of R 5.267 billion would still be payable to 
JJT/CJT but 85% of that, they would have to account to the 
Guptas for. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 175 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So let us now turn to the 
agreements in terms of which all of these payments were 
made.  And while we are it, we may identify one or two – or 
actually one additional agreement that we will discuss 
tomorrow.  Can I ask you now to turn to Annexure A on FOS, 
Bundle 6A, page 298? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please repeat that page Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is Bundle 6 A, page 298.  Chair, 
298. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   629. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, 298 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 298. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 6, page 298. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this is a contract that we 
will get to tomorrow but very briefly because we are going 
through the whole batch of contracts, can you tell the Chair 
what this contract relates to? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, this is an agent agreement 
20 
that is dated the 13 June 2011 and signed between party A 
which has provided Shanghai Zhenghua Heavy Industries 
Co Limited and we will be referring to them tomorrow in 
more detail as ZPMC which is the alternate acronym for 
them and party B is JJ Trading FCE and it relates to a 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 176 of 249 
 
contract for two ship to shore container cranes including 
the repositioning of existing Noell Cranes, and additional 5 
number ship to shore cranes for Transnet South Africa.  
The name of the project is – the Transnet internal name for 
the project is iCLMHQ0762 which then is indicated as 
design, manufacture, delivery and commissioning of seven 
hand and lift ship shore cranes for the Durban Container 
Terminal, Durban, South Africa and relocation of two 
existing IMPSA ship to shore cranes from Durban to Port 
Elizabeth, South Africa.  And I should add here, Chair, this 
10 
is a separate and distinct contract to the contract that was 
entered into between Transnet Port Terminals and Liebherr 
which we discussed on Friday. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So – I mean, we will get to in 
detail 
tomorrow 
but 
this, 
to 
anticipate 
tomorrow, 
is 
kickback contract in relation to the Transnet procurement 
of cranes from ZPMC. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair.   What the 
agreement effectively arranges is for – incentivises JJT to 
seek to increase the cost of the contract to benefit ZPMC. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then the next agreement which 
is the first agreement that we have dealing with the 
locomotives contract, that is on page 304 of bundle 6A and 
it is annexure B.  And on page 304 can you briefly describe 
how the cover page describes this agreement? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 177 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, it indicates and exclusive 
agency agreement entered into between CNR Hong Kong, 
which is China North Rail Hong Kong Corporation Limited, 
was Tequesta Group Limited. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go over the page 
to page 305 can you further share the date of the 
agreement? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, the date of agreement 
appears at the very top of that page, it reads: 
“This agency agreement, this agreement is dated 20 
10 
May 2014 and is made and entered into by between 
the following parties.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the first party named on the 
agreement? 
MR HOLDEN:   Is Tequesta Group Limited, hereinafter 
referred to as TGL, a company duly incorporated and 
existing under the laws of Jebil Ali Free Zone and having 
its registered office at P.O. Box 17398, Dubai, UAE, duly 
authorised and represented by Mr Salim Aziz Essa. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if you can go down to 
20 
following page 306 under the definitions.  There is a 
definition of project and product, can you redact those 
definitions out for the Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, under product it reads: 
“Means diesel locomotives as awarded by Transnet 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 178 of 249 
 
Freight Rail for general freight business after being 
successful in tender.” 
And under project, project is defined as: 
“Refers to supply of 232 diesel locomotives for the 
general freight business issued by Transnet Freight 
Rail in South Africa.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then there is – well, if you go to 
page 309 the terms of payment are described under clause 
7.  Can you take the Chair to those? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, so in clause 7 we have seven 
10 
sub-clauses, 7.1 states: 
“The 
agency 
commission 
of 
TGL 
shall 
be 
ascertained on a deal to deal basis.” 
TGL being Tequesta Group Limited.  7.2: 
“For the project referred here and above, TGL shall 
…[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, can you just pause there, 
that would be the 232 locomotives, diesel locomotives 
project according to the definitions. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair.  Returning to 7.2: 
20 
“For the project referred here and above, TGL, 
Tequesta Group Limited, shall be entitled for a 
success fee of 2% of the contract value and an 
agent fee commission of 19% of the contract value 
which shall invariably include the value of all 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 179 of 249 
 
supplies made under the project.” 
7.3 reads: 
“TGL should be entitled to agency commission 
irrespective of the fact whether supply is of main 
product or any spare part or ancillary item thereto.” 
7.4 reads: 
“The success fee of 2% on the total value of the 
project as stated above will be paid by CNR Dalian 
Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company to Century 
General Trading FCE hereinafter referred to as RAL 
10 
which is duly incorporated and existing under the 
companies ordinance of Hong Kong and having its 
registered offices at P.O. Box 17398, Hong Kong, 
UAE, duly authorised and represented by Mr Salim 
Essa.” 
If I may, Chair, what we have here is a slight confusion in 
the contract between who exactly CNR is contracting with.  
We know that this is a contract between CNR and 
Tequesta.  However, these typos would indicated that there 
was a similar contract or similarly worded contract that 
20 
applied between CNR and Century General Trading and in 
preparing this particular contract an attempt was made to 
replace Century General Trading with Tequesta Group 
Limited but that does not appear to have happened in all 
cases. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 180 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then 7.5? 
MR HOLDEN:   7.5 reads: 
“The agency commission of 19% on total project 
value 
shall 
accrue 
immediately 
on 
receipt 
of 
purchase order or on securing of the bid by the 
company and same shall become due for payment 
apportionately 
either 
when 
payment 
when 
the 
company 
is 
released 
by 
the 
ultimate 
buyer.  
However, it is agreed that 19% of the first payment 
will be paid by company in second payment of 50%, 
10 
means half of 19% along with 19% of second 
payment amount and 50% means balance half of 
19% in third payment along with 19% of the third 
payment amount and from the fourth payment 
onwards 19% in every payment.  The amounts are 
getting due shall be transferred to the account of 
TGL through a wire transfer within 15 days of 
receipt of payment by the company.” 
And after passing some very difficult to read contractual 
language, I understand this to mean that on a rolling basis 
20 
CNR would retain 50% of the success fee that was due at a 
particular milestone payment and that would release the 
following 15% on the payment of the next payment 
milestone, clearly as a means of buffering CNR from 
adverse costs in relation to this contract. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 181 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go down to page 
313 can you just identify who the individual is who must 
receive notices on behalf of Tequesta Group Limited? 
MR HOLDEN:   313?  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Clause 12.1.3. 
MR HOLDEN:   Clause 12.1.3 indicates that for Tequesta 
Group Limited would be for the kind attention of Mr Salim 
Aziz Essa, P. O. Box 17398, Dubai, UAE. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then to the signature page 
on 315 and if you can just identify the signatories to the 
10 
Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, at page 315 the signatory on 
behalf of Tequesta Group Limited is Mr Salim Aziz Essa 
and for and behalf of CNR is Mr Ma Zhan.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we can go to the next 
contract, that is on page 316, it is annexure C and again 
on the title page, the parties? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  This reads: 
“Exclusive agency agreement” 
And it is a contract between CNR Dalian Locomotive and 
20 
Rolling Stock Company Limited with Regiments Asia, CNR 
standing for China North Rail. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And over the page on 317, the 
date and individual representing Regiments Asia? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, the date is provided at the top 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 182 of 249 
 
line, the date is the 20 May 2014 and under the parties it 
indicates for Regiments Asia hereinafter referred to RAL.  
They are duly authorised and represented by Mr Salim Aziz 
Essa. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you can then go down to page 
320 and identify the project? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, under project it refers to the 
supply of locomotive and [indistinct] .10.26 parts in South 
Africa. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at 324, the payment terms 
10 
in clause 7? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, under clause 7, 7.1 reads: 
The agency commission of RAL, Regiments Asia 
Limited shall be ascertained on deal to deal basis. 
7.2 
For the project referred here and above 
Regiments Asia Limited shall be entitled for 
an agency commission of 18 120 000 US 
dollars, shall invariably include the value of 
all 
supplies 
made 
under 
the 
project.  
Regiments Asia Limited shall be entitled to 
20 
agency commission irrespective of the fact 
whether supply is of main product or any 
spare part or ancillary item thereto.” 
7.4 
The agency commission which works out at 
US dollars 18 120 000, as stated above, 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 183 of 249 
 
shall get immediately due and payable in 
five instalments within a month of the project 
being signed, validated and upon receiving 
advance deposit for the first batch from the 
ultimate buyer by the company.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then down to page 329 to see 
who gets notices for Regiments Asia.  
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly under 329 it indicates that the 
individual who had received notice for Regiments Asia 
Limited would be Mr Salim Aziz Essa at P.O. Box 17398, 
10 
Hong Kong. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at 332, the signatures? 
MR HOLDEN:   Page 332, Chair, the signatory on behalf of 
Regiments Asia Limited is Mr Salim Aziz Essa for and on 
behalf of CNR Dalion Locomotives and Rolling Stock 
Company, it is Mr Zhu Zhi Jong(?). 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The next contract is a draft 
contract, it is annexure D at page 334.  It was superseded 
by annexure at page 346, so because we are going to deal 
with neither of them today maybe you can skip annexure D 
20 
and go straight to annexure E and briefly describe to the 
Chair what annexure E, page 346. 
CHAIRPERSON:   346? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   346, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 184 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, this is a business 
development services agreement entered into between 
CNR China North Rail Rolling Stock South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 
so as distant from its Hong Kong entity with Business 
Expansion, structure Products (Pty) Ltd and it provides a 
registration number for – what we refer to as BEX 
2009/020420/07 and the agreement date is the 25 April 
2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now we are not going to discuss 
this very briefly just to tell the Chair what it governed. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, it is the relocation of certain 
facilities that was requested by Transnet in relation to the 
production 
of 
locomotives 
and 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
contract is that BEX or Business Expansion Products would 
be incentivised to try and ensure that Transnet increased 
the amount that it was going to be paying to CNR way 
above the original stated amount, which was just under 
R10 million, and that any amount over a certain benchmark 
price, which is R580 million would be payable to BEX so it 
is an incentive on behalf of BEX to induce Transnet to pay 
20 
a much larger amount than had originally been anticipated 
for relocation costs. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you just repeat those two 
figures?  What was the original anticipated cost?  What 
was the benchmark cost in the contract above which BEX 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 185 of 249 
 
would get their commission? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  The original quoted price was 
slightly under R10 million.  It was, as far as I recall, R9.75 
million and the benchmark price, which has actually 
increased on the previous contract is R580 million and 
thereafter, the amount that was to be earned by BEX, 
would be the amount over and above R580 million.  So if 
there were able to get Transnet to pay more than R580 
million they would receive the additional amount that is 
paid.  That is clearly an adverse or prejudice to Transnet of 
10 
close to - in terms of the benchmark price R570 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that benchmark price is at 
page 357, annexure A. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair.  It appears at 
annexure A under point 2 which indicates: 
“Negotiate and assist to include the project at the 
minimum benchmark cost of R580 million excluding 
VAT.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then we come to the contract 
which is the most famous of all of these contracts, it is 
20 
annexure F at page 358.  Can you take the Chair to that 
contract and the parties on the cover page? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, at 358 we have a business 
development services agreement between CSR, which 
China South Rail Hong Kong Limited with Tequesta Group 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 186 of 249 
 
Limited, or its nominee, with an agreement date of the 18 
May 2015.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At page 362 we see the project 
to which this refers. 
MR HOLDEN:   Indeed, Chair, it refers to project 359 and 
project 359 is defined as: 
“Refers to any portion of the tender for the supply 
of 359 electric locomotives 22E to Transnet SOC 
Limited South Africa, hereinafter the client.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you can go to page 
10 
365, paragraph 3.3 and explain to the Chair what that 
clause deals with? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, I will read out the full clause but 
the summary of the clause is that – summation of the 
clause is that at a certain point JJT and CJT were no 
longer used as the main – as the primary agents and they 
were replaced by in this case Tequesta Limited and that 
Tequesta would seek under its own powers to resolve any 
outstanding disputes with JJT arising.  Should I read the 
full paragraph? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think do, yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   Okay.  3.2 reads: 
“The company has advised Tequesta that a previous 
agreement had been signed between CSR Zhuzhou 
Electric Locomotive Limited and JJ Trading, FZE, 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 187 of 249 
 
hereinafter referred to as the JJT.  However, the 
company advised Tequesta that in event that JJT 
disputes 
or 
contests 
the 
cancellation 
or 
non-
payment in a court of law and if the court decrees 
that 
the 
agreement 
with 
JJT 
is 
valid 
or 
the 
[indistinct] 17.51 agreement is reached between 
Tequesta and JJT then the financial compensation 
to JJT, which will not exceed the retention amount, 
that is 15% of the total amount payable to Tequesta 
under this agreement will be deducted from the 
10 
amount retained from Tequesta as per clause 6.1.6 
and the balance, if there is, will then be paid to 
Tequesta within 30 days after the company receipt 
of the last payment and/or return of all bank 
guarantees released by the client whichever occurs 
later.  Under this circumstance, the invoices with 
retention to the company shall be not be claimable, 
[indistinct] 18.25 Tequesta, Tequesta shall resolve 
the dispute with JJT through amicable consultation 
and ensure there is no further dispute with the 
20 
company from either side.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if you can go to page 367 
clause 6.1.1.   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, at 6.1.1. It reads: 
“For the project-related advisory services provided 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 188 of 249 
 
by Tequesta as detailed in annexure A Tequesta 
shall be entitled to an advisory fee of 21%. 
In brackets it indicates 20% but I am assuming that is 
supposed to read 21%. 
“...of the contract value of project 359 awarded to 
the company based on 2% of the contract value as 
a success fee and 19% of pro rata to the milestone 
based payments received by the company from the 
client.  The company has already paid 3.9% of the 
contract value which is indicated R706 770 480 to 
10 
JJT up to the agreement.  Total payable amount to 
Tequesta under this agreement is 17.1% of the 
contract value which is R3 098 916 720. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So can you explain broadly what 
that is describing? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, it is describing that had already 
been paid to JJT and TJT up until the date of this 
particular 
contract 
and 
thereafter, 
with 
that 
amount 
deducted 
from 
the 
contract 
value, 
the 
amount 
that 
remained to be paid to Tequesta under this agreement 
20 
which meant that by signing this agreement Tequesta was 
due to receive over R3 billion. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then the notices at the foot of 
page 370. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, it says under miscellaneous, it 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 189 of 249 
 
provides for Tequesta, Tequesta Group Limited, it says: 
“For the attention of Mr Salim Essa.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The signature page, 375? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, at page 375 we have Mr 
Salim Essa signing on behalf of Tequesta Group Limited, 
this contract was signed at Shenzhen on the 18 t h day of 
May 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then annexure A, the services 
that Tequesta and Mr Salim Essa had to provide CSR for in 
return for these billions of rands are listed.  Can you take 
10 
the Chair through those services and then we will pause 
and reach the final clause. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly and the annexure A, there are six 
services that are identified.  First is: 
1. Advise the company on the regulatory social, 
cultural and political framework in South Africa 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is the page where the 
services...? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   376, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   376.  Okay, thank you.  I have got it.  
MR HOLDEN:   Okay, so under 1, let me begin again, 
Chair. 
1. Advise the company on the regulatory social, 
cultural and political framework in South Africa 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 190 of 249 
 
with respect to the project. 
2. Identify the various opportunities of participation 
in 
various 
government 
and 
private 
projects 
leading to the short listing and focus on the 
current 
project 
as 
contemplated 
in 
this 
agreement. 
3. Closely 
coordinate 
with 
the 
designated 
authorities 
to 
comprehend 
the 
applicable 
government policies and advise the company 
accordingly to ensure smooth execution of the 
10 
project. 
4. Provide 
consultancy 
on 
participating 
in 
the 
tenders and bidding processes related to the 
project on an ongoing basis. 
5. Assist the company in negotiating with the client 
on pricing levels in relation to the project. 
6. Assist the company in  increasing their footprint 
in government and private projects in South 
Africa.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you read the clause after all 
20 
of this? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  The clause thereafter 
reads: 
“It is hereby noted and agreed between the parties 
that the above services are provided as a pre-
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 191 of 249 
 
project service and will conclude on the company 
signing the contract for the project with the client.  
The company will not require any proof of delivery 
of the above services since it is understood that the 
project would not have materialised without the 
active efforts of Tequesta to provide the services 
listed above.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I found the - apart from this one, 
this clause, I found that other one, what is it, 3? 
“Closely coordinate with the designated authorities 
10 
to comprehend the applicable government policies.” 
[Laughs].  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Now, can you – so this is 
for the 359 electric locomotive project.  Do you remember 
when that tender was awarded? 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, I would have to double-check my 
notes, I do not know the exact date but I know it certainly 
before this contract was entered into. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Well, it was part 1064 
locomotives so the BADC decision was in March 2014.  
20 
What is the date of this contract? 
MR HOLDEN:   The date of this contract is, if I refer 
backwards, it is the 18 May 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   2014, 2015 in Eskom and Transnet were 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 192 of 249 
 
quite busy. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   They were indeed, Chair.  As 
was Mr Essa.  Then you have sourced from Hong Kong, 
from Hong Kong Companies office, details of the Tequesta 
Group Limited.  Can I take you to annexure G on page 377 
and can you tell the Chair what that document is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, this is a document that I 
procured – it is an annual return for Tequesta Group 
Limited that I purchased from the Companies Registry in 
Hong Kong. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what did it tell you of 
interest? 
MR HOLDEN:   The most interesting thing for me appears 
at – well, there is two potentially interesting things within 
this document.  The first appears at page 380 of bundle 6A 
and it provides the details of the loan director of the 
company and the loan director of the company is given as 
Salim Aziz Essa with the residential address of 2 New 
Forest Road, Forest Town, Johannesburg, 2193 South 
Africa.   
20 
Referring to the previous page, at page 379, we 
have the details of the company secretary, so this is the 
individual - the company that was filing the return on 
behalf of Mr Salim Aziz Essa and we will return to why this 
is interesting, I am sure, in a while, but it is worthwhile 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 193 of 249 
 
noticing 
the 
email 
address 
there 
is 
abbeylie@onlinecompanyregisters.com under the relevant 
– so that will become clearer a bit later. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  I was looking for the email 
address, I have seen it here, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then can I take you to another 
document that you sourced in relation to Tequesta from the 
Hong Kong Companies office, it is page 385 and can you 
tell the Chair what that document is? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, this is a document again 
that I acquired from the Hong Kong Companies Registry, it 
is From ND2A which is a notice of change of company 
secretary and/or director and the substance of this is that 
the sole director is identified – whose details will be 
changed, is identified at the first page and that is given as 
Salim Aziz Essa and on the following page, page 386, is an 
indication of the new director of the company and that is 
given 
as 
Aashika 
Singh 
with 
an 
address 
233 
Kua 
Namayigut Road, Dharapara, Solly Gungee Kokuta 70082, 
20 
West Bengal, India. (all names spelt phonetically) 
 
I should note, Chair, I have neglected to mention 
that on the previous page they indicated the dates of this 
form is the 17 November 2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So would I be correct in 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 194 of 249 
 
assuming that on the 17 November 2016 Aashika Singh 
replaced Salim Essa as the sole director of Tequesta? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go to our next 
contract which is annexure H on page 388 and can you tell 
the Chair what – who the parties to that contract are? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, at 388 we have a business 
development services agreement between CSR, Zhuzhou 
Electric Locomotive Company Limited with Regiments Asia 
Limited and the agreement date is provided as the 10 June 
10 
2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If you go down to page 392 you 
see project, can you tell the Chair which project this 
agreement relates to. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, and the project that reads: 
“Refers to the long term, expected 12 years, 
financial 
budget 
for 
the 
railway 
spare 
and 
maintenance by Transnet SOC Limited South Africa, 
hereinafter the client.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then at page 398, the 
20 
payment terms? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, we have – at paragraph 6 we 
have a clause 6.1.1.  Should I read the full terms into the 
record? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Please do, yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 195 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   At 6.1.1 we have: 
“Provided that the contract is awarded to the 
company for any part of the project the company 
shall pay and amount equivalent to 21% against the 
actually 
participated 
contract 
amount 
of 
the 
company including variations and extensions to 
Regiments which is referred to as the service fee.” 
6.1.2: The service fee will be paid to Regiments as 
follows: 
6.1.2.1  A percentage of the contract amount will be treated 
10 
as 
success 
fees 
and 
certain 
other 
milestone 
payments, will become payable after the signing of 
the contract between the company and the client 
and the receipt of the advance payment by the 
company from the client and on reaching the said 
milestones respectively, these 
amounts 
will be 
determined closer to the time of finalisation of the 
contract and will be detailed in an addendum to this 
agreement. 
6.1.2.2 The remaining amount will be paid in proportion to 
20 
the payment received the parties agree that the 
proportion on period is subject to cash flow received 
from the client.  The detailed mechanism for this 
arrangement will be outlined in a separate addendum 
to this agreement, closer to the time of finalisation. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 196 of 249 
 
6.1.2.3 It reads: 
Within 30 days after receipt of the payment by the 
company from the client.” 
And at 6.1.2.4. 
With the amount in the same currency as the payment 
received by the company, and a currency to be 
intimated by Regiments and each invoice they will be 
submitted by Regiments to the company.  The 
exchange rate, exchange rate will be fixed on the 
date payment is received by the company from the 
10 
client. 
6.1.2.5 All of the income tax and other types of taxes if any 
may be levied by and banking charges in Mainland 
China, related to the payment shall be borne by the 
company.  All other taxes and banking charges 
outside 
of 
Mainland 
China 
shall 
be 
borne 
by 
Regiments.” 
And at 6.1.2.6 it reads: 
For the sake of clarity, ...  (indistinct) otherwise 
provided in this agreement each party shall bare its 
20 
own costs and expenses incurred in negotiating and 
entering into this agreement and pursuing furthering 
and fulfilling the rights and obligations set forth 
herein. 
And then can you identify the party to whom notices for 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 197 of 249 
 
Regiments ...  (indistinct) dispute rests?  It’s on page 402?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  Under clause 10.1.4 it indicates 
that the person, the contact person for Regiments Asia would 
be Mr Salim Essa.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And this contract has for the first 
time has some banking details attached to it for the 
Regiments or to quest the party, they are at page 405.  Can  
you take the Chair to that?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  At page 405, on that paragraph 11, 
indicates Regiments’ banking details.  The first entry is name 
10 
of bank and branch which is given as HSBC Bank Head 
Office Central, Hong Kong.  It provides an account number 
which is 652353533-838.  The currency of the account is 
indicated as US dollars.  The account name is given as 
Regiments Agency Limited.  And then it provides a Swift 
code of HSBCHK4HOKH.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then can you take the Chair to 
the signatories to that contract at page 406? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly, we have the contract indicated 
being signed in Sandton on the 10 t h of June 2015, for and 
20 
behalf of Regiments Agency Limited.  It was Mr Salim Essa.  
And for and behalf of SCR, is usually Electric Locomotive, it 
is Mr Zhu Quinn Yi.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then briefly to 407 where we 
see the same addendum that we saw to the previous 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 198 of 249 
 
agreement talking about services.  Can I at this time ask you 
to just read out the last clause of the addendum? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  At page 407, the final clause 
reads: 
“It is hereby noted and agreed between the parties 
that the above services are provided as a pre-project 
service and will conclude on the company signing the 
contract for the project with the client.  The company 
will not require any proof of delivery of the above 
services since it is understood that the project would 
10 
not have materialised without the active efforts of 
Regiments to provide the services listed above.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then you had made some 
inquiries at the Hong Kong company’s office in relation to 
Regiments?  Regiments Asia.  Can I ask you to go to page 
408?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can  you tell the Chair what that 
document at 408 is? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  Page 408 is annual return 
20 
document that I secured from the Hong Kong company’s 
registry.  The annual return is dated the 20 t h of June 2016 
for Regiments Asia.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  At the top of page 409, the email 
address of Regiments Asia? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 199 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:  The email address as provided again as 
abbeylie@onlinecompanyregister.com. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Page 411, where it identifies the 
Director. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  The sole Director is identified as 
Salim Aziz Essa, with an address of 2 New Forest Road, 
Forest Town, Johannesburg, 2193.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then on page 416, there’s a 
second document.  I understand you sourced that too from 
the Hong Kong Company’s office.  Can you tell the Chair 
10 
what this is? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair, this is again form ND2A, 
which is a Notice of Change of Company Secretary and 
Director, which is dated the 17 t h of November 2016.  And the 
substance of this form which is then revealed on this page 
and the following page is to replace Mr Salim Aziz Essa as 
the sole Director with Ashiq Hussain.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if I remember correctly, it is 
the same date, 17 November 2016 as was the case in 
relation to Tequesta. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we then go to the next 
contract which is Annexure K, page 421?  And can you 
describe to the Chair what this contract or who the parties to 
this contract are and what it does? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 200 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  This is an addendum to the 
already existing agreements signed between CRRC Hong 
Kong Company Limited and Chair if you recall earlier on in 
the evidence I noted that CRRC is the merge name of CNI 
and CSR.  Regiments, and that’s signed ...  (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was after July.  You said after July 
2015? 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct Chair.  Regiments Asia Limited 
and Tequesta Group Limited and it’s dated August 2016.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the essence or the purpose of 
10 
the contract is, is essentially set out in clause 2.1.  Can you 
read that clause to the chair and explain its significance? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  It reads at clause 2.1: 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That page 422, sorry Chair.  422. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was looking at the right page.  You must 
have said it.  I was looking at the right page, you must 
have said it.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh Chair, I must apologise.  I think 
that the replacement pages for this, for this agreement it 
should have been – no, this agreement has always been in 
20 
the file.  Does you 422 page start with … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
parties 
now 
hereby 
agree 
to 
restructure?  To restructure the payment method as 
follows?  That is 2. – that is 2.1 and then there is 2.1.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 201 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  2.2 Starts with, that within 10 working 
days. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  Yes.  Chair, Chair no we are 
on the right page.  So it’s 2.1.  Well the whole of 2, 
essentially deals with the restructuring of the payment and 
2.1 is the, is the critical provision.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Holden?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  At clause 2.1 reads: 
“That 
with 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
this 
addendum, 
10 
CRRCHK, that is CRRC Hong Kong, will no longer 
withhold any amount from the amounts that are due 
and payable to Regiments and to Tequesta against 
the 
above 
agreements. 
 
The 
amounts 
due 
to 
Regiments and Tequesta will be paid by CRRCHK 
without any offset, deduction or adjustment against 
invoices supplied by Regiments and Tequesta, except 
that one, the contract for the maintenance project 
under the business development services agreement 
number 
SA2015-2450 
between 
CSRZELC 
and 
20 
Regiments dated 10t h June 2015 is signed between 
Transnet and CRRCZELC 60 business days after 
received LOA as long as CRRC don’t cause any 
delays.  And two, E-maintenance for at least 95 
project or 100 project have been affective and 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 202 of 249 
 
executed 
before 
October 
2018, 
under 
the 
maintenance project as long as CRRC don’t delay 
any process with the abovementioned two conditions 
are 
not 
achieved, 
CRRCHK 
will 
be 
entitled 
to 
withdrawal of 15 percent of all paid amounts under 
100 project agreement and 359 project agreement, by 
the same amount due and payable under 359 project 
agreement.  Signed between CSR Hong Kong and 
Tequesta, dated the 18t h of May 2015.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then clause 2.2. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  It reads: 
“That 
within 
10 
working 
days 
after 
CRRCZELC 
receives the letter of award for the maintenance 
project 
CRRCHK will 
release to 
Regiments the 
previous 
accumulated 
amount 
of 
US 
dollars, 
15 144 510,00 dollars being the 15 percent of the 
amount of held till date on 3rd August 2016 as per 
details below.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And, and then what is detailed 
below?  What is that table refer to? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  It indicates a series of 
invoice numbers on the left-hand side.  And provides for the 
invoice dates which run between the 12 t h of January 2015 
and the 26t h of December 2015.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think you need to go down a page 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 203 of 249 
 
or two, because the table continues much longer.   
MR HOLDEN:  That’s for Regiments.  And the following one 
is for Tequesta. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry, I apologise.  You are 
absolutely right.   
MR HOLDEN:  So this is, sorry I should make it entirely 
clear Chair that the table I am referring to here is in relation 
to invoices that have be submitted by Regiments Asia.  And 
the following table which we will get to is the first invoices 
submitted by Tequesta.  As I was saying the final invoice 
10 
here is indicates that it is invoice 127, on the 26 t h of 
December 2015.  It provides for the amount that had been 
invoiced by Regiments.   
The amount that had been paid by CRRC and the 
amount that had been withheld by CRRC as surety against 
any particular, potential future prejudice to the contract.  But 
the, probably the most key amount is that the – at the bottom 
right-hand corner provides a total amount withheld by CRRC 
Hong Kong up until that date.  And that figure is given as 
$5 181 354,65.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then the next table? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  We have a very similar table which 
begins with the invoice CSR001 with the date of 20t h of July 
2015.  Which then runs to invoice number 24, the date there 
is provided as the 2n d of August 2015.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 204 of 249 
 
Again we have a repeat of the invoice amount that 
had been submitted by Tequesta to CRRC.  The amount that 
had actually been paid to them.  And then the amount that 
withheld and again the most important figure appears rather 
blurrily at the bottom of page 424.  And that reads a total 
amount withheld is $9 963 156,23. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you go to page 425 and 
425.1 to identify the signatories?   
MR HOLDEN:  I do not appear to have a 425.1.  It might be 
in bundle B. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I may, I may have made an error 
there.  Let’s look at 425.  I will check my source document to 
see if there is a 425, if there should be a 425.1.  
MR HOLDEN:  I think there probably is, because the, the 
only signatory appearing at 425 is Zhu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, you have – well 425 is, is it one 
signature there.  And then the one where which would have 
been your 425.1 is the, is the outside page with, with the 
names of the parties.  So there must be some page 
missing.  Or pages … 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair, I don’t want us to delay now.  
But we will search for the signatories. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The signatory page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s fine. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 205 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair, can I ask if your 426 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The 426 is a document that ought 
to have a replacement agreement in it.  Can I ask what your 
426 cover page says? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s got, it’s handwritten at the top, 
Agreement number 0661 blah, blah, blah, blah. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That’s the correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct].  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I just check with Mr Holden if 
10 
he has the correct document in front or he has a duplicate of 
the previous document? 
MR HOLDEN:  I think I have a duplicate.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I offer you this replacement?  
And this is our last agreement.  Can you tell the Chair Mr 
Holden what this agreement is on page 426? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly, this is an addendum to an 
agreement signed between CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotives and 
Regiments Asia Limited.  And it’s dated August 2016.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can I ask you to go to 2.2 on 
20 
page 429?  And tell the Chair what, what that deals with? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly, at clause 2.2. it states: 
“That 
within 
10 
working 
days 
after 
CRRCZELC 
receives the letter of award for the maintenance 
project, CRRCZELC will release to Regiments the 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 206 of 249 
 
previous accumulated amount of $4 357 543,94 being 
15 percent of the amount withheld till date on 3 rd 
August 2016 as per the details below.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then the table? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  We have again a further table 
which is the indicates at the far left column an invoice 
number.  And then a series of dates, the first date is given 
as the 11t h of February 2015.  And the final date I am afraid 
is very difficult to decipher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are these the best copies you have 
10 
Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I’m afraid they are Chair.  This is a 
– whoever leaked these documents didn’t, didn’t use a 
photocopier or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If they did … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR HOLDEN:  I am reluctant to hesitate to guess that that 
date, I suppose that the key issue is that the total amount of 
… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one?  Let me – which one?  Which 
date do you have, are looking at by the stand? 
MR HOLDEN:  The final entry which I think is invoice 125. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the last? 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s the last date.  And the amount withheld 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 207 of 249 
 
is ...  (indistinct) legible. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
[Indistinct] 
2018, 
line? 
 
But 
it 
is 
dangerous to … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think the most important figure is 
the total.   
MR HOLDEN:  Chair, the total is then replicated as 
$4 357 543,94.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then if we go to the signatory 
page on 430.1?   
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair, at that page we have the 
signature, the individual signing on behalf of Regiment Asia 
Limited, is Salim Essa.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it indicate where whoever signed, 
where it was signed?  I saw that the previous one I think 
was signed in Sandton.  The one of the ones that we just 
looked at was signed in Sandton.   
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct. There is one that is signed in 
Chen Chen(?) and the one that’s signed in Sandton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:  This one does not seem to provide a place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So we have seen a series of 
contracts and the ones that we focused on are the ones 
between the Chinese Rail Companies and Tequesta and 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 208 of 249 
 
Regiments Asia.  I want us now to go back and we’ve, we’ve 
touched on some earlier contracts with the Chinese Rail 
Companies and JJT and CGT.   
I want us now to go back to that document with the 
workings email which indicated how much had been paid to 
JJT and CGT and how much was still due to be paid.  That’s 
on page 419 of bundle 6A.  Can I ask you to go to 419?  And 
I want us to focus on the dates here.   
And you’ve taken the Chair through these dates.  The 
original email is 6 January 2015.  It’s from Bunsal Rupesh(?) 
10 
who you identified as a World Window individual.  Zhang Min 
Yu. Can you explain who Zhang Min Yu is?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  Zhang Min Yu is a very 
senior executive at Chinese South Rail.   
CHAIRPERSON:  A very senior? 
MR HOLDEN:  Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then Zhang Min Yu forwarded 
it to Businessman, who we believe to be Salim Essa on 7 
January 2015.  And then there was a delay of more than two 
20 
months before it got forwarded again to Asha Tjala(?) on the 
22n d of March.  Want us to – can you broadly describe to the 
Chair what was happening in the Gupta enterprise world 
window relationship over that period, first quarter 2015?  
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  What we see is a, we have hints 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 209 of 249 
 
from the Gupta leaks that they are increasing tensions 
between the World Window Group and the Gupta enterprise.  
And that’s indicated in certain documents, including that by 
May 2015 for example the company Outclass which is a 
subsidiary of Worlds Window Group, is entry, is cancelling all 
of its various agency agreements and its co-production 
agreements with all of the Gupta enterprise companies.   
There was an interview that was conducted with an 
alleged member of the Worlds Window Group by Abu 
Bongani(?) who indicated that there was some sort of falling 
10 
out between the Worlds Window Group and the Gupta 
enterprise related to the disposition of funds, related to coal 
mines that the Worlds Window Group had invested in that 
were, were beneficially owned by the Gupta enterprise. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And, and the first agreement that 
we see between the Chinese Railway Companies and 
Tequesta or Regiments Asia that provides for monies that 
were previously to go to JJT or CGT now to come to 
Tequesta or Regiments Asia is I’m correct the annexure F.  
Page 358 which is the 15 – sorry the 18 May 2015 
20 
agreement between Tequesta and CSR, that records the 707 
million that’s already been paid to JJT and has that provision 
that if that Tequesta must essentially make sure that that 
money will be deducted from what’s due to Tequesta and that 
Tequesta must take of JJT.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 210 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct.  Although I must correct Mr 
Chaskalson.  That the earliest agreement I have involving 
Tequesta is the 20t h of May 2014.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes, but not – that does not deal 
with taking over. 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well taking over rights to payment 
that previously had vested in JJP or CGT. 
MR 
HOLDEN: 
 
Yes 
that’s 
correct. 
 
I 
apologise, 
I 
misunderstood the question.  But that’s correct. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I want now to look a bit more 
closely at Mr Zhang Min Yu and what he was doing in the 
first quarter of 2015.  Can I ask you to go to bundle 6B 
annexure XX at page 1110?   
CHAIRPERSON:  You said 1110. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That’s correct Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s A. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  B.  Bundle B.  6B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well it’s been a long day, so but I 
see that the first page is 869? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes, but it should go, it should go 
until – 1110 should be quite close to the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 1110? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  1110.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No I didn’t hear the zero.  So I was 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 211 of 249 
 
wondering how 111 could be on this bundle.  Okay.  1110.  
Ja, I have got it.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you identify that document for 
the Chair?  Or can you say where that document comes 
from? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  This is a document that 
emanates from the Gupta leaks archives.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And what is it? 
MR HOLDEN:  What we have here Chair is an email that’s 
sent 
from Asha 
Chawla 
to 
Salim 
Essa 
forwarding 
a 
10 
reservation, confirmation from the Oberoi in Dubai.  The 
reservation confirmation is for Mr Zhang Min Yu. The body of 
the email indicates that the guest name is Mr Zhang Min Yu 
and the arrival date is Friday, the 27 t h of February 2015.  
And the departure date is Sunday, the 1s t of March 2015.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 
112 and to identify that document to the Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  We have a document that 
also emanates from the Gupta leaks archive.  It is sent from 
the … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the top one or the bottom email? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  1112. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair.  1112.  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, ja. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 212 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It’s a string that in fact starts on 
the previous, previous page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But for now I ask Mr Holden just to 
identify the parties to the end of the string which is at the 
top of page 112. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  1112, not 112. 
MR HOLDEN:  So we have the individual from whom it’s sent 
is Saniel at HRT Services.  And it’s sent to Asha Chawla.  
10 
And the subject is, ...  (indistinct) now 17 t h of March 2015.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the date, sorry.  Ja, you have 
just given the date to which it relates.  Can you tell the Chair 
what the string is dealing with?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  This is a string that relates 
to the booking of a private air charter for a company of 
individuals who would be travelling to like now.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if you go to the foot of page 
1113 we see the passengers who are going to be flying on 
this chartered plane in another email for Asha Chawla to 
20 
Sunial Gow, at sunialaircharterservices.com.  Also on 16 
March 2015.  Can you identify those passengers for the 
Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  We have first passenger is Mr 
Rajesh Gupta or Tony Gupta.  We have Mr Salim Essa.  We 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 213 of 249 
 
have Mr Zhang Min Yu.  We have Mr Digaan Yuah. We have 
Mr Wang Jincheng(?).  And finally Mr Mokesh(?).   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And so we know about the first 
three.  Do you know who Mr Digaan Yuan is?   
MR HOLDEN:  Yes.  He is a executive also of CSR.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Mr Wang Jincheng?   
MR HOLDEN:  He is also an executive of CSR. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And do you know who Mr Mokesh 
may be?  I think the record won’t be able to see your faces.  
So I think that ...  (indistinct). 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Yes.  I’m wondering if I should know.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  [Indistinct] you had no reason to 
believe that you should know.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Chaskalson you recall that yes, 
in years gone by in the Magistrate’s court or maybe in the 
High Court’s the interpreter would always sometimes 
describe whatever the witness is doing, to say well the 
face looks like he’s shocked.  So you might have to 
describe.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The face looks like he does not 
20 
know who this ...  (indistinct).   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Our last issue in relation to – our 
last email in relation to Mr Zhang Min Yu is at page 1115.  
Can you identify that email to the Chair? 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 214 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  At that page we have an 
email again emanating from the Gupta leaks.  It’s from 
Jacqueline Van Der Merwe at Oak Bay.  It’s sent on 
Thursday, the 8t h of October 2015 to Naziem Hower(?), cc’d 
to Asha Chawla and Wana Karagvan(?) and the subject reads 
SATY Stats at six o’clock, on 8 October 2015.  
And SATY is the acronym for South African of the 
Year.  Indicating this is a statistics related to potential 
attendees at a South African of the Year event that was 
going to be hosted by Oak Bay and the Gupta enterprise.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if you down a page to 1116, 
can you identify that document for the Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  What we have here is an 
extract from the excel spread sheet that had been attached 
to the email from Jacqueline Van der Merwe, that I have just 
described. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you’ve highlighted one entry. 
Can you tell the Chair what that entry is? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  It is very small on the 
document, I apologise.  It is at row 173, it’s highlighted.  And 
20 
the invitee is indicated as Zhang Min Yu.  And it provides an 
email 
address 
in 
the 
third 
to 
last 
column 
which 
is 
zhangminyu542qq.com.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Mr Holden.  While we’re 
on this topic, can I ask you to go to page 1117 and if I recall 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 215 of 249 
 
correctly, Mr Zhang Min Yu stay at the Oberoi were 27 
February to 1 March 2015. 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you tell the Chair what you 
see on page 1117? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  This is another email 
emanating from the Gupta leaks.  We have an email from one 
Sarah Ben Hoian(?) at the Oberoi, Oberoi Hotels to Asha 
Chawla.  And the substance of the email is to confirm a 
booking for Mr Tony Gupta, Mr Rajesh Gupta and with an 
10 
arrival date of the 24t h of February and a departure date of 
the 26t h of February 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then if you go down to page 
11120. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  This is a email that is sent again 
as part of the Gupta leaks.  In this case it is from Asha 
Chawla to Sujay Grova(?) who we identified in our Estina 
related testimony as the Indian national who is employed by 
the Gupta enterprise, to manage their Dubai logistics and 
accountant, accounts.   
20 
And that provides the substance of the, of the email 
is to confirm the booking at the Oberoi Dubai from Ms Ashi 
Kasing(?) with an arrival date of the 24t h of February 2015 
and a departure date of Thursday the 26 t h of February 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then down to 1122?   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 216 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  Again this is another email 
emanating from the Gupta leaks.  It is a reservation, it is 
sent from a reservation address for the Oberoi Hotels to 
Asha Chawla.  And the subject is reservation confirmation at 
the Oberoi Dubai for Anash Singh.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the dates?  That reservation? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  The date of that reservation 
appears on the following page 1123 and the reservation is 
for Mr Anash Singh, arrival date Tuesday the 24t h of 
February 2015.  And departure date the 26t h of February 
10 
2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you then go down to page 113 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  So – can we infer that the 
same mentioned at 1122 is the same Singh mentioned at 
1123?  Namely Mr Anash Singh?   Or not? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think we probably can, but we do 
know who the reservation was for Chair, because that’s at 
1123.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No, no, when I was looking at 
20 
1122, that second line, after the greetings first line.  I saw 
that they said Mr Singh without giving the name, but or 
there is another Singh.  Ashika Singh, later in the … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  [Indistinct] the paragraph above 
the reference to Ashika Singh identifies Mr Anash Singh.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 217 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anash Singh.  Okay, now ja I didn’t see 
that.  Okay.  So this is February 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now so we have Anash Singh, 
Ashika Singh and Tony Gupta at the Oberoi from I think the 
24t h to the 26t h of February and we have Zhang Min Yu at the 
Oberoi from the 27t h of February to the 1s t of March.  Can I 
ask you to go to 1125 and this is a document sourced by the 
Commission Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It’s Mr Anash Singh’s immigration 
records from the Department of Home Affairs.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And what this document reflects is 
that Mr Anash Singh left OR Tambo on an Emirates flight 766 
on the 23rd of February 2015 and returned on Emirates flight 
767 on the 1 s t of March 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We have been through the 
20 
registration documents of Tequesta and Regiments Asia.  I 
think we’ll come back to abbeylie and stevenmslie a little 
later.  Can I ask you now to turn to bundle 6B, page 995.1.  
995.1?  And Chair, this is a document that that Commission 
obtained from HSBC and it attaches transactions – it’s an 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 218 of 249 
 
affidavit from an HSBC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Did you say 995.1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 6B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t think I have.  I’ve got 995.  Let me 
just see.  Ja, no I don’t have 995.1.  I have got 995.  And 
then the next one is 996.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I must apologise for that. 
Can I offer you up a copy of 995 … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  995.1.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well the whole 995.1 to point 34 
bundle because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That needs to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you can just repeat.  Just 
replace the old pages, the other pages. 
UNKNOWN MALE:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It comes in between 995 and 996. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  Well I think 995 is one 
20 
side or 995 and 996 are on the same page, on the same 
document.  Yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We’ll have to clean up your, your 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 219 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the meantime I think we can make 
do with – ja, okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So Chair at 995.1 you will see an 
affidavit furnished by Thomas Fletcher Shenfield(?) who is 
the Country Head of Financial Threat Litigation for HSBC 
Bank BLC Johannesburg branch, which is HSBC South 
Africa.  And he has furnished this affidavit to provide 
transaction records for four entities that the Commission has 
been looking at.   
10 
Freedom Trading Limited, Morning Star International 
Trade Limited, Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group.  And 
the, these are transaction records that went through the 
South African office of HSBC when they conducted their own 
investigation.  It confirms their authenticity as HSBC records 
of the transaction.  And the transactions for Regiments Asia 
are annexure 3 to that affidavit, which is at – sorry.  Which 
start at page 995.11.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And those for Tequesta are 
20 
annexure 4 to the affidavit that start at 995.16.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now Mr Holden we have made 
these records available to you.  And you, you’ve analysed 
them and, and drawn some conclusions from them. Can you, 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 220 of 249 
 
can I ask you to go to page 263 of bundle 6A which is back 
in your report?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the page on 6A? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  At 263 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  263.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we, sorry Chair.  HS – 
included in those HSBC records are also records for JJ 
Trading that HSBC has.  And for Century General Trading 
that HSBC has.  I must emphasise then in relation to JJ 
Trading and Century General Trading, what HSBC has is a 
10 
small window, small section of the total banking records, 
because they ran several accounts at banks, other than 
HSBC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Of course the writing, the 
words are very small on those. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe Mr Holden has been able to 
make a plan instead. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I wonder do  you have the original 
spread sheets or the spread sheets that were made 
20 
available. That might … 
MR HOLDEN:  Yes Chair, up on the screen now.  Check your 
screen is operational. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HOLDEN:  This is the one of the spread sheets as 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 221 of 249 
 
provided for productions relating to Regiments Asia.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we can first go to your, your sort 
of overall big picture findings at, at paragraph 264.   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  What I indicate at 264 is that 
a total amount of $187 054 355,77 was paid to Tequesta 
Group and Regiments Asia. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as US dollars.  What?  Is that US 
dollars?   
MR HOLDEN:  US dollars, correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja, and Regiments.   
MR HOLDEN:  Was paid to Tequesta Group and Regiments 
Asia by China South Rail, China North Rail, Allien(?) 
Locomotives and Rolling Stock Company, a subsidiary of 
China North Rail and CRRC.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think we must just come back to 
that total figure, because I’m not sure it’s accurate.  But we 
will come back to it.  265 Is, is the – when you break it down. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  An analysis of annexure NN which 
is the HSBC documents. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry NN is your extract from the 
HSBC documents, not the original HSBC? 
MR HOLDEN:  Correct, correct Mr Chair.  It indicates that 
Tequesta Group Limited was paid a total of $61 394 694,50 
by 
China 
North 
Rail, 
CRRC 
and 
CSR 
of 
which 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 222 of 249 
 
$15 234 248,00 
was 
paid 
by 
China 
North 
Rail.  
$2 704 159,00 was paid by CRRC and $43 456 242,00 was 
paid by China South Rail.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And paragraph 266?   
MR 
HOLDEN: 
 Analysis 
of 
the 
annexure 
shows 
that 
Regiments Asia HSBC account in Hong Kong was paid 
$83 781 589,22 by China North Rail CRRC, China South Rail 
and Dalian(?) of which $8 622 906,00 was paid by China 
North 
Rail. 
 
$40 757 788,75 
was 
paid 
by 
CRRC.  
$45 750 600,47 was paid by China South Rail.  And 
10 
$80 119 990,00 was paid by Dalian a subsidiary of China 
North Rail.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And, and then your totals to 
Regiments Asia and to Tequesta by each of those Chinese 
locomotive companies.   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  At 264 we, we might consider 
jointly Regiments Asia and Tequesta with us paid a total of 
$23 857 154,00 by China North Rail.  $70 461 947,75 by 
CRRC.  $89 206 842,47 by CSR.  And $80 120 982,50 by 
Dalian.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I ask you to go back to 
paragraph 264, because I think that figure of 187 million 
includes also payments that the HSBC records show to JJ 
Trading and CG Trading.  Because it’s greater than the sum 
of the sum of the Regiments Asia and Tequesta payments. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 223 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct.  And I think the correct amount 
is indicated at the bottom of the table at file, at page 266. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well before we get to that, those 
tables, can you just identify those tables to the Chair. Table 
3 on page 264.   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  What we have here is the, I 
extracted it from the various HSBC bank statements, the 
payments that were made to Tequesta Group and Regiments 
Asia at HSBC Hong Kong.  In the first part of the table I 
indicate payments that are made by CSR, CNR and CRRC to 
10 
Tequesta Group.  The first payment is indicated at the 7t h of 
August 2015.   
And the final payment on the 1s t of June 2016.  And 
the second part of the table indicates all payments that are 
made to Regiment Asia by Dalian, CSR, CNR and CRRC.  
The first payment indicates that on the 8t h of December 2014 
and the final payment indicated as the 1s t of September 
2016.  And then the final part of the table breaks down total 
amounts paid to Tequesta and Regiments Group by each of 
those individual contractors.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then the aggregate amount 
paid to Regiments Asia and to Tequesta Group in the Hong 
Kong 
HSBC 
accounts 
you 
have 
a 
145 
dollar, 
$145 177 086,91. 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct Chair.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 224 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  At prevailing exchange rates what 
would, what would that be? 
MR HOLDEN:  This is a level of mental arithmetic I was not 
expecting to perform.  But it would probably be roughly 1,6 
billion rand.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In fact would be quite a lot more 
than 1,6 billion rand at today’s.  Sorry at today’s exchange 
rate. 
MR HOLDEN:  Today’s, I thought you meant in 20 … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh, oh, sorry.  Okay.  We should 
10 
probably do the same exercise that we promised the Chair in 
relation to rand exchange rates and rand equivalents on 
each of those payments, which we will do.  Then can I ask 
you to go to annexure II.   
Which is at page bundle – sorry, just see.  Bundle 6B, 
page 885.1 to 885.25?  And again I think we might need you 
to go to the source spread sheet to magnify it on screen.  
Can you identify this document at annexure II? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair. This is a document that was 
compiled 
by 
the 
investigative 
generous 
group 
Ama 
20 
Bongani(?).  The substance of this work which is quite 
brilliant is to identify and track the amounts received and 
paid to CJT and JJT and to Regiment Asia and to Tequesta 
against the anticipated milestone payments in relation to 
kickbacks that were paid by the various Chinese State 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 225 of 249 
 
Money Manufacturing Companies.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you describe to the Chair 
how, how this document – I mean the original document is a 
spread sheet, but can you describe to the Chair how each 
one of the page, what each one of the pages does?   
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  We have at page 1, I’ll load it up 
on the screen so it’s slightly easier to see.  This is a set of 
calculations in relation to the 95 Locos contract.  And the 
substance of this page is to track here – let me try zoom in 
quickly.  On the left here payments that are made on certain 
10 
dates.   
And then to track the anticipated kickbacks due on 
each payment and then to trace those kickback payments 
actually being made to various accounts.  You can see the 
arrows then point.  It’s quite a complicated spread sheet, but 
the substance of which is to indicate that the payments that 
we do know that were made to Regiments Asia, or to 
Tequesta or to JJT or CJT match exactly what we would 
expect to see in terms of the kickback milestone payments 
as described in the underlined contract or agreements.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So, so just to take – maybe if we 
could go to – because let’s illustrate one with reference to 
the HSBC accounts.  And maybe we can use – so if you can 
maybe go to 885.5 which is the tab that relates to the 232 
Locos.  So if you click on your 232 Locos tab there, okay 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 226 of 249 
 
each one of these sheets relates to a different underlying 
contract 
between 
Transnet 
and 
the 
Chinese 
Rail 
Manufacturers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So at page 885.5 we have the 232 
Locos which was one, which was a diesel contract with China 
North Rail.  That, is that correct? 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct.  It’s subsequently replaced by 
CRRC.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Subsequently replaced by CRRC 
10 
as both China North and China South were.  And Mr Holden 
let’s take these columns one by one.  So the starting column 
is the date? 
MR HOLDEN:  Correct Chair.  So we have the date of a 
payment that’s been made.  The column B indicates the party 
that’s paying. Column C indicates the party that’s receiving. 
So this case we can see that on the 28t h of March Transnet 
paid to CNR, related to then column B gives the particular 
deal, the first two which is the 232 Locomotive contract.   
And then it indicates here at column E that a total of 
20 
R994 700 475,00 had been paid by Transnet to CNR and 
CRRC.  At column F we have a summary of the contractual 
terms between Regiments Asia and CNR related to this 
contract.  And it anticipated that there would be upfront on 
the first payment milestone a two percent excess fee that 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 227 of 249 
 
would be paid in relation to this contract.   
The Honourable Bongani have then calculated the 
rand kickback due.  And it’s a bit difficult to – I can’t zoom in 
on the formula number, but the formula is effectively takes 
the column E figure and works out what two percent of the 
total amount Transnet has paid.  And under that calculation 
the rand value of the kickback that would be due for the 
success fee would be R198 940 093,00.  Then that get 
continue Chair, Chair … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Do, do proceed.  Yes.   
10 
MR HOLDEN:  And what we have that proceeds thereafter is 
it’s total of five payments that are made on consecutive days 
between the 8 t h of December 2014 and the 12 t h of December 
2014.  And these are payments that are made from Dalian 
Locomotive which is a subsidiary of CNR to Regiments Asia, 
in relation to the 232 deal.   
And if we scroll here to the right, we have a record, 
because Abu Bongani also had access to a leak of the HSBC 
banking documentation.  They provide the total dollar 
amount that’s paid on each date.  And as we can see the five 
20 
amounts here which were paid on two consecutive days.   
The first was 3,5 – $3 599 998,00.  The second 
amount 
was 
$3 574 998,00. 
 
The 
third 
amount 
is 
$3 716 998,00.  The fourth amount is $3 649 998,00. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I stop you there and Chair can 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 228 of 249 
 
I ask you to go to bundle 6B at page 995.11?  995.11 Where 
we ...  (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  599.11. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  995.11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  995.11.  Yes I’m there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And these are the Regiments Asia, 
HSBC records.  And the four amounts that Mr Holden has 
just cited from that spread sheet, you will find Chair on the 
fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth entry on that page.  So if you 
go across, the first column says transaction identity.  The 
10 
second says source transaction type code.   
Original currencies, US dollars all the way through.  
The posting date and the value date.  Let’s look at the value 
dates, you go four down, there is 2014/12/08 and the amount 
is 3599998, which corresponds almost exactly to what Ama 
Bongani had. Then 35974998, 3716998, and 3649998. Which 
are those four … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Payments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Payments.  
MR HOLDEN:  And that there is actually, if I may add a fifth 
20 
payment as well.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  3577998. 
MR HOLDEN:  That’s correct and as you can see on the 
spread sheet this is the HSBC transaction sheet.  It appears 
there.   
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 229 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we go back to the Abu Bongani 
document, annexure II.   
MR HOLDEN:  So what we have here then is the total 
calculation of the amounts paid by CNR to Regiments Asia.  
It’s $18 119 990,00.  And the calculation is then performed 
by Abu Bongani here which indicates the … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry Mr Holden, when you say 
here can you identify the column? 
MR HOLDEN:  Oh apologies. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Apologies. 
MR HOLDEN:  At column B, row 8. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And because the printed copies 
don’t have column headings, they have column headings but 
not column letters.  Can you just read the, the what looks 
like the heading to the column in, in that red band? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  It says ZAR or South African Rand 
paid at SARB rate on Transnet pay date.  So that is the 
South African rand paid to the South African Reserve Bank 
rate on a Transnet pay date.  And you can see there is a line 
20 
that, a red line, I will show you the origin of that, but it 
indicates at row 8, column B, R192 323 762,00 which if I 
scroll back to the original calculation of the anticipated 
kickback is roughly equal, very similar in amounts to the 
rand kickback that they anticipated will be paid in relation to 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 230 of 249 
 
the success fee.   
So according to this calculation by Abu Bongani I 
think we can pretty safely assume that the five payments 
that are made by Dalian on these consecutive days relates 
specifically to the anticipated success fee on this contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And then I’m not looking here 
because I can’t read anything.  But so. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But we will get, we will get bigger 
and better.  Then they have to be A2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because there is so much detail.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But what the spread sheet does, is 
each one of these pages relates to a different one, contract, 
the 100 locomotives contract.  The 95 locomotives contract.  
The 232 locomotives contract.  The maintenance contract 
and so on.  And it tracks what you would expect the kickback 
to be what you see at HSBC.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And they broadly match up in all 
20 
cases.  It’s an extraordinary piece of work by the looks of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it looks like Ama Bongani got it right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The – let’s have a little bit of light 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 231 of 249 
 
relief.  Let’s see who before we get into the laundering of 
these funds, let’s see … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Maybe 
before 
we 
proceed 
Mr 
Chaskalson, let’s talk about our plan for the evening.  What 
is your situation?  Your assessment?   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair my guess is 45 minutes to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, well.  I think, I think then that 
should be fine.  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I, can I ask you to go back to 
porch at page 267, Bundle 6A at page 267, and there you 
have identified a series ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Chaskalson it may be that 
at some stage somebody must do an exercise to go back to 
where we used this Bundle 6 and if we are now only going 
to have A and B we won’t have the original Bundle 6 and in 
the transcript indicate where it is supposed to be A and 
where it’s supposed to be B. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if we are going to have maybe for 
convenience the original 6 which is combined then that 
exercise won’t be necessary and then still have 6A and 6B 
because then it would mean that where the transcript reads 
6A whoever has the files can go to 6A where it says 6B 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 232 of 249 
 
they can go to 6B, where it simply says 6 without saying A 
or B then there will be a file written 6. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes Chair I will have to speak to 
the Secretary to see if an original 6 still exists, because I 
think what they have done is the have cannibalised – but 
one way or another we will – either you will get an original 
6 plus your current 6A and B or we will have to do that 
exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC;   At page 267 of Bundle 6A you 
10 
record  a range of individuals who were paid out of the 
Tequesta and Regiments Asia accounts.  Can you just 
quickly give – take the Chair through those payments. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly we have a total, the first payment 
is to Salim Essa who received a payment of 99 985 dollars 
and thirteen on the 26 t h of October 2015 and that was paid 
into an account held at Habib Bank in Dubai.  The second 
entry is for Bartholomew Diaz Domingo who was paid 
665 257 dollars and eighty seven in eight payments 
between the 24 t h of December 2014 and the 9 t h of February 
20 
2015 into an account held at Banco PPISA in Porto 
Portugal.  At C we have Antonio Palango Sangosango who 
was paid 665 243 and one cent in eight payments between 
the 23 r d of December 2014 and the 9 t h of February 2015, 
again into an account held at Banco PPISA in Porto 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 233 of 249 
 
Portugal. At B we have a payment made to Prachi Desai 
who was paid 21 214 dollars on the 22 n d of April 2016. At E 
we have Faizel Rashied who was 29 992 dollars and eighty 
nine on the 2 n d of November 2016.  We have Marc Y Yung 
who was paid 70 000 dollars on the 24 t h of January 2015 
and then Chen Shwang who was paid 99 985 dollars and 
fourteen on the 16 t h of April 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Those individuals what were you 
able to find about them from public records? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly I think Salim Essa is relatively, 
10 
his identity is relatively well established.  For Bartholomew 
Diaz Domingo he is a Angolan Entrepreneur and owner of a 
Angolan company by the name of Guppo Bartholomew 
Diaz.  The public records for Antonia Sangosango which I 
describe at paragraph 276 was appointed to the position of 
Director of Administration and Budget in the Angolan 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in at least 2011 although I did 
indicate his personal LinkedIn page indicates that he held 
this position from at least 1998 and I indicate here in any 
event the payments made to Sangosango took place while 
20 
he held public office and I make a gentle suggestion that 
the Commission maybe might need to alert the appropriate 
authorities in Angola so they may conduct their own 
investigations into the probity of the payments.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Prachi Desai. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 234 of 249 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Prachi Desai is a Bollywood actress who 
performed at the wedding of A J Gupta’s son, Kamal 
Singala in Antalya, Turkey on the 23 r d and 24 t h of April 
2016.  As pointed out above she was paid 21 214 dollars 
on the 22 n d of April 2016, on the same day the organisers 
of the wedding Catalyst Entertainment Private Limited were 
paid 64 394 dollars and we can refer to the annexure which 
describes that event. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We found a sort of glossy mag, 
an Indian glossy mag online, Chair if you go to 6B page 
10 
1094. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1094? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   6B 1094? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   1094 and Mr Holden can you 
describe to the Chair what 1094 is? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair 1094 is a copy of a 
magazine which is called Excel which appears to be short 
for Experiential Celebrations, the copy, the issue number 
20 
or the issue date is between July and December 2016 an 
the tagline for the magazine is “An Insight into the 
Business of Social Evens.”  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you go to the 
contents page on 1095 there’s an entry for what we find at 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 235 of 249 
 
page 8 of the magazine. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly it indicates under the heading 
Wedding Planning at page 8, Happening and then the title 
of the article is Turkish Delight the Multiplanner Managed 
Antalya wedding. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go to page 1096 we 
see this article about Turkish Delight, can you read the 
first two paragraphs and the first line of the third.    
MR HOLDEN:   So the heading is “Turkish Delight”: 
“We bring you glimpses of the much talked about 
10 
Multiplanner managed Antalya wedding which took 
place at Mardan Palace Antalya Turkey in April 
2016.  On April 23 600 guests from South Africa, 
UK, India and Dubai flew into Antalya Turkey to 
attend 
the 
wedding 
celebrations 
of 
billionaire 
businessman and politician Ajay Gupta’s son Kamal 
Gupta and Delhi based businessman A J Jain’s 
daughter Palak Jain.  One of the biggest weddings 
to have taken place this year the much talked about 
Multiplanner managed Antalya wedding took place 
20 
at Mardan Palace in Antalya. Entertainment was 
handled by Catalyst while catering was taken care 
of by the Seasons Group.”  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay if we can stop there, can 
you just identify what we found in relation to Catalyst in 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 236 of 249 
 
the HSBC payments? 
MR HOLDEN:   We identified a payment of just over – I will 
get 
the 
precise 
amount 
from 
the 
bundle 
again, 
at 
paragraph 277 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we still on the same bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No Chair this will be 6A 277, but 
if you just keep that bundle open because we are going to 
go to the next page in a minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, 277 on the other one. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Page 268, paragraph 277. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Is it page 268. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, alright, yes I have got it. 
MR HOLDEN:   Here I indicate that on the same day that 
Prachi Desai was paid an amount of 64 394 dollars was 
paid to Catalyst Entertainment Private Limited. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, what was that date? 
MR HOLDEN:   It was the 22 n d of April 2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go back to page 1096 
6B what was the date that the wedding started? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   The 23 r d of April. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right, let’s see what Prachi 
Desai did at the wedding.  Can I ask you to – I’ve lost my 
reference, do you have the reference to Prachi Desai? 
MR HOLDEN:   I think it is 1098, let me double-check. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 237 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the other bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   6B Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   Sorry, it is 1097 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes we looked at some paragraph 1096 
then there is 1097. 
MR HOLDEN:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   And then it says on the left hand side of 
the page it says the exotic beachfront engagement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   And as you can see the second paragraph I 
will read it into the record, it reads: 
“Energetic 
performance 
by 
actresses 
Sonal 
Chauhan 
and 
Prachi 
Desai 
and 
singer 
Richa 
Sharma were enjoyed thoroughly by the guests.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you remind the Chair 
what Prachi Desai was paid out of that HSBC account?   
MR HOLDEN:   Certain Prachi Desai was paid 21 214 
20 
dollars on the 22 n d of April 2016. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  Now if we move 
away from payments to individuals to see where most of 
this money was distributed at page 269 of your bundle 6A 
in your report you produced a table of companies that 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 238 of 249 
 
received amounts in excess of a million dollars from that – 
from the Regiments and Tequesta HSBC accounts.  Can I 
ask you just to take the Chair through that table, page 269. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly sir we have table 4, recipients of 
over one million dollars from Regiments and Tequesta 
Holding, the largest recipients of funds was a company by 
the name of Almalucky Limited which received a total of 54 
payments between the 12 t h of August 2015 and the 10 t h of 
October 2015 and the amount is 15.312million Dollars.  
The second entry there is for Success Stan Limited which 
10 
was paid a total of 13 539 115,30 dollars across 44 
payments between the 19 t h of May 2015 and the 15 t h of 
January 2016.  The third entry is ...[indistinct] Garment 
which was paid in 38 payments 11 244 776,63 dollars and 
those payments are made between the 18 t h of August 2015 
and the 15 t h of January 2016.  The following entry is for 
Shunshi Limited which was paid 7 198 747,16 dollars, 
across 22 payments between the 13 t h of December 2015 
and the 13 t h of January 2016.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think in the interests of 
20 
speeding up maybe just describe to the Chair what this 
table is doing generally because it really speaks for itself. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly what this table indicates Chair is 
the – listed from the larges recipients to the smallest 
recipients of amounts totalling over a million dollars from 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 239 of 249 
 
Tequesta and Regiments HS accounts, the number of 
payments they received and the dates they received those 
amounts. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then you produced another table 
under 6.4.3 which you refer to at the bottom of page 270, 
paragraph 282.  That table – sorry that table is included on 
Annexure NN but it relates to an entity called Morning Star 
International, can you tell the Chair who Morning Start 
International are? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certain Chair.  Morning Star International 
10 
was a company that was also controlled by the Gupta 
Enterprise, 
they 
are 
most 
well-known 
because 
they 
received payments from Homex Pty Limited, the HSBC 
records indicate that they were paid in ten payments, they 
were all made between the 22 n d and 29 t h of May 2015 from 
Homex’s Mercantile Bank facility in South Africa and in 
total Morning Star was paid 393 965 dollars.  We know that 
Morning Star and  Homex were involved in allegations of 
impropriety in relation to contracts that were also awarded 
by Transnet. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at paragraph 284 you list a 
range of companies that received payments from all of 
Regiments, Tequesta and Morning Star International, can 
you identify them?  
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly the first company is Almalucky 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 240 of 249 
 
Limited, the second company is Success Stand Limited, 
third company is Meridian Warrior GL, the fourth company 
is Fly Bridge International DNCC and the fifth company is 
Silirtis Company Limited. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what do you – what 
conclusions do you draw from the fact that there are 
companies 
receiving 
payments 
from 
Regiments 
Asia, 
Tequesta and Morning Star?   
MR HOLDEN:   I believe that these three companies were 
all making use of the same money laundering organisation, 
10 
and money laundering routes with which the funds paid in 
relation to kickbacks could dissipated. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At 286 to get ahead of ourselves 
a little bit you talk about payments from the Tequesta 
Group Limited accounts at Habib Bank in Dubai, can you 
just take the Chair through that paragraph? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly I indicate here that following 
Tequesta Group’s decision to no longer use the HSBC 
accounts they made use of accounts at Habib Bank and I 
read as I state here - Bank statements made public by Amil 
20 
Bongani 
have 
revealed 
that 
Tequesta 
Group 
Limited 
operated a US Dollar denominated bank account at Habib 
Bank in Dubai with account number 2012-7771698603.  T 
his account was used to receive three payments from 
CRRC between the 22 n d of October and 29 t h of October 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 241 of 249 
 
2016 valued at 19 886 383 dollars and forty one, and what 
is notable here is that this account was also used to make 
two payments to Fly Bridge International one of 198 876.33 
Dollars which is equivalent to 755 000 Durham on the 28 t h 
of August 2016 and an amount of 735 000 Durham which is 
equivalent to 200 238 dollars and thirty five, also paid on 
the 29 t h of August 2016 also to Fly Bridge International. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to turn to 6B, 
page 977, and can you identify that document for the 
Chair? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair, what we have here is the 
documents that was ...[indistinct] by Amil Bongani it is a 
statement of account in relation to an account held at 
Habib Bank Limited and the owner or operator of the 
account is identified in the top left corner as Tequesta 
Group Limited and it provides the address for Tequesta 
Group Limited as Flat A, 16P, Effilia, which if we cross-
reference back to the Hong Kong company registration 
documents is the registered address for Tequesta Group in 
Hong Kong, and it provides a statement of account in 
20 
relation to the account number 20127771698603.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then can I ask you to go back to 
page 272 of Bundle A.  There you talk about a Sunnyside 
Import and Export CC report by the Reserve Bank, first can 
I ask you to identify that report by going to – sorry, we are 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 242 of 249 
 
jumping between bundles, it is  now going to be Bundle B 
page 1051. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just the page again Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   6B 1051. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1051, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you identify that 
document to the Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair this is a memorandum 
drafted by Mr K Naidoo who is the Deputy Governor of the 
South 
African 
Reserve 
Bank, 
from 
the 
Surveillance 
10 
Department, the date of the report is or the memorandum 
of authority is the 10 t h of March 2016 and it is a proposed 
forfeiture – the memorandum is a proposed forfeiture of  
money to the State in terms of the provisions of Regulation 
22B of the Exchange Control Regulations, Sunnyside 
Import and Export Close Corporation and it provides a 
registration number for Sunnyside Import and Export. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And – so this dealt with 
Exchange Control Violations by Sunnyside and I ask you to 
turn to page 1060 of the same bundle and can you identify 
20 
that document for the Chair? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair, this is a list of transactions 
that were recorded by the South African Reserve Bank in 
relation to Sunnyside Import and Export. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And those are across border 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 243 of 249 
 
transactions? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, these are payments from 
Sunnyside Export out of the country. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then ask you to turn to 
page 1093 and this is a document that you have generated, 
can you tell the Chair what it is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, what I have done here is identify 
all of those companies to which Sunnyside Import and 
Export made payments that also appear on the bank 
statements or the transaction records for Regiments Asia 
10 
and Tequesta Limited. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And have you counted them, do 
you know how many there are? 
MR HOLDEN:   There are 23 companies here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what inference do you draw 
from the fact that there are 23 companies who Sunnyside 
Import 
& 
Export 
did 
transactions, 
did 
cross-border 
transactions with from South Africa who also were paid 
money by Regiments Asia and Tequesta? 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair I believe that this is evidence of the 
20 
existence of a complex professional money laundering 
organisation that served to launder funds both from South 
Africa and also served to launder funds for the Gupta 
Enterprise in relation to Regiments Asia and the Tequesta 
Group. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 244 of 249 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You have repeatedly referred to 
what is going on in those Tequesta and Regiments Asia 
accounts is money laundering, can I ask you to go to page 
281 of Bundle 6A where you identify what you describe as 
obvious signs of money laundering taking place through 
these accounts and can you take the Chair through those 
signs, those indications of money laundering? 
MR HOLDEN:   At paragraph 300 I state the receipt and 
dissipation of funds from the accounts happened in a 
highly suspicious manner in particular the funds paid in by 
10 
CSR, CNR, Dallian and CRRC were paid out of the HSPC 
accounts almost immediately after they had been received.  
In addition the amounts paid out by Regiments Asia and 
Tequesta had all hallmarks of smurfing, in which large 
payment amounts are  split into a series of smaller 
payments made contiguous with each other.  This is to 
avoid the movement of single large sums that may incur 
compliance checks or mandatory reporting requirements.  I 
then provide an example at paragraph 302 which provides 
indicative examples of this and the first example between 
20 
the 31 s t of December 2014 and the 25 t h of March 2015 
Regiments Asia transferred 2 984 050 Dollars to a company 
called the Light Forever Limited in eleven transfers but 
most noticeably between the 10 t h of March 2015 and the 
24 t h of March 2015 Regiments Asia made ten transfers on a 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 245 of 249 
 
nearly daily basis, the transfers were mostly in round 
figures and then I provide a table here, thereafter Table 7, 
which indicates the payment amounts that were made from 
Regiments Asia to Light Forever and as the Chair will see 
here we have a series of payments that are made between 
the 10 t h of March and the 25 t h of March or within very close 
proximity all in round amounts and/or with all hallmarks of 
smurfing 
and 
money 
laundering 
...[indistinct] 
administratively to transfers all of those amounts in one go 
rather than across a number of different transactions 
10 
incurring transaction fees. 
 
In the second example which I indicate at paragraph 
303 between the 18 t h of August 2015 and the 6 t h of 
November 2015 Tequesta Group transferred 9 087 002,92 
to Almalucky Limited in 34 different payments, although 
realistically I must add that this was actually 33 payments, 
as one payment made of two dollars and ninety three 
cents.  The payments again took place on a regular basis 
often only a day or two apart and were roundabouts in a 
pattern that would be pretty indicative of smurfing and 
20 
money laundering, again I provide a table of those 
payments beginning at the 18 t h of August 2015 and 
concluding on the 6 t h of November 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then finally your concluding 
remarks at page 284 paragraph 304 in relation to the Hong 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 246 of 249 
 
Kong accounts of Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group.  
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, I say at 304 I say based on the 
above discussion the following facts can be confirmed, at 
paragraph A; Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group were 
paid 145 177 086,91 by CSR, CNR, Dallian and CRC 
seemingly after it was decided to get this ...[indistinct] 
window network to launder kickback payments.   At B; 
Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group were incorporated in 
Hong Kong shortly before receiving payments from CSR, 
CNR, Dallian and CRC. The Gupta Enterprise Associate 
10 
Salim Essa was the sole director of both Regiments Asia 
and Tequesta Group until 2016 after which he was replaced 
Aashika Singh, another Gupta Enterprise associate.  The 
amounts paid in Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group were 
immediately 
dissipated 
out 
of 
these 
accounts. 
 
The 
payments made out of Tequesta and Regiments accounts 
were made to, one, a small wedge of individuals, two a 
large 
number 
of 
Chinese 
registered 
textile, 
clothing, 
bedding or consumer goods manufacturers, many of whom 
are shown by public customs data to have been shipments 
20 
to South Africa or alternatively to have at least reported 
such shipments to customs authority in China.  Three, a 
large number of Hong Kong registered shelf companies all 
taking the same corporate form and none of which have 
any notable online profile.  At F; payments to Morning Star 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319 
 
Page 247 of 249 
 
International are also reflected at Annexure NN as are 
payments out. 
 
These records s how that only five companies 
received payments from all of Morning Star International, 
Tequesta Group and Regiments Asia namely Almalucky 
Limited, Success Stand Limited, Meridian Warrior GL, Fly 
Bridge International DMCC. Silitis Co Limited.  At 305, 
based on the above facts I believe it is reasonable to infer 
that: 
[a] 
The 
payments 
made 
to 
Tequesta 
Group 
and 
10 
Regiments Asia CSR, CNR, Dallian, CRRC were in all or 
part actually made for the benefit of the Gupta Enterprise; 
[b] 
Tequesta Group and Regiments Asia were created 
specifically as vehicles to receive laundered funds paid to 
the Gupta Enterprise by CSR, CNR, Dallian and CIRC and 
receive and launder funds from Homix. 
[c] 
The Gupta Enterprise through Tequesta Group and 
Regiments 
Asia 
paid 
funds 
to 
at 
least 
identifiable 
laundering networks which may or may not have been 
linked, namely the Hong Kong Shell Company network and 
20 
the Chinese South African Consumer Goods Export Import 
Network. 
[d]  
Morning Star International, Tequesta Group and 
Regiments Asia 
all 
participated 
in 
the 
same 
money 
laundering network as shown by payments made by all 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319

three to the same five entities. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thanks Mr Holden.  I realise we 
haven’t taken you, some of those conclusions are based on 
material in your report which we haven’t actually addressed 
in these hearings but I think we have done quite well for 
tonight.   I am not going to ask you to go back. 
 
Chair that concludes Mr Holden’s evidence on the 
kick 
backs 
paid 
into 
Hong 
Kong 
for 
the 
Transnet 
Locomotives contract.  Tomorrow we will be dealing with 
the kickbacks paid to CDT and JJT and the World’s Window 
10 
Network at an earlier stage.   I understand that the Eskom 
evidence tomorrow may in fact finish earlier ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...than anticipated so would you 
like us to be on standby from two o’clock? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like you to be on standby for 
earlier than today but I am not sure how long, I think if you 
speak to Mr Seleka he might give an indication whether two 
o’clock would ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   He was suggesting that two 
20 
o’clock would be a sensible time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then that would be in order ja, that 
would be in order. 
 
Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
07 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 319
