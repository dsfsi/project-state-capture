PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 19 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
 
After hearing argument on Monday I indicated that I 
would give my ruling on Tuesday but we had to extend or 
postpone until this morning.  I am now ready to give the 
ruling. 
 
The 
actual 
full 
typed 
ruling/judgment 
will 
be 
available later today because there are some further 
corrections to be made.  But this is the ruling. 
10 
R U L I N G 
 
This 
is 
an 
application 
brought 
by 
Mr 
Jacob 
Gedleyihlekisa Zuma for my recusal as Chairperson of this 
commission or for my recusal from hearing any evidence 
that may be given by him or any member of family in this 
commission. 
 
Mr 
Zuma 
to 
whom 
I 
shall 
I 
refer 
in 
this 
ruling/judgment as the Applicant is a former President of 
the Republic of South Africa. 
 
On 22 October 2020 the Applicant was served with 
20 
a summons issued and signed by the Secretary of the 
Commission requiring or compelling him to appear before 
the commission at ten o’clock on 16 – 20 November 2020 
for the purpose of giving evidence and being questioned by 
an evidence leader in the commission. 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 4 of 38 
 
 
The scope of his evidence was to cover about 35 
affidavits or so of certain witnesses who have already 
testified before the commission.   
 
On Wednesday 11 November 2020 the application 
lodged with the commission an application for my recusal.  
The application was set down for hearing before me.  It 
was opposed by the server of the commission who 
delivered an answering it – an answering affidavit during 
the weekend of the 14 November 2020. 
 
A replying affidavit by the Applicant was delivered 
10 
in the evening on Sunday the 15 November 2020.  Under 
circumstances that will be apparent from this judgment or 
ruling later I read a certain statement into the record at the 
commencement 
of 
the 
proceedings 
on 
Monday 
16 
November 2020. 
 
A 
copy 
thereof 
was 
given 
to 
the 
Applicant’s 
attorneys 
as 
well 
as 
the 
commission’s 
legal 
team.  
Subsequently the Applicant delivered another affidavit on 
Wednesday 18 November 2020.   
 
I have heard oral argument from Counsel for the 
20 
Applicant Mr Skihakhane SC who was assisted by Mr T 
Masuku SC as well as argument from Mr P J Pretorius SC 
the head of the commission’s legal team. 
 
Before I proceed it is necessary to set out the 
background to this application.  It is not necessary to set 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 5 of 38 
 
out that background in any great detail because the 
establishment of this commission is well-known. 
 
 
It suffices to point out that in accordance with its 
name this commission was established to investigate and 
report on allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud 
in the public sector including organs of state. 
 
It was established by the Applicant in January 2018 
when he was still the President of the country.  He did so 
pursuant to an order of the High Court Pretoria which gave 
effect to the then Public Protector ’s Remedial Action. 
10 
 
In accordance with the Public Protector ’s Remedial 
Action and the order of the High Court Pretoria I was 
selected by the Chief Justice and appointed by the 
Applicant as the then President of the Republic as the 
Judge who would chair this commission. 
 
My appointment was announced by the Applicant in 
January 2018.  I am the sole member of the commission.  
The commission has a secretary who heads the secretariat 
of the commission.  It also has its legal team as well as the 
investigation team. 
20 
 
The legal team consists of a number of practicing 
attorneys and advocates.  The investigation team consists 
of various investigators. 
 
Part of the Terms of Reference of this commission 
which were approved by the Applicant when he was still 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 6 of 38 
 
President 
include 
apart 
from 
the 
Provision 
that 
the 
commission must investigate allegations of state capture, 
corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs 
of state. They include that the commission must investigate 
and report on whether and to what extent and by whom 
attempts were made through any form of inducement or for 
any gain of whatsoever nature to influence members of the 
National Executive [including Deputy Ministers, Office 
Bearers and of Functionaries employed by or Office 
Bearers of any state institution or organ of state or 
10 
directors of the boards of SOE’s].   
 
In particular the commission must investigate the 
veracity of allegations that former Deputy Minister of 
Finance Mr Ncebisi Jonas and Ms Mentoor were offered 
Cabinet positions by the Gupta family. 
1.2  Whether the President had any role in the alleged 
offers of Cabinet positions to Mr Ncebisi Jonas and Ms 
Mentoor by the Gupta family as alleged. 
1.3   Whether the appointment of any member of the 
National Executive Functionary and or Officer Bearer was 
20 
disclosed to the Gupta family or any other unauthorised

member of the National Executive is responsible for such 
conduct. 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 7 of 38 
 
1.4  Whether the President or any member of the President 
or previous members of his National Executive [including 
Deputy Ministers or public official or employee of any state 
owned entity] breached or violated the constitution or any 
relevant at the [00:08:37] or legislation by facilitating the 
unlawful awarding of tenders by SOE’s or any organ of 
state to benefit the Gupta family or any other family, 
individual 
or 
corporate 
entity 
doing 
business 
with 
government or any organ of state. 
1.5  The nature and extent of corruption if any in the 
10 
awarding of contracts tenders to companies, business 
entities, organisations by public entities listed under 
Schedule 2 of the Public Finance Management Act Number 
1 of 1999 as amended. 
1.6 
 
Whether 
there 
were 
any

undue 
enrichment, corruption and undue influence in the awarding 
of contracts, mining licences, government advertising in 
the 
New Age 
newspaper 
and 
any 
other 
government 
services in the business dealings of the Gupta family with 
government departments and SOE’s. 
20 
1.7  Whether any member of the National Executive and 
including 
Deputy 
Ministers 
unlawfully 
or 
corruptly 
or 
improperly intervened in the matter of the closing of 
banking facilities for Gupta owned companies. 
1.8  Whether any advice as in the Ministry of Finance were 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 8 of 38 
 
appointed without proper procedures in particular and as 
alleged in the complaint to Public Protector where there 
are two senior advisors who were appointed by Minister 
Des 
Van 
Rooyen 
to 
the 
National 
Treasury 
were 
so 
appointed without following proper procedures. 
1.9  The nature and extent of corruption if any in the 
awarding of contracts and tenders to companies, business 
entities 
or 
organisations 
by 
government 
departments, 
agencies and entities in particular whether any member of 
the National Executive including the [President, public 
10 
official, functionary of any organ of state influence the 
awarding to tenders to benefit themselves, their families or 
entities in which they held a personal interest]. 
 
Paragraph 3 of the Terms of Reference reads and I 
quote: 
“All organs of state will be required to 
cooperate fully with the commission.” 
7.  There are two ways in which a person may be 
compelled to appear before the commission for purposes of 
giving evidence.  The one is the issuing of a summons 
20 
against such a person in terms of Section 3 of the 
Commission’s Act 1947.  The other is by the issuing of a 
directive by the Chairperson in terms of Regulation 10.6 of 
the Regulations of the Commission. 
 
In terms of Regulation 10.6 the Chairperson also 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 9 of 38 
 
has the power to issue a directive to anybody to depose to 
an affidavit or affirmed declaration for the purposes of the 
investigations of the commission. 
 
I have already said that the Applicant was served 
with a summons to appear before the commission this 
week. I have previously also issued two directives in terms 
of Regulation 10.6 against the Applicant to furnish the 
commission with affidavits dealing with certain matters. 
 
I will have reason to revisit this subject later in this 
ruling. 
10 
8.  The commission has been hearing oral evidence since 
August 2018 except for certain breaks that it has taken.  I 
understand that it has heard about 257 witnesses.   
 
By way of an order of the High Court Pretoria the 
commission’s lifespan has been extended to the end of 
March 2021.  Pursuant to an invitation extended to the 
Applicant to appear before the commission from 15 to 20 
July 2019 the Applicant appeared before the commission 
from two and half days or so. 
 
He gave evidence and was given an opportunity to 
20 
present his side of the story and was questioned.  However 
while the Applicant was being questioned he objected to 
further questioning on the basis that he was being cross-
examined.  As a result of that objection a discussion 
ensued in terms of which an agreement was reached 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 10 of 38 
 
between the Applicants legal team and the commission’s 
legal team aimed at addressing the Applicants concerns 
regarding how he was questioned. 
 
I announced the Terms of the Agreement at the 
hearing.  Three of the terms were that the commission’s 
legal team would by 30 July 2019 furnish the Applicants 
team with a document that identified areas of interest in 
each affidavit in regard to which the Applicant was required 
to provide his version. 
 
Another term was that the two teams would seek to 
10 
agree the date by which the Applicant would deliver his 
affidavits but that if the two teams did not reach agreement 
the matter would be brought to my attention and I would 
after hearing both sides determine the period within which 
the Applicant would deliver his affidavits. 
 
Prior to the commission’s legal team reaching 
agreement with the – with the Applicants legal team the 
Applicant informed the commission through his legal team 
that he had decided to terminate his participation in the 
commission due to his dissatisfaction with how he had 
20 
been questioned. 
 
However the agreement that was reached included 
an undertaking by the Applicant that he would continue to 
participate in the commission and would therefore return 
on a later date to continue his testimony. 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 11 of 38 
 
 
Subsequent to the Applicants appearance before 
the commission in July 2019 the commission’s legal team 
furnished the Applicants legal team with a document 
identifying “areas of interest in various affidavit” in respect 
of which the Applicant was required to provide affidavits 
containing his versions. 
 
In 
other 
words 
the 
commission’s 
legal 
team 
complied with his obligations under the agreement of July 
2019.  The Applicant failed to agree with the commission’s 
legal team a period within which he would furnish the 
10 
affidavits he had undertaken to furnish the commission. 
 
Ultimately I fixed a date by which the Applicant 
would deliver his affidavits.  Nevertheless the Applicant 
failed to deliver those affidavits. 
 
Between July 2019 and mid-December 2019 the 
commission set aside various weeks for the Applicant’s 
appearance before the commission but the attempts were 
unsuccessful.   
 
Towards the end of 2019 the dates of 26 to 31 
January 
2020 
were 
set 
aside 
for 
the 
Applicant’s 
20 
appearance before the commission and the Applicant was 
notified. 
 
In December 2019 the commission’s legal served 
the Applicant with an application for an order to be made 
by me authorising the issuing on a summons to compel the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 12 of 38 
 
Applicant to appear before the commission on specified 
dates in January 2020 – that is 26 to 31 January 2020. 
 
The Applicant delivered opposing affidavits.  The 
application was set down for hearing.  On the date when 
the application was to be heard it was adjourned on the 
basis that another date would be allocated for argument.  
The application was adjourned because it appeared that 
owing to medical reasons the Applicant was not going to be 
available to appear before the commission until after March 
2020. 
10 
 
Also the commission’s legal team needed time to 
prepare a replying affidavit to the Applicant’s answering 
affidavit in that application.  The replying affidavit was 
delivered by the commission’s legal team in due course. 
 
Before the application could be set down for 
hearing the state of national disaster was declared and a 
national lockdown was instituted with effect from 26 March 
2020 to deal with Covid-19. 
 
From that time to 28 June 2020 the commission did 
not have hearings.  It resumed its hearings during the 
20 
week of 29 June 2020. 
 
By the last week of August 2020 the Applicant had 
not furnished the commission with the affidavits it had – he 
had undertaken in July 2019 to furnish to the commission. 
 
By the beginning of the national lockdown there was 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 13 of 38 
 
a great number of witnesses who had testified before the 
commission in respect of whose evidence the Applicant had 
been served with Rule 3.3 Notices in terms of Rules of the 
Commission. 
 
These are notices which are served on a person 
who is either implicated or who may be said to be 
implicated in a witness’ statement. 
 
During August 2020 the Applicant was notified that 
21 to 25 September 2020 had been set down as the dates 
for the Applicant to appear before the commission. 
10 
 
On 
27 
August 
2020 
I 
signed 
the 
first 
ever 
Regulation 10.6 Directive against the Applicant which was 
issued soon thereafter and later served on the Applicant. 
 
Through the Regulation 10.6 Directive I sought to 
compel the Applicant to deliver an affidavit or affidavits 
giving his version in response to the affidavits of Mr Popo 
Molefe in regard to the commission’s investigations into 
certain matters at PRASA. 
 
Around 
11 
September 
2020 
I 
signed 
another 
Regulation 10.6 Directive seeking to compel the Applicant 
20 
to furnish the commission with an affidavit giving his 
version to the affidavits of Mr Zola Tsotsi and Mr Nick 
Linnell with regard to a meeting that is alleged to have 
been held in the President’s official residence in Durban on 
8 March 2015. 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 14 of 38 
 
 
On 1 September 2020 the Applicant’s attorneys 
wrote to the acting Secretary of the commission and said 
that the Applicant would not be able to appear before the 
commission on 21 to 25 September 2020. 
 
The reasons advanced were that: 
a. The Applicant’s attorneys of record had been recently 
appointed as the Applicant’s attorneys and needed 
more time in order to familiarise themselves with all 
the documentation which the Applicant had been 
served – with which the Applicant had been served by 
10 
the 
commission 
since 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
commission. 
b. The Applicant was “preparing for his much anticipated 
criminal trial the importance of which cannot be over-
emphasised”.  The letter continued and said that it 
was 
“rather 
unfair 
to 
expect 
the 
Applicant 
to 
simultaneously consider evidence and affidavits of 
more than thirty witnesses in order to make himself 
ready to appear before the commission on 21 to 25 
September 2020.” 
20 
c. The Applicant was of advanced age and given Covid-
19 he had been advised to limit his movements. 
d. The Applicant had raised a concern regarding the 
recent amendments of certain regulations of the 
commission relating to the sharing of information with 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 15 of 38 
 
Law Enforcement Agencies and was seeking legal 
advice “on the implications thereof on his further 
participation.” 
e. The Applicant was also engaged in several other 
cases which required his full attention. 
In that letter the Applicant’s attorneys also noted that 
Notice had been given of the intention of the commission’s 
legal 
team 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
application 
for 
the 
authorisation of a summons to be issued against the 
Applicant to compel him to appear before the commission. 
10 
 
The Applicant’s attorneys then said and I quote: 
“It should follow that we must await the 
outcome of that application before we can 
discuss the possible appearance of the 
Applicant at the commission.  We trust that 
the 
commission 
will 
engage 
with 
us 
regarding dates for the hearing of the 
application.” 
 
The Applicant’s attorneys emphasised that dates 
should have been discussed with them as the Applicant’s 
20 
new legal team.  And they requested that future dates be 
discussed with them. 
 
On the 21 September 2020 which had been meant 
to be the first day of the Applicant’s appearance before the 
commission that week I made an announcement at the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 16 of 38 
 
commencement of the proceedings of the commission. 
 
Since the Applicants attorneys had made it clear 
that the Applicant was not going to appear before the 
commission during the week of 21 to 25 September 2020 
the commission made alternative arrangements in order to 
ensure that that week was not wasted. 
 
The announcement that I made was that: 
a. The application for the authorisation of summons 
against the Applicant was set down for hearing on 9 
October 2020. 
10 
b. If the Applicant or his lawyers did not appear on the 9 
October 2020 and did not provide good reasons why 
they – there was no appearance the matter would 
proceed with or without them. 
c. The dates 16 to 20 November 2020 had been 
determined as the dates for the next appearance of 
the Applicant before the commission.  The Applicant 
was to subsequently say that I have called a media 
conference and made this announcement at a media 
conference.  That was not true as I had made the 
20 
announcement at the commencement of the days’ 
proceedings in the commission. 
On the 28 September 2020 the Applicant’s attorneys 
wrote a letter addressed to me in which for the first time 
the Applicant said that he would be seeking my recusal as 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 17 of 38 
 
the Chairperson of the commission. 
 
The Applicant’s attorneys said that that they had 
been instructed to seek my recusal:  
“On the ground that the Applicant reasonably 
apprehends that you have already adopted a 
biased disposition towards him and cannot 
bring an impartial mind to the issues and 
evidence that relate to him.” 
 
The Applicant’s attorneys went on to say that the 
Applicant’s conclusion that I was no longer capable of 
10 
exercising an independent and impartial mind was fortified 
by what he viewed: 
“As 
the 
unwarranted 
public 
statements 
made by the Chairperson at the said media 
briefing.” 
 
The Applicant’s attorneys went on to say that the 
Applicant has: 
“Always 
expressed 
his 
willingness 
to 
cooperate with the commission.” 
 
They confirmed: 
20 
“This is in spite of his reservations about 
the 
legality 
of 
the 
commission 
and 
in 
particular 
about 
your 
suitability 
as 
Chairperson given your personal relations 
with him.  However the conduct of the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 18 of 38 
 
Chairperson towards has left the Applicant 
with no choice but to take this step in order 
to defend his rights as a citizen.  The 
Applicant believes that the Chairperson’s 
conduct has stripped this commission of its 
much required and founded legitimacy.” 
 
The Applicant’s attorneys also stated in the letter: 
“Viewed in the context of previous media 
statements the conduct of the Chairperson 
and 
treatment 
of 
the Applicant 
by 
the 
10 
commission the Chairperson’s utterances 
have left the Applicant with distinct – with a 
distinct impression that the Chairperson 
seeks to target him for special treatment 
and public humiliation.” 
 
In 
paragraph 
9 
of 
that 
letter 
the 
Applicant’s 
attorneys said: 
“The Applicant believes that the source of 
the Chairperson’s bias against him stems 
from the fact that the Applicant and the 
20 
Chairperson have historical personal family 
and professional relations that ought to 
have 
been 
publicly 
disclosed 
by 
the 
Chairperson 
before 
accepting 
his 
appointment." 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 19 of 38 
 
 
This sentence in the Applicant’s attorney’s letter of 
28 September 2020 makes it clear that at least as at that 
time the Applicant believed that the source of my alleged 
bias against him stem from: 
“The 
fact 
that 
the 
Applicant 
and 
Chairperson 
– 
the 
Chairperson 
have 
historical personal family and professional 
relations that ought to have been disclosed 
publicly 
disclosed 
by 
the 
Chairperson 
before accepting his appointment.” 
10 
 
In paragraph 10.3 of the letter the Applicant’s 
attorneys wrote: 
“The Applicant is of the firm view that the 
Chairperson’s bias against is a result of 
personal and strained relations that the 
Chairperson ought to have disclosed right 
at the beginning of the inquiry.” 
 
In the letter of 28 September 2020 the Applicant’s 
attorneys also listed what they said where some of the 
other reasons to be set out in greater detail in the affidavit 
20 
relating to the recusal application.  These were given as: 
“10.1 The Chairperson’s election to reserve 
media conferences for the Applicant attests to 
the fact that he seeks to portray him as 
uncooperative and belligerent in the eyes of 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 20 of 38 
 
the 
public. 
 
No 
other 
witness 
has 
been 
subjected to such public rebuke through the 
media. 
“10.2 It has become common place for the commission 
to parade a particular narrative through witnesses and 
to 
treat 
certain 
witnesses 
particularly 
those 
who 
implicate the Applicant with difference.  It is apparent 
to the Applicant that the commission to seek to 
entrench a narrative that portrays him as guilty at all 
costs.  The Applicant is of the firm view that the 
10 
Chairperson’s bias against him is a result of personal 
matters and strained relations that the Chairperson 
ought to have disclosed right at the beginning of the 
inquiry.  The Chairperson in its engagements with 
witnesses testifying before him, has already prejudged 
the very issues he is tasked to investigate.   
In particular, he has already made prejudicial statements 
about the Applicant while addressing some witnesses 
who had made no reference to the Applicant. 
The Chairperson refused to believe that the Applicant’s 
20 
failure to appear before the Commissions earlier this 
year was due to struggle to seek medical treatment.  
Again, publicly or portraying him as a liar.” 
And 10.6: 
“The Chairperson has joined the narrative that seeks 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 21 of 38 
 
to present the Applicant as the cause of all the 
corruption he is tasked to investigate.” 
Before I proceed, I need to deal immediately with 10.5 which 
I have just read, where it is said that:   
“The Chairperson refused to believe that the Applicant’s 
failure to appear before the Commission earlier this year 
was due to his trouble to seek medical treatment.  Again, 
publicly portraying him as a liar.” 
I want to indicate that there is absolutely no evidence in the 
papers supporting this allegation against the Chairperson.   
10 
 
10.9:  
“The Applicant’s attorneys also pointed out that until 
the 
Applicant’s 
recusal 
application 
had 
been 
determined, the Applicant would not take part in the 
Commission, recusal application.  
In his founding affidavit, the Applicant provides what 
he refers to as the synopsis of the grounds upon 
which he seeks my recusal.”   
 
He says that those grounds maybe summarised as 
follows.  
20 
“1. 
given our personal relations, the background 
of which is set out fully below.  Deputy Chief Justice 
Zondo 
ought 
to 
have 
declined 
to 
chair 
the 
Commission whose Terms of Reference indicated 
that I was to be the main implicated person.  
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 22 of 38 
 
2. 
In my absence the Chairperson has made 
several comments whose effect is the suggestion 
that I am already guilty of state capture.   
Many 
of 
these 
comments 
carried 
with 
him 
a 
miscellanea on insinuations about my involvement in 
the unlawful capture of our state while I was 
President.   
I am advised that it is not uncommon for judges to 
hear testimonies that may well them but they remain 
composed in order to create a safe forum even for 
10 
the accused.   
In this regard, they are guarded in the comments 
they make while  hearing testimonies. 
3. 
The Chairperson has singled me out for public 
announcements relating to me through the media.  I 
am the only witness in respect of whom so many 
pre-statements 
have 
been 
issued 
by 
the 
Chairperson.   
4. 
The Chairperson clearly doubts my bona fide.  
On two occasions he questioned or doubted my 
20 
statement that I had trouble to seek medical 
attention. 
5. 
the Commission has tendered to call only 
those witnesses particularly members of my cabinet 
that implicate me in some way or are disgruntled 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 23 of 38 
 
that at some point I may have removed them from 
the cabinet posts.” 
The law: 
Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Applicants case 
for my recusal is that the Applicant has a reasonable 
apprehension that I will not bring an impartial mind to the 
issues involving the Applicant.  He made it clear, however, 
that's the Applicant's case was not based on actual bias. 
 
In The President of the Republic of South Africa and 
Others, 1992(2) BCLR 725 (CC), the Constitutional Court 
10 
had 
this 
to 
say 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
impartial 
adjudication of disputes and I quote: 
“A cornerstone of any fair and just legal system is 
the impartial adjudication of disputes which comes 
before the courts and other tribunals. 
This applies, of course, to both criminal and civil 
cases as well as to ad judicial and administrative 
proceedings. 
Nothing is more likely to impair confidence in 
proceedings, whether on the part of litigants or the 
20 
general public, than actual bias or the appearance 
of bias in the officials who have the power to 
adjudicate on disputes.” 
 
The 
test 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
a 
reasonable 
apprehension of bias was set out in these terms by the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 24 of 38 
 
Constitutional Court in SARFU and I quote. 
“The question is whether a reasonable, objective an 
informed 
person 
would 
on 
the 
correct 
facts 
reasonable apprehend that the judge has not or will 
not 
bring 
an 
impartial 
mind 
to 
bear 
on 
the 
adjudication of the case.   
That is a mind open to persuasion by the evidence 
and submissions of counsel. 
The reasonableness of the apprehension must be 
assessed in the light of the Oath of Office taken by 
10 
the judges to administer justice without fear or 
favour and the ability to carry out that oath by 
reason of their training and experience. 
It must be assumed that they can disabuse their 
minds 
of 
any 
irrelevant 
personal 
believes 
or 
predispositions. 
They must take into account the fact that they have 
a duty to sit in any case in which they are not 
obliged to recuse themselves. 
At the same time, it must never be forgotten that an 
20 
impartial judge is a fundamental prerequisite for a 
fair trial and a judicial officer should not hesitate to 
recuse herself or himself if there are reasonable 
grounds on the part of the litigant for apprehending 
that the judicial officer for whatever reasons was not 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 25 of 38 
 
or will not be impartial.” 
 
It is important to highlight that the person contemplated 
in the test must be reasonable, objective and informed.  The 
apprehension must be reasonable and that the question is 
not whether a reasonable, objective and informed person 
might on the correct facts apprehend but it is whether such a 
person would on the correct facts reasonable apprehend. 
 
Furthermore, reasonable apprehension is not that the 
judge may not bring an impartial mind to bear on the 
adjudication of the case but it is whether the reasonable 
10 
apprehension is that the judge has not or will not bring an 
impartial mind to bear on the adjudication of the case.  That 
is a mind open to persuasion by the evidence and the 
submissions of counsel. 
 
The 
reasonableness 
of 
the 
apprehension 
must 
be 
assessed in the light of the Oath of Office taken by judges to 
administer 
justice 
without 
fear, 
favour 
or 
prejudice.  
Furthermore, the onus to establish the case is upon the 
Applicant.   
 
In SARFU the court made it clear that an unfounded or 
20 
unreasonable apprehension concerning a judicial officer is 
not a justifiable basis for an application for recusal and that 
the 
apprehension 
of 
the 
reasonable 
person 
must 
be 
assessed in the light of the true facts as they emerge at the 
hearing of the application. 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 26 of 38 
 
 
Courts are hesitant to make a finding of bias or to 
conclude that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in 
the absence of convincing evidence to that effect.   
 
Both Mr Sikhakhane SC, who together with Mr Masuku 
SC appeared for the Applicant and Mr PJ Pretorius SC, the 
Head of the Legal Commission Legal Team, who agreed that 
the test as set out above is the test for a reasonable 
apprehension of bias but they differed on the application of 
the test. 
 
No benefit will be derived from referring to other cases 
10 
because I am satisfied that the application of the test to the 
facts of this case does not present any problem in deciding 
this application. 
 
The first ground upon which the application relied in 
support of my recusal was that the Applicant and I are 
friends and have been friends for many years.   
 
In this regard, he said that when the Chief Justice gave 
him my name as the judge whom the Chief Justice had 
selected to chair this Commission he was concerned that 
because of that friendship I could be disqualified. 
20 
 
He admits that he did not raise his concerns with the 
Chief Justice.  He says that the reason why he did not raise 
his concerns about me with the Chief Justice was that he 
feared that if he raised his concerns he could be seen as 
seeking to influence the selection of the judge who was 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 27 of 38 
 
going to chair the Commission when the Public Protector 
revised remedial action had made it clear that the judge 
chair the Commission should be selected by the Chief 
Justice. 
 
After becoming aware that this was one of the grounds 
relied upon by the Applicant, I followed the President of the 
Constitutional Court in SARFU and read into the record a 
statement which set out the facts relating to my relationship 
with the Applicant.  This was on Monday, 16 November 2020. 
 
Yesterday 
morning, 
the 
Applicant 
furnished 
the 
10 
Commission with an affidavit responding to my statement.  In 
my statement I stated that although the Applicant and I have 
known each other since the 1990’s and we have a cordial 
relationship, we are not friends.  The Applicant maintains 
that our relationship was that of friends. 
 
What is important however, is that the Applicant does 
not dispute the various matters listed in paragraph 7 of the 
statement I read into the record except paragraph 7(e).   
 
With regard to paragraph 7(e), the Applicant points out 
that it is not accurate because I did meet with him for a 
20 
briefing at his official residence after the Chief Justice had 
given him my name as the judge he had selected to chair 
this Commission. 
 
The Applicant is correct that such a meeting took place 
but insofar as he suggested that such a meeting should have 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 28 of 38 
 
been mentioned in paragraph 7(e).  Paragraph 7(e) appears 
under the heading Personal Relationship between myself and 
Mr Zuma.  That topic excludes official meetings.   
 
The meeting I had with the Applicant, after the Chief 
Justice had given my name, was an official meeting.  I was 
not paying him a personal visit.   
 
Indeed I was informed by the Chief Justice that the 
Applicant had asked that whichever judge the Chief Justice 
selected should come and see him.  Furthermore, in 
paragraph 7(e) I had in the mind the Pretoria official 
10 
residence of the President.  Hence the reference to the 
presidential office in that paragraph. 
 
In the light of the fact that the Applicant does not 
dispute most of the facts set out in paragraph 7 of my 
statement, I am of the opinion that on the undisputed facts, 
there was not the kind of relationship between myself and 
the Applicant, such as would disqualify me from chairing this 
Commission, nor is it a proper ground for me to recuse 
myself. 
 
In any event, I am of the opinion that if the Applicant 
20 
was of the opinion that I should not chair this Commission 
when the Chief Justice gave him my name, he should have 
raised the matter with the Chief Justice. 
 
The view he expressed that he would have been seen to 
be interfering with the selection of the judge to chair the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 29 of 38 
 
Commission is not sound.  If the Chief Justice had given him 
the name of a judge about whom he, that is the Applicant, 
had reports of corruption which he was he planning to pass 
on to the Chief Justice, would he have kept quiet?  I do not 
think so. 
 
After all, the Chief Justice would not have been bound 
by the Applicant’s opinion.  He would have applied his mind 
to the disclosure and either stood by the name of the judge 
had chosen or selected another judge.  In my view, there 
was no sound reason why the Applicant only raised the issue 
10 
of a personal relationship between myself and himself close 
to 
three 
years 
after 
my 
appointment 
to 
chair 
this 
Commission.  The Applicant cannot be allowed to raise this 
issue so late in the day. 
 
The Applicant also contended that the manner in which 
the Commissions holds its witnesses at the beginning, gave 
rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias because many of 
them appeared to be persons who had an axe to grind 
against him.  In this regard, he referred to some of the 
ministers who testified before this Commission.  There is no 
20 
merit on this point.  
 
The Commission was free to use whatever witnesses 
were available, as long as in the end, the Applicant was 
himself afforded a fair opportunity to come before the 
Commission and deal with whatever evidence such witnesses 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 30 of 38 
 
may have given. 
 
The Applicant also contended that after he had come 
before 
the 
Commission 
and 
testified 
last 
year, 
the 
Commission ignored the matters that he had raised during 
his evidence.  
 
The fact of the matter is that the Applicant had not 
completed his evidence when he left the Commission in 
July 2019.  It was agreed that he would come back to 
continue his evidence.   
 
Since then, it is now more than a year and the 
10 
Commission has been trying to get the Applicant to come 
back to the Commission to continue his evidence but the 
Applicant has had to be compelled by way of a summons to 
appear before the Commission. 
 
Indeed, the Commission has served the Applicant with 
two directives in terms of Regulation 10(6) of its regulations, 
compelling him to furnish the Commission with affidavits but 
the Applicant has not complied with his directives. 
 
Indeed, the Applicant has to date not furnished the 
Commission with affidavits he undertook in July last year, he 
20 
would provide to the Commission.  In these circumstances, it 
cannot lay in the Applicant’s mouth to say the Commission 
has ignored the matters he raised in his evidence.   
 
Counsel for the Applicant contended that I made various 
comments when certain witnesses gave evidence which 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 31 of 38 
 
suggested that I thought that the Applicant was guilty of 
State Capture.  I have read all the comments quoted in the 
founding affidavit.  I do not propose to refer to anyone of 
them.  I am satisfied that the Applicant’s contention has no 
merit.   
 
As Mr Pretorius SC submitted.  I am entitled and 
sometimes actually obliged to ask witnesses questions and 
to 
seek 
clarification 
on 
their 
evidence 
because 
the 
Commission seeks to establish the truth on the matters that 
it is investigating.  Even in a judge in a court of law is 
10 
entitled to ask questions and seek clarification in a trial.   
 
The main difference between the Applicant’s approach to 
the 
comments 
I 
make 
and 
my 
approach, 
indeed 
in 
Mr Pretorius’ approach, is that the Applicant appears to 
expect me to be very passive when witnesses give evidence.  
I do not agree.  I believe that, provided I keep an open mind 
and act fairly, there is no difficulty in me seeking clarification 
from witnesses and testing their evidence. 
 
What is important is to strike the right balance.  I am of 
the view that that balance has been correctly struck in 
20 
regard to most if not all the comments about which the 
Applicant complains. 
 
In the end, I conclude having had regard to all the points 
that had been raised by the Applicant including the points 
relating to press statements and media conference that he 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 32 of 38 
 
has referred to in his affidavit, I conclude that the Applicant 
has failed to meet the test for a reasonable apprehension of 
bias.   
RULING 
(APPLICATION FOR RECUSAL) 
 
Accordingly, I conclude that the application for my recusal 
falls to be dismissed and it is accordingly dismissed.

CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, during the course of the week 
we have had various discussions both in chambers and 
during the course of address before you that indicated that 
the Applicant and his legal team would react in one way or 
another and perhaps we should find out what their attitude 
is.   
 
We, as the legal team, do have in possession and we 
have prepared an argument on the eventuality of the result 
20 
that has occurred but perhaps that should wait and we 
should hear my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Sikhakhane. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   Chair, I am not entirely sure what 
Mr Pretorius is saying.  He says he will argue after me.  I am 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 33 of 38 
 
not entirely sure.  I have noted the judgement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   I really do not know what he says I 
must say before he argues something.  I am truly not – I am 
a bit baffled about what he says we must argue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   I really do not know what he wants 
me to do. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, 
I 
guess 
he 
should 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   He wants to hear what I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He should carry on with his plans. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   I think he must carry on with his 
plans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   And I will say if his plans do not – 
are not aligned with mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It seems that any attempt at 
[speaker not clear] is not well-accepted.  Our position is, the 
summons still stands and the Applicant, Mr Zuma, must now 
answer questions.  If that position is opposed, I will present 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 34 of 38 
 
argument to you on that basis.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I am clearer 
now about what it is we are debating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   Well, I have no position to put for 
us to debate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   One is that, before we excuse 
ourselves from the proceedings, I think I have a duty to tell 
the Chair why we will excuse ourselves so that it not cause a 
10 
walk out or defiance but we will excuse ourselves right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   The facts is this.  Is that the 
instruction is to review your decision that you have just of 
when you finally give us a copy and we will take it from 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   The next Chair is that.  You will 
realise – maybe I did not say this enough.  Is that you have 
become a judge in the dispute that involves yourself, in that, 
20 
in determining disputes that arise in matters that include 
you.   
 
And Chair, I know you have quoted Arthur Chaskalson, 
the CJ but you may not have noted that the issues in Arthur 
Chaskalson and Louis Luyt were common cause and the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 35 of 38 
 
issues here are not common cause.   
 
And for that reason Chair we want to excuse ourselves 
from these proceedings so that we consider your ruling.  And 
insofar as the issue of you becoming a judge in your own 
matter, which on its own is a ground that we have mentioned, 
that Mr Zuma mentioned.   
 
I want to say that we have also been instructed to bring 
an application – not an application – to lodge a complaint 
about you in that regard to the Judicial Service Commission 
in respect of the issue about which you have made yourself a 
10 
witness and a judge.   
 
And therefore Chair, I have no other instruction today or 
anywhere in the future until we have considered the review 
except that we would like to be excused from these 
proceedings.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, we have prepared argument in 
writing to place before you.  The effect of that argument is 
that, notwithstanding an intention to review your decision, in 
short, the proceedings must continue.   
20 
 
And if, as my learned friend puts it, they are excusing 
themselves from the proceedings.  They are, in fact, acting...  
Well, not they, the Applicant would be acting in defiance of 
the summons and unlawfully.   
 
It is up to you Chair to decide whether or not the 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 36 of 38 
 
proceedings will continue or whether they will be adjourned 
or stayed, in effect, pending any application for review or 
any referral of any complaint Chair.   
 
So the position is simply this.  The summons stands.  It 
is not, with respect to my learned friend, open to the 
Applicant simply to “excuse himself”.   
 
The proper application of the law that demands that you 
make a decision about the continuance of proceedings.  And 
in that regard, we have prepared argument.   
 
But in the face of a unilateral decision, I am not sure 
10 
that it is going to be productive to take up time, presenting 
that argument to you.  So perhaps we should take a short 
adjournment and you can rule on the proceedings after the 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us take the tea adjournment and 
then we will resume after 15-minutes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We took a tea adjournment which has 
ended up taking quite long.  We return to the hearing in 
circumstances where Mr Zuma has left, I have been told.  
Mr Zuma had been issued with a summons to be here from 
Monday to tomorrow unless he was excused by me.  On 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 37 of 38 
 
Tuesday his lawyers asked me to excuse him for yesterday 
because he wanted to attend a funeral.  I excused him from 
attending.  He has left today without asking me to be 
excused.   
This is a serious matter but in terms of the plans of 
the Commission for this week he was going to be, if I 
dismissed his application that I should recuse myself, as I 
have done, he was going to be asked to take the witness 
stand and be questioned about various matters relating to 
matters that we are investigating as a Commission.  It is a 
10 
pity that he has elected to leave without asking for 
permission.   
There is no point for the Commission to sit for the 
rest of the day because it has convened to deal with his 
evidence, there is no point in coming tomorrow because he 
is not coming back.   
So we are going to adjourn and the Commission will 
reflect on the matters that it needs to reflect on but it is 
going to continue with its work.  I think I am going to end 
there.  I do not know if there is anything you want to say 
20 
Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Your address is noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay so we are going to adjourn, 
19 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 309 
 
Page 38 of 38 
 
there will be no hearing tomorrow but next week there are 
witnesses who will come and we will continue next week on 
Monday.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 23 NOVEMBER 2020
