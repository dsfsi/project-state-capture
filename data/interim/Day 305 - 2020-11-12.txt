REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR SADIK:  So help me God. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good morning Mr Sadik. Yes you can 
take off your mask.  May I just ask you when you give 
evidence can you please try and speak in a clear voice and 
try I know it may be difficult because I am asking most of 
the questions although the Chair may also ask some 
10 
questions of you.  But even when I am asking you 
questions try and look towards the Chair rather than me. 
MR SADIK:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So that you show him the respect so 
that he can – he can hear you and also so that your voice 
is directed into the microphone.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr 
Sadik is it correct that you have furnished an affidavit at 
the request of the commission? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you should have in front of you a 
20 
bundle that is marked Denel Bundle 11 and another one 
Bundle 12.   
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if I can take you I have indicated 
to you already where you should be looking for the page 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 5 of 246 
 
number.  It is the top left the last digit of the numbers on 
the top left page 4.  Is that the first page of your affidavit? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And may I ask you please to turn to 
the last page of the affidavit before your annexures at page 
60.   
MR SADIK:  Yes I have it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that your signature the first of the 
two signatures that we see on that page? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is it correct that you signed this 
affidavit swearing the oath before a Commissioner of 
Oaths? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And I note that the affidavit was 
signed on the 9 February 2020 
MR SADIK:  Correct yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you have indicated to me in 
consultation that there are some – that there is one 
correction that you want to – want to make to a word in the 
20 
body of the affidavit.  I will take you there in a moment but 
there are also some events that have changed since you 
signed the affidavit in February 2020 is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And I will take you through the – the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 6 of 246 
 
events that have changed to the extent it is necessary.  
First to deal with the correction of the word that is wrong.  
If I can take you to page 6.  Paragraph 152 you indicated 
to me that there is an error that you want to correct there.  
What is the error? 
MR SADIK:  The error it is 1 – paragraph 152 reads final 
report when it should read draft report presented by Ndidi. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Now apart from that 
correction or subject to that correction and apart from the 
events that you want to update the Chair on that have 
10 
occurred since February 2020 does the affidavit contain 
facts that were correct at the time of February 2020. 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can you confirm that? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And can you confirm you have been 
through this affidavit and you able to attest to that under 
oath that all of the contents subject to the correction of 
that word that you have just indicated are true and correct 
in every respect? 
20 
MR SADIK:  Correct – agreed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Chair I would then ask – 
may I just indicate Chair that the witnesses agreed to 
assist us further in providing a supplementary affidavit that 
formerly corrects the error in paragraph 152 that he has 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 7 of 246 
 
alerted you to Chair and also to update you on the specific 
changes.  It largely relates to the different role that Mr 
Sadik is now playing with in Denel and he will provide that 
supplementary affidavit and his attorney I should have 
mentioned he is assisted by his attorney Mr Pillay who has 
been here on previous occasions in the Denel stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Evidence and we appreciate his 
cooperation as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Well let us just get him to 
10 
place himself on record properly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pillay.  I think just put on that 
microphone.  Ja I do not know if it is working failing which 
you can go to the one. 
ADV PILLAY:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV PILLAY:  My name is Yagashen Pillay again I confirm 
what Advocate 
Kennedy 
has 
transmitted 
to 
you 
this 
morning. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  May we then on the 
basis that is already indicated ask you – ask your leave 
please 
formerly 
to 
admit 
this 
affidavit 
which 
is 
accompanied by many annexures.  So that is the affidavit 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 8 of 246 
 
that appears at Denel Bundle 11 from page 4 as Exhibit 
W26.  In fact I beg your pardon it fact appears in both 
bundles 
11 
and 
12 
as 
one 
affidavit 
with 
numerous 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Would – may we ask for leave to 
admit the entire affidavit as Exhibit W26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The affidavit of Mr Talib Sadik 
starting at page 4 with its annexures which go up to Denel 
Bundle 12 is admitted and as Exhibit W26. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  And with your leave 
may I lead the witness on the initial issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That appear to uncontroversial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Sadik you set 
out in your affidavit your – the background that you have in 
relation to Denel.  May I just ask you before we get to that 
what is your – what is your overall background by way of 
qualifications and by way of experience before you became 
20 
involved in Denel.? 
MR SADIK:  Chair I am a qualified Chartered Accountant.  I 
studied at the University of Natal and I completed my CA 
exams.  I qualified as a CA at the – around 1991 and since 
then 
I 
have 
been 
mainly 
working 
in 
the 
corporate 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 9 of 246 
 
environment occupying senior finance roles and the role 
that I had occupied for a time at Denel was the Group 
CEO.  So I have over twenty years’ experience. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  And when did you 
first start at Denel as an employee? 
MR SADIK:  I started in Denel as an employee in 2006 as 
the Group CFO in 2006 and then in September 2018 – 2008 
I then took over the role as the acting Group CEO and was 
confirmed in September 2008 as the Group CEO of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And was that before Mr Saloojee was 
10 
appointed as Group CEO? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair he had replaced me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And when was that replacement? 
MR SADIK:  He had replaced me effective from 1 February 
2012. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So you were either acting or 
as the fully fledged as it were GCEO for about four years – 
four or five years, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  When you – did you then leave 
20 
the employ of Denel when Mr Saloojee replaced you as 
Group CEO? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And were you then on the board of 
Denel as you left at that time? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 10 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:  No I was not on the board of Denel at the 
time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But you later joined the board of 
Denel, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct.  I re-joined the board on an 
interim basis in April 2018 and it was confirmed a month 
later.  So I am now part of the current board of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that is the current board of Denel 
under the chairpersonship of Ms Hlahla, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And we have heard evidence 
from her and others that the board in fact started operating 
fully from about May 2018.  So you were there from the 
beginning of the new board – the current board’s term, is 
that correct? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now in addition to the – sorry 
were you executive or non-executive member of the Denel 
board then? 
MR SADIK:  At the time I was a non-executive director on 
20 
the Denel board and I was also appointed Chair of the 
Audit Committee. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that the Audit and Risk Committee 
– is that its full title? 
MR SADIK:  No it is – it was called the Audit Committee. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 11 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I see.  And so you chaired that.  What 
is your current situation in relation to Denel? 
MR SADIK:  Currently with the – from effective 15 August I 
have appointed as the interim Group CEO and I am an ex 
officio member now of the board.  I am still a member of 
the board.  I am no longer the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Because you are now the acting or 
interim Group CEO, is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR SADIK:  Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it is really a role that you 
previously served in Group CEO there was then quite a 
gap; you then came back to Denel in a different capacity as 
a non-executive direction and as Chair of the Audit 
Committee.  But now you back in the hot seat as it were as 
the inter GCEO since August you mentioned I think 18 
August?  Is that of this year? 
MR SADIK:  15 August from 20 – from this year ja 2020. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Thank you.  Who is the current 
chair of the Audit Committee? 
MR SADIK:  The current chair of the Audit Committee is Ms 
Siya Tola she was part of the original board that was 
appointed in April 2018 and she is now taken over the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 12 of 246 
 
chairmanship of the Audit Committee.  We have now 
combined it with the Risk Committee and it is now called 
the Audit and Risk Committee of the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right now in your affidavit we 
obviously going to focus only on some specific points that 
appear to be of particular concern. You set out a number of 
facts to appear to fall if I am – I understand your affidavit 
correctly and please correct me if I am wrong into two 
categories.   
 
There are some facts and events that you were 
10 
personally involved in.  For example you deal with certain 
transactions that occurred while you were Group Chief 
Executive Officer, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The other category relates to some 
events that took place while you had no role at Denel.  For 
example contracts that were entered into while others were 
involved in management particularly Mr Saloojee was in the 
role of Group CEO.  Is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it appears from your affidavit that 
you have dealt with those issues even though you do not 
have personal involvement in them or personal knowledge 
of them.  You were asked by investigators because at the 
time that the request was made you were sitting on the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 13 of 246 
 
board and the chairperson of the Audit Committee to 
address, is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And in that regard in that second 
category you have referred us to – or the Chair to various 
reports that were – that were the product of investigations 
done by various – by various entities, is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you refer at page 6 in your 
affidavit to reports that you received from various entities.  
10 
So 151 refers to a report from – a draft report from 
Dentons that is the 20 January 2016 and that dealt with the 
acquisition of DVS previously known as Land Systems 
South Africa also abbreviated to LSSA, is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then you have corrected the word 
final to read draft in 152.  You have – the draft – there was 
a draft report prepared by Ndidi in GIDI business advisory 
dealing with the review of the process relating to the 
conclusion of the MOA between Denel and VR Laser.  Now 
20 
you have indicated to me that – that it was in fact only a 
draft report as the correction indicates but has there ever 
been a final report submitted by Ndidi? 
MR SADIK:  No there has not been a final report. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Do you know why? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 14 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:  Chair we have made contact with them 
because this draft report that we have does not contain 
any 
annexures 
although 
the 
main 
report 
referred 
to 
annexures.  So we have approached them and they have 
indicated that they did – they no longer wanted to be 
involved in the Denel – in the Denel – to complete the 
assignments. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now but have you furnished to 
the commission whatever you have received from Ndidi? 
MR SADIK:  Yes Chair we have. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now to go back to the Dentons 
draft report.  Has there been a final report in relation to 
the Dentons investigation? 
MR SADIK:  Yes Chair we did receive a final report which 
was presented to the Audit and Risk Committee and then 
presented to the board on Tuesday this past Tuesday which 
would have been the 9 November. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  9 November this week. 
MR SADIK:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and so what is the status of 
20 
that?  You have received that report.  Is that – is that now 
the subject of consideration? 
MR SADIK:  That board – that report Chair was considered 
by the board on the Tuesday and it was noted by the board 
and referred back to the Audit and Risk Committee for the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 15 of 246 
 
consideration of the remedial action to be taken. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right so does that still have to be 
then considered and decided upon any remedial action that 
may be appropriate? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you have referred then in 
paragraph 153 to another report from a different entity 
BDOPS Advisory we can refer to it simply as BDO they 
have submitted a final draft report on an investigation into 
inter 
alia 
non-adherence 
to 
policies 
procedures 
and 
10 
legislation by employees of Denel Corporate Office, Denel 
Land Systems, DLS and LMT as well as DVS.  Now is that 
still at the level of final draft report?  Is it a draft or is it a 
final report or is it a final draft? 
MR SADIK:  It is a final draft report Chair that has been 
approved by the board.  The reason why it is – it remains a 
draft because of the limitation in the information that is 
available.  But is has been approved by the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And you have attached to your 
affidavit as you say at the top of page 7 a copy of the BDO 
20 
report but not the Dentons and Ndidi reports because as 
you say you do not want to make what is already a very 
large volume of paper even larger but you have offered to 
make that available to the commission, is that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 16 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you have also referred in 
paragraph 1.9 to PriceWaterHouse PwC rather.  What did 
they investigate? 
MR SADIK:  Chair they had investigated the loans that was 
granted to LMT over the recent years and we had asked 
them to investigate the process and the approvals process 
that was followed in granting these loans. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you refer in – at the top of page 8 
in paragraph 1.10 to the final report of PwC being expected 
this is the time that – that you writing this to be delivered 
10 
at the end of January 2020 including recommendations.  
Can you give the Chair – is there any update to be 
reported on that?  Has that – is the final version of their 
report actually been received? 
MR SADIK:  Chair the report was received.  It was 
considered by the Audit Committee.  At the time I was the 
chairman of the Audit Committee and there were additional 
work that we felt the PwC should continue with so they are 
now completing that exercise. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then you refer in 1.11 to an 
20 
investigation 
by 
ITIACT 
Pty 
Limited 
to 
assess 
the 
capabilities of Denel’s divisions to determine if the work 
listed in a particular paragraph could have been done 
internally to provide expert opinion.  Now are they the 
defence experts that are referred to in 1.12 of your 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 17 of 246 
 
affidavit 
MR SADIK:  That is – that is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Has – and you say that was 
expected to be delivered by the end of February 2020 we 
now in November  Can you give the Chair please an update 
on that?  Has the – have the Defence experts known as 
ITIACT in fact submitted a report? 
MR SADIK:  Chair they have submitted a very high level 
draft report and we have been working through that.  They 
have not yet finished the exercise and they – we have 
10 
spoken to them recently to try and conclude the exercise 
they have been having challenges on their side but from 
our 
side 
we 
have 
also 
been 
experiencing 
liquidity 
challenges and we were not able to meet the payments that 
was due to them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  May I now deal with some of 
the specific transactions that are the subject of your 
affidavit.  And we can start if we may please at page 9 your 
paragraph 2 deals with financial assistance granted to LMT 
and this is I understand it from your affidavit relates to an 
20 
advanced payment of approximately R12.7 million.  Is that 
right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The full figure the exact amount is set 
out in your paragraph 12 – sorry 2.1.  Correct? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 18 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And this was an advanced payment 
made by DLS that is a division of Denel, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To LMT.  Now we have – the 
commission has heard evidence that LMT was – was 
initially privately owned but then a majority shareholding 
was bought by Denel and the evidence has been that one 
of the objectives was to acquire the capacity redaction of 
capacity of LMT to enable it to be within the Denel group 
10 
so that it would have in-house capacity and would also be 
able to manage it.  Is that your understanding? 
 MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now as I understand your 
evidence the R12.7 million advanced payment was made 
before Denel acquired the 51% shareholding in LMT.  Is 
that right? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now when did this take place the 
advanced payment and was it during the time that you were 
20 
employed by Denel as Group CEO? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair I was the Group CEO and 
the payment was – the agreement was made on the 29 
April 2010. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 19 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:  And 28 June as per clause 213. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Now did you as 
Group CEO at that stage approve the transaction in which 
the R12.7 million was paid as an advanced payment to 
LMT? 
MR SADIK:  Chair we had – we had a Denel Land Systems 
divisional board in place.  I was part of the board at the 
time and we had received a presentation by management 
and part of the board we had approved this transaction. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now essentially why was this 
10 
paid? The other evidence that the Chair has heard in the 
earlier days of these hearings to do with Denel have 
suggested that it was not simply paying in terms of the 
contractual time table for the provision of the goods 
concerned by LMT but it was actually provided as it were 
as a benefit to LMT because they were facing some 
financial difficulties.  Is that correct? 
MR SADIK:  Chair they were a combination of issues 
around LMT and LMT as I point out in paragraph 2.14 the 
you know what caused us to go ahead one of the issues 
20 
was the financial challenges that the company was facing 
but the important thing is that they were the localised 
partner of an international OEM called Patria and the – we 
had then placed a contract on them called a trunnion 
contract.  And on that contract we had paid 25% of that 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 20 of 246 
 
trunnion contract as an advanced payment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But are the other witnesses 
correct to the effect that if you had simply followed the 
letter of the contract between DLS and LMT you were not 
due to make that payment but this was as it were a 
concession to LMT.  It was a way of assisting them to get 
an advanced payment which they were not contractually 
entitled to but which you were persuaded to pay in order 
primarily to assist them in a situation of a financial 
difficulty. 
10 
MR SADIK:  Chair we – when we place a contract we 
normally will pay a supplier an advanced payment which is 
generally about 25% of the contract value.  So it is on that 
basis we made the – we – so it was part of our normal 
course of business to make a portion of the pre-payment 
especially when a contract is quite material. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you have referred… 
MR SADIK:  I am sorry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that you are saying you dispute 
20 
the evidence of those witnesses who said this payment of 
R12.7 million was a way of coming to the assistance in 
terms of it being an advanced payment giving assistance to 
LMT to assist it deal with its financial difficulties. 
MR SADIK:  Correct Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 21 of 246 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that you dispute that evidence? 
MR SADIK:  I would say I would dispute it because it was 
based on the contract that we have placed on them and on 
that contract we had given them 25% of the value of the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You dispute it completely or you say 
that consideration was one of the considerations and not 
necessarily the only consideration? 
MR SADIK:  Chair the latter is – it was not the only 
consideration it was one of the considerations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To assist them. 
MR SADIK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  In paragraph 218 
you say that the pre-payment was not precluded by any 
law, treasury directive or instruction or policy of Denel and 
so you say it was therefore not unlawful to make the 
advanced payment and not unusual commercial practice at 
Denel and the industry.  You stand by that evidence? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Then you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am sorry.  Earlier on you said 
something to the effect that advanced payments were 
normal or abnormal at Denel that is where normal during 
your time.  If you say they were normal it might mean that 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 22 of 246 
 
they 
happened 
with 
a 
certain 
degree 
of 
regularity 
frequency.  They happened with a certain degree of 
frequency.  It may mean that – is that what you intend to 
convey or is the position that they were not a norm but 
they did occur from some time to time. 
MR SADIK:  Chair it was a norm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were norm. 
MR SADIK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then in paragraph 219 you say this is 
10 
ordinarily done in recognition that large manufacturing 
contracts demand a cash outlay and financial commitment 
which a manufacturer may sometimes not be able to meet 
or unwilling to carry at full risk. 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And in this case were you satisfied 
that LMT was in a financial situation that it could not carry 
the risk upfront you would need to – you would need to 
follow the norm.  It was justifiable to follow the norm and 
make an advanced payment. 
20 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now what seems to have been slightly 
different about this is apparent from paragraph 217.  
Normally Denel would seek advanced payment guarantee 
from a bank on behalf of a supplier but due to weak 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 23 of 246 
 
financial position of LMT Denel accepted alternative forms 
of guarantees.  So are you saying that they were not able 
to get a bank guarantee which you would normally expect 
and require? 
MR SADIK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you say that you accepted other 
forms of guarantees other than a bank guarantee.  Can you 
recall what sort of guarantees were provided by LMT? 
MR SADIK:  Chair not in the exact detail but it would have 
been guarantees over their assets in particular their 
10 
debtors’ book and some of the IP that they would have 
owned as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And some of the other 
witnesses have dealt in some detail with that.  And you 
confirm that after this advanced payment it happened that 
LMT’s 
majority 
shareholding 
was 
– 
the 
majority 
shareholding in LMT rather was acquired by Denel? 
MR SADIK:  Ja part of the arrangement to secure the 
guarantee Chair we had a section to convert our - well, 
really as security.  So if we believe we need to get closer to 
20 
the business or it is an option for us to convert that into an 
equity, which is what we then did.  At the time when we gave 
them the loan...  Oh, sorry, not the loan, the prepayment.   
 
We had an option to acquire 70% of the company and we 
then brought in another shareholder who came in as a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 24 of 246 
 
consortium and we then converted that option of 70% in to a 
51% stake in LMT.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was the other entity that you brought 
into the consortium Pamodzi? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Are you aware that LMT, in fact, 
wanted to bring in a different entity as a BBBEE partner into 
the consortium, a company known as Beryl?  Are you aware 
of that and that Denel said no, they wanted rather to have 
Pamodzi.  Are you aware of that? 
10 
MR SADIK:   No, Chair I am not aware of that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you then deal in 
paragraphs 2.3 and 2.4 with an advance payment of 
R 5.7 million relating to the Malaysian Tarots Contract in 
2011 and a R 378 million loan by Denel to LMT which was 
the total of various individual loans.  In respect of both, you 
say you have no personal knowledge of these? 
MR SADIK:   That is right Chair.  It happened when I was not 
part of Denel in any way. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now.  Well, was the Malaysian 
20 
transaction not during your time?  It says in 2.3 that that 
took place in July 2011. 
MR SADIK:   Sorry.  Chair, yes it was during my time but I 
have no knowledge of that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 25 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then the big amounts of loans from 
Denel to LMT.  Was that after your time there? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, now let us get to the next 
transaction which is dealt with in paragraph 3 from page 14 
and that is the Platform Hulls Contract and as you point out 
in 3.1.1.  VR Laser was appointed with that contract in 2014 
10 
to provide Platform Hulls.  Now you had already left by that 
stage in 2012, correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So as I understand it Mr Sadik.  You do 
not have personal knowledge of what went on but what your 
affidavit then goes on and then being requested by the 
investigators to deal with this.  It goes on to deal with what 
the BDO Report then investigated and made findings on.  
And it is your affidavit’s section that starts here.  A summary 
of what comes out of the BDO Report. 
20 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now did you say that the BDO 
Report has been accepted by the Audit Committee? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the Board of Denel? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 26 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   That is also by the Board of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did they make certain findings and 
recommendations? 
MR SADIK:   Yes, Chair the report did make findings and 
recommendations which the board has, to a large extent, 
have 
followed 
through 
with 
those 
findings 
and 
recommendations. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now can you indicate just by 
way of a brief summary because there has been evidence in 
relation to what actually happened in this contract.  And 
10 
also, the BDO Report is an extensive report which you have 
attached.  In fact, can I just ask you please to look at 
page 61, the first annexure to your affidavit? 
MR SADIK:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the first page of the BDP 
Report? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And that runs, it seems, to 300 
pages and attached to the 300 pages, in turn, a whole lot of 
annexures.   
20 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now can you just summarise in 
a few sentences please for the Chair’s assistance what the 
bottom line is of the BDO Report’s findings in relation to 
whether there was anything improper or unlawful done in 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 27 of 246 
 
relation to the awarding of the DLS contract for Platform 
Hulls to VRL? 
MR SADIK:   Sure.  So, Chair there were three contracts or 
three big contracts that were entered into with VR Laser, 
with the VR Laser Group.  One was the Platform Hulls 
Contract.   
 
The others were two Memorandums of Understanding.  
One of the Memorandums of Understanding was between 
Denel Land Systems, which was a division of Denel and the 
VR Laser Group.   
10 
 
And the other, which was the subsidiary of Denel called 
DVS and there was a Memorandum of Agreement between 
VR Laser Group and Denel Vehicle Systems which we 
abbreviate as DVS.   
 
 
So what the investigation found is that all three of 
those contracts were irregular.  That they have not followed 
proper process as specified in terms of Treasury Regulations 
and also in terms of the company policy of Denel.   
 
And as a result of that, the report from BDO had 
recommended 
that 
pursue 
both 
civil, 
criminal 
and 
20 
disciplinary 
action 
against 
relevant 
individuals 
in 
the 
company.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now when you say there was 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
Treasury 
Regulations and also Denel’s own internal processes, does 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 28 of 246 
 
that relate to Supply Chain Management, procurement 
requirements of law or does it involve other measures or 
both? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, I think it probably would have been a 
whole host of regulations.  One in particular was around 
Supply Chain non-compliance.  I think one may say it was 
also against the Constitution of South Africa as well.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SADIK:   So it probably was larger than Supply Chain. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you then mention that 
10 
action was recommended to bring criminal and civil legal 
proceedings as well as internal disciplinary proceedings 
against individuals.  Would that be employees of Denel? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, they were former employees of Denel 
and there are some current employees of Denel that has 
been implicated as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if I can take you please to page 
24? 
MR SADIK:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And here we are dealing with the 
20 
Hoefyster Platform Hulls Contract.   
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We will get to the other two contracts 
that you have mentioned in a moment.  You appear to be 
summarising findings from the BDO Report that the closed 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 29 of 246 
 
tender process and signing off on the seven year contract 
was non-compliant with the policy stated above and it was 
irregular expenditure   
 
And then you have referred to Mr Burger in particular in 
3.6.2.1.  He was the one who actually signed the MOA 
notwithstanding having the knowledge that the Group SCM 
Executive disapproved.   
 
And then Mr Saloojee as the ultimate approver of the 
appointment of VR Laser.  Now has any action been taken 
against these individuals at the level of disciplinary action? 
10 
MR SADIK:   Chair, no we have not taken any disciplinary 
action because they no longer in the company. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did they resign? 
MR SADIK:   Both of them are...  Mr Burger did resign. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR SADIK:   And I think Mr Saloojee, his contract would 
have ended at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  In fact, he has given evidence to 
that effect.  In fact, that was by agreement that he would 
then leave before the end of his contract but would be paid 
20 
out for the balance of the contract or a portion of the 
balance.  Is that right? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, I have no knowledge of that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you not involved at the time that 
that was done? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 30 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   No, I was not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that done at the time of the board 
prior to the board on which you served under Ms Hlahla?  
Was 
it 
the 
prior 
board 
headed 
by 
Mr 
Mantsha 
as 
chairperson? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you mentioned also the 
recommendation by BDO that criminal and civil legal action 
be taken.  Let us deal with the criminal action first.  3.6.3 
refers to action being taken by the current Chief Executive 
10 
Officer of Denel.  Who was that at the time you signed this 
affidavit at the beginning of February this year? 
MR SADIK:   It was Mr Daniel du Toit who was at the time 
the Group CEO of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he has since left.  Is that right? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was it Mr Du Toit that you then 
had replaced as interim CEO since August? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So Mr Du Toit, based on the 
20 
recommendations of the BDO Report, you say has taken 
action at the level of a criminal complaint under POCA.  Is 
that right?  The Prevention of Organised Crime Act in 
relation to this transaction.  Is that right? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 31 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now are you aware of that because at 
the time the criminal complaint was laid, were you then 
chairing the Audit Committee of Denel? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And have you in that capacity 
or since then as interim or acting Group CEO since 
Mr Du Toit left, are you still monitoring that process? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, we are monitoring it, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And can you inform the Chair from your 
own knowledge.  Has there been any progress in the police 
10 
investigation and has any prosecution in fact started to your 
knowledge? 
MR SADIK:   Not to my knowledge but there was a meeting 
held between the NPA and the Hawks on this matter. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is Denel cooperating with the 
Hawks in this regard? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR SADIK:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now.  So you refer in 3.6.4 to the fact 
20 
that Burger and Saloojee had both left.  So it was not 
possible to take disciplinary action.  And then you refer in 
3.6.5 to the investigation that we mentioned earlier.  Apart 
from BDO, you also have had the investigation undertaken 
by ITI.  They are the defence experts.  Is that right? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 32 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that report is still not finalised. 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you indicated that that will 
consider whether or not Denel suffered any financial loss 
from contracts from VR Laser including the Platform Hulls 
Contract.  So is there investigation currently underway.  
Does that extent beyond the Platform Hulls Contract and 
look also at the two single source, single supply contracts 
awarded by DLS and DVS? 
10 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair.  They are looking at all 
of the dealings between the Denel Group and VR Laser to 
see whether the work could have been in-house.  And also, if 
it was outsourced, you know, that we pay fair market related 
rates for that.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you have indicated 
that if once that investigation is complete and you get the 
report from these experts, ITI, that may be able to establish 
whether or not you have actually suffered losses.  And if so, 
what sort of amount and will you take action, potentially, 
20 
based on the outcome of that report once it comes? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair.  And that will form the 
basis for our civil action. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Next you deal from page 26, 
paragraph 4 with another contract that you have mentioned 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 33 of 246 
 
briefly in passing earlier and that is the MOA between DLS 
and VR Laser.  You mentioned also earlier a Memorandums 
of Understanding.   
 
The Chair has heard evidence and there is a lot of 
documents before the Commission as well which indicate 
that in respect of that this transaction, there was initially a 
Memorandum of Understanding and that was later converted 
into a Memorandum of Agreement.  Is that correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And has the award and the conclusion 
10 
of that contract, the MOA with VR Laser from DLS’ side, has 
that also been a subject of investigation? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair.  That was subject to the 
BDO Investigation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The BDO Investigation? 
MR SADIK:   The BDO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, BDO? 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I beg your pardon.  And you refer also 
to ITC Act also looking at aspects of that.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now this MOA specifically was 
a contract in terms of which VR Laser was appointed as 
single supplier by DLS.  Is that correct?  Is that your 
understanding? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 34 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   Yes, that is my understanding based on the 
BDO Report. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Was this for work over and above 
the Platform Hulls Contract? 
MR SADIK:   I would have assumed it is all the work that 
would have been required. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now again, this was concluded, I 
believe, in 2015.  Is that correct?   
10 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And again, you were not involved, 
either at management or board level of Denel at that stage.  
Is that correct?   
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you cannot help us with facts that 
comes from your own personal knowledge about what 
happened within Denel with VR Laser in relation to this 
transaction? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now again, is your knowledge of 
information that you set out from page 26, based on what 
you have picked up from the BDO Report? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now again, may I just you to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 35 of 246 
 
just in a sentence or two to indicate what your understanding 
is of the bottom-line of the BDO Report in respect of this 
particular transaction, the Single Supplier MOA between DLS 
and VR Laser?  What were there overall findings and 
recommendations? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, this was a single source arrangement 
when there were other suppliers that could form something 
similar in South Africa.  It was also quite a long contract and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was that period? 
10 
MR SADIK:   It was ten years. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR SADIK:   I think.  Yes.  And the Head of Supply Chain at 
the time, according to the BDO Report had objected to 
entering into a long-term contract with this.  And the 
management at the time went ahead and finalised the 
contract. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you refer on page 29, paragraph 
4.6.1, in fact, :  
“A passage from the BDO Report which implicates 
20 
Mr Burger, Mr Wessels and Mr Saloojee in relation 
to the recommendation and approval of the deal in 
question 
and 
this 
was 
done 
irregularly 
in 
contravention 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
National 
Treasury Supply Chain Management Guide, as well 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 36 of 246 
 
as the Denel Supply Chain Management document 
of 2014.   
It refers to a total payment of R 107 million for in 
particular financial years being irregular expenditure 
as defined by the PFMA.” 
 
So is this what BDO found? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And have you accepted this particular 
finding of the BDO Report? 
MR SADIK:   Yes, we have. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now in addition to Mr Burger, 
Mr Wessels and Mr Saloojee being implicated by BDO in 
their report in the passage that I have just quoted from.   
 
You indicate in the next paragraph 4.6.2 that in DD(?) 
report which we know was never finalised, has also identified 
other people who may have been – who are implicated in 
irregularity.  They too identify Mr Saloojee and Mr Burger.  
We see that in 4.6.2.1 and 4.6.2.2.  Correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then it seems some additional 
20 
people that were not identified by BDO but were identified in 
DD, the top of page 31, Mr Reenen Teubes.  Correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Wessels had already been 
mentioned by BDO but in 4.6.2.5 in DD also made findings in 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 37 of 246 
 
relation to Zulake and Tshepe.  Correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As well as Mr Denise Govender, the 
former Chief Legal Officer. 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right? 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now did BDO recommend that Denel 
take 
any 
action, 
such 
as 
disciplinary 
action, 
criminal 
prosecution and civil action arising from the irregularities 
10 
identified in relation to this MOA between DLS and VR 
Laser? 
MR SADIK:   Yes, they did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that similar to what they had 
recommended in relation to the other contract, then Platform 
Hulls Contract? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 And 
have 
you 
accepted 
that 
recommendation, did you? 
MR SADIK:   Yes, we have and we have acted on it by 
20 
reporting it to the police. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   By the reporting it to...? 
MR SADIK:   To the South African Police Service. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And do you know whether that is still 
being investigated, whether any progress has been made, 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 38 of 246 
 
whether there is any prosecution? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, we are fully cooperating with them.  We 
have a case number and there has been ongoing inquires 
and we have responded to that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Did BDO also recommended you 
should take disciplinary action to the extent it was possible? 
MR SADIK:   Yes, they have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was it in fact possible to take 
disciplinary action? 
MR SADIK:   We, at the moment, are processing it and will 
10 
continue with that.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you say in 4.6.4 except for 
Mr Teubes and Mr Douglas Masuku and Nkolisi Makatini.  
None of the presidents referred to the reports are still in the 
employee of Denel.  So presumably that is why you have not 
disciplined Mr Wessels or Mr Burger all Mr Saloojee because 
they have left the employ. 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right? 
MR SADIK:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But what about the people who 
are still in the employ, Mr Teubes, for example?  DD 
implicated Mr Teubes in their Provisional draft report which 
has not been found the last.  Has any action being taken 
against him thus far and is any action possible?  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 39 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   At this stage no action has been taken but 
action is possible and we intend to do that.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Of course under the Labour 
law, one is required to bring disciplinary proceedings quite 
speedily.  I don't want you to argue any possible objections 
that might be racing that regard but can you just comment on 
why...   
 
Firstly, when did you receive the BDO report?  And why 
are you still in the process of considering whether or not to 
take disciplinary action against Mr Teubes?  
10 
MR SADIK:   Chair, the individuals that have been mentioned 
here refer to in the DD reports which was a draft report and 
we need to, you know, we were hoping to finalise that report 
before we could take action.   In the BDO report, they have 
identified the individuals with Denel but they did not specify 
these individuals.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.   
MR SADIK:   So the reference here is from the draft in the 
DD Report.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I have no doubt that the citizens out 
20 
there who know that public money is at stake will be 
interested in the level of accountability ...[intervenes]  
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...on the part of Denel’s management 
and its board and people such as yourself.  are you able to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 40 of 246 
 
tell the Chair to what extent you may be addressing these 
issues that have arisen from these various reports?  
MR SADIK:   We are addressing them to the extent we can 
and we believe we are making good progress but these are 
the outstanding individuals that we need to follow through.  
With some of them they were charged or they were 
allegations with him on other matters which we then 
concluded 
the 
investigation 
on. 
 And 
some 
of 
those 
individuals were cleared on those other matters.  So we will 
now proceed with the next stage.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  You then deal from page 33, it 
is quite a long section in your paragraph 5 that is headed, 
the 
Armscor/Hoefyster 
Contract. 
 
and 
specifically 
the 
procurement process followed in contracting Patria for the 
usage of this Vehicle Platform for the Hoefyster vehicle 
various.  Was that also the subject of investigation by BDO 
or anyone else?  
MR SADIK:   Chair, It wasn't really an investigation as such 
but it is more the factual situation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  now you have set out in some 
20 
detail the background and what - and you were asked 
specific questions.  For example, if I can take you two page 
37, paragraph 5.5?  Why DLS did not send personnel to 
Finland from LMT and/or BAE But instead decided to 
capacitate personnel, et cetera.  That is the question.  Who 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 41 of 246 
 
raised that question?  Was that a question from the 
investigators off the Commission?  
MR SADIK:   From the Commission, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So you were asked to 
specifically deal with these aspects?  
MR SADIK:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I don't propose unless the chair 
would direct me to.  I do not propose to go through this 
section. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is not really necessary because the 
10 
report is there.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May we then turned to what seems to 
require some focus at page 46 and that is your paragraph 6 
and that is the Denel’s acquisition of all LSSA, BAE.  Now 
known as Denel’s Vehicle Systems, a division of Denel.   
 
Now 
there 
is 
some 
evidence 
in 
relation 
to 
this 
transaction previously.  as I understand it and please correct 
me if I'm wrong in my summary.  As I understand it, BAE is 
20 
the British defence entity.  Correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   and it earned a local entity that was 
referred to as Land Systems South Africa. 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 42 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Because it is a South African 
subsidiary. 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Involved in defence item manufacture.  
is that right?  
MR SADIK:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And BAE then sold its shares in LSSA 
to the Denel holding company.  Is that right?  
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that hearing your 10 year as 
10 
Group CEO? 
MR SADIK:   It was not Char. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   When did it take place?  
MR SADIK:   It took place during 2014 and 2015.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So again, are you simply 
providing information to the Commission at its investigators’ 
request and you do so on the basis of what you have been 
able to glean from the report of those who investigated it?  
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Right. 
 
Now 
who 
has 
been 
20 
investigating that?  
MR SADIK:   There was a firm called Dentons. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
MR 
SADIK: 
 
 
Dentons 
Forensic 
Investigators 
had 
investigated that acquisition. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 43 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you mention Dentons right in the 
beginning offer evidence when will refer to the reports all 
various entities and you mentioned that Dentons had given 
an interim report or a draft report and that that has now been 
supplanted by final report.  Is that the Reporter received on 
the Tuesday?  
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So your affidavit, as I 
understand it, reflects a summary that you have made of the 
broad findings and recommendations of Dentons in the 
10 
interim draught report. 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right?  
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now are you willing to make available 
to the Commission if it requires it, the final report of 
Dentons? 
MR SADIK:   Yes, Chair.  The Board at its review session on 
Tuesday agreed that a final report should be forwarded to 
the Commission.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  If you could please arrange for 
that to be done if it hasn't been done yet.  
MR SADIK:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now we don't have that report in front 
of us now.  I do not think we necessarily have to because 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 44 of 246 
 
hopefully you can assist the Commission.  have you been 
through that final report?  
MR SADIK:   Yes, I have been through the final report Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And had you previously gone through 
the interim report which is summarised in your affidavit? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair.  I have, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  We are going to look at the..  
We are going to ask you in a moment for you to summarise 
the broad findings and recommendations from the interim 
report.  Are you able to tell the chair whether the final report 
10 
in substantial material ways differs from the interim report?  
MR SADIK:   Chair, It does not.  Probably 95% is what was 
in the final report.  Sorry.  That was in the draft. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Is there anything in the final 
report that deviates in any material way from your summary 
of the interim report in your affidavit?  
MR SADIK:   Not in a material way Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now can you please summarise 
for the chair please the broad findings and recommendations 
that come out from both the interim and the final report of 
20 
Dentons?  
MR SADIK:   Chair, this Investigation dealt with the 
acquisition of Land System South Africa by Denel.  the 
shareholding based in Land System South Africa was BAE, 
which on the majority stake.   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 45 of 246 
 
 
And there was a local consortium called DG BGD 
Technologies that owned a minority stake.  Denel Acquired 
this company for about R 855 million.   
 
And the findings from the Dentons report is that we have 
not fully complied with the approvals that we have received 
from the minister in terms of the conditions and in one 
particular condition related to the funding arrangements off 
the transactions become more onerous will become onerous 
to Denel.   
 
Denel had to revert to the minister to inform the minister 
10 
on the changing of the funding mechanism And that did not 
happen.  So the big part of the Dentons Report focused 
around compliance issues to the PFMA.   
 
They also looked at the strategic rationale of the 
acquisition 
and 
they looked 
at the evaluation of the 
business.   Under compliance at the time Minister Brown 
was the Public Enterprises Minister and her view – and 
Minister Nene, I think was the Finance Minister at the time 
and the condition that was put on is that we were – Denel 
had acquired Land Systems South Africa through two loans 
20 
that were arranged.   
One was with Nedbank and the other was with ABSA 
and in the original PFMA application the PFMA application 
process stated that the loan with Nedbank will be a five 
year loan but in fact once the acquisition was busy being 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 46 of 246 
 
concluded Nedbank had changed the loan terms to five 
months, as a bridging finance.   
So that was quite a substantial change in the 
funding arrangement and in terms of the conditions that 
Denel had received in the PFMA we had revert to the 
ministers on the change, which we had not done. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now did – if I can take you to page 
59, paragraph 68.18.  You refer in your summary of the 
Dentons’ – the interim Dentons’ report to a finding by 
Dentons 
that 
Mr 
Saloojee 
and 
Mr 
Mhlontlo 
were 
10 
responsible for these nondisclosures and in particular Mr 
Mhlontlo as the then Group CFO appears to have been 
primarily responsible for that.   
Now has any action been taken against Mr Saloojee 
or Mr Mhlontlo in that regard? 
MR SADIK:   So Chair, now that we have seen – we have 
noted the report at the board, it has been referred to audit 
and risk committee for the remedial action to be taken.  We 
have instructed senior counsel to review the report and to 
advise the board accordingly. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   They, of course, we know have left 
the employ of Denel some time back after they were 
charged but ultimately no disciplined for various other 
allegations, so they cannot be disciplined now because 
they have long since left, correct? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 47 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   They are no longer in the organisation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  You have mentioned that you 
were taking senior counsel’s advice.   You refer at page 60 
in your paragraph 682, right at the end of your affidavit, 
just above where you signed it, you say: 
“The board has taken legal advice about recovery of 
any financial prejudice suffered as a result of the 
conduct of the officials identified.  Denel is yet to 
determine whether and if so how much financial 
prejudice has been caused to Denel.  It is when it is 
10 
determined what amounts are recoverable from the 
implicated individuals that Denel will institute such 
recovery legal process as is appropriate.” 
Now that, of course, was your affidavit as at the 9 February 
2020.  Has there been any update to report to the Chair of 
this Commission as to whether Denel has since determined 
whether you have suffered financial prejudice and if so, 
how much? 
MR SADIK:   Chair, in the final Dentons’ report it highlights 
the interest differential during the bridging loan duration so 
20 
that has been included in the final report but we are  - we 
are going to be engaging with senior counsel who right now 
has been instructed and to go through – some of it has 
been 
reputational 
damage 
that 
Denel 
has 
suffered 
especially with the bankers that were providing the loans 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 48 of 246 
 
to 
the 
company 
and 
also 
the 
way 
we 
funded 
the 
transactions  So we will go through that process, so it is 
still in progress. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  My attention is directed to an aspect 
which I went through quite quickly to do with the LMT 
prepayment.  If I can take you back to page 11.  What you 
have said in your affidavit at page 11 paragraph 214 is: 
“The decision to make an advance payment to LMT 
was made in recognition of cash liquidity challenges 
that LMT was experiencing at the time and taking 
10 
into account the importance of LMT, the localised 
partner of Patria, the timeous delivery of Hoefyster 
milestones.” 
I would just like to clarify, you used the term earlier that it 
was the norm at Denel and in the industry for advance 
payments to be made such as this.  Presumably if it was 
truly a norm that was uniformly applied it would not depend 
on whether LMT had financial challenges whether you 
might be vulnerable if they were delayed by anything, you 
would automatically give them an advance payment.   
20 
Am I right in understanding that it happened 
frequently, 
as 
you 
told 
the 
Chair 
earlier, 
but 
not 
automatically?  Is that right? 
MR 
SADIK: 
 
 
It 
generally 
would 
have 
happened 
automatically because in the conditions one would say a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 49 of 246 
 
percentage as an advance payment to a contract and the 
reason why this is highlighted in the way it is, is that we 
had made available the advance payment without a proper 
bank guarantee.  That was outside of the norm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then in 217, at the foot of 
this page: 
“The payment to LMT was intended to pay its 
business critical creditors to ensure LMT continued 
to operate as a going-concern.  To that end DLS put 
in place measures that monitored the application or 
10 
use of cash by LMT with a view to ensuring that the 
money was not applied other than for the intended 
purpose.” 
Is that correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, that seems to convey to me 
something a little different from what I believe you said 
earlier on.  The payment to LMT, that is still a reference to 
the advance payment, is it not?  Or not? 
MR 
SADIK: 
 
 
It 
is 
the 
advance 
payment, 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
“...was 
intended 
to 
pay 
its 
business 
critical 
creditors to ensure LMT continued to operate as a 
going-concern.” 
That seems to me to say the purpose of the advance 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 50 of 246 
 
payment was to enable LMT to address its financial 
difficulties involving its creditors. 
MR SADIK:   Chair it was on the back of a contract that we 
had entered into with LMT and we had paid them a 25%.  
What we used to – what we did not do, Chair, is we did not 
specify when we gave a company a contract to use it for 
the particular contract.  So generally the funds of the 
supplier would have been pooled into the overall cash 
resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say what you have just said 
10 
now, are you talking in general that whenever you made 
advance payments to any supplier it was not specified in 
the contract for what purpose that payment was to be 
made? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you say? 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which in one way at one level could be 
interpreted as meaning that the supplier was free to use it 
in whatever way.  Is that a fair interpretation?  Could that 
20 
be a fair interpretation? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that is rather strange to me 
because whenever one talks of an advance payment in the 
context of two parties doing business such as would be the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 51 of 246 
 
case, I would imagine, with an SOE and a supplier, I have 
always thought that the advance payment – the purpose of 
the advance payment is to assist the supplier in carrying 
out or honouring its obligations under the contract.   
An example, the supplier undertakes in terms of the 
contract it concludes with Denel to deliver a certain 
product to acquire and deliver certain product to Denel by 
a certain date.  That product is very expensive and 
therefore it is agreed between Denel and the supplier that 
at least give me so much in advance, an advance payment, 
10 
not the whole amount, but it is going to – the intention is to 
assist it, the supplier, in buying the product or making the 
product, if they are supposed to manufacture a product, it 
is not supposed to – that advance payment is not meant to 
be used by the supplier for other things and then fail to 
deliver in terms of the contract so that that would be my – 
that is my understanding of what the purpose of an 
advance payment is in those cases where it takes place 
but from what you say, with Denel, with regard to the 
advance payments that it used to be involved in that, that 
20 
was not necessarily the purpose, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair, and just to expand of 
that.  It was a similar policy with the advance payments 
that we received from our customers where we had put it 
into a pool account and then we will decide how to use the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 52 of 246 
 
cash and that has been one of the lessons we have now 
learnt, you know, because if you look at where Denel finds 
itself today, we have used advance payments that we have 
received from our customers for other purposes as well to 
fund our general working capital or to fund acquisitions, 
etcetera. 
 
So, 
for 
instance, 
if 
you 
look 
at 
the 
LSSA 
acquisition, there we had used an advanced payment under 
Hoefyster project to fund that transaction, to repay the 
loan that the bank had provided.  So that is the lessons 
10 
learnt in terms of the turnaround that we are busy with 
right now, is to put in more stronger measures around that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it seems to – and you must tell me 
whether you do not agree, it seems to me that it should be 
illegitimate 
to 
make 
and 
advance 
payment 
on 
the 
understanding that the supplier can use that money for 
whatever they like. 
MR SADIK:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I am going – if you are Denel and we 
enter into contract, I must manufacture something for you 
20 
and you give me an advance payment and I go and buy a 
nice Porsche or BMW with that money, does not look 
legitimate. 
MR SADIK:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you agree?  Why must I – I must 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 53 of 246 
 
wait and work for my money, get paid, then I can buy my 
Porsche or whatever. 
MR SADIK:   Ja, I absolutely agree with you, Chair.  I 
stand to be corrected but I think legislatively we probably 
need to tighten that up a bit more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Because imagine if you take 
taxpayers’ money and give me and advance payment and I 
do exactly that, go and buy a Porsche or whatever 
expensive car, the next thing, when I am supposed to 
deliver, in terms of the contract I cannot deliver because I 
10 
do not have money anymore or that kind of – and yet you 
had given me advance payment.  You understand? 
MR SADIK:   I fully agree with you, Chair, and this is one 
of the issues that our current board has. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
MR SADIK:   You know, in terms of turning around.  It is 
not only advance payments that we receive, Chair, or 
make, it is also payments that we received from our cuss 
right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SADIK:   So what we have recently done, Chair, is that 
we have said - for instance, one of our – an essential 
service we provide is to the air force.  So the air force 
pays us on a regular basis.  So we have now ring fenced 
the cash that we have received from the air force to use it 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 54 of 246 
 
or resources that is required to execute the air force’s 
contract.  Until recently we did not do that.  We were 
pooling the funds.  So now we are also – we are going 
further than just advance payments, it is also regular 
payments that we received from our customers to ensure 
that they are being used for the contract of that customer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If  I may, Mr 
Sadik, conclude your evidence by raising an issue which is 
not deal with in your affidavit, it was only raised in the 
10 
affidavits of others, in particular Mr Burger and he has 
referred to the fact that you participated in television 
interviews I believe on two occasions, is that correct? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just identify for the Chair please 
what the two TV stations were? 
MR SADIK:   One was on eNCA and the other was on the 
SABC Morning Live.  On the eNCA it was a programme 
called The Fix. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The Fix, is that with the journalist 
20 
Karima Brown? 
MR SADIK:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Mr Burger has complained about 
those interviews and particularly the one on the fix.  Just 
tell the Chair please how it came about that you were 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 55 of 246 
 
interviewed? 
MR 
SADIK: 
 
Chair, 
we 
had 
made 
a 
parliamentary 
presentation 
providing 
an 
update 
on 
all 
of 
the 
investigations that we were busy with and this in particular 
dealt with the creation of Denel Asia and the VR Laser 
Group as well.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you solicit the interview or did 
the TV stations contact you? 
MR SADIK:   We were contacted by the media. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now what essentially did you 
10 
say on eNCA?   
MR SADIK:   On eNCA, Chair, the focus of the discussions 
was around the transactions with the VR Laser Group and 
Denel Asia and the point we had stated as that based on 
the investigations we had completed which was the BDO 
investigation.  Those contracts with Denel were found to be 
irregular and the recommendation from BDO, one of it was 
to pursue – a couple, was to pursue civil and criminal 
actions against the individuals and that is what I had 
stated in that interview and then the other question I was 
20 
asked later on in the interview was who was on the board 
of Denel Asia and on the board of Denel Asia I made the 
comment that there were from the Denel side it was Mr 
Burger and Mr Ntshepe.  At the time Mr Burger was the 
CEO of DLS and Mr Ntshepe was the Group CEO at the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 56 of 246 
 
time and on the Denel Asia side representing the other 
shareholder in Denel Asia it was Mr van der Merwe and Mr 
Singhala.   
I made the point that Mr van der Merwe was – I was 
not sure whether he was still the current or former legal 
adviser of the Gupta family and I had also stated in that 
interview that the other shareholder in Denel Asia was a 
company called VR Laser Asia and these were Hong Kong 
based companies and the hundred percent shareholder of 
VR Laser Asia was Mr Salim Essa. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Mr Burger has in two sections of 
his 
affidavit 
alleged 
that 
you 
were 
misleading 
and 
defamatory in what you said in these interviews, that it was 
untrue.  He has explained at some length in his affidavit 
and he is going to be giving evidence as our next witness, 
so we will be dealing with that, but he has given his 
version as to why he says the various transactions dealing 
with VR Laser both locally in the DLS agreements and also 
the VR Laser Asia and the Denel Asia venture, why all of 
those were above board and lawful.  But what he has aid 
20 
is, not only that you were defaming him by saying that he 
had improperly and unlawfully, that one of the main points 
he seems to make is this.  I am not going to take you to 
the affidavit, I am just going to read out a few words that 
he uses, that he says these allegations – he considers 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 57 of 246 
 
these allegations to be defamatory misleading albeit part 
of a popular and yet irresponsible narrative in which it is 
suggested that Denel was the subject of state capture.  If I 
may just have a moment, Chair?   
Just for the record may I just place on record that 
allegation is made in Mr Burger ’s affidavit in Denel bundle, 
volume 10, page 611, paragraph 11 and later in his 
affidavit at page 642 of the same bundle, Mr Burger says 
again: 
“I have previously averted to the statement made by 
10 
Mr Sadik…” 
And that, in its context, is the statement you made in the 
television interviews. 
“…that Denel has decided to law criminal charges 
against certain individuals and will also institute 
civil action in order to…” 
Sorry, record, it says, presumably means recover. 
“…monies and losses suffered by Denel.” 
And this is the point I want to raise for your attention and 
reply please, Mr Sadik.   He says: 
20 
“It is no small coincidence that Mr Saloojee was not 
mentioned by name during the interview with Ms 
Karima Brown on the television programme The Fix 
on the 4 August 2019.  This is, of course, because 
Saloojee trumpets the popular narrative.” 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 58 of 246 
 
Now, Mr Sadik, I am going to ask you to comment on that 
but before I give you that opportunity I just want to indicate 
to the overall thread of Mr Burger ’s affidavit in this regard, 
as we understand it.  He effectively is saying to the Chair 
of this Commission that the allegations of state capture 
relating to Denel Land Systems in which he was CEO and 
he also had some role in relation to DVS, to a limited 
extent as well, but all of these allegations that had been 
raised about irregularity have got nothing to do with state 
capture, it has nothing to do with any improper relationship 
10 
between 
VR 
Laser 
and 
the 
Guptas 
and 
improper 
relationship between them and anybody at Denel, including 
himself, and in fact, as I understand his evidence – and we 
will be asking him questions about this – he seems to be 
suggesting this, that the allegations of state capture are 
raised as a stratagem, as a ruse, as a pretext to try and 
deflect attention from the real reasons for Denel being in           
such a serious operational and financial crisis and that was 
bad decision-making and bad management of Denel by 
those responsible other than Mr Burger and that people are 
20 
trying to avoid responsibility, people such as Mr Saloojee 
himself.   
So he saying that when you made these statements 
on television in the interviews and referred particularly to 
the Gupta connection that you were part of a campaign by 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 59 of 246 
 
people at Denel to try wrongly to blame the problems being 
faced by Denel relating to non-completion of projects such 
as Hoefyster, serious financial problems in which you have 
been, and still are, seeking bailouts from government, that 
all of this is just a pretext and it seems that he is 
suggesting that you are a part of this and suggesting in 
particular that you are protecting Mr Saloojee by the fact 
that you did not refer to him by name but you referred to 
others.   
Now that is fairly long question but I think you 
10 
understand it was necessary for me to put that in context.  
Can you please tell the Chair whether the criticism of you 
is valid or not? 
MR SADIK:   Ja.  I think, Chair, it is really unfortunate to 
hear these point being made by a senior executive of the 
company. 
 
I 
mean, 
quite 
clearly, 
looking 
at 
the 
thoroughness of the BDO report, which we regard as being 
very thorough and you would see there was a blatant 
disregard, not only the company policies within Denel but 
for the broader South African legislative environment as 
20 
well.  And, as a state owned company, we should have 
been far more responsible.  So it is really very unfortunate 
and it is really sad to be hearing these sort of comments, 
you know, because when one is in a leadership position 
you actually need to take accountability for your actions 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 60 of 246 
 
around that. 
 
And, as you know, Chair, I mean the plight of Denel 
right now is very public, you know, we are losing a lot of 
skills in the company and it is because of the financial 
challenges we find ourselves and really, it is the financially 
challenges that as a result of the poor leadership that we 
have had in place, that we are not strong enough.   
 
State capture definitely made a contribution, a 
significant contribution to the reputation issues that we are 
suffering, not only locally but globally as well because we 
10 
operate in many countries across the globe.  And also 
locally with our lenders because it has made them very 
nervous to be associated with Denel and to be providing 
funding as one stakeholder.  There has been a range of 
stakeholders.   
 
So coming back to the interview on eNCA, the 
question that I was asked at the beginning is that can I 
name individuals and at that stage because it was in a 
public platform and these reports were still in process, we 
did not disclose any names and I did not.  But the direct 
20 
question I was asked, Chair, is that who was on the board 
of Denel Asia at the time and that is a clear black and 
white answer, so – and one could see who was on the 
board of the company and that was the response I gave 
and our view around the creation of Denel Asia is that it 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 61 of 246 
 
was illegal because it was prior to receiving all of the 
ministerial approvals.  A partner that Denel chose to 
partner with had no experience and this comes out from the 
BDO report in the Asian market, in particular with India.   
 
The person that was on the board of Denel Asia 
representing VR Laser, one was a Mr van der Merwe, who 
was a South African citizen, a lawyer by profession and we 
had another individual named Mr Singhala and he was – at 
the time he was about a 22 year individual.  So he had no 
credibility in the Indian market which is where they were 
10 
aiming to go into.  That was the one. 
 
The other, is that during this era of state capture, 
we had also – there were some opportunities we were busy 
with elsewhere in the broader market of Asia and with state 
capture we were then – we were affecting the relationships 
we have with some of our advisers in those markets, we 
were sending confusing messages to our customer base.  
Just for the sensitivity of those countries I would not 
mention the names here, Chair.   So I do not know whether 
I answer your question. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Mr Sadik, is there 
anything else that you want to raise with the Chairperson 
that arises from your affidavit or the last issue that you 
want to add or are you happy with completing your 
evidence at this stage? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 62 of 246 
 
MR SADIK:   I think, Chair, the one pint that was raised by 
your legal adviser was around the interview on Morning 
Live on the SABC and that was with Leanne Manas at the 
Morning Live show and the purpose of that interview was to 
discuss the contract that Denel entered into with the 
government of Chad which was to supply vehicles that 
were going to be used for peacekeeping services and 
Denel at the time had received R100 million and we had 
not executed on the contract.  So we were – there were 
media reports over the weekend and then based on that we 
10 
were then invited to be on the interview and I, as Chairman 
of the audit committee, I then attended – I led that 
interview and the point we had made in that interview is 
that we, at the time, the current board, which I was part of, 
was that it was a significantly loss-making contract and 
also the timeline to execute that contract was reduced by 
50%.  So as a result of those two – and Denel did not have 
the financial resources to complete the project within that 
specified time and the management at the time had acted 
contrary to the mandate that was provided by the divisional 
20 
management 
would 
have 
responsible 
to 
execute 
that 
contract.  So that was the purpose of that interview. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Mr Sadik, we have no 
further questions of this witness.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Sadik, for 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 63 of 246 
 
making yourself available to give evidence.  We appreciate 
it and if we need you to come back, we will ask you.  Thank 
you very much. 
MR SADIK:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are now excused. 
MR SADIK:   Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, I see that we have exceeded 
the normal time before the tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Our next witness I assume is present 
10 
and ready to take the witness box.  May I suggest that it 
may be appropriate to take a brief adjournment now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us take the tea adjournment 
now, it is twenty five past eleven, let us resume at twenty 
to twelve.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Twenty to twelve.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you ready Mr Kennedy? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We are thank you Chair, and with 
your leave may we now call as our next witness Mr 
Abraham Stephanus Burger. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you, please administer the

Page 64 of 246 
 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
MR BURGER:   Abraham Stephanus Burger. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR BURGER:   I do not have any problem. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemn affirm that the evidence you 
will give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth, if so please raise your right hand and 
say I truly affirm. 
ABRAHAMS STEPHANUS BURGER:   [Affirmed] 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Before I ask 
questions of this witness may I just mention something, 
just for the record and for your reassurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In relation to the last witness, Mr 
Sadik’s evidence, he indicated that he was willing to 
provide to the Commission a copy of the final Denton’s 
report that they received on Tuesday.  His attorney, Mr 
Pillay, who’s just left has, again, kindly assisted us, and 
just made available a copy, already, of that final report.  
20 
So, it now already in our hands and we will make the 
necessary arrangements to have it done through the formal 
channels to bring it before you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Good morning Mr Burger, thank you 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 65 of 246 
 
for coming to assist the Commission. 
MR BURGER:  Good morning Mr Kennedy, good morning 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Burger. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, Mr Burger ’s affidavit appears 
in Denel Bundle 10 from page 607.  Mr Burger you should 
have that Bundle, hopefully, in front of you and if I can ask 
you please, you will know by now the references to page 
numbers is a reference to the top left in black ink rather 
than the red that you see on the right and I’m not going to 
10 
give you the full number, it’s quite long, I’m just going to 
refer to the last three digits, so it’s 607 is the beginning of 
your affidavit, is that correct? 
MR BURGER:   I’ve got it thank you, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now, this is your main affidavit 
you’ve also provided a supplementary affidavit, is that 
right? 
MR BURGER:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right,  let’s deal with the main one 
first.  If I can ask you, please to turn to the signature page 
20 
on page 744. 
MR BURGER:   Sorry page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 744. 
MR BURGER:   744, yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature at the foot? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 66 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   I confirm that’s my signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you swore this affidavit, or 
affirmed this affidavit, rather, in front of a Commissioner 
whose details and signature appear on the following page 
745? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now, Mr Burger you’ve 
mentioned to me in consultation and again this morning 
that there are some typographical errors in your affidavit.  
As I understand it, they are merely typo errors, there’s no 
10 
difference in substance, is that correct? 
MR BURGER:   That is absolutely correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so you’ve indicated to me you 
don’t think it’s necessary for you to take the Chair through 
every typo error and it seems to us that, that makes sense, 
unless the Chair wants otherwise. 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, have you been through this 
affidavit, are you familiar with its contents? 
MR BURGER:   I am familiar with it, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And are you able, under the 
affirmation that you have now taken, to confirm that the 
contents this affidavit are true and correct? 
MR BURGER:   I confirm that it is true and correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  We’ll take you, in a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 67 of 246 
 
moment to some of the points that you raise in your 
affidavit but just for completeness, may I take you to the 
supplementary affidavit that you have provided us.  Of 
course, the main affidavit, we’ve seen was signed some 
time ago, I think it was in February, is that right? 
MR BURGER:   That’s correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And since then, is it correct that the 
investigators of the Commission have asked you to respond 
to certain questions and in response to that you’ve 
provided a supplementary affidavit? 
10 
MR BURGER:   No, Chair, I did respond to certain 
questions in my original affidavit, the second affidavit is to 
answer or to respond to certain Rule 3.3 that I present. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and if I can ask you please to 
turn to page 746. 
MR BURGER:   I’m there, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the first page of your 
supplementary affidavit? 
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can ask you please, to turn 
20 
to the signature page, 788? 
MR BURGER:   I’m there, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature? 
MR BURGER:   That is my signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is it correct that you took the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 68 of 246 
 
affirmation before a Commissioner of Oaths as appears on 
page 789? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was a very recently supplied 
affidavit and we thank you for your assistance, that’s dated 
the 4 t h of November 2020, is that correct? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair at this stage, may I just 
apologise for a lapse on my part of professional etiquette 
and that is, Mr Burger, in fact, is assisted by his legal 
10 
representative, Mr Rudi Krause and I do apologise to Mr 
Krause and Mr Burger for my failure to mention to you, his 
presence, I should have done it at the outset, I beg your 
pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine, let him just place 
himself on record properly. 
MR KRAUSE:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  My initials are 
R.C and my surname is Krause and no apology necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Burger the 
20 
supplementary affidavit, the same question there, are you 
familiar with its contents? 
MR BURGER:   I’m familiar with it Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you confirm the correctness of 
those contents? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 69 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   I confirm the correctness. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, Chair, may we then ask your 
leave please to have, formally admitted, into the evidence 
of the Commission, the two affidavits.  The one starts at 
page 607 and we would ask that, that be admitted as 
Exhibit W25.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Abraham Stephanus 
Burger starting at page 607 is admitted as Exhibit W25.1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair, and may we ask 
that the supplementary affidavit that starts at page 746 of 
10 
Bundle 10 be admitted as Exhibit W25.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The supplementary affidavit of Mr 
Abraham 
Stephanus 
Burger 
starting 
at 
page 
746 
is 
admitted as Exhibit W25.2. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Burger your 
affidavit – your main affidavit, particularly gives a very 
detailed account of your version.  I’m obviously going to 
focus only on some aspects that appear to require 
particular attention but you can have the assurance that 
the 
Chairperson 
has 
the 
full 
affidavit 
and 
the 
20 
supplementary affidavit before him and it will, in its 
entirety and in its full detail be taken into account.  Your 
background, I believe is summarised in your affidavit at 
page 618, is that right? 
MR BURGER:  That is correct.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 70 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   With your leave, Chair, may I lead 
him on what appears to be uncontroversial aspects? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  You have a degree in 
Mechanical Engineering, correct? 
MR BURGER:   That’s correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you joined – after your 
academic 
education 
you 
joined 
a 
company, 
Lyttelton 
Engineering Works, in Pretoria, as an Engineer, which was 
a subsidiary of Armscor and that later became known as 
10 
Denel, is that correct? 
MR BURGER:   That’s correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, when did you first start, in Denel 
under its previous name? 
MR BURGER:   As it’s stated there, Chair, LIW was Denel 
Land Systems as we know it today.  So, my very first work 
was at Denel Lands Systems and I’ve spent my entire 
career there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I’m asking when did that 
actually start? 
20 
MR BURGER:  In 1981.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   1981…[intervenes]. 
MR BURGER:   The beginning of 1981. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, your entire career has been 
spent at Denel under its previous name and then under its 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 71 of 246 
 
current name? 
MR BURGER:   Correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And when did you leave Denel? 
MR BURGER:   I left Denel at the latter part of March 
2018. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you were, at that stage, the 
Chief Executive Officer of a division of Denel, known as 
Denel Land Systems or DLS, is that right? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you indicate that you held that 
10 
position for about 13 years before your resignation. 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now, the affidavit deals with a 
number of transactions that have been of interest to the 
Commission and we’re going to get to some of those 
transactions in a moment and particularly your own role in 
relation to that.  Now, I’d like you start please, though, 
with the general theme, as I understand it of your affidavit.  
I assume you were present earlier when Mr Sadik gave 
evidence, you got here nice and early. 
20 
MR BURGER:   I was here, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and you heard that I put my 
understanding of the overall theme of your affidavit to Mr 
Sadik but I’d like you to put the overall theme in your own 
words to the Chairperson, if you would please, as to your 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 72 of 246 
 
concern raised in the affidavit that Denel has problems but 
their problems had been misrepresented, as it were, as if 
they’re all due to – or primarily due to corruption and the 
involvement of the Guptas with VR Laser and the contracts 
that you were involved in at DLS with VR Laser.  Can I let 
you please, express in your own terms, your overall 
feeling? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I’ve got a very proud history at 
Denel Land Systems.  I was in various positions as the 
years went by but in principle, in the 13 years I was the 
10 
CEO at Denel Land Systems I inherited a business that 
was 
bankrupt 
at 
this 
stage, 
it 
was 
approximately 
R280million turnover and it had a huge overdraft and it had 
very little order cover.  I – we went through a process of 
refocusing the company, the intent of LMT had a role to 
play in refocusing the company, I’m sure we’re going to get 
to that point as well but in principle year on year, growth 
was seen through all those years. To a point that in 2016 
and 2017 the turnover of that business was just under 
R3billion per year and it was profitable every year.  Now, 
20 
that performance, in my opinion, is unprecedented, that 
performance does not happen by itself, it happens through 
people that are extremely dedicated, that are not afraid to 
take decisions, that think out of the box and think like 
business people.  Hopefully – that was true for me but I 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 73 of 246 
 
want to state it categorically that the whole team at Denel 
Land Systems were in my mind businessmen and when 
they got to Denel in the mornings they did not go to work 
they went to their business.  So, with that as a background 
I passionately felt that the decision to give a contract to 
VR Laser was the right decision because I felt, at the time, 
it was the best company to do the job.  Similarly when a 
decision was taken to go for a single source agreement, 
although that was not my idea or my proposal, I supported 
that because as I state, elsewhere in the affidavit, the big 
10 
gurus of the world that understand quality issues of 
complex fabrication like  Bennie said the best way to 
ensure reduction in total cost is to form single source 
supply agreements with suppliers rather than go out on 
tender.  So, when this proposal was made to me, I only 
saw the benefit in that, and I supported it passionately. 
 
The point – or the theme of this document is that if 
there 
were 
people 
that 
benefited 
from 
irregularities 
because of my support for those actions, I cannot stand in 
for that.  I took a business decision and so the overall 
20 
theme of these reports were, I will not deny if I sometimes 
fell over my own feet in applying policies and I stand to be 
corrected and I will take the accountability for that but 
those things were all done with the best interest of the 
division at heart, firstly and secondly the best interest of 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 74 of 246 
 
Denel at heart.  So, when anybody comes and says those 
decisions were made because of State Capture or to 
enhance State Capture I really, really get upset about it. 
So, the overall thread of this is, we tried to make good 
business decisions, we tried to continue the growth of the 
business and the profitability of the business and to the 
benefit of Denel.  So, if those decisions  misrepresented to 
say they were because of State Capture, then I don’t think 
it is fair, Chair.  So, that is more or less the theme of the 
document. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, before  Mr Kennedy proceeds there’s 
a part that I didn’t hear well in your remarks, Mr Burger.  
You 
said, 
if 
there 
were 
people 
who 
benefited 
from 
decisions you made and then you said something, I don’t 
know whether you said you can’t stand that, but I didn’t 
hear what you said. 
MR BURGER:   No…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said if there were people who 
benefited 
either 
from 
decisions 
you 
made 
or 
from 
20 
irregularities or something and then you said something, 
then I didn’t hear that part. 
MR BURGER:   Yes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you forgotten what you said? 
MR BURGER:   I cannot remember verbatim what I said but 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 75 of 246 
 
what I meant to say was, I supported business decisions.  
If those business decisions were in line with objectives – 
with 
objectives 
people 
had 
that 
were 
not 
business 
decisions I cannot stand in for that, I was unaware of 
anything of that nature.  So, I’m just trying to say that the 
decisions we made were purely, purely made on the 
grounds on what is best for the company and what’s the 
best for the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I know you are going to give your 
evidence and some of the things will come up as you 
10 
proceed but I want to raise something upfront.  One, the 
Commission doesn’t operate on the basis that we want only 
evidence that might show that there was State Capture and 
we don’t want evidence that might show that there was no 
State Capture, we want all evidence that may tend to show 
that there was State Capture and evidence that might tend 
to show that there was no State Capture.   
So, as a result we want to hear from witnesses who 
have different perspectives about that, we want to hear – 
to benefit from all those perspectives.  So that’s the first 
20 
point but I want to say to you, in relation to State Capture 
and what you said in your remarks, when I was hearing 
evidence relating to the suspensions at Eskom a few weeks 
ago, one of the things I said to some of the witnesses was, 
that, it is possible that when the Board of Eskom made the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 76 of 246 
 
decisions that it made, I don’t know how much might have 
followed that evidence, you might not have okay I won’t go 
into it but when the Board of Eskom made the decision that 
it made on the 11 t h of March 2015, which were to decide 
that there should be an enquiry into the affairs of Eskom 
and 
that 
certain 
Executives 
at 
Eskom 
should 
be 
suspended.  I said, it is possible that other people outside 
of Eskom had made the decision that the Board should 
make these two decisions, should appoint – or establish an 
enquiry and should suspend certain Executives.  I said 
10 
that, in part, because according to the evidence I heard, in 
a meeting that happened prior to the Board meeting, and a 
meeting that was not a Board meeting, in Durban where the 
Chairperson of the Board was invited to that meeting, the 
issue of an enquiry at Eskom and the suspension of 
Executives was raised there with the – in the presence of 
the Chairperson of the Board of Eskom and then I heard 
evidence that somebody who was not part of Eskom and 
was not part of Government, Mr Salim Essa appears to, 
according to some evidence that I’ve heard, appears to 
20 
have known about the Executives who were going to be 
suspended already on the 10 t h of March which was before 
the date of the meeting and if the evidence I’ve heard to 
the effect that, he knew and he told one or more of Eskom 
employees, the names, he got it right. Those were the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 77 of 246 
 
people who were suspended the following day.   
I said, well it is possible that in the Board of Eskom 
at that time, there may have been people who might have 
known about some agenda decided upon, outside of Eskom 
involving the suspension, the Executives but it is possible 
that 
some 
members 
of 
the 
Board, 
in 
making 
these 
decisions, knew nothing about any such agenda and simply 
made decisions and contributed in the bone fide belief that 
they thought these were the decisions that were in the 
interests of Eskom and then some might have opposed 
10 
these decisions, not because they knew of any agenda by 
people outside of Eskom but because on the facts they 
didn’t think the decisions were the right decisions.  So, I’m 
making this example of something I’ve already said before, 
to say to you, even within Denel, it may be possible that 
some people – if there was some agenda from people 
outside of Denel, maybe some people within Denel knew, it 
may be that some other people didn’t know but believe that 
they were making decisions that were in the interest of 
Denel but it is possible that unbeknown to them there were 
20 
people outside of Denel who may have been pushing a 
certain agenda that might not have been known to some 
people within Denel.  They make certain decisions but 
there are people who are pushing a certain agenda and 
they believe they are just making business decision but 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 78 of 246 
 
actually there is an agenda that they might not be aware of 
and that agenda may well be, State Capture.  So, I just 
thought I’d mention this, I don’t know if you would like to 
comment about this analysis? 
MR BURGER:   Chair other than I fully accept your point, 
yes, I take your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now, you indicated 
earlier that you are quite prepared to accept accountability 
if you’ve done something that may have been wrong, as 
10 
you put it, I think you said, if you tripped yourself up or fell 
over your own feet, I think is the expression you used, then 
you’re quite happy to acknowledge that and be accountable 
for that but it’s unfair to tar you with a brush of being 
associated with State Capture or corruption or anything, if 
I understand you correctly, that’s your point? 
MR BURGER:   One hundred percent, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now you have also criticised, 
and I don’t want to go into this in any detail, you’ve 
criticised the media for playing along to an agenda of 
20 
trying to attach State Capture corruption type allegations 
to what may be legitimately explained in another way.  I’d 
like you to just touch on an aspect that I raised at the table 
end of Mr Sadik’s evidence when you were present, and 
that is that he appeared on two television interviews and 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 79 of 246 
 
he stated that certain actions taken were unlawful within 
Denel and that criminal charges and civil claims were being 
brought 
against 
certain 
individuals. 
Now, 
you 
have 
criticised him for that as defaming you and playing along 
with this overall wrong, as you would see it, of trying to 
dress up something that you say can, legitimately, be 
explained as if it were corruption, do you stand by that 
accusation? 
MR BURGER:   I do, Chair, to give context, that opinion 
cannot be seen on its own merit.  I attach a media article 
10 
in my second affidavit that was written in 2016, stating 
various 
things 
that 
I’ve 
told 
colleagues 
which 
were 
blatantly, blatantly untrue and I truly believe that is where 
this image started and as a matter of fact, many witnesses 
used that as a departure point for their opinion about me 
and Chair, I don’t know if we’re going to get back to that 
article but the fact of the matter is, if one takes cognisance 
of Denel Asia and the BDO report, the accusation against 
me was that I – the Board of Denel only approved the 
concept of Denel Asia, I don’t know when it was, but let’s 
20 
say in December of 2015 and we – I started interacting 
with potential clients or potential partners in September. 
That is true, I did but I had no way of knowing what 
decisions were taken in the Board and whether, indeed, the 
Board took a resolution or not. I was given an instruction 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 80 of 246 
 
that the Board did decide to enter into this opportunity, and 
we should start to see if there were any business 
opportunities.  So - and based on that it is recommended 
that criminal and civil action is taken against me.  It sounds 
unfair to me Chair I – it just does not make sense to me in 
any way or terms.  So that is the reason for when it was then 
put to the – into the news that I was on the board that 
criminal civil action should be taken against me.  I just 
thought it was unfair.  And that is the long and the short of it 
Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Of course as the 
Chairperson has indicated he is keen as the Chairperson to 
hear evidence both as to whether there was state capture 
which 
would 
include 
allegations 
of 
corruption 
and 
wrongdoing and also evidence whether there was not state 
capture and corruption and particularly in relation to yourself 
and your own role and that is why we have asked you to 
come and give evidence.   
Firstly to assist the Chairperson so that he can have 
all the facts before him before he writes his report and 
20 
makes his findings and recommendations and submits them 
to the State President.   
 
But secondly also to give you a chance as a matter of 
fairness to be able to put your version out and as I have 
indicated you have put in – you have helped the commission 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 81 of 246 
 
with a very detailed and thorough main affidavit as well as a 
detailed supplementary affidavit and all of that will be taken 
into account. 
 
The purpose of the hearing today is to hear you 
further in addition to what is down in writing so that you can 
give your own perspective and answer questions just as we 
have done in relation to the other witnesses. 
MR BURGER:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now Mr Burger. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I can just add this Mr Burger.  I am 
10 
particularly interested in hearing all those against whom 
there are serious allegations of involvement in state capture 
and corruption.   
 
Firstly because my decisions and my findings would 
be much better if they were informed by all sides.  But two to 
give them an opportunity to put their side of the story openly 
in a forum like this. 
 
Even the Gupta’s if they were willing I would have 
wanted to hear their side of the story.  Indeed when I gave 
my judgment last year in their application for leave to cross-
20 
examine certain witnesses I made it clear that if they were to 
come back into the country I would give – I would have no 
hesitation in giving them an opportunity to cross-examine if 
they meet the requirements of the rules witnesses and to 
hear their side of the story. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 82 of 246 
 
 
So I just want to emphasise that throughout the idea 
has been we must hear all sides.  But if there are serious 
allegations of corruption or involvement in state capture 
against you; against certain people I particularly want to 
hear their side of the story. 
 
So that applies to you. 
MR BURGER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Chair may we just touch on 
an issue to get that out of the way.  Likewise before we deal 
10 
with the meat of the – of these specific transactions and so 
forth.  Mr Burger you have – you have raised your concern 
about the media.   
You have also raised your concern about some of the 
witnesses as distorting the facts and playing to an overall 
agenda of trying to dress up problems as if they were all 
attributable to state capture and corruption whereas in fact 
there were legitimate reasons.  
We have dealt with that and the Chairperson has 
given you the assurance that he wants to hear your evidence 
20 
and it is important that he does to hear everything.   
You have also criticised the investigating team of the 
commission and particularly an individual investigator and 
you have alleged that you have a – had – or have a 
perception that there was not a complete neutrality on the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 83 of 246 
 
part 
of 
the 
investigator 
and 
you 
felt 
that 
he 
acted 
inappropriately and in an intimidating way. 
Now what I am going to suggest to you but subject to 
the guidance of the Chair is this. The Chair has already 
requested he has conveyed to me that the investigator 
concerned provide a proper affidavit to deal properly and 
seriously with all the allegations that you have made against 
him personally and we are still awaiting the affidavit.  We 
have been told it is on the way. 
I do not have anything though to put to you at this 
10 
stage as to his – his version but may I say this subject to the 
Chair’s guidance because ultimately it is – it is for his 
decision as to how this – this sort of matter as with 
everything needs to be handled. 
What I can give you is an undertaking as the legal 
team subject to the direction of the Chair is that once that 
affidavit comes to hand that will be furnished to you and your 
legal team and you will then have an opportunity to respond 
to that by way of affidavit and if the Chair considers it 
appropriate in the interest of fairness and transparency to 
20 
hold – to give you a further opportunity to give oral evidence 
in that regard and that is also for the investigator to give oral 
evidence.  That will be something that the Chair will consider 
and decide once that process of affidavits has been 
undertaken.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 84 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Would you be comfortable with that 
approach? 
MR BURGER:  Very comfortable. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do want to say Mr Burger there is 
nothing wrong you have done by raising your concerns about 
a member of the investigation team in terms of how you felt 
treated.  So we will look into those concerns. 
MR BURGER:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I also in case there is any question 
mark about it may I also on behalf of our legal team dealing 
with the Denel stream just convey to you our assurance that 
we have been appointed and in fact have taken an oath 
before the Deputy Chief Justice to act impartially and 
honestly and lawfully and we have no agenda in this matter 
at all and we are also concerned just as the learned 
Chairperson has indicated that he is concerned we are 
concerned that everybody gets a fair opportunity to be heard 
20 
and give their perspective. 
 
That is why we have been – we have asked you to 
come today and have allocated some considerable time for 
you in the – in the midst of a very busy schedule with many 
witnesses to give you that opportunity which you are fully 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 85 of 246 
 
entitled to use now. 
MR BURGER:  I truly appreciate Chair thank you very much. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Are you happy to proceed on that 
basis? 
MR BURGER:  Happy to proceed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you very much.  Now you 
have referred in your affidavit particularly from page 618 to 
what you call a general background and I would like to just 
pick up a thread which you touched on earlier and that is the 
– the achievements that you made while at Denel particularly 
10 
and DLS.   
The success as you see it of DLS and then you deal 
on from page 619 with the present status of Denel as a 
business and you have referred to your perspective as to 
why Denel – as to what extent Denel is suffering – has been 
suffering serious financial and other issues and what you 
attribute that to. 
 
Would you just in brief terms please summarise your 
overall evidence in that regard? 
MR BURGER:  Yes Chair.  The – the problems with Denel 
20 
started in the early 2000 and it started after also Denel Land 
Systems were very successful in promoting an artillery 
system in India. 
 
It went through three iterations of demonstration and 
with each iteration the gun had to be upgraded and modified 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 86 of 246 
 
because it was a unique system for India. 
 
The negotiating a deal in India is extraordinary 
difficult as one might imagine.  We got to the point where 
this deal was negotiated, agreed, the contract was signed by 
South Africa – on South African side and it was for 280 
artillery systems.  Today artillery systems costs about 5.5 
million Dollars.  So with all the support, equipment it is – in 
today’s rand value about R30 billion.  The biggest contract 
one can imagine. 
 
A single newspaper article appeared around 2003 I 
10 
think it was thereabouts – maybe 2 where – where Denel in 
South Africa – where Denel was accused of wrongdoing and 
illegally using technical advisors. 
 
Now I am cognisant of the time but this is – it is 
extremely important point because at that – at that time India 
was in the middle of general elections.  Sonia Gandhi was 
about to be the new Prime Minister of India and there was a 
Minister of Defence his name was George Fernandes and 
when that article appeared in the papers it was like throwing 
petrol on a political time bomb.  And that was used as part of 
20 
various allegations against Mr George Fernandes because 
he was opposing Ms Sonia Gandhi in her campaign to with 
the contract – to win the elections. 
 
She subsequently was – became the Prime Minister 
and Denel was labelled as corrupt.  It was treated as being 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 87 of 246 
 
blacklisted.  It never by the way was proven that there black 
– well they were never officially blacklisted but they were 
treated the whole time and nothing was ever proven.  There 
was no wrongdoing found and here 12/13 years later the ban 
is lifted. 
 
That – that single newspaper article in my mind 
almost broke Denel.  It was necessary for government to 
give a bailout and then it started to rebuild itself. 
 
But in principle that was the biggest financial blow 
because we had contracts ammunition and anti-material 
10 
weapon contracts which were cancelled and R30 billion 
worth of business never materialised – it never happened. 
 
So that is in my mind where the problems started with 
Denel.  I – if I can then continue to – when after that 
happened the – the idea was to save Denel by decentralising 
the business.  Getting equity partners from abroad and 
continue their [00:13:31].  And I personally felt that was the 
way to go for Denel and that is when the RDN deal happened 
with Rheinmetall buying into the ammunition plant and that is 
when VAE systems the very same VAE systems which we 
20 
talk later on about also made an offer to purchase DLS. 
 
And I can later get to that point.  But what I thought 
was that was the right direction for Denel to go.  And Denel 
on the back of that structure Denel started going forward and 
started building the foundation for a good business. Getting 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 88 of 246 
 
the accountabilities at the right position, getting quick 
decision making and moving forward. 
 
And that was for me the foundation of the growth 
everybody talks about in 2015/16 that happened 14.  That is 
when the foundations happened.  Later on in the timeframe 
of when Mr Saloojee joined Denel that strategy was stopped.  
The idea of selling equity, the idea of having decentralised 
decision making, decentralised accountability and more 
centralised decision making were taken and I go into my 
affidavit about the problems with decentr... – with centralised 
10 
decision making. 
 
Now I was never really in favour of centralised 
decision making because of how complex and how vastly 
different the processes, the clients, the technologies and so 
on of the different divisions were. 
 
There were certain divisions that were similar and I 
said those divisions should be put together.  But I was 
always a supporter of decentralised accountability and 
decision making. 
 
But I have also said that if you want to centralise the 
20 
business no problem.  Centralise the business.  Centralise 
decision 
making 
but 
then 
please 
also 
centralise 
accountability.  You cannot have centralised decision making 
and decentralised accountability. 
 
And I talk about that process and that is – that was 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 89 of 246 
 
my concern then with the direction the management was 
going.  It is very interesting and I listened to Mr Sadik this 
morning.  It is very interesting to note that what I have now 
said throughout this affidavit a year ago is exactly what 
Denel decided to do.  Is now to go with decentralised 
decision making, decentralised accountability.  Decentralised 
cash flow management even.  And I believe that is the only 
way.  It is a little bit late for them to make that decision but 
that I believe was the right decision.  That was for me the 
whole decentralised – decentralisation model. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry before you move on from that.  I 
am sorry to interrupt but it seems to be relevant for me to 
raise this.  I can understand your frustration with an 
approach that did not equate with what you saw as the best 
business model.  The best business model in your view was 
decentralisation.  In other words there would be a strong 
level of independence as it were of you as the Head of DLS 
to be able to take decisions and so forth without having to be 
– to get approval from head office or be overridden by them. 
 
Is that right? That was [00:17:27] 
20 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair.  But it was not an ego thing.  It 
was – Denel Land Systems were exporting 80% of its 
business.  It was competing against other suppliers that 
were in the private industry but which had very strong 
governmental support in terms of marketing and financially. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 90 of 246 
 
 
And we had to compete with them and we had to 
export – or we were exporting about 80% of our revenue.  So 
to compete in that arena. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  You have got to be quick on your feet.  You 
cannot have a big bureaucracy which takes forever to take 
decisions and a big centralised model does unfortunately do 
that.  But that was not my criticism.   
 
My criticism really was about if you want to centralise 
then also take the accountability. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I understand your approach and I 
understand your point that – that you felt that there was a lot 
of advantage to decentralise so that you can be nimble and 
quick and so forth. 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What I just want to ask you though is 
this.  You say that your understanding and Mr Sadik’s 
evidence suggests that Denel have actually eventually after 
you went – after you left have come round to your way of 
thinking to decentralise.   
20 
What I just want you to confirm though is that the 
time that you were at DLS as a CEO particularly around 2014 
to 2016 when many of these transactions took place it was 
still relatively centralised and you – and in terms of the 
company policies, the group policies and so forth you still 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 91 of 246 
 
had to get approval.  You were - find that frustrating not so?  
But you still did – you were still subject to a policy and rules 
and regulations and processes, correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you were frustrated by that? 
MR BURGER:  I was? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  I was but those were the rules and we played 
by those rules.   No problem. 
o problem. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That – so I – we going to deal later with 
whether you did play by the rules and if you did not play by 
the rules whether you accept accountability for that and so 
forth.  We will give you a full opportunity on that. 
MR BURGER:  Sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But are we in agreement then that you 
accepted that the more centralised model was then enforced 
and that applied to you whether you liked it or not. 
MR BURGER:  Correct.  And I was not ignoring the model. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR BURGER:  Not in – Chair sorry I just need to add.  This 
centralisation did not happen in one go from one day to the 
next.  It was a gradual process that started in 2013 that were 
running at a fairly efficient way in about – in 2015 and from 
2015 to 2018 when I left – when I left it just was at a point 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 92 of 246 
 
where no decisions were my decisions anymore. And I 
recorded that it was untenable.   
I went through a period of eight months of saying I 
cannot work under those conditions and I left the company – 
I resigned under the auspices of a constructive dismissal  It 
was for me impossible to operate in – and be held 
accountable and that is the reason.  And it was a process of 
eight months from where I started to say it is impossible to 
work like this to where I eventually just left. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you I apologised earlier for 
10 
having interrupted you because I thought it was an important 
question I had to raise.  Is there anything else that you want 
to add? 
MR BURGER:  Sorry, sorry, sorry on the problems? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On the overall problems. 
MR BURGER:  Yes there is just…. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I ask you please if you would – if 
you would just please be very brief because obviously the 
commission’s time is limited and it needs to focus on in 
considerable detail later. 
20 
MR BURGER:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On some of the individual transactions. 
MR BURGER:  I will do that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you. 
MR BURGER:  Okay I am not going to go into the very 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 93 of 246 
 
conservative and lack of decision making which just stifled 
the program is the whole – the whole bundle on that.  I just 
want to – I just want to mention the LSASA deal which I – 
which probably is not such a big issue Chair but it is the 
proverbial straw that in my mind broke the camel’s back from 
a cash flow perspective. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Again with apologies to interrupt your 
flow but page 629 is where you deal with what you refer to 
the disaster of the LSSA acquisition. 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright just summarise very briefly why 
you call it a disaster and why you feel it was significant? 
MR BURGER:  Chair in my mind I was part of the acquisition 
– the proposed acquisition of BAE wanting the buy Denel 
Land Systems.  Denel Land Systems at the time had very 
strong, very huge – big opportunities but it lacked orders.  It 
did not have orders a couple of 100 million probably and I 
was part of the team that negotiated with BAE and they were 
very hard negotiators and they said you know you cannot 
expect us to pay anything for this company for a majority 
20 
share if you have not got orders.   
Orders determine the value of the company and they 
quoted the phrase ‘a business without any business is not a 
business.’  And they offered more or less nothing for that 
business but what they offered was we going to give you new 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 94 of 246 
 
business structures, we going to put people in place that can 
make this place profitable and we will make sure you will get 
orders.  We will turn the company around. The decision was 
taken not to go there because the – I think the political 
appetite at that stage for selling shares stopped. 
 
However when Denel approached BAE Systems for 
the acquisition of LSSA I was part of that in [00:24:08].  I 
thought they had no orders. Then why would you pay 
anything unless it is for strategic value for a company with 
no orders or they had a R100 odd million orders and they 
10 
needed about a billion per year to sustain. 
 
So my proposal was in recollection of what happened 
in the past with BAE Systems offer them very little.  I – it 
then so happened that I was not part of the team and it was 
bought for R855 million.  In my view it was too much.  In my 
personal view one can do due diligences, they evaluate the 
strategic value of the IP whatever the case may be but it did 
not have orders.  And I thought it was too much. 
 
Ms Martie Janse van Rensburg gave evidence that 
said but they had a plan to sell half of those shares for R450 
20 
million and they were far progressed with getting potential 
partners in.  Now at the end of the day the best potential 
partner there was was for R224 million for half of the 
company.  And for that reason I say they paid firstly too 
much for the business.  It could have at best been double 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 95 of 246 
 
the 224 the value of the company. 
 
Secondly Denel did not have money and I only found 
out when I read Mr Sadik’s affidavit that the Hoefyster pre-
payments were used to finance this deal.  And no wonder 
were suffering so much at the time to make ends meet.   
So Chair not to go in too deep into this I thought it 
was the timing was wrong to buy this – the place for – from a 
financial perspective the amount that was paid was too much 
and it turned in my opinion it was a disaster and it broke the 
camel’s back in terms of cash flow management.   
10 
And from that point onwards really nothing happened 
in Denel anymore because all we were doing is speak to 
suppliers to beg them please stay with us we cannot pay 
you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now I would like you to – I would like to 
take you back to a remark you made earlier which was to say 
it is wrong and unfair to criticise you for any involvement in 
state capture and state capture was not the real thing – the 
real reason for the difficulties and that you can be held 
accountable if you have slipped – tripped yourself up in 
20 
relation to compliance and so forth.  You prepared to be 
accountable on that but not to be accountable if you had to 
be criticised for being involved in anything corrupt or 
anything involved in state capture. 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 96 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now the first part of that I would like to 
peruse with you.  To your credit you say you will be prepared 
to be accountable for anything that may have done wrongly if 
you had tripped yourself up in relation to compliance of 
processes. 
 
As I understand it though your overall points that is 
apparent from the affidavit is that that was done with the 
best – if there was anything done at all that may have been 
not incompliance with processes throughout you had a 
genuine and good faith intent to advance the interests of 
10 
Denel’s business and nobody else. 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you have been following 
the evidence as one would expect of the commission in fact 
you mentioned to me when we greeted this morning that you 
like we had been up till fairly late last night.  You had seen 
in the media coverage of the proceedings that we finished 
around about 9:30 last night you mentioned that and – so 
that is to your credit that you have been following with 
interest the evidence of other witnesses. 
20 
 
You no doubt have heard Mr Burger and you have 
also been sent these Rule 3.3 Notices to indicate that the 
commission wanted you to give your answer to some of the 
things that had been said about you and the processes by 
other witnesses. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 97 of 246 
 
 
You no doubt are aware that other witnesses not all 
some have defended you but others have criticised you or 
your processes.  You are aware that there has been 
evidence 
in 
the 
spotlight 
before 
the 
commission 
that 
processes were not always followed correctly. 
 
Now I want you before we look at the detail of 
individual transactions just to indicate so we can know up 
front what your overall attitude is.  Do  you in fact say to the 
Chairperson of the commission now that everything you did 
in relation to every process for every transaction was 
10 
actually compliant with every rule and requirement and 
regulation or do you say at least with the benefit of hindsight 
I acknowledge that I may have or I did breach any particular 
– some particular rule or whatever and I can explain how 
that came about.  Which one is it? 
MR BURGER:  The second one Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  But I want to add the at the time we took the 
decision, I was not aware that I was transgressing any policy 
or National Treasury Regulation.  As time went on, I got to 
20 
realise:  Oeps, we might have done something wrong here in 
terms of processes.   
 
But at the time, it was not purposefully done to 
circumvent the process.  It was done in good faith at the 
time and...   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 98 of 246 
 
 
But your second point, that I do acknowledge, having 
listened to everybody that things should have been done 
differently. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Could you just identify if you are 
able to, without going into detail, what specifically you – 
what transaction you specifically acknowledge was not done 
correctly?   
 
And I accept your point, the qualification that you have 
added that if you breached anything, you did not do it 
intentionally.   
10 
 
Now that is a separate question the Commission may or 
may not want to deal with that and make findings on that.  
But 
what is 
your 
own 
version as to 
what 
you may 
unintentionally have breached?  For which transactions are 
we talking? 
MR BURGER:   I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe, let me add this to what 
Mr Kennedy says.  If you are able to, you might deal with 
this like in two or three categories.  You might say, having 
heard some of the evidence that has been led before the 
20 
Commission and maybe having read some investigation 
reports about things that happened at Denel. 
 
I have been able to identify the following transactions in 
which I was involved where I accept that we did not do 
things correctly or I was, I did not do things correctly. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 99 of 246 
 
 
It is this one.  It is that one.  It is that one.  And this is 
where I think we went wrong.  Then there may be a category 
where you are not sure.   
 
To 
say, 
there 
are 
these 
– 
there 
is 
category 
of 
transactions where I accept that we may have been wrong 
but I have not reached a point where I say we were wrong or 
I was wrong. 
 
And then there may be a third category where you say.  
On these ones, my position is clear that I say those were in 
order.  I did not do anything wrong.  We did not do anything 
10 
wrong. 
 
So if you are able to do them like that, that would be 
very helpful but I accept that might not be possible, in which 
case, you just do the best that you can. 
MR BURGER:   Let me try and play it as it goes Chair, if you 
do not mind? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine.  Ja. 
MR BURGER:   Let me start off with the first one and that 
was the whole deal and I hope we can get to the reason 
behind the whole deal Chair.  But at that time, I... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is that one now? 
MR BURGER:   The hull deal, the Hoefyster Hulls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  Oh, yes. 
MR BURGER:   The Hoefyster Hulls in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 100 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry to interrupt you.  That is the 
Platform Hulls? 
MR BURGER:   The Platform Hulls, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For the armoured vehicles? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that not always called a badger, is 
that right? 
MR BURGER:   It is a badger. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
10 
MR BURGER:   Or the product name, Hoefyster.  It was the 
project name.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR BURGER:   So it is the same thing.  At the time we went 
out into multi tender.  The allegation today is, we should 
have gone out to open tender.  Chair, I still maintain today 
that in the defence industry with confidentiality issues, with 
the IT issues and so on.   
 
It is very difficult, extremely difficult, if not impossible, 
to take something like that to the open market and publish it 
20 
and says, there is a drawing.  Anybody wants to quote, quote 
on that.   
 
How it worked is, we had something what we called LIW-
100.  So if you are – and for you to be able to tender on 
something, you first have to be an accepted potential 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 101 of 246 
 
supplier, you have to sign these LIW-100’s.  It is a whole lot 
of confidentiality agreements and so. 
 
And then you – then only can you get the drawings and 
you get sign it.  So I ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Burger, I am sorry to interrupt.  And 
again, I do not mean to be rude.  May I suggest, so we can 
just bring some sort of structure to the evidence and interest 
of time and focus that you start with you identifying for each 
of 
the 
transactions, 
whether 
you 
say, 
following 
the 
Chairperson’s guidance as to which category it is.   
10 
 
For example, when you deal with the whole contract that 
was awarded by DLS to VR Laser, you say that nothing was 
done wrong or that you acknowledge that something was 
done wrong or do you say in the middle category, I am not 
sure? 
 
Can we just identify transaction by transaction?  And 
then we can go into detail.  Because may I just suggest to 
you why it may be in the interest of yourself, avoiding 
lengthy evidence and questioning from me and so forth. 
 
If at the end of a long section that you may say, at the 
20 
end, to the Chairperson, in fact, I acknowledge that this was 
wrong.  Then I do not need to go through the long process of 
putting to you various documents and saying is this correct 
or not. 
 
If you say, I agree and I accept that unintentionally I did 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 102 of 246 
 
something, then at least we know that.  If, on the other hand, 
you say that particular contract was awarded.  Absolutely, it 
was squeaky clean.  There is nothing to accept was 
irregular.  Then we know that that may require a bit more 
detail. 
 
If there is something in the middle category, then we 
know that too.  So if you do not mind, subject to the 
guidance of the Chair, I would like to start with that and then 
we are going to go into deal with each contract to the extent 
that we need to. 
10 
MR BURGER:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was there in relation to the Hoefyster 
Platform Hulls Contract – what is the bottom-line there?  Do 
you accept that there was anything wrong about it or that 
there was nothing wrong about it or you are not sure? 
MR BURGER:   I will give a little bit more detail.  I think 
when it came to the whole evaluation, my opinion was the 
fact that we went out on multi-tender and not open tender, I 
do not think there was anything wrong with that.  I could not 
see any other way of doing that.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So that is for the request for office?  
The three suppliers being asked to ...[intervenes]  
MR BURGER:   The three ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...to submit bids. 
MR BURGER:   The three suppliers ...[intervenes]  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 103 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Instead of asking the entire nation, an 
advertisement in the ...[intervenes]  
MR BURGER:   Exactly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So that was acceptable, you 
say? 
MR BURGER:   That I think was correct.  Through that 
process – you are going to get there – but I did informed VR 
Laser that their price is ridiculous.  They are not serious 
about business, you know.   
 
And they did submit an unsolicited offer, at the time I did 
10 
not have group approval.  It was – it went through the 
process.  It was decided but I thought at the time, that is the 
only way to reduce the price but I do accept that that should 
not have been done. 
 
But if I did not do that, the price would not have been 
acceptable.  I am sure of that.  So I accept that that was 
wrong. 
 
When it comes the Single Source Agreement.  I, and I 
hope, just to state, that I – as time went on, I started 
realising the process given the new legislation and the new 
20 
policies at Denel, the process was not hundred percent 
correct.   
 
Only recently, I started realising that there could have 
even been a legislative issue but at the time, I did not know 
that at all.  So those were the only two, I think, were really 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 104 of 246 
 
substantial to talk about. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
The 
Denel Asia 
Project 
and 
transaction? 
MR BURGER:   I do not know.  I was not involved Chair in 
the decision, in the motivation thereof, in the logic thereof 
and in the final application.  My legal person did support 
head office to write papers but I was not intimately involved 
in that.  So I do not know.  I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Let us – and there are some 
other transaction we may have to come back to but I agree 
10 
that these are the primary area of focus as will be apparent 
from the evidence that the Chair and you have already heard 
from other witnesses. 
 
So let us go back to the Platform Hulls deal.  That 
related to 217 or perhaps a few less than of these particular 
armoured vehicles and that was a contract supplied by... 
 
Sorry, those were products to be supplied by VR Laser 
to DLS.  Is that correct? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And you have indicated that 
20 
you feel that there was nothing irregular about going out for 
simple three bidders rather than going out into the open 
marketplace.  And you have said that you have explained the 
reason that the defence industry is not appropriate to go out 
with this sort of product in an open tender process.  Now 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 105 of 246 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now there are different schools of 
thought about that and there could be a debate about that 
from a legal point of view.  I am not going to spend any time 
on that with you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Kennedy.  But I do want him to 
enlighten me on his thinking with regard to what he has said, 
namely in the defence industry you cannot invite the whole 
world.   
10 
 
Is the question not whether the Supply Chain Policy, the 
procurement policy, whether it allows you to do that or not?  
 
In other words, if the procurement policy does not do 
what you think is the way this thing should be done, you are 
not free to do things your own way.  You must comply with 
the rules. 
 
So, is the question not whether it was permitted to do it 
that way, namely just go for certain quotations from certain 
identified suppliers or whether it was not permitted? 
MR BURGER:   Point taken, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   You are right.  But in my mind, the Denel 
Procurement Policies allowed for multi-tender and not for 
open tender.  So in my mind, it was allowed.  Whether that 
was constitutionally correct, that is another matter. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 106 of 246 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   And I cannot comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR BURGER:   But in my mind, it was from a Denel 
perspective allowed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I take it that you – that must mean 
you did have – you have had a look at Denel’s policy and 
there is something there that made you think it is allowed.  
So in other words, you can point me to specific areas in the 
policy to say, this is what made me think this was allowed.  
10 
Or are you basing it on practise?   
 
Because I just need to know whether your view that it 
was allowed is based on you having applied your mind to the 
policy and seen something that you interpreted as allowing 
this. 
 
Or whether it is because you know of a certain practise 
at Denel that things were done in this way and that gave you 
the 
impression 
that 
it 
was 
allowed, 
which 
may 
not 
necessarily be what the policy said. 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I did not study the policy to that effect 
20 
to be an expert on exactly what it says.  It was my 
perception based on how things were done and who 
complaint and who did not complain.  So that was my opinion 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With regard to that answer.  It also 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 107 of 246 
 
becomes important to establish whether there was a practise 
in which this is – things were done this way and that is part 
of what may have influenced your view. 
 
Or whether there was no practise of doing things that 
way but in your own thinking, maybe because this was the 
defence industry and it has certain dynamics. 
 
Based on your own thinking you though there should be 
nothing wrong with doing things this way.  Which one is it? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I based my opinion, then and now, on 
the fact that we should have gone out on multi-tenders.  
10 
Whenever we went out on multi-tender, it was accepted by 
all.   
 
And if we do not go out on multi-tender and went for 
single source, there needed to be very compelling reasons 
and/or a single source agreement or whatever the case may 
be. 
 
But that is from my perspective and speaking for myself, 
was influenced by how it was done and the advice I was 
given and not sitting down and studying the policy myself.  
That I did not do. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can take you Mr Burger to the 
actual SCM Policy of Denel.  Just put aside for a moment the 
file that contains your affidavit.  And if you just refer to the 
box behind you of volumes?  If you can please look for Denel 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 108 of 246 
 
Bundle 1? 
MR BURGER:   [Speaker away from microphone – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy, I do not know whether it 
might be a good idea to adjourn and you direct him to 
whatever you want him to read. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then he can read it during the lunch 
break. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when we come back, he knows 
10 
exactly.  Is that fine? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am happy to do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then let us do it that way.  It is about half 
a minute to one.  So we will resume at two. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, during the 
20 
lunch adjournment I drew the attention of Mr Burger to two 
versions of the procurement policy of Denel.  Mr Burger, do 
you have available there the first bundle, bundle 1? 
MR BURGER:   I do have, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I referred you first to page 735. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 109 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   I have got it, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is the company policy on 
procurement of - the effective date you will see on page 
735, the 25 August 2008 and the other one that I drew your 
attention to is at page – in the same bundle, page 827. 
MR BURGER:   I have got it, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That seems to be the next version of 
the supply chain management policy that became – that 
was effective from 19 November 2014. 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, I as I understand it, the second 
policy coming into effect only in November 2014 did not 
apply to the procurement of the platform hulls that took 
place earlier in 2014, is that correct? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So if we go back to page 735 it 
seems to me that there was nothing to specific as to 
whether it should be a public tender, an open tender 
advertised in the media for anybody and everybody to 
tender …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Kennedy, I have not got 
yet where you are. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 735, bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it in another bundle, not the one that 
has got …[intervenes] 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 110 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair, I indicated it is 
bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Perhaps your registrar has not – 
does not have it.  It looks like he is still trying to find it.  I 
beg your pardon, Chair, I did not notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So, Mr Burger, are we agreed that 
the policy at page 735 is the one that applied at the time? 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is at the time of the platform 
hull contract and it appears to us that there was nothing 
specific to say whether you had to go out on a publicly 
advertised tender, an open tender or whether three quotes 
in an RFQ process was required. 
MR BURGER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you made an important 
point …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to tell me which particular 
clause or clauses appear to be the relevant ones? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   With respect, there does not appear 
to be anything that deals with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is there nothing that talks about how 
tenders are supposed to be handled? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, not in this …[intervenes] 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 111 of 246 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not on this one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the later version there is but that 
was not applicable at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Mr Burger you made an 
important point earlier that, of course, you cannot say 
whether this particular policy or any of the policies of 
Denel necessarily, as you put it, complied with the 
10 
Constitution and presumably also you mean with the PFMA 
and the Treasury regulations, is that right? 
MR BURGER:   That is right, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is not your area of expertise, 
you have areas of expertise elsewhere and presumably you 
would rely on your colleagues at Denel to ensure your 
supply chain management colleagues and your finance 
colleagues, etcetera, to deal with that. 
MR BURGER:   If I may add, Chair, we also had our own 
legal department and these were collective decisions. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, these were? 
MR BURGER:   Collective decisions.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, my expectation is that 
people who occupy positions within the public service, 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 112 of 246 
 
SOEs, government departments, from a certain level of 
seniority they would at least have an idea of what kind of 
legislation or regulations apply to their business or to what 
they have to do.  They might not be experts or specialists 
but they would have some idea and would know who to 
consult if they were not sure or if they wanted to know 
what the position is.  That is, to consult somebody some  
people like those who are in the supply chain management 
department in the organisation or the legal department in 
the organisation or even outside, lawyers, you know, where 
10 
it is deemed necessary. 
 
Now 
I 
would 
have 
expected 
that 
somebody 
occupying the position of CEO in DLS, such as yourself, 
would have an idea that well, PFMA or maybe even 
Treasury instructions, you know, this is what it says but 
whether it – how and when it applies in certain situations 
you might need advice from the experts or specialist but I 
would expect that you would have an idea.  Is that an 
unfair expectation? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, it is not an unfair expectation at all.  
20 
I think you are right.  The problem here, however, was that 
this was in a transition period, things – the National 
Treasury and its relations changed and we were running at 
300 kilometres an hour and in all honesty, that was not the 
focus of a person like me but your point that a person 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 113 of 246 
 
working in an SOC should have a fair opinion, I have got 
no argument about that, I think it is a fair comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And I would think that by, you 
know, 2010, 2014 that would have been a period by which 
particular people at certain senior positions in SOEs would 
know that there are always issues about compliance with 
PFMA and procurement policies and so on in regard to 
government departments and SOEs so that they would be, I 
would think, much more careful to say, you know, we do not 
want to do anything wrong, therefore, if we are not sure, 
10 
let us call in supply chain management people or legal 
department, tell us, are we going the right direction, are 
we are not going to be in breach of anything?  That would 
be also another expectation I would have.  What would you 
say about that part of the expectation? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I repeat, your comments are valid 
but we were running not a department, we are running a 
business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   And in all honesty, the fires …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The focus was …[intervenes] 
MR BURGER:   Ja, the focus was on different areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   Try to deliver the – to get an order, to keep 
the client satisfied and so on. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 114 of 246 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   Those were the issues that kept me awake 
at night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, yes. 
MR BURGER:   It was not procurement policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR BURGER:   And I understand it is wrong, I understand 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR BURGER:   But that was not my focus. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Mr 
Kennedy?  Switch on your mic, Mr Kennedy.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair.  I understand your 
concern that things were going - were having to move fast 
and one of your objectives from a business point of view to 
develop the business of Denel and advance the interests of 
its shareholder was to achieve business opportunities not 
lose them and not get bogged down.  But would you accept 
that it still had to be done lawfully? 
MR BURGER:   I do, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MR BURGER:   I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now – so, if I may, I would like to 
move away from the issue as to whether it was appropriate 
for you to go out for more than just the three bids that 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 115 of 246 
 
were invited.  You indicated that you feel with the benefit 
of hindsight and having hear the other witnesses that it 
was inappropriate for you to have conducted negotiations 
with VR Laser after it submitted its price to negotiate a 
reduction in the price, is that correct?   
MR BURGER:   I accept that under rules it was incorrect. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now have you heard the 
evidence and seen the documents that show that when the 
RFQ process was followed and the quotations or the bids 
were received from the three entities, the two of particular 
10 
relevance, being VR Laser and LMT, were very far apart.  
The cost of the items in question that LMT was bidding for 
would have involved approximately 150 million, is that 
correct?  
MR BURGER:   I cannot recall, I thought it was a little bit 
higher than 150, but I will not argue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the amount for VR Laser was 
approximately 260 million. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And we will look at, in a 
20 
moment, 
at 
the 
memorandums 
that 
came 
from 
Ms 
Malahlela’s 
office 
but 
what 
was 
then 
decided, 
as 
I 
understand it, by your management committee at the 
regional 
level, 
the 
DLS 
level, 
was 
that 
you 
should 
approach VR Laser to negotiate a reduction in price, is that 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 116 of 246 
 
right? 
MR BURGER:   Not exactly correct, Chair.  What happened 
was – and I accept by saying this that we are going to get 
to the point why I was so adamant about VR Laser but 
accepting that for a moment, I was approached by both Mr 
Reenen Teubes and Ms Malahlela to say – and at that time 
both of them supported VR Laser.  They however said that 
the price is a real problem for the budget.  My question 
was, did they win the competition fairly and squarely 
regardless of the price and they said yes and I said well, 
10 
leave it to me, I will see what I can do. 
So it was not an initiative that came from me, it was 
an initiative that said this is the preferred supplier, the 
price is high and what I then did is I did not get in my car 
take people and drove there and go and sit down and 
negotiate.  Originally it was so unimportant that I did not 
even really remembered it but hearing all the evidence, I 
recollect that I phoned VR Laser and I cannot remember 
my words but I said something to the effect of you are 
obviously not serious about doing business with us, I 
20 
mean, your price is ridiculous, goodbye.  
That was the extent of my negotiation.  So I was 
hoping, I must be honest with you, I was hoping that they 
will see the light and do something proper and get – and 
what subsequently happened was they did solicit another 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 117 of 246 
 
proposal. 
Chair, at the time I was convinced if I did not take 
the opportunity then and if I waited until after the process 
was completed and everybody that was involved said no, it 
is okay, let us contract VR Laser, that they would have 
known about that long before it.  It is just how people talk 
too much.  And I would have had no basis of negotiating a 
proper price.  The price was unacceptable. 
So the policy – and I did not know it then because 
what I thought at the time was because they were the 
10 
number one supplier, I had the right - and I thought they 
were going to win and I had the right, they were the 
recommended one, to negotiate with them.  But I did not 
negotiate, I just said your price is ridiculous and that 
formed the basis to negotiate later on.  I had - as a matter 
of fact, it is not that I even argued with Ms Malahlela about 
not putting that, I supported it, to not in the motivation put 
the reduced price in.  But if we did not do that, Chair, there 
would not have been an opportunity to reduce the price.  
Why would they if they knew that they were going to get 
20 
the work?   
So that was the reasoning but I accept that policy 
states first award, then negotiate, I understand that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it be correct to say you accept 
that you may have or you did do something that was not 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 118 of 246 
 
appropriate but you believe that ultimately you were doing 
it for the good of Denel? 
MR BURGER:   We saved millions of that single phone call, 
Chair.  So I truly believe that.  I still believe that if I did 
not do that, the price would have been much more.  So I 
honestly believed it was for the best of Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course the whole framework, if 
one uses the procurement processes, they are meant to 
ultimately achieve what is in the interests of the company, 
working within the framework and not outside.  And not 
10 
outside, so you accept that? 
MR BURGER:   I understood.  I understood, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR BURGER:   I am not arguing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that there is a reason for, so to 
speak, banning any outside role other than within the 
framework.  In other words, the framework, what did the 
company expect?  Is that all role players will work within 
the framework and not outside and it would discourage 
anybody 
from 
going 
outside 
to 
say 
whatever 
your 
20 
suspicions or whatever, work within the framework because 
those who have put the framework together believe that 
that is the best way of handling these matters.  You would 
accept that? 
MR BURGER:   I will accept that, Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 119 of 246 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   But I want to add that when we had that 
discussion – and I said let me do something about this, I 
will try outside the procurement policy, nobody said oi, you 
cannot do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   This is a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   Everybody around that table wanted to see 
the price reduced, so and - but your point is taken, Chair, 
10 
one hundred percent, no argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I want to go back 
to a point that the learned Chair raised with you earlier and 
that is what is expected of a CEO such as yourself at DLS.  
Let us accept for a moment that your colleagues also 
wanted VR Laser and let us accept for a moment that 
nobody raised any objection to your going to negotiate and 
let us accept for a moment that you were simply genuinely 
wanting to benefit Denel by getting a reduction in price, 
20 
surely as part of your functions and responsibilities and 
duties as CEO, was not simply to get the best price for 
Denel but also to comply with the rules, the law and the 
rules internally within Denel as to how prices would be 
achieved and they were to be achieved in terms of 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 120 of 246 
 
prescribe procedure.  Now whether you liked the rules or 
not, you were bound by those procedures, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I have conceded to this point, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, yes.  It just seems to me, Mr 
Burger, is that it may have been irresponsible of you not to 
go – sorry, to go ahead and negotiate with them when in 
fact the rules did not permit it, as you now acknowledge.  
Why did you not take the trouble to find out the rules 
beforehand or ask people who might have had a bit more 
expertise, for example Ms Malahlela or Mr Mlambo at head 
10 
office level? 
MR BURGER:   I repeat, Ms Malahlela was in that meeting. 
When I made that phone call I did not believe that I was 
transgressing at the time.  I can now see by the – but at 
the time… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   And, Chair, yes, I have conceded to that 
point, I should have taken the trouble. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now one of the problems was that 
20 
you had a limited budget for these items, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can you recall what that budget was? 
MR BURGER:   I cannot recall exactly, it was around a 
million rand per hull. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 121 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  A million rand per hull and there were 
about 200 of them, so it was about 200 million.  In fact that 
is roughly the figure as we have seen in earlier evidence.  
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now was there not also another issue 
that you had to consider and that is in terms of the 
delegation of authority, you only had authority up to a 
certain point, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At divisional level.  You may have 
10 
wanted 
a 
lot 
more 
because 
of 
the 
decentralisation 
advantages that you have argued for earlier before the 
Chair but you had to live with the fact that the delegation 
of authority then limited your authority, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair, but I did not have a problem 
with the delegations at that point.  I was not complaining 
about the delegation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, just hear me out, if you would?  
Now, as it happens, the limit of authority in relation to a 
contract of this sort of order, in fact there was a difference 
20 
between contracts under 200 million and contracts of or 
above 200 million and in the case of contracts above 200 
million you would have required the full board of Denel 
head office to approve this, not so?  
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 122 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Anything above a certain limit but 
below 200 million would be subject to approval by the 
GCEO, the Group CEO. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was the negotiation to bring down 
the price, did that have anything to do with any attempt to 
try and avoid having to put the matter before the whole 
board, perhaps in the interest of being quick so you did not 
have to wait for the next board or whatever? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I want to reject that notion totally.  
10 
That was not even remotely in our minds at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you even aware of the 200 
million limit? 
MR BURGER:   Probably.  Probably at the time, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you accept now that at least with 
the benefit of hindsight that if you are going to follow some 
sort of competitive process as you did here to a limited 
extent by inviting three bids and whether that was enough 
or whether you wanted -  a full tender we have already 
dealt with, I am not going to go back on that, but do you 
20 
now accept with benefit of hindsight that if a process is in 
fact competitive such as a three entity bidder process 
where you go out with a request for quotes from three 
bidders, do you accept that you have to be fair as between 
all three bidders? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 123 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Absolutely, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now what happened here was 
that you or your staff went out with an RFQ, presumably 
not you, you did not issue it yourself, is that right? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you were aware of the process, 
not so, that it went out on an RFQ to three bidders.   
MR BURGER:   I was aware, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And each of them submitted bids? 
MR BURGER:   I was aware of it, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you are aware that it was about 
160 million for LMT, a little bit less, in fact, and around 260 
million from VR Laser? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We have already dealt with that.  
Now was it not – do you accept now the wisdom and the 
need to – if you are going to allow any party to revise its 
price, if you are allowed to do that at all, you cannot select 
one party to have that opportunity where the others are not 
selected, not so? 
20 
MR BURGER:   Chair, the reasoning at the time was, in our 
minds they fairly won the competition at their original 
price.  That and for that reason alone did I have the guts or 
the inclination to contact them.  If they did not win and if 
they were second in the scale, there would have been no 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 124 of 246 
 
way that I would have phoned just them to try and get them 
at number one and that was the reason why we – why I did 
not even argue - as a matter fact I supported the fact that 
we cannot use those improved prices as part of the 
evaluation.  My thinking at the time was there was a 
recommendation, there was a multidisciplinary team that 
was part of that recommendation.  They came up to an 
answer, they came to me and I was fairly certain that that 
recommendation would be approved by Denel so I took that 
opportunity to say can we not squeeze the for a better 
10 
price. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   My question – I am sorry, have you 
finished? 
MR BURGER:   No, I think I have finished. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   My question is – and we will come 
back to the justification for going to VR Laser to get a 
price and I understand your point that you were aiming to 
get a better price so that Denel would land up paying less 
and you would then achieve the objective of getting an 
acceptable product at an acceptable price but at the 
20 
moment I am dealing with something different and that is 
this.  There is a competition on the go in this RFQ process, 
not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and Denel has to undertake the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 125 of 246 
 
decision 
at 
the 
end 
of 
that competition 
process 
by 
comparing the three quotes, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now you did in fact allow VR 
Laser to change its price and it went down from about 260 
million to 195 million, correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was achieved, you say, just 
through a phone call.  
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, either you have the most 
remarkable ability to be persuasive in a phone call or the 
other possibility is that VR Laser had just put in their 260-
odd million tender recklessly and very casually because 
they thought this is going to be easy, let us make fat 
profits out of Denel.  Which one is it or is there a 
[indistinct] 27.12  that I have missed?  
MR BURGER:   I will be speculating on their behalf if I 
would give an opinion but what I think happened was that 
there was a first round in 2012, I think it was, and in that 
20 
first round it was fairly clear that VR Laser was the most 
competitive one.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Most competitive in what sense? 
MR BURGER:   In terms of price. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In terms of price? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 126 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   The price, yes.  And I think they were 
probably a little bit resting on their laurels in terms of 
price.  I think they thought we have got this in the bag.  I 
think. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Burger, I am not trying to be 
difficult or to catch you out, I am just trying to understand 
your evidence.  I understand that there was an earlier 
process in which they were asked to give some sort of 
indicative prices but that did not lead to an actual award, 
is that what you are saying? 
10 
MR BURGER:   No, it did not.  No, it did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It did not lead to that.  And you say 
you think that they knew that they were probably going to 
get it and you think they then exploited that by pushing up 
the price.  How would they have thought that they were 
probably going to get an award of a contract that only took 
place two years later?  And how – where would they have 
got that information from? 
MR BURGER:   I do not know, I do not know and I say 
again, I am speculating, I do not know that happened.  I 
20 
know I gave a very angry call to VR Laser and yes, I think 
they had to sharpen their pencils. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say lengthy call? 
MR BURGER:   Angry call, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, angry call. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 127 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Angry call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you were angry that they had 
abused their situation and come in with a rather cheeky 
high price? 
MR BURGER:   I thought the price was too high, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now I just want to go back as 
to your speculation.  Obviously you are not stating this a s 
a matter of fact and I appreciate that. 
MR BURGER:   Ja, I do not know. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You do not have facts to back this 
up.  
MR BURGER:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But, you see, I think – but do you 
appreciate that when Denel is an entity that was in some 
financial difficulty that required bailouts from government 
to get it out of its financial difficulties, where you are 
dealing with vast amounts of public money and where there 
may have been, even on your own admission, some 
breaches of the law of procurement policies which are 
20 
binding, and where as it happens later it turns out that one 
of the – that the supplier in question actually has 
controversial links.  Do you accept that it is appropriate for 
the public and for this Commission to be entitled to look 
into how it comes about that a supplier gets business? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 128 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   No argument Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so when we look at this it is 
important to understand whether this was a genuinely fair 
and legal and honest competitive process, not one in which 
there may have been funny business. 
 
Now I am not saying that there was funny business 
here, it is for the Chairperson to decide at a later stage 
whether there was and to what extent but the Chair is 
entitled to look into whether then – whether there is a 
proper justification for business decisions. 
10 
 
Now there is a controversy that is raging in the 
media and in the public debate and so forth, as to whether 
VR Laser was getting this and a number of other lucrative 
contracts that we will deal with in a moment, at least the 
DLS contract you know about and the DVS contract that 
you were not directly involved in. 
 
There is concern as to well how was this justified?   
Now if there is a proper justification then one may be 
satisfied but as you have suggested earlier the Gupta link, 
the State Capture allegations that actually had nothing to 
20 
do with it.  As you said this was a genuine bona fide lawful 
up to a point transaction. 
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if it was unlawful that was bona 
fide it was an oversight it was not intended to favour 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 129 of 246 
 
anybody.  Do you understand where we…[intervene]   
MR BURGER:   I understand.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   …what the gravity of this and the 
objective is.  Now it just seems to me and in fact some of 
the other witnesses such as Mr Mlambo have commented 
on this, it just seems to me as an outsider although Mr 
Mlambo was an insider with expertise in supply chain 
management in the Denel context.   
He expressed real concern as to whether in fact this  
was a genuine transaction at all and one of the points that 
10 
he raised in his evidence before the learned Chair was can 
one take seriously a supply that comes in with R260 odd 
million as its initial price and then after a negotiation 
process happily brings it down or maybe feels that it 
should do but it ultimately voluntarily brings its price down 
to a R195million.   
Now you tell us that took a brief conversation 
admittedly one in which you expressed a tone of anger but 
it just seems to me that when you talking about such a 
massive 
difference 
in 
price 
something 
looks 
wrong, 
20 
something smells a bit fishy.  Do you understand the 
problem?         
MR BURGER:   Chair if you look at the first iteration of 
prices the LMT price was double the one they quoted so we 
were use to a little bit of fluctuations in the price that is 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 130 of 246 
 
so.  It is – that was a substantial saving and I was very 
happy.  So I think the supplier were pushing the envelope, 
I think so.  I think that R260million was not warranted.   
The issue here for me is what did we use to 
evaluate them and in my mind that was post the evaluation 
they did come out number one and therefore I had to do 
something to get the price down.  But Chair that is what 
happened and the intention was to help Denel – otherwise 
why would I want to get the price down, what other reason 
can there be to get the price down.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well that is the problem if I may 
interrupt and I apologise for doing so I do not mean to be 
rude.  Is that not the problem?   
The public and the Commission need really to know 
whether this was a genuine reduction in price not only your 
own bona fide’s but whether VR Laser were acting bona 
fide or whether your colleagues in Denel were and so even 
if one accepts that you were in good faith and simply 
acting in the interest of Denel’s trying to bring down the 
price.  
20 
Do you not agree that this is a disturbing feature of  
those events that VR Laser came in with what you have 
said is an unacceptably high price and then magically just 
from a short or be it angry conversation you managed to 
cause them to bring down their price massively.      
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 131 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Chair I was under the impression that they 
after my discussion with them that they were not going to 
get the business and I think they wanted to make 
sure…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That they were not? 
MR BURGER:   That they were not going to get the 
business.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  
MR BURGER:   And that is why the reason why I thought 
they came down substantially.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now you have mentioned that 
they were clearly so suited and they had been evaluated 
on the basis that they were better than LMT.  
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you aware that the scoring that 
was done not by you but an evaluation team that was 
appointed in terms of the Denel policy evaluation team 
assessed the technical side the BBBEE side and the price 
and LMT came within a whisker in terms of scoring of the 
scoring given by the evaluation team to VR Laser.  It was 
20 
less 
than 
one 
percent 
it 
was 
about 
zero 
point 
six 
percent…[intervene]   
MR BURGER:   Zero point seven percent.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   …in the scoring.  
MR BURGER:   I am aware of it Chair.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 132 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and one of the main reasons 
why LMT did so well in relation to that issue was because 
their price was so much better, correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now why did… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well…[intervene] 
MR BURGER:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay continue. 
MR BURGER:   Why did you then not take this approach?  
If you were looking at this with your colleagues and a 
10 
decision has to be made as to who as the party to whom 
the tender should be awarded.  Does this not sound a 
logical approach; we have two tenderers that have an 
absolutely marginal difference less than one percent a 
negligible difference I am suggesting to you.   
But what is hugely significant is that if we go LMT 
rather than VR Laser we going to save about R100million.  
Now does that make sense to you?  That could have been 
an approach that you could have adopted, no so?   
MR BURGER:   If we used the original price, if we 
20 
contracted VR Laser at the original price there would have 
been but the dilemma was there was not a R100milion.  I 
was not prepared to pay R260million…[intervene]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct.  
MR BURGER:   …because there was not a R100million 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 133 of 246 
 
laying available to do certain things with.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You had a budget and you had to 
work within that budget.  
MR BURGER:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   R260million would have brought them 
way out of the budget.  
MR BURGER:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, but there was another reason 
why you were not prepared to accept the R260million and 
that is even if you had the kitty of money, even if you had 
10 
the budget of maybe R500million you would not have done 
it because you thought it was an exorbitant price, not so?  
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And one of the reasons that it seems 
to you to be exorbitant and I think everybody would agree 
with you is that it is a R100million more than one of their 
competitors LMT.   
MR BURGER:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Sorry Chair there is two reasons we had a 
20 
fairly good idea of how much it should cost because we 
had our tariffs, we had process times, we had material 
costs.  So we knew what is a fair price and not a fair price.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so you knew it was not in the 
R260million ball park a fair price would have been more 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 134 of 246 
 
like a R160million.   
MR BURGER:  R200million.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   R200million? 
MR BURGER:   I thought R200million was a ballpark.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You thought R200million but is it not 
a whole point of a competitive procurement process that 
whatever you may think well we can – R200million would 
be a fair price if you can get it for a R150million that would 
be good news.  You should not say well let us pay 
R200million while we at it, not so?    
10 
MR BURGER:   Absolutely not Chair if we could get it for 
R150million I would take it with a smile.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the point is Mr Burger you could 
have got it for a R150million approximately because that is 
exactly what LMT was offering you and that is my point.   
MR BURGER:   Chair at this point can I please say why I 
was not supporting LMT.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I thought I had asked you that 
question about ten minutes ago.  
MR BURGER:   LMT. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   LMT, but before you do that I am sorry 
Mr Kennedy before you do that I want you to go back to Mr 
Kennedy’s question that you have not answered.  He asked 
you whether you accept that it would have been an 
approach open to you or to Denel to take to say and Mr 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 135 of 246 
 
Kennedy you must listen carefully I do not want to 
misrepresent what you were saying.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say this two companies were so close 
to each other in terms of score if the price of the one is so 
way above the one for the other company we should go 
with the one with the lower price.  Now I may have 
misrepresented what you were just saying.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No the spec is spot on Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so do you accept that that was an 
10 
approach you could have taken or Denel could have taken 
with justification but you may have preferred a different 
one but it is an approach that could have been legitimate.   
MR BURGER:   It is an approach that could have been 
legitimate I think it would have been irresponsible but I it’s 
a legitimate…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I don’t know if it would have been 
legitimate if you would have been irresponsible.    
MR BURGER:   My honest opinion at the time was it would 
not have been in the best interest of Denel and this is 
20 
why…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and I guess that will come out when 
you say why you did not support LMT.   
MR BURGER:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay deal with that then.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 136 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, if you can deal with that.  
MR BURGER:   Chair I will try and make it quick.  Firstly, I 
just want to get the reason for the LMT acquisition off the 
table it will take me two seconds.  I was the biggest 
promoter of buying LMT and I was very concerned when 
LMT was in a financial crises and the reason for that was 
they were busy with development work.   
There designs were not fixed yet, the design would  
have hung in the air nobody would have been there to 
finish the landmine protection and Chair I want to place on 
10 
record a couple of defamatory things was said about me 
yesterday by Dr Stephan Nell but be that as it may he is – I 
always respected him for his engineering capability and his 
marketing capability.  I think I really thought and I still 
believe his one of the brightest engineers I have ever met 
and that is what drew me to LMT.   
So we - also contrary to what was said earlier, what 
was then done was we gave LMT an order on risk, it was a 
risk order with a pre-payment with an objective to help 
them.  It was transparent, it was discussed with the Board 
20 
with everybody.  So the first step was we made sure that 
they did not go under. So the second step was to exercise 
our options to acquire LMT.  The first and most important 
reason and this is what people do not understand was we 
did not acquire them for their production capability as a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 137 of 246 
 
matter of fact the reason why they went bankrupt in the 
first place was because they went from a design house, a 
design capability to a production capability.  That is why 
they ran into trouble in the first place.   
So we were as Denel we were on the level four 
system supply level which means we were supplying turrets 
to the client.  They were buying a tarot and then they 
would buy a different product like the vehicle, the weapon 
platform from another supplier.  Then they would buy 
ammunition from another supplier and then they would buy 
10 
simulators from yet another supplier and Armscor then had 
the accountability, responsibility to do just exist twenty 
screws and then the tarot is on top of the vehicle and you 
put the ammunition in the car and then everything is fine.   
And then as long as it works it is fine but if you 
missed the target and especially on a complex system we 
find moving to moving systems.  If you miss who’s to blame 
and what then happened was and this is why Armscor went 
out, first they went out for a tarot and vehicle and then 
they decided no we are going to go out on a level five 
20 
product system which is inclusive of all these things.  So 
we knew that if we wanted to compete in that area we 
needed to team up with somebody and we teamed up with 
EADS that did not work and we had to grow our own 
capability. So what we – combat system consists of three 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 138 of 246 
 
technical areas.  It is fire power which sits in the gun and 
the tarot, it is protection and it is mobility.  Those are the 
three technological areas you need to understand if you 
want to play in the area of a level five.   
We thought they will bring that to us it did not work 
out and at that time I saw LMT with the design capability of 
vehicles and especially the design capability to give 
protection.  The flat bottom design technologies as an ideal 
area to strengthen Denel Land Systems not Denel, Denel 
Land Systems.   
10 
On the contrary I thought that what is lacking at 
LMT were they did not have proper process engineers, 
process design.  Their quality processes were lacking, 
there general management skills I thought was lacking, 
there financial management system was not in my mind 
proper and I thought that is exactly what Denel Land 
Systems had.   
So if we could manage LMT as an extension of 
Denel Land Systems then it would be the best of both 
worlds and then so the reason the main drive for LMT was 
20 
there strategic capability to ensure a proper level five 
system capability.  I do concede and I was the first to say 
if we implement now all these things in LMT and strengthen 
their capabilities then they can also be a supplier of 
fabricated stuff, they can even make build vehicles or 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 139 of 246 
 
whatever the case may be.  I was really convinced of the 
fact that we can grow LMT into a supplier of substance and 
I believe that with my whole heart.   
Why did LMT fail?  Those processes were never 
implemented in – we started off like that Stephan Nell was 
part of my executive team, my quality people and my 
process engineers and so on were in their facilities working 
there.  I was at the Board of LMT I was working there, it 
was even announced publically that they will be part of 
Denel Land Systems and then they got a big contract from 
10 
Saudi Arabia and I was called in to the office of the then 
Group CEO Mr Saloojee and he said it is a conflict of 
interest for me to be so close to LMT.   
Henceforth you should no longer be on the Board, 
your people should exit LMT and you should contract LMT 
at an arm’s length and from that moment on LMT was left 
to their own devices and Denel managed through the Board 
or tried to manage through the Board LMT.   
So what happened then I made a commitment and I 
kept to my commitment by giving them all this.  I gave them 
20 
seven substantial orders in those years leading up to 2014.  
The one was and this was – sorry I just need to address 
the court because that is a point that was made from a 
capacity capability and a financial perspective.  So from a 
capability perspective I gave them all this, all of those 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 140 of 246 
 
orders 
had 
problems 
I 
heard 
Dr 
Nell 
say 
it 
was 
exaggerated it did not happen.  Let me give you two 
examples Chair…[intervene]                                               
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you need to Mr Burger? 
MR BURGER:   Yes I think it is important, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well please try and keep it brief 
because I am afraid we going into all sorts of terrain that 
does not really seem to have direct relevance to the 
question that you have been asked to focus on.  
MR BURGER:   I think it has got all the relevant.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright finish your points then please 
and then may I just develop my questioning with you 
please.  
MR BURGER:   Correct two projects that I want to focus 
on.  The first one was the ambulances, the ambulances 
went through a process where we went through various 
iterations and at the end of the day I begged the client to 
accept 
them 
even 
though 
they 
did 
not 
comply 
to 
specification and I made a personal promise that I will 
ensure that if they ever give problems we will be happy to 
20 
replace.   
The second thing that happened fifteen Casper ’s 
that were delivered to the United Nations started cracking.  
I did not have a big problem with the fact that they cracked 
because people make mistakes the problem was when I 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 141 of 246 
 
asked to rectify those Casper ’s they came and they just 
weld the plates over the cracks and obviously it is armour 
steel they crack next to where they were welded.  So what 
then happened was we were a single source or preferred 
not single source a preferred supplier to the United 
Nations at that point.  So what then happened is the United 
Nations threatened to blacklist us.   
Denel Land Systems brought fifteen Casper ’s back 
had them rebuilt and sent fifteen Casper ’s back to them.  
Now my dilemma was not so much that there was a 
10 
problem my problem was that LMT never admitted to say 
maybe there was a problem from my side how can I fix this 
problem.   
Denel Land Systems from a financial perspective 
ended up paying to bring the vehicles here and send them 
back and rebuild them it was just shy of R30million tab that 
Denel Land Systems and Denel picked up.   
This is a safety critical item Chair a hull for a 
Casper is a simple thing it has been built for the last 60 
years it is a simple thing to compare that with the 
20 
Hoefyster Hull is like chalk and cheese.   
So that is the first point the second point I want to 
make is they had a capacity problem they just got the 
biggest order of their life to Saudi Arabia by the way also 
for turrets which they did not place on us and I want to put 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 142 of 246 
 
on record…[intervene]                  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry which they didn’t? 
MR BURGER:   Place on Denel Land Systems we were the 
tarot house in South Africa.  They preferred not to buy the 
turrets from us, I went to Stephan Nell and said please this 
is irresponsible let me just then help you to do the design 
for that turrets then somebody else can make the money 
out of the production to ensure that we have got a safety 
tarot system which we then did.   
So with that as background when somebody came to 
10 
me and said – and that just happened I mean that was 
fresh in our minds to say here is LMT they have halved 
their price from their previous quote.  I just knew that the 
previous mistakes or my burden financially and otherwise 
and they halved their price, I said I do not believe this.  
The cost of that thing is going to increase and it is going to 
be for my burden.             
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You did not believe the R160million 
there was a genuine price?  
MR BURGER:   The sums that…[intervene] 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So is that what you’re saying? 
MR BURGER:   I am saying that, I am saying at the time 
the people in Denel Land Systems were sceptical that they 
would be able to do that and if they did it at that price it 
would probably be at a loss which again would have been 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 143 of 246 
 
for Denel’s.  So to come back if we had to place money in 
LMT 
to 
bring 
them 
up 
to 
standard 
as 
one 
of 
the 
suggestions.  It is not as simple as that Chair because we 
were only 31% shareholder.  So if we brought R50million to 
the table you have to dilute the other shareholders or do 
something.  You cannot just bring in money from nowhere 
and to be honest Chair it is a long way I have calmed down 
a lot since then but if somebody ask me then please give 
some more money to LMT so that they can be up to 
standard I would have aggressively fought that notion.   
10 
So that was the reason Chair which I said you know 
I would rather somebody that I – oh by the way I wanted to 
say this as well.  We had a scoring system how we rate 
suppliers and at the time VR Laser was in the top sector of 
suppliers and LMT was right at the bottom.       
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry in terms of what?  
MR BURGER:   In terms of customer satisfaction. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So in customer satisfaction. 
MR BURGER:   So it is quality, it is on time delivery, it is 
do you accept that you have made a mistake, are you 
20 
going to fix your mistake.  Those sort of things.       
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that reflected in the criteria 
for the scoring of the…[intervene] 
MR BURGER:   Not at all it was not but it was the 
engineers I was not part of that but...[intervene] 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 144 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, but sorry to interrupt Mr Burger 
and 
you 
must 
please 
allow 
me 
to 
question 
you 
at 
appropriate stages rather than going on and on and giving 
us a long session which makes it very difficult to unpack.  
The evaluation was done in terms of the criteria that was 
laid down in terms of the policy.    
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
You 
thought 
that 
customer 
satisfaction was something that should have been in the 
criteria but it was not.  You could not reinvent the criteria 
10 
you were bound by them whether you liked it or not, 
whether you think it was a good idea or not, whether the 
Chair of this Commission thinks it is a good idea or not is 
with respect irrelevant.       
MR BURGER:   Agreed Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is what was laid down.  
MR BURGER:   Agreed Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So once again rather like the 
decentralisation type of argument is this not something you 
wished it had been a certain way but it was not and you 
20 
have already conceded rightly that you were bound by the 
situation that you were facing.     
MR 
BURGER: 
 
 
Supported 
and 
agreed 
Chair 
but…[intervene]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, sorry yes.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 145 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   But the point being those criteria’s were 
followed and VR Laser won the competition.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But by point six of a percent.  
MR BURGER:   True.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you seriously suggesting that 
because they got the higher score are you suggesting that 
you were bound to give them the contract because of that?  
MR BURGER:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes? 
MR BURGER:   Yes, Chair they won the competition.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry they won the competition? 
MR BURGER:   They won the competition.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But in terms of procurement policies 
you are not necessarily bound to award a contract to a 
particular supplier where it has a score and better than its 
nearest rivals.  There is a measure of discretion allowed 
and particularly with point six percent.  So it cannot be 
right that you were bound to give it because it scored the 
highest.   
You may have felt you were bound to give it 
20 
because you thought only it could provide the best service 
and in fact many passages in your affidavit I am not going 
to take you to them but many passages seem to suggest 
exactly that that you Mr Burger maybe for very good reason 
thought that VR Laser were a wonderful supplier and that 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 146 of 246 
 
LMT was not a wonderful supplier in fact it had problems 
but that therefore come what may VR Laser should get the 
contract.   
It was not because they scored zero point six 
percent better it is because you felt that they were way 
above LMT and that LMT in fact should not really be 
considered at all, not so?      
MR BURGER:   Chair I stated it in writing in emails that I 
was not prepared to support VR Laser if they did not win 
the criteria based on the original proposals made, that is 
10 
so.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, well we know that they had won 
but they won by a marginal difference we went through all 
of that already.   
MR BURGER:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So can I just go back to your earlier 
evidence effectively if I understand your evidence correctly 
and if I have got the wrong understanding please correct 
that for the benefit of the Chair.   
You seem to be saying whatever difference in price 
20 
there may have been between LMT and VR Laser only VR 
Laser should have got that contract firstly because you 
could not believe the price of a R160million of LMT you 
thought that was a bit of nonsense it had reduced from 
their previous price dramatically and you felt that was 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 147 of 246 
 
suspicious.   
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   VR Laser you managed to get down 
their price but you felt that that was acceptable.       
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That was a massive reduction on 
their part but that you felt was all in order and then on top 
of it you felt LMT just could not do the job.  Is that not 
really what you saying here?   
MR BURGER:   Chair at the time if the pain of paying 
10 
R30mllion of looking a client in the face was very fresh in 
my mind that is true, firstly.  Secondly I dispute the fact 
that LMT can do a lot of work.  And it is difficult to answer 
these questions without elaborating, but like a gun barrel 
which Denel Land Systems manufactures, after that decided 
to, to outsource more or less everything because it is a 
safety critical item.  I thought the hole was a safety critical 
item.   
My problem was not so much that at all cost VR 
Laser must did the work.  That was no my argument.  My 
20 
argument was this is a safety critical item.  It is – we just 
gone through a whole set for whatever reason that cracked 
and if we have something like that on Hoefyster, it will be 
catastrophic.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So Mr Burger are you saying this and I 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 148 of 246 
 
go back to my last question.  Are saying that you were not 
impressed by LMT’s price partly because that they had 
dramatically reduced it.  But secondly because you felt that 
they could not provide a sufficiently safe product, correctly 
saying? 
MR BURGER:  Correct yes, under those circumstances. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now then I have a further difficulty.  
Why on earth does DLS go through the trouble of asking LMT 
to submit a price, a bid in the first place if you know so suit 
some as you are now that LMT is not going to be able to 
10 
supply a safe price?   
This was not an open tender where somebody sees in 
the Sunday Times or Citizen Newspaper advertisement 
request for proposals from Denel.  Not so?  You did not 
invite the market to submit tenders and you might have got 
tenders if you done that from all sorts of people who did not 
a turret from a bar of soap.  But here you were, your 
company went out and decided we are not going to go out on 
an open tender; we are going to go out as we normally do, 
on an RFQ.   
20 
And we are going to go out to people to submit bids 
in order presumably to get the best price.  And who are we 
going to select?  We are going to select VR Laser, LMT and 
DRD.  Presumably because we think that they are people 
who can do it and we want them to compete against each 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 149 of 246 
 
other to see who is going to be the best price.  And so what 
happens, LMT tenders a price.  VR Laser tenders a price and 
lo and behold it is 100 million difference.   
Now you seem to be saying, well you cannot accept 
the genuiness of their price, so it is not a true comparison 
between 150 million and 260 million.  So it is not a true 
price.  But most important LMT could not be relied on to do 
the job.  Why on earth go through the whole process of 
asking them all to submit quotes against each other?   
Why go through a process of having a committee that 
10 
evaluates them and tests all sorts of things and works out a 
score and so forth?  If Mr Burger behind the scenes has 
already decided long ago, well LMT is, is, should not be 
considered.  This does not make sense to me.  
MR BURGER:  Fair comment Chair.  I think it is a fair 
comment at that point, but please remember the decision to 
go through those three suppliers was not my decision. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  That was a decision taken in 20 – before 
2012.  So by 2012 these problems, I was still sitting on the 
20 
board of LMT by at that stage I thought that I was told to 
contract them.  But at arm’s length but I thought that they 
had more than fair probability of getting the work and we 
went out with three tenderers.  These problems I am talking 
right now was not on the table.   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 150 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But they were on the table that their 
value, at the time at the Evaluation Committee did its 
scoring.  An Evaluation Committee had to score, not only the 
price where obviously LMT had a huge advantage. 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But also technical capability.   
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Surely your colleagues who were 
involved in the technical evaluation for purposes of scoring 
could and should have taken into account exactly the 
10 
problems that are raising.  And despite that they say, well we 
are giving them some points.  They gave them less points 
than 
VR 
Laser, 
presumably 
because 
there 
had 
been 
problems.   
MR BURGER:  Correct yes.  Sorry the first question was … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  Why did, why did we even consider LMT at 
the time? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  So, so I am just saying it is, this process 
20 
started already in 2012. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes you made that … 
MR BURGER:  And in 2014 it was basically a continuation of 
that process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  (00:05:00). 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 151 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  That is why they were scored.  I am, I am 
binking(?) my personal frustration at the time, but that I do 
not believe influenced the scoring system, because I was not 
interacting with the people doing the scoring for that.  They 
made up their own minds.  They evaluated and on that they, 
VR Laser won.   
So when they brought it to me I, I wanted to make 
sure that they win and if they won I wanted, I had all these, 
these things passed their capacity problem with Saudi Arabia 
at LMT.  I just said it will be irresponsible.  And I again, 
10 
Saudi Arabia did not successful – was not successfully 
concluded for these very same reasons.   
So, so Chair I really think it would have been 
irresponsible.  That was my point at the time, but having said 
all of that and I want to, I want to make that point, I accepted 
and I put it in writing that it was not my decision.  I said it is 
Denel Head Office decision.  I have given them my reasons, 
please make your decision, but in the mean time the 
technology transfer to be able to do welder training, that slot 
is passing us by.   
20 
And I decided at Denel Land Systems Cost to send 
both LMT and VR Laser personnel to Finland to get their 
training.  So I was, I was, it is not that I said I will not do 
that and I will walk away.  I was prepared to implement the 
decision of Denel, but I was making a point.  This is a safety 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 152 of 246 
 
critical item, it would have been irresponsible.   
COMMISSIONER:  Well I think you said and maybe other 
witness also said that the price, original price that the other 
(00:07:17) are had quoted.   
MR BURGER:  Yes Chair.   
COMMISSIONER:  Was, I do not know whether is that out of 
budget or far too high.   
MR BURGER:  It was double the second price Chair. 
COMMISSIONER:  Yes.  I got the impression and you must 
tell me if it is the wrong impression.  I got the impression 
10 
that the way that price was hiked, there was no way Denel 
would approve that price as, as it was.  Is my impression 
correct? 
MR BURGER:  It is correct Chair. 
COMMISSIONER:   Now the question that arises for me is, 
how do you take the decision that VR Laser is the entity that 
wins above another or the others when realistically you know 
that you cannot appoint them on the price they quoted as is?  
Because my thinking is that you should only say this is the, 
the bidder or the entity that wins if you can afford that price.   
20 
But if you cannot afford that price, you should let, 
you should not appoint that entity.  You should, that entity 
should lose some points or, for that kind of price.  And, and 
if that approach is correct, then LMT could easily have won if 
the VR Laser some points because they were so close in 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 153 of 246 
 
terms of scoring.   
And therefore when you make a call to VR Laser and 
get them to reduce the price, you are in a way depriving LMT 
of a chance to win, because if their price is so high you 
cannot afford it, they should not win.  The next entity that 
should win is LMT.  What do you say to that? 
MR BURGER:  Hindsight is a wonderful thing Chair.  Maybe 
that could have been an argument. The way it worked was 
that we had a total budget or for suppliers, for the whole 
system.  And there were big things and rounded up in certain 
10 
areas, 
because 
this 
was 
not 
something 
that 
was 
manufactured before.  We did not have a cost Chair that was 
in time and accurate.   
So we had a budget, an allocated amounts of money 
and, and, and on top of that we also had a risk provision 
because we knew in some instances we will be wrong.  So, 
so what we did was, every supplier, every opportunity where 
we placed an order we looked at what was the budgeted 
price and what was the, the amount left in our slush fund, in 
our risk provision.   
20 
And it did happen that people were over the budget.  
And but they did win the competition and it was a good 
supplier and everybody agree with that was the best decision 
taking 
transformation, 
taking 
capability 
and 
price 
into 
account that that, the one, the person that won, even though 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 154 of 246 
 
they are over budget.   
Then we did place orders on them, taking account of 
what is, what is the total budget of the system. Can we 
afford it, we cannot.  And obviously as a businessman I, I try 
to get the prices down as low as possible in all cases.  And 
then also would send the bid people back and say, go and 
renegotiate.   
But, but that was what you say Chair might have 
been an approach.  Could have been a good approach.  I am 
not arguing that.  But it was not the approach, it was not the 
10 
way we did it.  (00:12:32) nobody. 
COMMISSIONER:  Of course the question is going, goes to 
the issue of fairness.  That is where it goes to. 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
COMMISSIONER:  To say LMT may be justified, may have 
been justified to say because VR Laser quoted you a price 
that was too high, that was unacceptable to you, you should 
not have asked them to reduce their price.  You should have 
gone to the next, next competitor whose price you could 
afford.  And that was me.  Therefore by getting them to 
20 
reduce the way it was done, you deprived me of getting this 
job.  You deprived me of the opportunity to get this job.  You 
understand? 
MR BURGER:  I understand 100%.  
COMMISSIONER:  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 155 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  And that was not 
done.   
MR BURGER:  No, that was not done, that was never done 
and it was not the process that we followed. 
 ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Now what was also not done was 
to go back to LMT and to say to them that you, Mr Burger 
and maybe some of the colleagues who agreed with you 
were of the view that LMT should not be given this contract, 
even though their price was so low compared with VR Laser, 
because they could not be relied on.   
10 
Because of the United Nations Casspir which were 
different, where there could have been an opportunity for 
LMT to, to have a debate with you.  You heard did you not Dr 
Nell’s evidence where he said, well firstly Casspirs are 
different from this Badger type of vehicle.  Secondly we had 
a valid excuse which was verified by an independent outside 
agency that put in a report, who say that we were not to 
blame. It was steel that was corroded from a supplier that we 
were not, that we could not be blamed for.   
Now it may well be that ultimately you would not be 
20 
persuaded by that.  But would it not be appropriate to at 
least ask them?  Give them that opportunity before you 
effectively disqualify them.  Is that not actually the, the 
bottom line?  In effect you disqualified them.  When they put 
a very seemingly attractive price of R150 million, well we not 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 156 of 246 
 
interested in that price, we are not impressed by that price, 
because we do not think that – you cannot do it seriously.  
But you would have been able to hold them to that price if 
you had awarded them the contract, not so?   
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  But again the Casspir incident showed that 
that holding them to something eventually becomes Denel’s 
problem in any case. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I understand that Mr Burger, that that 
10 
rational.  But before you come to that decision, is it not 
appropriate to be fair?  You see the Chairperson has 
reminded you a couple of times now that it is not just a 
question of what, what would have gotten you a good price 
from VR Laser and you were satisfied that VR Laser was, 
was an excellent supplier at the technical side.  But also 
what is fair.   
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Because fairness is not just something 
that is a nice to do if you can concept, it is what the 
20 
constitution says.  The lawyers know it is in Section 2017.  
Every state entity such as Denel shall have a procurement 
system for the procurement of goods and services that is 
lawfully, fair, competitive, cost effective, transparent and 
equitable.  Fairness comes into it not just in the expressed 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 157 of 246 
 
word of fair, but also equitable and so forth.  Now it just 
seems that you do not, you do not at least at that time did 
not seem to appreciate that.   
MR BURGER:  Chair … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You appreciate it now. 
MR BURGER:  I do.  I do and absolutely no argument.  In my 
mind the fairness came in that we went through a process 
where we used, we had a closing date.  We used the 
information for the closing date.  And that is what we used to 
do the evaluation.  And VR Laser won.  So that was where 
10 
the fairness came in.  The question about … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry Mr Burger.  It has been put to you 
a couple of times, both by myself and the learned Chair that, 
that fairness does not depend on who gets 0,6% superiority 
in score.  It is a little more complicated than that.  And even 
if the score was to the advantage of VR Laser, as a matter of 
law and fairness, it is not automatically required of an entity 
to grant it, come what may.   
It makes perfect rational sense for a state entity that 
says, well I see my Evaluation Committee has come up with 
20 
a total score that gives X a score that is 0,6% better than Y.  
But if it is going to cost me a half or a third less of, of the 
price from Y, I should rather go that way.  That is perfectly 
lawful and fair.   
MR BURGER:  I accept that. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 158 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You accept that.   
MR BURGER:  Accept that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Alright, now may we move from 
this aspect of the deal of the platform hulls contract to 
another issue that has been raised in evidence?  You dealt in 
your early stage when I asked you to indicate which category 
the hull platform, hulls contract fell into.  Completely 
compliant or not compliant?  Or do not know?   
You raised the two issues.  The one is the, that you 
went out on RFO for – RFQ for bids, three bids, we have 
10 
dealt with that.  We have now dealt with the negotiation with 
VR Laser to reduce their price.  You have conceded through 
your credit that that was the benefit of hindsight was not 
permissible in terms of the policy. 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But there is another aspect.  In fact 
there are quite a few aspects that one could deal with.  But I 
am going to focus on what seems to be the most relevant.  
And that is Mr Mlambo’s concern.  And that is that he had 
not approved this.  And his approval was required under 
20 
Denel policy.  Now Mr Mlambo was initially consulted about 
this, not so? 
MR BURGER:  Not that I am aware of Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay, can I ask you, I am not sure 
which bundle you had now in front of you.  It is Bundle 1.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 159 of 246 
 
The same one we looked at for the procurement policy 
earlier. 
MR BURGER:  Sorry, sorry Chair, prior to me going to Denel, 
Dennis Mlambo was not consulted.  I know from my 
(00:19:40). 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry just say that again. 
MR BURGER:  Prior to me going to Head Office to say, I did 
not go, we did not take it to Mlambo for approval.  But I know 
there was a lot of consultation within, within the executives 
and in Head Office and they did speak to him. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did they speak to him? 
MR BURGER:  Ja, that much I know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then let us look at some examples of 
that in Bundle 1. 
COMMISSIONER:  Oh I am sorry, let us clear that.  Are you 
saying they did speak to him or are you saying they might 
have spoken to him? 
MR BURGER:  No, I know they did. 
COMMISSIONER:  They did? 
MR BURGER:  They did speak to him, yes. 
20 
COMMISSIONER:  Okay. 
MR BURGER:  I know there were discussions between Mr 
Jan Wessels, Mr Mlambo and Mr Fikile Mhlontlo.   
COMMISSIONER:  Okay, alright.  Do you know whether the 
discussions were aimed at getting his approval or not 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 160 of 246 
 
necessarily? 
MR BURGER:  I was not party to those discussions. 
COMMISSIONER:  You are not sure of that? 
MR BURGER:  I do not know. 
COMMISSIONER:  Okay. 
MR BURGER:  And I know there were … 
COMMISSIONER:  Okay. 
MR BURGER:  Serious discussions, but I was never party to 
those discussions. 
COMMISSIONER:  Okay, no that is fine.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright, may I take you to the email 
correspondence that seems to be relevant, in Bundle 1.  I do 
not know if you have been, if you still have Bundle 1 access. 
COMMISSIONER:  Ja, I have got it ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  If I can start at page 788.   
COMMISSIONER:  What is the page number? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  788.   
COMMISSIONER:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You have it? 
MR BURGER:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right, now the, the – there is an email 
right at the bottom dated the 22 nd of July.  It is not clear 
what the actual content that email may have been, because 
it just has a disclaimer.  But be that as it may, the email 
about halfway down the page, 2 nd of September 2014, comes 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 161 of 246 
 
from Dennis Mlambo.  And is addressed to Celia/Reenen.  
You see that? 
MR BURGER:  I see that Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright, so what Mr Mlambo says: 
“I have just established that LMT does have a valid 
triple BEE certificate, see attached.  I am baffled as 
to why it was not submitted as per your claim at this 
evening’s meeting.  I will request details from 
Stephan 
Nel 
about 
the 
pricing 
and 
proof 
of 
shareholding of VR Laser as discussed.”  
10 
Now this appears to bare out the evidence of Ms 
Malahlela as well as Mr Mlambo that there was interaction 
between officials, maybe not yourself, but officials at DLS 
with Mr Mlambo at Head Office there.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  I see that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that included Celia, Ms Malahlela 
from your procurement supply chain section, the head of 
that.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Yes, I see that too. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And Reenen Teubes, what was, what 
20 
was his position at the time? 
MR BURGER:  He was COO of Combat Systems. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And one of the issues that was 
raised in discussion with Mr Mlambo was the triple BEE 
certificate, because there was concern about whether the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 162 of 246 
 
scoring of the triple BEE was done correctly.  And whether it 
may have favoured VR Laser and prejudiced LMT.  Are you 
aware that there were such discussions? 
MR BURGER:  I can see I was copied on an email. I am, I 
cannot, I cannot recall this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And then Reenen Teubes at the 
top of the page, in the email that you have rightly referred to 
as having copied you in, take this further and he says: 
“As explained in this meeting a formal process was 
followed to evaluate the proposals, etcetera.” 
10 
 
And then he refers further to, to all the bidders being 
given an opportunity seven days to submit additional 
information. 
 
All 
this 
additional 
information 
that 
was 
received, was within the seven day period was then taken 
into account to finalise the scores.  So the parties were 
allowed to, to give more information that what had originally 
been submitted in respect of triple BEE accreditation.  You 
see that? 
MR BURGER:  I see that Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And we know that VR Laser was 
20 
allowed to submit a changed quote for price, but LMT was 
not.   
MR BURGER:  I accept, I have already said that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You have explained that earlier.  Yes.  
Then Mr Mlambo who certainly does not seem to like to leave 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 163 of 246 
 
thing unattended, replies on the 3 rd of September, on the 
previous page 787.  He addresses it to Mr Teubes and again 
copied, copies in Celia Malahlela and Fikile Mhlontlo.  He 
was the group CFO at that stage.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct and he was also reporting to Fikile.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, exactly.  So he had a direct 
reporting line, Mr Mlambo to Mhlontlo? 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Would I be correct in inferring from this 
that Mr Mlambo was here making sure that his concerns 
10 
were not just dealt with, within the division, DLS that were 
now being brought to the attention of his boss at Head Office 
deal.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And not only your procurement 
people like Ms Malahlela, but of course in divisional level, 
but also Jan Wessels.  He was then COO of the group, 
correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And also that you were kept informed, 
20 
Mr Burger, as CEO of the division? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then he, he sets out a number of 
issues that he describes as key issues in, in – he says: 
“As I did not have an opportunity to do a thorough 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 164 of 246 
 
study 
of 
all 
the 
tender 
submissions 
I 
cannot 
categorically claim that the process was sufficiently 
objective and the confidence level is high enough to 
place it beyond reproach.” 
 
He seems to be raising, ringing an alarm bell here.  
Not so?  He is saying, I am not satisfied on the basis of what 
I have been sent that this is necessarily compliant.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did that, do you remember actually 
seeing this email that was addressed to you? 
10 
MR BURGER:  Chair I must have seen it at the time, I cannot 
remember. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  I cannot remember the content or I cannot 
remember this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Should you not remember it 
though Mr Burger?  In this sense, as CEO you are having 
your juniors in the, in the division, Ms Malahlela who is your 
most – in fact she is the most senior person in the 
procurement section.  Not so?  So she has been dealing with 
20 
various issues such as triple BEE certificates and so forth.  
And Mr Mlambo is saying, I have got queries about the triple 
BEE certificate.   
And then there is a response that is then provided to 
him, that we have seen on the previous page from Reenen 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 165 of 246 
 
Teubes.  He then responds and does not simply confine 
himself to triple BEE, where it is clear he is not completely 
satisfied on that either.  But he is saying as I read to you 
now: 
“Nonetheless the following are key issues that merit a 
serious review of the adjudication process and 
outcome.” 
 
This must have been a serious alarm bell that should 
have triggered your interest and made you remember this 
sort of thing if you took it seriously. 
10 
MR BURGER:  Yes.  The, the process there, we were at that 
stage in the middle of the process.  I was instructed by my 
boss which was Mr Saloojee to have two signatures on the 
motivation that was Fikile Mhlontlo and, and Mr Jan Wessels 
to make the recommendation.  At that time during September 
I was not interacting with Dennis Mlambo.  And I was aware 
of the fact that both Jan and Fikile were, were constantly 
interacting with him.   
So, so I took this as, as obvious that they were 
considering his inputs.  I say again Chair, this I raised my in 
20 
writing in meetings my opinion about the direction to go.  I 
would have supported any decision that was made and this 
was not part of the process. This was now already laying at 
Head Office for months when this happened, when this, this 
issue arose.   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 166 of 246 
 
So, so for me this was, should have been – if this 
was the problem and I had, I was Fikile was reporting to me, 
and speaking to him weekly about this program, I would, I 
would think that he took cognisance of that before signing 
the recommendation.  So, so yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But your feeling of comfort surely would 
not have been justified, because you are here being copied 
in and you say you must have received it.  You have been 
copied in by the most senior person in the group, is the 
Group Executive of Supply Chain.  One of the witnesses Mr 
10 
Ntshepe has said that the term executive was wrong, that he 
was only a Manager.   
But in fact the delegation or authority approved by 
the Board in fact calls him the Group Supply Chain 
Executive.  But let us leave aside the label.  He was the 
most senior official, specifically tasked with supply chain 
management within the entire group.  Not so? 
MR BURGER:  True Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And he is now flagging methodically, 
point by point.  I am not going to take you through all of 
20 
them, but he is raising serious concerns that he is saying …

INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  “These are key issues that merit a  
serious review of the adjudication process and 
outcome.”  
 
Did you undertake, did you accept the advice you 
were getting or perhaps even instruction you were getting 
from Mr Mlambo that these are keys issues that merit a 
serious review?  Did you undertake that or do you know if 
anybody else did? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am not aware of it Chair. 
10 
MR BURGER:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No.  And then he deals with capability.  
And one of the points he makes in the first paragraph is that 
LMT was the only one of the three tenders that manufacture 
the same hulls under contract for Patria, that had obtained 
the lowest score on capability.  DCD has never manufactured 
the same hulls and yet it obtained the highest score.   
Now I am not wanting to go into a lengthy debate 
about whether Mr Mlambo was right or wrong, he seems to 
be saying, why does LMT get such a low score when it has 
20 
got, when it has actually got experience of this?  How can it 
get such a low score on capability and DCD gets a high 
score even though it has never manufactured this thing?   
So how could it be given that?  Now your answer 
could conceivably be, well LMT although it has manufactured 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 169 of 246 
 
this sort of thing cannot be relied on.  But whatever the 
outcome of that debate might be, seems to me to be 
unnecessary to go into.  Mr Mlambo is raising serious 
questions.   
There may have been good answers like the one I am 
speculating that you might give.  But the point is he is saying 
these need to be answered.  And that these three reviewed, 
and yet that does not seem to have been done.   
MR BURGER:  No Chair.  And I say again, at that point in 
time this argument was escalated to DCO. So between Fikile, 
10 
Jan and Mr Mlambo they, they were discussing this on a 
regular basis. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And ultimately who signed it?  It 
was Mr Saloojee? 
MR BURGER:  Koert? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  But are you saying that you just 
left it to Head Office and even when you were alerted by 
Head Office Mr Mlambo to the fact that he was raising rightly 
or wrongly, that he was raising issues that he was entitled to 
raise as Group Executive for Supply Chain.  That needed 
20 
this to be resolved, that you did, you did nothing about it.  
Why did that (00:02:24) 
MR BURGER:  I did nothing about this.  Sorry Chair, I did 
nothing about this email, correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And then he deals with the price 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 170 of 246 
 
difference.  And the points … 
COMMISSIONER:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  You say you are 
clear that you did nothing about it?  Why was that in 
circumstances where Mr Mlambo was raising a number of 
issues of concern? 
MR BURGER:  The reason, the reason for that is I was under 
the impression that there was a difference of opinion.  And 
because there was a difference of opinion, this discussion 
escalated to a level higher than Mr Mlambo.  That was in my 
mind what was happening.  So and for that reason I said, 
10 
there are these unhappiness.   
We thought we gave a good answer, he now comes 
with different, different issues and, and I have to admit  
Chair that and I state that in my affidavit as well, that at that 
time maybe I did not enough patience with, with the 
situation.  I was getting grumpy and I was a little bit irritable. 
So, so and I am not saying that justifies it. I am just saying 
that was … 
COMMISSIONER:  Just explain how? 
MR BURGER:  Ja that was the scenario. 
20 
COMMISSIONER:  (00:04:08). 
MR BURGER:  And my mind was for a person like Mr Dennis 
Mlambo to stay, guarantee could make this thing high.  I 
think he did not understand the challenges that, that or I just 
sat with where a supplier like the – ag the client like the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 171 of 246 
 
United Nations formally told us we will never ever ever buy 
from you again if you make hulls at LMT.  So those were the, 
those were the issues I was dealing with at the time. 
COMMISSIONER:  It seems to me that in a situation such as 
this where the entities have been told, these are the criteria 
that will be used to decide this competition between the two 
of you or three of you.  It seems to me that you can only 
make the decision as to who gets the job on the basis of 
those criteria.   
And that it should not be something outside of that.  
10 
Now I want to hear what your comment is because it seems 
to me that you knew certain things about LMT and maybe a 
lot of other people within Denel knew certain things.  But and 
those things were influencing your attitude towards LMT as 
to whether they should be given this job or not. 
MR BURGER:  True Chair. 
COMMISSIONER:  Now to the extent that those were things 
that may have been outside the criteria that had been used 
by the scoring team or whatever they are called.  Would it 
not have, would it not have been illegitimate to use factors 
20 
that were may not have been part of the factors that the 
criteria that you were announced as the criteria that would 
decide who wins? 
MR BURGER:  Chair the criteria that was, was set down by 
policy was, was new for us.  It was not, we were not used to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 172 of 246 
 
implementing those criteria.  So we, we basically followed 
those criteria and we came to an answer.  I, I, my opinion at 
the time was and I take note of Mr Kennedy’s position that it 
was a small variance.  I take note of that.  But my position at 
the time was, we strictly followed the prescribed rules.  It 
gave a winner.   
And, and we did not use a reduced price, we did not 
use anything else.  It gave a winner.  Now accept that, it was 
by a small margin.  The arguments that were put to me was, 
let us bend the rules to rather favour LMT.  That was what 
10 
the impression that I got.  Let us bend the rules to rather 
favour LMT, because for various reasons.  They part of us so 
we can – it is in-house and all those things.   
And, and those arguments I tried to counter by 
saying, hang on.  If you want to do that understand the risk 
you are putting Denel into.  And, and that was my position at 
the time and, and but Chair and I say this and I put it in 
writing then on emails, if Denel decide we are not going to 
because of all these good reasons, the delegation lies with 
Jan – above me, three people above me for all these good 
20 
reasons, let us go with LMT.  We would have tried our best 
to make it work.  No argument.   
COMMISSIONER:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Commissioner.  I just want 
to raise one brief question on a point that you raised earlier.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 173 of 246 
 
And that is that the reduction in price would not have made 
any difference in the sense that they already had the 
advantage in terms of the scoring, so … 
MR BURGER:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So this was at it were a bonsella(?).   
MR BURGER:  That was my impression too.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  What I suggest is that that is not 
a correct impression.  Because in fact if you had not allowed 
them to or asked them and urged them in your angry 
conversation to reduce their price, then they would not have 
10 
reduced their price and then they would not have got the 
contract.  That seems to me to be absolutely crucial, a 
reduction in price.  By reducing their price to 195 from about 
260 million, that was pivotal in the decision.  It was not any 
relevancy.   
MR BURGER:  Shu Chair, I am not sure if I am following.  
The issue here was we made a recommendation based on 
the previous price, with the expectation to come down.  Now 
if they at that stage they made an unsolicited proposal, they 
had all the right not to say, no, no, no, we made a mistake it 
20 
was the original 280 or 260. 
So from my perspective then we would have been 
forced probably if it would have been above the delegations 
to come back and say, this needs to go to the board but the 
recommendation remains the same.  So I, in my mind, in my 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 174 of 246 
 
mind it would not have been a difference in supplier.  It 
would have, the delegations would have changed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now let us complete our 
reference to this email.  As I said I am not going to go 
through it point by point because it can be read in due 
course.  And I do not think it needs to be debated.  But one 
of the points Mr Mlambo raised, raises is price. The price 
difference of about 100 million, that is the price between VR 
Laser and LMT.  Now that of course is their original quote 
price. 
10 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Of 360 million.  And she says: 
“The price difference between VR Laser and LMT Ops 
is almost 100 million.  In my investigation I was 
informed by Stephan.” 
Now it is apparent from Mr Mlambo’s evidence that  
the Stephan there is not yourself.  It is Dr Stephan Nel.   
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.   
“That the LMT quote was based on factual figures 
20 
since LMT has manufactured the hull before.  If 
Stephan is right, it would not make business sense to 
pay so much more.” 
So he does not simply accept it necessarily as well 
Stephan Nel has said it therefore I accept it as the gospel 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 175 of 246 
 
truth.  He just says this is what I have been told, if he is 
right it would be crazy to go to VR Laser if you can get it for 
100 million cheaper.  So in other words if Stephan is right, 
that would be an answer to your concern that the 150, 160 
million that LMT offered in fact is a bit of a joke.  It cannot 
be taken seriously.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then he says: 
 
“You agree it would not make business sense.” 
 
Not so? 
10 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And since LMT is a sister 
company, now by that he meant by this stage LMT was 
already owned or subject to the share option.  I am not sure 
which, but it was, it was now being brought into the Denel 
Group.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  It was, it was at that stage fully owned. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was already. 
MR BURGER:  Owned by Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Majority owned, not fully owned. 
20 
MR BURGER:  Majority.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Not fully owned.  Yes.  But I understand 
by what you meant by fully.  I believe some of the deal, he 
should have demanded the supporting evidence before 
assuming that LMT under quoted.  Now in fact the belief that 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 176 of 246 
 
LMT under quoted was, it may have been shared by others in 
DLS, but it was certainly a feeling that you had.  Not so?   
MR BURGER:  It did not originate from me Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It did not originate from you? 
MR BURGER:  No it did not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But it was, you shared that belief.  
MR BURGER:  I shared that belief. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right, so you say, he says: 
‘I believe some of the DLS should have demanded 
supporting evidence before assuming that LMT under 
10 
quoted. 
 
I 
that, 
this 
anomaly 
wants 
further 
investigation and validation.” 
 
So again it is a serious alarm bell.  He is saying, well 
you guys in the divisional level seem to be thinking that well 
MNT’s price that is so much less than VR Laser, that that 
cannot be assumed in its favour, because they under quoted, 
it is not a genuine price.   
He is saying, no I as the Head Office Head of 
Procurement need to satisfied and you should have been 
satisfied.  Where is your evidence for this?  Not just Mr 
20 
Burger knows these things.  Or Mr Teubes knows these 
things.  He needs evidence.  Would you agree that it is a 
responsible attitude on his part to be making sure even if 
you are right, that decision can only be taken once the facts 
are established? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 177 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  Chair the question here is, what, what is he 
saying?  Should we have increased the price?  If they said 
oops we made a little bit of a mistake, and re-evaluate it, I 
am not sure what the process would have been if they came 
back and said, oops it is, it can be a little bit higher than 
what we thought.  What … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But does that matter? 
MR BURGER:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It does not answer Mr Mlambo’s point, 
does it?  And that is what I am asking you on. 
10 
MR BURGER:  No it does not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  No it does not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  But then he deals with BEE 
certificates and he suggest that there was a, there was an 
unfairness in that.  But what I am particularly interested in is 
paragraph 5.  Effectively he is saying that the documents 
submitted by VR Laser on their ownership and these raise 
suspicions as they do not specify the individual shareholders 
in person.   
20 
Now 
Mr 
Mlambo’s 
affidavit, 
he 
also 
gave 
oral 
evidence but not in all its detail, in quite as much detail as 
the affidavit obviously.  He was not aware at that stage, as I 
understand his evidence that in fact the Guptas were 
involved or that something that could, could raise potential 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 178 of 246 
 
media speculation and controversy in the public domain.  
That was an innocent question, but it was an important 
question.   
He is saying, well they say, VR Laser are saying they 
are owned by somebody and they say they are owned by a 
particular companies, but they do not say who owns those 
companies.  So he is concerned.  He says, the names Olga 
Solve(?) and Kreshwe(?) Investments are silent about the 
identities of the real shareholders.  There were no other 
documents.   
10 
Now it seems that Mr Mlambo may well have had 
some foresight because as it turned out it emerged later that 
in fact, that there was a Gupta link and so forth.  Now I am 
not saying that that would necessarily have disqualified them 
or could have disqualified them.  But he is not satisfied, he 
is saying there are all sorts of problems.   
Triple BEE certificates, one party has been given 
treatment to another and so forth.  Again I am not going to 
debate whether his opinion was right or wrong, but he 
reached this opinion.  You do not, you do not dispute that Mr 
20 
Mlambo was trying to do his job in good faith? 
MR BURGER:  No, absolutely.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  Absolutely.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it fact it was his responsibility to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 179 of 246 
 
deal with this. 
MR BURGER:  Absolutely. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And he has specifically copied in not 
just Celia and Reenen, Mr Teubes and Ms Malahlela, but 
also his boss, Mlambo’s boss and the COO and of course 
yourself as DLS CEO. 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  He escalated it. 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So he had said this is serious.  These 
10 
are key issues and then his final paragraph after the 
numbered paragraphs he says: 
“I trust that the details above clarify my reasons for 
not supporting the recommendation to a point VR 
Laser to manufacture the hulls.” 
 
Clearly he was of the belief and it appears that he 
may well have been right, that he needed to endorse the 
recommendation. 
 
He 
also 
had 
to 
recommend 
the 
appointment of VR Laser before the Group CEO finally 
approved it.  That was part of his job, not so? 
20 
MR BURGER:  At the time I did not, I did not see his – we 
have never had his signature for something that went to the 
Group CEO on something like this prior to this.  So, so we 
saw that as he needed to be consulted.  His inputs need to 
be given and needed to be taken seriously and, and then a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 180 of 246 
 
decision was made.  I must also say that the decision who to 
sign on the motivation was not my choice. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  That was a decision made by the Group CEO 
Mr Saloojee and he said those are the two people that must 
sign.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Then he concludes his last 
sentence: 
“Alternatively the entire process must be revisited 
and conducted in a fair and objective fashion.” 
10 
 
Now he has given evidence that he felt that this was 
not objective.  He feels that you were subject, that you in 
fact were as his affidavit indicates and oral evidence that no 
doubt you listened to.  And suggested to the Chair that you 
were not, you were not objective.   
You 
were 
being 
subjective, 
but 
this 
was 
not 
sufficiently independent and that he wanted the whole thing 
to be done properly in a fair and objective way.  Now 
obviously 
you 
would 
disagree 
that 
you 
were 
acting 
subjectively.  You have already given evidence that you 
20 
believed this was a good business decision and so … 
MR BURGER:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But, but it is quite clear from this email 
that this was a serious matter, not so?   
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 181 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now this was not simply a matter that 
was going on at Head Office level between different people 
at Head Office.  Because as we have seen this email was 
addressed primarily to Mr Teubes at, at your divisional level.  
Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And in fact you then replied to it.  
Presumably you did not leave it to Mr Teubes to reply to, 
because you realised the seriousness.  If you look at the 
email, it starts right at the foot of page 785 or 786.   
10 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And you then for an entire page 
and your email and I do not criticise you for this, set out 
some reasons why you say that, that VR Laser should get it 
and LMT should not.  And you see the numbered paragraphs 
1 to 4? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That sets out a number of your 
arguments in that regard.  You then say: 
“Nevertheless I am convinced that VR Laser is 
20 
technically best equipped to execute this program.  I 
also believe given the recent contract performance of 
LMT, it will be irresponsible to place a contract of 
such criticality on them, also take into account the 
affect the KSA order will have on them.” 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 182 of 246 
 
 
What is the KSA order?   
MR BURGER:  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So that is the same Saudi 
Arabia … 
MR BURGER:  That I spoke about. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Order that you mentioned.  Now Mr 
Mlambo comes back to you in an email at the top of page 
785, on the 4t h of September, later on in the same day.  And 
he says: 
“We are clearly no aligned in terms of the analysis of 
10 
the data and information that I saw for the first time 
on Tuesday at the meeting I had with Reenen and 
Celia. I think we should not exchange any more 
emails on the SC in question as the resolution may 
be easier to find around a table.  However the 
following issues are definitely not been addressed.” 
 
And so he deals with, with again, four points.  Huge 
price differential, the issue of a conflict of interest, refuted 
any conflict of interest to the submission of the document 
etcetera by the capability.  He still has reservations in 
20 
relation to this.  And then after his paragraph 4, he says: 
“My contention is that despite being convinced of a 
fair and objective process that was followed by the 
adjudication team …” 
 
And here his evidence explained that here he was 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 183 of 246 
 
really saying that he was not convinced, it was more that you 
were convinced.   
“Let 
us 
appoint 
an 
independent 
assessor 
to 
corroborate your claim.  It is also worth mentioning 
that you flouted the delegation of authority by not 
presenting a file for review to me before engaging 
Fikile.” 
 
That is Mr Mhlontlo, CFO, correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And Jan.  Jan Wessels, COO, correct? 
10 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  “Any transaction above 20 million must  
go through my office first.  I am beginning to have 
doubts that this was an oversight.” 
 
Now he there seems to be suggesting not only that 
you were being subjective and not objective.  But also that 
you were actually manipulating processes.  You received this 
email, did you? 
MR BURGER:  Ja I remember it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  What did you do about it? 
20 
MR BURGER:  I … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you reply? 
MR BURGER:  I parked that.  No, his opinion was let us 
resolve this around a table. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 184 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  That was his suggestion.  And I thought at the 
time there are clearly a difference of opinion.  It is beyond 
my salary of decision making and this should be escalated to 
the level of Mr Saloojee, Mr Jany Wessels and Mr Mkhlontlo.  
And they were all party to this and, and for a decision … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No.  Did you – I am sorry.   
MR BURGER:  No and that was my, that was my view.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  We had differences of opinion and (00:23:55). 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Did you write back to Mr Mlambo and 
10 
say that?  Say let us not have a round table meeting 
between us, it is above your and my? 
MR BURGER:  No I did not, I did not. Not that I can recall. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You see again it is interesting to note 
that Mr Mlambo has taken the trouble and he gave evidence 
that he did take this trouble for a good reason.  He says he 
not only responded to you, but he also copied in Celia 
Malahlela, which was appropriate.  She was your junior, but 
she was the Head of Supply Chain at DLS, correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it was right that she should be kept 
in this loop, not so? 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And again he copies in Mr Mhlontlo and 
Mr Wessels and Reenen Teubes and now for the first time Mr 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 185 of 246 
 
Saloojee.   
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So he keeps escalating and he keeps 
saying, I am not satisfied with this process.  It does not look 
objective, it does not look compliant.  You have ignored me.  
Now that I am engaged, I have now picked up these 
problems and I need answers.  Now whether he was right or 
not to be satisfied with the answers you attempted to give, 
clearly he was not.   
Whether or not he was right to, to feel disturbed by 
10 
your answers, rather than reassured by your answers is 
neither here nor there.  He was not satisfied.  Now he was 
telling his bosses, Mhlontlo and Saloojee, I am not satisfied.  
You felt well, then he must, it must just be referred to them 
at Head Office and they must take a decision.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  I at the time I told we were running out of 
time, I am prepared and I say again, I said that indeed his 
emails, I am prepared to accept any decision, but just take a 
decision.  And it was, it was with this very email, it was 
escalated to a point.  So … 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I understand. 
MR BURGER:  So that, that is how I felt and then there were 
very, a lot of healthy discussions and arguments that, that 
happened after this.  I was not party to and this is originally 
why I said I was not, after this I did not really have a lot of 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 186 of 246 
 
discussions with … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Mlambo. 
MR BURGER:  Mr Mlambo. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  But I know both Fikile and Mr Jan Wessels 
did have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry who and who?  Wessels? 
MR BURGER:  Mr Fikile Mhlontlo and … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mhlontlo?   
MR BURGER:  Ja. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  And Mr Jan. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  With Mr Mlamba.  Yes.  Is it not correct 
that you in fact had the discussion with Mr Saloojee? 
MR BURGER:  At the end when we had the discussion, all of 
us, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  All of us being who? 
MR BURGER:  The four of us.  Clearly Jan Wessels, myself 
and … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So you and? 
20 
MR BURGER:  The CFO and the COO and the Group CEO.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it was Mr Saloojee, Mr Mhlontlo, Mr 
Wessels and yourself? 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right, but not Mr Mlambo? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 187 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  Not yet. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You see this is part of the problem that 
Mr Mlambo has raised and it seems to be an issue we need 
to canvass with you.  I can fully understand your attitude that 
well we have got a complication.  You have tried to persuade 
Mr Mlambo.  Mr Mlambo is trying to persuade you.  And you 
just cannot see eye to eye on this.  Not a personal 
antagonistic thing, it was … 
MR BURGER:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was a matter of on both sides you 
10 
have accepted people being bona fide and trying to do their 
job.  You had not persuaded each other.  So now who, how 
do you break this logjam?  You go to the bosses because 
after all the delegation of authority ultimately rests the final 
approval in Mr Saloojee. 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And now Mr Mlambo regarded his 
approve – his own approval or recommendation as being 
vital, but let us leave that debate aside.  I think we have 
touched on that already and the delegations authority can be 
20 
looked at.  But, but so let us, let us accept for a moment that 
your position, at your level with Mr Mlambo’s level you have 
reached a logjam.  It has got to go higher.   
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now it seems to me to be significant 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 188 of 246 
 
that Mr Mlambo was not part of that meeting.  Now I am not 
suggesting that, that you should have told Mr Saloojee, your 
ultimate boss, how he should run a meeting.  But I am just 
asking you to comment on this because the Chair ultimately 
has to look at whether this process was, was properly done 
and carefully considered by management.  Particularly where 
it is in the context of public controversy about State capture 
and so forth.   
The Chair may need to be satisfied that this was a 
truly genuine, bona fide, good faith type of transaction.  Not 
10 
designed to favour people like the Guptas because of their 
political connections and so forth, but this was a genuine 
bona fide thing.   
I just want you to comment on my concern.  Mr 
Mlambo has been playing his role, raising all of these 
concerns and yet he seems to have been left out of the – 
well we know he was not part of that meeting.  You know why 
not? 
MR BURGER:  I have got no idea.  It was not strange for me 
that his name was not on the motivation, because that was 
20 
the way it was done previously. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  For orders above 50 million.  Obviously 
orders between 20 and 50 million he, he had to sign off.  But 
orders above 50 it was the CFO and the COO that needed to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 189 of 246 
 
recommend and the CFO represented Mr Dennis Mlambo. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  So I… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry the CEO represented Dennis 
Mlambo. 
MR BURGER:  The CFO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  CFO represented Mr Mlambo. 
MR BURGER:  Correct.  Because he was reporting to him. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And the CFO had in fact been copied in 
on these emails admittedly. 
10 
MR BURGER:  Ja he – I do not even see his name here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Certainly – sorry the CFO was Mr 
Mhlontlo. 
MR BURGER:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes on page – the email at the top of 
page 785 I see Fikile Mhlontlo after Celia Malahlela. 
MR BURGER:  Oh yes there is sorry that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So it does seem that Mr Mlambo 
included him as one of the people to whom this was copied. 
MR BURGER:  Correct.  But to give him credit Chair that if I 
20 
was – if this was such a big issue because subsequent to 
this email there were many meetings at head office which I 
was not party to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  And many visits to LMT and to whoever and I 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 190 of 246 
 
was not party to that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  And if this was so controversial I would 
probably have if I was in the shoes of Mr Mhlontlo I would 
have probably said Dennis come with me.  I take that view or 
that accept that point. But the fact of the matter was this was 
– it was at a stale mate.  It was escalated – everybody that 
was there were represented by their bosses at least and it 
was signed off. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now can I take you now to a 
10 
further email at page 791 still in Bundle 1 the same bundle. 
MR BURGER:  791 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  The correspondence we have just 
been looking at was dated the 4 September and this one on 
the – on page 791 is dated a few days later the 9 September 
2014, do you see that? 
MR BURGER:  I see that Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And this now is sent by Mr 
Mlambo to Mr Saloojee.  He is the actual addressee together 
with Mr Mhlontlo and Mr Wessels.  Now he says: 
20 
“I have managed to review DLS’s submission 
pertaining to the abovementioned subject.  
The following issues paint an unacceptable 
picture from a process fairness and objective 
point of view.” 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 191 of 246 
 
Now of course those terms have particular relevance 
when you look at the constitutional requirement that the – 
that there be a process, that there must be a system and you 
must comply with your system and it must be done in a 
lawful fair and objective manner. 
 
And he points out that there are a number of defects 
in the process which he obviously regards as being serious.  
In paragraph 4 he say: 
“In the submission it is claimed that LMT’s 
quote is too low and unrealistic.” 
10 
Now that would be the submission that was prepared 
by Ms Malahlela that you signed for purpose of submitting to 
head office to get the GCEO’s approval.  Correct. 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And in that memorandum that point had 
been made that the LMT quote of about R150 or 60 million 
was too low and unrealistic.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. And then he says: 
“The difference between LMT’s quote and the 
20 
VR Laser quote is almost R100 million.  After 
questioning Stephan Nel on the accuracy of 
his quote he offered to come and present the 
facts to demonstrate that it is based on 
realistic quotes.  Furthermore he claimed 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 192 of 246 
 
LMT had made the hull before – before under 
Patria’s contract.” 
Then he says in paragraph 5. 
“In 
my 
meeting 
with 
Stephan 
Burger 
yesterday” 
So you actually had a meeting with Mr Mlambo. 
MR BURGER:  Correct I see that now yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was not just emails correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
10 
MR BURGER:  As was suggested in that last email of his. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed.  You – he says: 
“He that is yourself Mr Burge indicated that 
VR Laser had offered to reduce the quote 
from around R262.4 million to R195 million!” 
That clearly is something that is worthy of emphasis.  
He says: 
“Does that not tell a disturbing story about 
the initial offer on the basis of these findings 
and other facts it is my considered opinion 
20 
that the submission from DLS be rejected 
since LMT has the capability to make the 
hull.  This issue should have been discussed 
before going out on tender.” 
Now again I cannot expect you to defend Mr Saloojee 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 193 of 246 
 
or Mr Mhlontlo in their actions but what I would like you to 
comment on is this.  Mr Mlambo’s evidence suggested that 
you effectively put a lot of pressure on Mr Saloojee and 
made a whole issue about the very point you raised just now 
urgency, we need this urgently.   
And LMT’s offer cannot be taken seriously they have 
under quoted and they have got technical problems and so 
forth.  And all of that you presented to Mr Saloojee and 
persuaded him a way which had the effect of not only 
undermining Mr Mlambo’s position as head of Supply Chain 
10 
Management but importantly probably most importantly is 
saying this as your expert in Supply Chain Management I am 
telling you that this has not been done fairly, properly, 
objectively and correct from a process point of view.   
And he said I have – I have just smelt a rat he said I 
do not believe that this was being done objectively.  This 
was being rushed through and arguments about things being 
so urgent were being put above the importance of procedural 
compliance, legal compliance.  Do you have a comment 
about that particularly to the extent that that criticism is 
20 
directed not only at them but at you personally? 
MR BURGER:  Ja firstly the – Chair the opinion of it being 
illegal was – is a surprise to me at the time.  It never 
crossed my mind.  Secondly this very strong letter I am -  I 
was not party to it, I did not see it and it is news to me.  It is 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 194 of 246 
 
– we were running at a schedule and this was getting late 
and – in the day for approval of it especially with regards to 
certain milestones like technology, transfer and so on.   
 
The long and the short is I felt strongly that VR Laser 
given everything is in all probability the better decision – 
given everything from a technical and a risk perspective.  If 
– sorry I have got lots of respect for Mr Dennis Mlambo and 
he understands the processes and the procedures and the 
National Treasury requirements much better than me for 
sure.  But unfortunately he did not create over years a 
10 
scenario where it is easy to find compromises.  The 
frustration levels were very high. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Frustration on your part. 
MR BURGER:  On from the divisional level it was high and it 
– wrongly and I am not trying to defend it but it – at the time 
– at that time it was felt that he is being – he is making life 
difficult for obvious decisions so… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  But I take your point I am not going to argue 
it but the – at that time there was a level of frustration. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  And this is why I did not go and see on my 
own Mr Saloojee and lobby with him if that is the insinuation.  
There was a discussion.  I did put over my points with 
enthusiasm but both Jan Wessels and the CFO were having 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 195 of 246 
 
discussions on a regular basis about these matters with him.  
And… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is Mr Saloojee or Mr Mlambo? 
MR BURGER:  Mr – Mr Mlambo, Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlontlo 
had regular discussions, regular. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  And in my – and after this and you can see 
here this was now escalated.  It was no longer on the level 
of the division and group Supply Chain.  These things were 
discussed and I put my arguments.  The very same answers 
10 
articulated here as I said earlier I put on the table there.  
And I was prepared to make compromises but I was really 
scared about the safety critical item like a hull.  And that is 
as simple as it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and also delays. 
MR BURGER:  Of course I was concerned about it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Can I just debate with you the 
latter aspect of delays? 
MR BURGER:  Yes Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You see I understand from your 
20 
evidence and in fact the evidence of some of the other 
witnesses and some of the documents suggests that there 
was frustration on the part of people like yourself. That there 
were delays and the delays were unacceptable and should 
be avoided or minimised.  I accept that that could be a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 196 of 246 
 
legitimate concern. 
MR BURGER:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What just seems to me to be a bit 
strange is that in the greater picture whether – if there was a 
delay in relation to what Mr Mlambo was suggesting as you 
have accepted in good faith that these issues need to be 
investigated 
and 
possibly 
a 
fresh 
process 
should 
be 
undertaken in order to comply with the requirements of the 
law and of the procurement processes.  If that had taken 
place it would not have meant a delay of many years, 
10 
correct? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Let us – let us assume for a moment 
and Mr Mlambo has not said that it was necessary in this 
case that a – particularly under this Supply Chain policy at 
that time that you had to do anything other than a request for 
offers – a request for quotes. Was not necessarily going to 
be a fully open public tender advertised in the media 
etcetera.  It would not have taken all that long.   
So I can understand when you say that you were 
20 
frustrated with Mr Mlambo.  You accepted he was in good 
faith.  You accepted that he was entitled to come to these 
opinions.  You may have disagreed with them but he and you 
suggested that he was being difficult but not in bad faith it 
was just frustrating to your intent to get the ball rolling. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 197 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But in the bigger picture if you had 
humoured Mr Mlambo or complied with Mr Mlambo’s request 
and the same of course applies to Mr Saloojee and Mr 
Mhlontlo and we have had to deal with those questions with 
them.  It would not have delayed the Hoefyster Project by 
much in the greater picture. 
 
We have before the commission facts as to the 
seriously disturbing delay in the project which goes into – we 
are talking about more than a decade – so I can understand 
10 
you may be have been frustrated with that as well and that 
may not have been your responsibility and so forth. 
 
So even if one accepts your desire to expedite 
things, hurry things along firstly was it not required in terms 
of the law?  Was it not required because your expert within 
the group Mr Mlambo was saying we need to do this?  And 
surely it would have possible to do it where in the bigger 
picture any delay was not going to make another decade on 
top of what was already there.  Any comment on that? 
MR BURGER:  Yes I would to like put the slip in perspective.  
20 
A lot has been said about PB or PBLA and PBL1 and they do 
not know if in the next three years PBL1 will be achieved.  
How that works is there is not only one PBLA and one PBL1 
per variant.  There is a build-up of PBL’s. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No but why are you raising that in the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 198 of 246 
 
midst of my question. 
MR BURGER:  Sorry hold I will get to that point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Please. 
MR BURGER:  Sorry I will get to that point.  At – in 2013 we 
already reached the sub, sub system level PBL where we 
could go out with the manufacture of the hulls.  In 2016 
Armscor granted PBL1 on the combat system with certain 
conditions.  That was in 2016 four years ago.   
So 
we 
were 
running 
at 
a 
schedule 
with 
the 
expectation PBL has – well in 2016 it was building up to it 
10 
and it was achieved in 2016.  Subsequently to that I am told 
that Armscor took the decision that those conditions are not 
– were not met or were not favourable or I do not know what 
the reason is and there is no longer now a PBL1.   
Now this is extraordinary disturbing and I think 
anybody should be disturbing – disturbed by this.  I also 
want to put it that the Malaysian order was running on – 
probably more complex than Hoefyster was running on 
schedule, was running within budget and were running within 
the technical performance.  So we were used to performing 
20 
according to the program plan. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR BURGER:  And that is why I was gittery and getting 
frustrated number 1. 
 
Number 2 the hulls were a separate line item on the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 199 of 246 
 
contract which meant that we were selling the hulls.  Every 
hull that was made we would sell -  Armscor would come and 
accept it.  Their program management, their quality as well 
as Denel Land System’s quality they would sign it off and 
Armscor would then buy the hull.   
And we would get the money for the hull.  So it was 
in my interest at the time these were one of the very few 
separate line items.  Get the hulls out and get them into 
production.  So Chair it is not correct to say ag but it is – the 
program is a decade late, what does it matter if there is 
10 
another three months taken?  I just wanted to clear that with 
– perception. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I am not sure that I understand.  
Mr Kennedy’s point is this. When you and other people may 
have thought or may have taken the view that Mr Mlambo’s 
issues were going to cause a delay or that he was delaying 
the process.   
Mr Kennedy is saying but the truth of the matter is 
even if you had to redo the process but do it properly.  If 
20 
what was required was to just send out a request for 
proposals or whatever in regard to two entities or three 
entities it was not going to cause a delay – the kind of delay 
that you should really have been concerned about.  Because 
and I am now adding what he did not say.  It must have been 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 200 of 246 
 
possible to do that within I would imagine even two weeks 
because these were entities which had already worked on 
this thing.  They were not going to start afresh.  So how 
could a period like two weeks really be something to 
complain about? 
MR BURGER:  Chair no you are right and this is – this is 
September it was finally approved in November I think it was 
there about so you are correct Chair.  The time was probably 
there to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR BURGER:  In hindsight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  You are right.  The point I was trying to make 
was it – I could never as a CO of a division acknowledge that 
schedule is not important.  It always was and it always will 
be but in the greater scheme of things and it was only signed 
in November it would not have mattered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  You are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Kennedy. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just to complete my 
questions on this issue Mr Burger.  Of course it is always 
possible in the real world out there especially in South Africa 
these days that parties who are unhappy about the outcome 
of a procurement process could take you on review in a court 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 201 of 246 
 
process, not so? 
MR BURGER:  That is true. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Certainly counsel such as myself and 
my learned juniors in fact have taken… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are always ready. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We always ready.  Our phones are on.  
It is a gross industry as it were.  Now – and of course the 
courts are burdened with a huge load of these things.  You 
are aware as a – at the time a Chief Executive Officer that 
there are risks.  If you do something unlawful let alone 
10 
unconstitutional you can be taken on review.  Now this could 
have happened here not so? 
MR BURGER:  You are correct Chair I concede to that.  But 
in my mind I – at that time we sat with a – the Group CEO 
that needed to sign this off. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  He was the boss of the organisation, the 
person that signed the delegations of authority and in my 
mind I did not have any hesitation that to think that if he 
signs it off there is something funny. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright. 
MR BURGER:  So in my mind I did not see it as being 
unlawful.  But I listened to the commission and I accept that 
the rules have changed and… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well for some time yes long before 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 202 of 246 
 
2014. 
MR BURGER:    Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  This type of litigation has been going 
for quite a while.  But let us leave that aside I would like to 
explore briefly if I may Chair with the witness this issue 
about well if the Group CEO signs it then you are sure that 
there cannot be anything wrong.   
What I suggest to you is that that is a very passive 
approach to your duties at that stage as CEO.  You were 
CEO of the division. In fact you were very keen to have more 
10 
powers and authority given to you at division level in terms 
of the decentralisation that you preferred, not so? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now I see you smiling are you seeing a 
bit of a logical inconsistency.  But I will give you an 
opportunity to answer that.  May I just complete the 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he will consider it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I think so too but what I want to put to 
him if I may Chair I am not going to belabour the point I 
20 
hope.  What I am suggesting to you is that part of your – and 
here I am not Mr Saloojee’s defence counsel and I know 
there have been some allegations even in your own affidavit 
about Mr Saloojee been given special treatment and so on.   
I am not going to go down that route.  But at a level 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 203 of 246 
 
of not just law but good management practice when you are 
the head of a divisional unit in this case DLS and you have 
to take certain steps in your division and then whether you 
like it or not you have to send it up for approval to the Group 
CEO for his approval in this case Mr Saloojee.   
Is it not your duty to be ensuring that Mr Saloojee is 
protected and informed in a sense that you should not send 
anything to Mr Saloojee for approval unless you have 
ensured that there has been proper compliance. Rather than 
saying well let us see if Mr Saloojee approves it?   
10 
If he does – as you put it earlier – well he has 
approved it so I did not see anything wrong with it.  Surely it 
was incumbent on you to see whether there was anything 
wrong with it before you sent it.   
Because you were recommending it to Mr Saloojee 
for approval, not so? 
MR BURGER:  Correct Chair and under a normal run of 
things you absolutely correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  It is my responsibility. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  But the point is this issue was escalated.  
Everybody was aware of the issues.  It was not news to… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Aware of the? 
MR BURGER:  The issues that… 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 204 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The issues. 
MR BURGER:  The issues that was put under.  It was not 
news to anybody and that is why I say regardless of that 
both the COO, the CFO as well as the Group CEO decided to 
accept this. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  The – it was – something was not being kept 
away from him.  He knew everything. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now if we accept your evidence 
earlier that you were at the time unaware that there was any 
10 
breach but have since realised that there was a breach at 
least in respect of negotiating a lower price with VR Laser.  
Would you accept that Mr Mlambo is entitled to say he raised 
all of these issues as you say with his bosses as well as with 
you?   
They effectively in his view ignored it.  They did not 
come back to him.  They did not say well Mr Burger has said 
this and what do you say about that?  There was none of 
that.  Instead he finds out later that Mr Saloojee has signed 
despite the fact that Mr Mlambo had raised all of these 
20 
objections.   
And so Mr Mlambo has suggested to this commission 
is his evidence well I do not understand this.  It actually 
seems to compound my fears and perceptions initially.  
There is something funny going on here.  Mr Burger is acting 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 205 of 246 
 
subjectively.   
Even 
when 
I 
raise 
with 
him 
concerns 
about 
compliance with the legal requirements of the procurement 
process I get vague answers from Mr Burger. That is what he 
is effectively saying in his email.  Whether he is right or 
wrong leave aside for a moment and he says and then it is 
escalated to head office.  
 There is a discussion not involving me Mr Mlambo 
but Mr Burger then has a fast track to have a meeting with 
Mlambo’s superiors.  He is not invited.  Mr Saloojee then just 
10 
accepts it and what has happened to my objections?  My 
being Mr Mlambo’s objections.  There seems to be something 
funny about this. You understand? 
MR BURGER:  I understand. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  His perception. 
MR BURGER:  Understood but he has also in his evidence 
said that he only found out I think five months after the 
event. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR BURGER:  That this was done.  An email was written, 
20 
sent to him, the email is at the investigators that informed 
him of the meeting a day after it was signed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And its outcome. 
MR BURGER:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 206 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:  A day after it was signed.  So there was no – 
we were not trying to hide anything from him.  He was 
informed so … 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But are you suggesting that he is 
concocting evidence and deliberately telling an untruth to the 
commission when he said he only found that out later – much 
later? 
MR BURGER:  I cannot say that Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
MR BURGER:  I am – he might have forgotten. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
MR BURGER:  But… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well that is a generous attitude on your 
part Mr Burger.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Shall we take a short break we are 
at twenty nine minutes past four. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes thank you Char. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And subject to everybody being happy Mr 
Burger and your counsel.  We – I propose that we continue 
until maybe about half past five. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or there about before we then adjourn.  If 
at that stage the feeling is that justice has not been done to 
the 
issues 
that 
Mr 
Burger 
must 
cover 
then 
another 
opportunity will be arranged for Mr Burger to come back. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 207 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with you Mr Burger? 
MR BURGER:  Hundred percent Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your counsel is that fine with – is that 
fine?  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us take a short adjournment now and 
we will resume in probably say ten to – so a ten minutes 
break.  Not ten to twenty to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Twenty to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja twenty to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  May I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, I did not quite hear you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, let us just continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Burger, we have dealt extensively 
now with the Platform Hulls Contract and I think we have 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 208 of 246 
 
debated it as far as we from the legal team’s perspective.  
Need to say for one point, if I may just ask?  The price 
reduction by VR Laser that you are able to get to know in a 
phone call with a bit of angry tone, resulted in a reduction 
from R 266 million.  That is the actual total value of the bid 
that was put in by VR Laser to R 195 million.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you have already commented 
about why you felt they should not have tendered so much in 
the first place.  It does seem curious that they were 
10 
persuaded so easily, as I have put to you earlier.   
 
The question that one of my learned colleagues has just 
asked me to put to you and I do so because I think it is a 
valid question.  You may have a valid answer to it.  We 
would like to give you the opportunity.   
 
Is the reason why they were not – why they were 
prepared to come down so suddenly and so easily and so 
substantially in price, that they were told that they could 
make this up in a Single Source Supplier Contract? 
MR BURGER:   I reject that Chair.  At that time, there was no 
20 
inkling about a Single Source Supplier Contract. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Well, then let us move to that 
very contract that took place the very next year.  Is that 
right? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 209 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What I would like to find out from you 
is how it came about that this contract was in fact negotiated 
and then granted?  Who came up with the idea? 
MR BURGER:   The then Group CEO, Mr Saloojee.  He 
called me to his office one day and informed me that we 
should supply him with an MOU.  I am not sure if the word 
MOU was used.  That looks at single sourcing wherein the 
rights of Denel is protected.   
 
I then went to the division.  I had a discussion with Mr 
Reenen Teubes.  I asked whether he thought this was a good 
10 
idea.  The – his initial response was:  Yes, mine also, by the 
way.   
 
We, however, decided let us within the division check if 
the engineers also think it is a good idea.  There was a study 
done by the engineers.   
 
And it was also discussed at an – on an executive level.  
It was minute.  It is very clear that in the minutes and I have 
not got it in front of me but that an MOU must be produced 
with certain conditions on it for signature by the Group CEO.  
And so we did that.   
20 
 
The first MOU that came out were from the time with my 
name at the bottom.  I asked that it be changed to Mr 
Saloojee’s name.  I had a discussion with Mr Saloojee and 
he said:  No, no, no.  He will sign the approval page.  And I 
must sign the document.   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 210 of 246 
 
 
He – in the next utterance he said:  I know I must add Mr 
Zwelakhe Ntshepe on the document and then the next 
utterance he said:  No, I must also add Mr Jan Wessels on 
the motivation.  And the document was presented. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The question was, who initiated that?  
It was not your own suggestion, it was Mr Saloojee’s. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   Sorry, it is a long-winded answer but correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry.  I am not trying to be 
10 
sarcastic but...  Ja.  It is not curious though that this sort of 
suggestion should have come from head office?   
 
After all, you had been for some time being the CEO of 
DLS and Mr Saloojee, presumable, would rely, although it 
was to an extent a centralised model.   
 
There was a measure of decentralisation in that, not 
every decision within DLS was taken at head-office level.  
Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Did you find anything curious 
20 
about the fact that it came from Mr Saloojee rather from 
within your own division? 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I write quite a lot about my 
relationship with Mr Saloojee. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 211 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   In my affidavit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You did, yes. 
MR BURGER:   Mr Saloojee made it very clear that so-called 
politically decisions and certain marketing decisions is – he 
is better suited to take those decisions.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Marketing or market decisions? 
MR BURGER:   Marketing. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Marketing? 
MR BURGER:   Marketing.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   This was not a marketing decision, 
10 
correct? 
MR BURGER:   No, no.  Correct.  But also certain political 
decisions.  He has, in the past, given me many instructions 
to say certain suppliers are politically well-placed and we 
must please support them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you do that? 
MR BURGER:   One of the suppliers he mentioned was VR 
Laser during the – before the 2014 approval. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Even before the 2014 approval for the 
whole contract. 
20 
MR BURGER:   For the whole... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did that have any bearing on your 
enthusiasm for VR Laser for that contract? 
MR BURGER:   My answer to him at the time was, VR Laser 
is one our biggest suppliers.  You should not worry.  It is 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 212 of 246 
 
common knowledge that they will get work.  So relax. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you were happy to give him comfort 
in expecting that you would ensure that VR Laser would get 
a fair, lot of work? 
MR BURGER:   I was convinced through normal processes, 
they would get a fair amount of work. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now how did you find that 
request or instruction from Mr Saloojee even before the 2014 
contract was awarded?  Did you feel that it was a proper 
one? 
10 
MR BURGER:   Chair, our relationship was – although I had 
a lot of respect for him.  He was a very dynamic Group CEO.  
Our relationship was strained.  And I think he had to break 
the decentralised model and inverting the decentralised 
model, he probably needed to cut me down to size a little bit.   
 
But our relationship was a tense one.  And given his – 
numerous occasions where he said:  You keep your nose out 
of political matters.  That is my domain.  Certain things are 
more important that you will not understand.  I did not like it 
but I accepted it as the normal run of the business. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I assume that you would agree that 
political matters may have a range of different meaning and 
interpretations.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And one narrow one would be, that to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 213 of 246 
 
the extent that there is – that this is a state-owned entity 
where the cabinet member responsible for Public Enterprises 
is the shareholder in Denel on behalf of the state.  And there 
has to be accountability by the board and the Group CEO to 
the minister that that would involve legitimate political 
interaction.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And in that sense, if Mr Saloojee was 
saying to you:  Leave the politics to me.  (Mr Saloojee)  That 
there would be nothing wrong with that.  Correct? 
10 
MR BURGER:   Absolutely not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  In fact, it would make sense not 
to have a divisional head like you dealing with the minister, 
unless there was some reason to report to the minister that 
there is something seriously wrong going on. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That you could not resolve internally.   
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  But it sounds to me as if he 
was saying something a bit more than that.  Not so? 
20 
MR BURGER:   He was suggesting that certain divisions who 
are certain suppliers were politically well-positioned.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well-positioned to what?  Get 
favourable treatment, to get preference in the allocation of 
awards or contracts for business? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 214 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   His opinion was, it would be good for Denel 
to place contract on there. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Because 
they 
were 
politically 
connected. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not because they were necessarily the 
best supplier to do a good job, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Yes.  Hopefully, both will be true.  But yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But it certainly was not just the one.  
As I understand your evidence, your perspective and your 
10 
contention before the Learned Chair is, you looked at it from 
a point objectively, although Mr Mlambo questioned that.  
You have assured the Chair, you were looking at what was in 
the best interest of Denel, regardless of political connection. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your case? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now, obviously, if it was simply 
a question of saying:  Well, we want you to do a good job 
Mr Burger.  Make sure that you get the best product from a 
20 
quality point of view and the best price and so forth.  That 
would have been a legitimate expectation.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you knew that already, that you 
knew is as your function. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 215 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Obviously, correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But again, obviously, he was 
suggesting something different.  He was suggesting that in 
award of contracts, that VR Laser because they were 
politically connected, should be given a preference.   
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   An undue advantage because they 
were 
politically 
connected, 
not 
because 
they 
were 
necessarily the best company.  Is that how you understood 
him? 
10 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair.  I, however, would not have 
supported something that did not correlate with my believe in 
it being the best or and not in the best interest of the 
business and the operations. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But it is interesting your reaction to 
Mr Saloojee.  It is not to say:  I would never do anything that 
was not in the best interest, boss.  It is to say:  Do not 
worry, boss.   
 
And I am paraphrasing you and if I am over-simplifying 
it, please.  You will get an opportunity to correct me.  You 
20 
seem to be saying:  Do not worry boss.  They have been 
getting a lot of work already.  You do not have to worry.  
They are still going to get lots of work. 
MR BURGER:   Sorry.  If you read my affidavit, I said I 
believe that VR Laser is in the best business in their niche 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 216 of 246 
 
area.  From that perspective, I anticipated they will be 
getting work and therefore, for that reason, your concern is 
covered. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But Mr Saloojee’s concern, it seems 
was not simply that they should get a lot of work because 
they are good.  We have debated this already.   
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So what you seem to be saying is, 
when he was suggesting something improper to you, you 
came back and you said:  Well, do not worry.  They are going 
10 
to get it anyway.  For a good reason, not for the reason that 
you are telling me, boss.   
MR BURGER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not so? 
MR BURGER:   If that was the first incident, then it would 
have 
probably 
liaised(?) 
more 
longer. 
 
But 
similar 
instructions were given with regards to N4 in the past.  It 
was ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   N4? 
MR BURGER:   N4, which also manufactured casters for us.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That same remark made that they 
should 
be 
looked 
after 
because 
they 
are 
politically 
connected. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And when was that said to you by 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 217 of 246 
 
Mr Saloojee? 
MR BURGER:   Probably – it was before that.  Probably 
2013.  I would imagine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And did you react to that?  Did 
you respond to him when he told you that? 
MR BURGER:   I did not officially respond.  I ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And unofficially? 
MR BURGER:   N4 did get work. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry?  They got work? 
MR BURGER:   They got work but ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But I am asking you about your 
response to Mr Saloojee, not whether or not they got work. 
MR BURGER:   I hear you.  My response ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say you did respond, initially 
responded.  Did you? 
MR BURGER:   Ja, what I said was:  I hear you, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I hear you.  You did not say to him:  I 
am sorry Mr Saloojee.  I do not mean to disrespect you but I 
have a real problem with that request or instruction.   
 
I am afraid I am going to decide things to the extent I 
20 
have authority on purely proper grounds.  Not because of 
politically connections.   
 
Now that might reflect a naivety on my part in that you 
were obviously some ranks below Mr Saloojee.  But would 
that not have been the appropriate response? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 218 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   I can answer it in this way Chair.  I still today 
as I sit here, I have got no regrets that I supported the whole 
manufacture at VR Laser.  However, the fact that I just 
accepted Mr Saloojee’s instruction, I do regret.  I think the 
responsible thing would have been that something does not 
sound right here.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And you could have done that 
diplomatically? 
MR BURGER:   Ja, I could have.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And hopefully have kept your job.  I 
10 
mean, presumable if you had said something like I have 
suggested to Mr Saloojee.  I am afraid that if you are going 
to ask me to favour anybody, however good or bad they 
might be, for a reason not that they are good but because 
they are politically connected.  I am afraid I cannot do that.   
 
If he had then charged you with insubordination or a 
failure to comply with an instruction, surely you would have 
been able to say:  Well, that was not a reasonable or lawful 
instruction.   
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the law, no doubt, would have 
supported you on that. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair.  My dilemma that I sat with at 
the time was.  The thing he gave me the instruction on was 
something 
I 
wanted 
and 
that 
is 
the 
dilemma 
and 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 219 of 246 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   And I...  You are correct.  I am not arguing it.  
And in hindsight, it would have been so much easier but 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, it might not have been easier but 
it might have been easier in the sense that you would not 
have to be facing these questions under the glare of 
television lights and in a judicial commission chaired by the 
Deputy Chief Justice.   
10 
 
So in that sense, I accept that.  But...  Yes.  And of 
course, Mr Saloojee must give his version as to whether or 
not this was said in the context.   
 
Can I just go back to the other reference that you gave, 
the other example that you gave?  It was N4. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He had asked you to favour for 
political favouritism reasons. 
MR BURGER:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In that case, were you also keen to 
20 
support N4 in business because of them being superior like 
you regarded VR Laser as being superior? 
MR BURGER:   Yes.  We manufactured Caspir’s at many 
suppliers and they were one of our suppliers.  So it was not, 
in my mind, a big deal and it was not such a substantial 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 220 of 246 
 
contract in any case.  So that was not..  In the years that 
would have followed, they would have received work in any 
case.  So. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Can I ask you this?  Apart from 
how you could perhaps any idea and with the benefit of 
hindsight have responded to Mr Saloojee.  Again, with the 
benefit 
of 
hindsight 
did 
you 
– should 
you 
not 
have 
considered perhaps reporting Mr Saloojee?   
 
You know, that although it may be better on paper that in 
practise, 
the 
law 
provides 
considerable 
protection 
for 
10 
whistle-blowers.   
 
And would it not have been possible for you to have 
reported, for example, to the Minister of Public Enterprises 
or the Public Protector or parliament or somebody like that 
or the chairperson of the board, whether or not he may have 
been amenable to such a report, may be debatable.  But did 
you not consider that possibility? 
MR BURGER:   It would have been the right thing to do 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR BURGER:   But the dilemma I was facing was, our 
Supply Chain processes were horrendously slow.  If I took – 
if I took the numbers of orders that needed to be placed and 
I divided it with the days available, it would have taken 
forever under normal processes.  So, firstly.   
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 221 of 246 
 
 
Secondly, I already expressed my opinion about VR 
Laser and their capabilities and in my mind – and in the 
past, we used to have a lot of single source suppliers.   
 
So his proposal, even though he said it is – they are 
important supplier, they are a connected supplier.  Please, 
form a single source agreement.  That coincided with my 
ambition to streamline processes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   So that was the dilemma.  And I had reported 
him, I would have gone against something that I thought was 
10 
good for the business and would streamlined the business 
and.  So.  But in hindsight, I should have done that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   I should have done that.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Your last argument about how it 
suited your business objective as you would put it, for good 
business reason.  It does suggest, perhaps, that you are 
arguing that the end justifies needs.   
MR BURGER:   Chair, I am not saying that Chair.  I am not 
saying that.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But cannot one read into that – exactly 
that? 
MR BURGER:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you are not saying that, what else is 
it? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 222 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Ja.  No, I was naïve. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry? 
MR BURGER:   I was naïve Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it was the end that you wanted to. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   Yes, I was naïve.  And I – it was objective.  
Just to put this into perspective.  If this thing came from 
Denel Land Systems, it would have been a totally different 
approach.  We would have written a position paper, giving 
the pros and cons, giving all the arguments. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   We would have presented it at the Exco of 
the DCO or the CEO and he would have said:  Right, this 
sounds good.  Investigate.  Continue.  And give me 
feedback.  That is how that would have – if it was initiated by 
Denel Land Systems. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   It was not – it did not happen like that.  But I 
thought it was a good idea.  And that I cannot... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  On the last point.  Can we 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR BURGER:   Sorry.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes? 
MR BURGER:   And this is for me a very important point to 
make.  Sorry, Chair.  My apologies for interrupting.  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 223 of 246 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR BURGER:   If the insinuation is.  I knew, as an example, 
State Capture or corruption was a play and therefore let us 
support something that will promote State Capture or 
corruption.   
 
Then I would have, regardless of what the situation for 
DLS would have been, I would have said no we cannot do 
that.  I mean, that is...   
 
But in my mind at that time was, the – this is a 
connected supplier and it is important.  They are a 
10 
transformed supplier.  It is important to support them.  And 
the way you should do that is get a single source agreement 
in place. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But Mr Saloojee was not making his 
requests or giving you his instruction to favour VR Laser 
simply because they happened to be black-owned and to 
advance BBBEE.  As I understand it, the whole point that he 
was trying to stress, is not that they are black-owned but 
that they are connected politically and they must therefore 
be favoured.   
20 
MR BURGER:   Ja, well politically and an important supplier.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But politically important must mean, 
they are connected to politicians.  They want us as a state 
entity to do what they expect, which is to give their buddies 
contracts which they might not get if you follow the normal 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 224 of 246 
 
processes.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So I just want to test.  I mean, I 
do not want to go into A definition or a debate about the 
semantics, about what state captured and so forth means.  
But you have said you would have reacted - you would have 
resisted an instruction if you had known if this had actually 
had elements of state capture and corruption.  Correct?  
MR BURGER:   Yes.  If...  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR BURGER:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But of course the term state capture 
had not been conceived at that stage.  It came about much 
later.  And of course, the corruption specific to the Guptas’ 
also only became reveal to only much later.  
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At least in the public domain. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   did you have any idea at that stage 
who now owned VR Laser?  Presumably you did because you 
20 
are getting a lot of business from them already.  
MR BURGER:   Yes.  By 2015, I think it was already in the 
public domain.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR BURGER:   The full extent that came down to me in 2016 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 225 of 246 
 
when I received the email from Celia Malahlela. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR BURGER:   That is when everything sort of dawned.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now I do not think we can 
reasonably expect you to have had advanced knowledge of 
all the facts that have come out overtime.   
 
And in fact, this Commission I served the purpose 
amongst others of actually revealing a great deal of facts 
that the public may not have had before and the media may 
not have had before.   
10 
 
So there are no doubts of the reasons that you president 
decided to appoint the Commission in the first place.  But at 
the time that you were dealing with the single supply 
contract in 2015, you knew already that day was concern on 
the part Mr Mlambo about Denel being satisfied as to - we 
have - at least having knowledge as to who the truth ultimate 
shareholders and beneficiaries of VR Laser were.  that had 
already arisen in the Hoefyster Contract, not so? 
MR BURGER:   During the Hoefyster Contract, I did not 
particularly pay attention to that. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But no, my question was not whether 
you paid attention. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He had raised it.  we saw that in 
paragraph five of the one email we saw earlier, not so?  
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 226 of 246 
 
Where he says:  all that they have said when you guys at 
divisional 
level 
had 
requested 
disclosure 
of 
who 
the 
shareholders are.  all they give is the shareholders and VR 
Laser auto companies and I do not know who is behind those 
companies.  So already ...[intervenes]  
MR BURGER:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So already then, whether he knew or 
not that the Gupta connection existed,  he was concerned 
about that as he was entitled to be.  Not so? 
10 
MR BURGER:   True. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now.  so when the Single 
Source Supplier Contract came up, you must have been 
away then.  You have said, you think that already it Was in 
the public domain as to who VR Laser – who owned VR 
Laser, ultimately. 
MR BURGER:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Being the Guptas’. 
MR BURGER:   Being Salim Essa. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Being Salim Essa who was connected 
20 
to the Guptas’, correct? 
MR BURGER:   Ja.  In 2015, I did not realise the strong 
association yet.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Were you aware then or can 
you not remember that Mr Sinhala was a director of VR Laser 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 227 of 246 
 
at the time and that he was the son of one of the three Gupta 
brothers?  
MR BURGER:   If not then, it must have – I think it was 
shortly thereafter. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   That I started becoming aware of it.  I think I 
started becoming aware of Mr Sinhala around middle of 
2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So let us accept you earlier 
indication that if you had known that Mr Saloojee gave this 
10 
instruction to prepare a motivation to enter into a Single 
Source Supplier Contract with VR Laser.  You, at least, knew 
that there was a particular shareholding in VR Laser.  
Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you also knew that why 
Mr Saloojee was raising this was precisely because he 
expected you to be giving business to VR Laser because 
they were politically connected.  Correct? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Did you ask him, did he tell you 
or did you just guess for yourself who – how the political 
connection came about?  How VR Laser was politically 
connected and with whom?  Could you guess or did he tell 
you? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 228 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   No, no, no.  He did not inform me 
whatsoever.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   At the time, it was not – during that 
discussion, I – I am not sure.  I cannot remember exactly if I 
have met a person like Salim Essa.  I think I did at the time 
but – so I knew about him, I think I started to know a little 
bit later about Mr Singhala but what was going through my 
mind at the time was – and that is why I also told the story 
about what happened in India is that I do not know of any 
10 
wrongdoing that these guys had done something funny so if 
a company – sorry and I also did not consider at the time 
too much focus on who is the owner of a company apart 
from proper BBBEE and so on.   What was for me of 
importance is how good a company is and how good they 
can perform.  I was very sensitive of judging people based 
on newspaper articles. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR BURGER:   And that came from the whole India 
debacle and so my opinion was, if somebody did something 
20 
wrong, you know, send him to jail.  If a company gets 
blacklisted because of wrongdoing, close the company but 
do not react on something that is written in the paper about 
…[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I understand that, Mr Burger.  What I 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 229 of 246 
 
am interested, though, is more than that.  I can understand 
you do not want to take decisions based on rumours and 
speculation and gossip and so forth and the media. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We know with great respect to the 
media representatives who are here, who are no doubt 
doing their job in good faith as well, we know that often the 
media is either wrong or may carry something because 
people are feeding them stories that may spread false 
information out there.  I fully understand that but I would 
10 
like us to focus rather on what you did know from Mr 
Saloojee.  So whether or not you knew exactly who was a 
director or the owner, ultimate owner of VR Laser at the 
time and whether they may or may not have been 
connected particularly to somebody in high position in the 
country.  What I am just interested in is what Mr Saloojee 
told you and I am particularly raising this question because 
the Chair - obviously he will determine in due course what 
is ultimately relevant and how to deal with it in his report.  
But it does seem an issue that is worthy of consideration, 
20 
is what the role is of officials at senior level within in state 
entities and I appreciate that Mr Saloojee was far more 
senior to you in the hierarchy of the Denel Group, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And obviously he has to answer and 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 230 of 246 
 
he has answer to an extent and he will still answer when 
he is called again but I am just interested in your – how 
you dealt with it and you are not on trial here but the 
Commission is entitled to hear your evidence as to how 
these things happened and why they happened.   
Now you have acknowledged very fairly early that 
there are some things with hindsight that you realise 
should not have been done.  You have also said that you 
were naïve in certain respects.  Do you accept, though, 
that it would not have just been a good thing to have at 
10 
least said to Mr Saloojee I am sorry but I am not prepared 
to accept an instruction like that.  Instead you just said, do 
not worry, they are going to get business which seemed to 
give him assurance, it seemed to show him you are going 
to comply with the request to favour in a procurement 
setting VR Laser for a specific contract because they were 
politically connected not because they were the best 
supplier.  Now did you not have a duty as a responsible 
state entity official to be taking a stance like that? 
MR BURGER:   In hindsight I should have, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  What I would like now to deal 
with is the process that was followed for this particular 
contract and here again we are dealing with a single 
supplier contract.  Just to make sure that I have covered it 
properly, Mr Saloojee had not said – had not given you a 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 231 of 246 
 
similar request before the Hoefyster contract was awarded, 
that was in fact, as I understand your evidence, something 
that did come from the division DLS itself, correct?  The 
idea to award the Hoefyster platform hulls contract to VR 
Laser. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That came from your own internal 
process. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was ultimately approved by the 
10 
GCEO but he did not start the whole thing. 
MR BURGER:   Other than saying before the time that VR 
Laser is an important supplier. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   The initiation came in totality from the 
division. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So he prior to his raising his 
requirement that you initiate or that you process a contract 
awarding the single supplier status from DLS to VR Laser, 
he had another earlier discussion with you specifically 
20 
about VR Laser, is that right? 
MR BURGER:   In February, around about in February 2014 
he had a discussion with me in which he said VR Laser is a 
very important supplier and in that discussion I told him we 
are busy with the processes, they are a very good supplier 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 232 of 246 
 
in a niche market, they in all probability will get work, do 
not worry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so that was at the stage that the 
platform hulls contract was being prepared? 
MR BURGER:   That was before the platform hulls – it was 
busy being prepared at divisional level, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Did he raise this in 2014 with 
specific reference to the platform hulls contract or in 
general? 
MR BURGER:   No.  No, Chair, that was not product-
10 
specific, it was a general comment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But in 2015 he made the same 
request but specific to the contract that he wanted you to 
award to VR Laser, is that right? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair, his instruction was – and 
attempt to verbalise his instruction was put on the minutes 
of the Exco meeting and it basically said it must be MOU 
with certain single …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR BURGER:   That aimed to achieve single source status. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR BURGER:   And that protects obviously Denel’s 
interest. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Chair, it is getting late in the 
day and you have understandable limitations on the time 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 233 of 246 
 
that you have already indicated to us.  May we be 
permitted to use the remaining time to start the questioning 
relating to the process followed in the award and the 
difficulties relating to procurement compliance?  It is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine, we still have about 
ten, fifteen minutes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Mr Burger, in relation to this 
10 
contract you have indicated earlier that you came to 
realise that with the benefit of hindsight that there were 
some difficulties in relation to the award of this contract, I 
understand …[intervenes] 
MR BURGER:   Which contract is that? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is the single supplier contract. 
MR BURGER:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what do you say was a defect in 
the award of that agreement? 
MR BURGER:   Firstly, at the time I did not see this as a

contract, I saw this as a strategic document, agreement.  I 
also did not see this as a document that stops any normal 
procedures to go through the process to giving a tender 
and getting the normal approvals.  In other words, it does 
not give me, as a divisional CEO, the carte blanche to just 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 234 of 246 
 
place orders.  It still had to go through all the relevant 
parties as indicated in the delegations of authority. 
 
So in my mind also in the past, much lower levels 
than me used to conclude the  strategic agreements.  So I 
did not, without studying the policy, I did not think that it is 
a problem at the time.  When it was approved and we went 
through the negotiation with VR Laser and certain changes 
were made, I therefore had no hesitancy to sign the 
document because I felt it was a fair balanced document 
and it represented the instructions that I got from the CEO. 
10 
So I did not feel that we did anything wrong at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So that explains why you did not 
think there was anything at the time. 
MR BURGER:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now can you please answer the 
question that I put to you, which is with the benefit of 
hindsight you have acknowledged earlier today that there 
was actually something wrong.  You did not realise that at 
the time you say but what is it that you acknowledge now?    
MR BURGER:   I did not …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was actually wrong? 
MR BURGER:   I did not realise it – if you will allow me 
just, it is one sentence.  When it – it then came – I came to 
learn that we should have gone out on open tender and I 
realised – it only – I only got to knew about this problem 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 235 of 246 
 
almost a year after it was signed.  I know it was discussed 
internally at Denel Land Systems.  I was not aware of it.  
There was – I was told about it literally in the passing and 
then there was an Exco meeting where it was discussed 
and I raised the opinion that yes, if we – it is not                                
possible to go out on open tender because the only way to 
do something like this is to send drawings of complex, 
fabricated components to potential partners, let them 
tender on it and give their explanation with regards to their 
capability, their processes, all that.  And just before that, 
10 
we went through that with the hulls.  So we did that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you did that with the hulls but not 
with the single supplier. 
MR BURGER:   Yes, correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I just stop you there for a 
moment, if I may?  Did that not actually alert you when you 
did get the instruction from Mr Saloojee to award it 
immediately and directly to VR Laser without even going 
out for three bids, did you not think hold on, last year we 
awarded a contract, albeit to VR Laser, we did it after at 
20 
least some sort of process of competition, competitiveness.  
We at least got three bidders, why are we not doing that 
here?  Did you raise that with Mr Saloojee?  Did you raise 
that in your own mind? 
MR BURGER:   I did not.  I did not.  Sorry, maybe I did not 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 236 of 246 
 
come across clearly, I – the argument that we should have 
gone out on open tender and my argument was it cannot be 
open tender, it needs to be closed tender, that argument 
was raised, to me, became known to me by early 2016. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR BURGER:   After the agreement was signed.  So at 
signature of the agreement I thought it was well within the 
Group CEO’s mandate to sign strategic agreements of that 
nature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR BURGER:   As the process unfolded and the last 
couple of weeks I came to realise but how things actually 
work nowadays is you have to go out on open tender for 
this.  So I, at the time, I really did not realise it and it – 
and this is why I said well, it is an MOU, let us – or MOA, 
let us go for it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would you explain this – would you 
attribute this, the fact that you did not know at the time 
and you have come to realise recently again to naivety on 
your part? 
20 
MR BURGER:   Chair, I do not know what the correct word 
is, I …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, if it is not naivety, what would 
you …[intervenes] 
MR BURGER:   I wanted to see this happening, I thought it 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 237 of 246 
 
was as good idea for the business.  Maybe I did turn a 
little bit of a blind eye, maybe I thought, you know, why 
this operational focus but it suited me and I supported it.  
And naivety, and not knowing what the correct procedures 
should have been on Treasury level. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and we have already debated 
whether you should have known those procedures and I 
think you have acknowledged that you should have. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But I want to just, if I may, Chair, just 
10 
in the final few minutes of the time left, just explore this 
last aspect of the naivety and the lack of knowledge of the 
processes.  You knew that there were some processes that 
were applicable, that were required, not so? 
MR BURGER:   At the time I knew of the supplier contract 
processes, that I did. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And in fact as I showed you 
earlier when we took the lunch adjournment and we 
confirmed this on the record straight after lunch there were 
two versions of the supply chain management policy.  The 
20 
one was 2013 before the award of the Hoefyster platform 
hulls contract but the other came into force after that.  
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that not applicable at the 
time of the award of the single supplier contract in 2015? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 238 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair, it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you have in your possession – 
had you been sent or did you have access to the current – 
the then current SCM policy? 
MR BURGER:   I had access, I did not have one on my 
table but I could find access. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Presumably when the board at head 
office level decided to approve the adoption of the new 
policy they would have informed you as CEO of a division. 
MR BURGER:   It was distributed, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now apart from your knowledge 
that there was now a new policy, you also had Ms 
Malahlela in your division who headed the supply chain 
management there and you also had Mr Mlambo, as we 
know, at head office who was the head of supply chain 
management for the whole group. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now what I want to ask you is this.   
Even if one assumes in your favour that you were not 
familiar - even though you had access to it, you were 
20 
aware that there is a new policy, you were not aware 
though about the detail that required, for example, a 
competitive process and you were not aware of the 
Constitution and the PFMA requirements to that effect and 
so forth, with the benefit of hindsight are you prepared to 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 239 of 246 
 
acknowledge here that in fact any ignorance of that must 
have been dispelled when Ms Malahlela and Mr Mlambo 
raised serious concerns about the award of this contract, 
the single supplier contract to VR Laser, and specifically 
raised these concerns that there had been noncompliance 
and the contract could not going ahead, what I am 
suggesting to you, if you were genuinely ignorant before 
then, you were then – that ignorance was dispelled by 
them drawing this to your attention despite that you went 
ahead and recommended the contract in your motivation 
10 
and then ultimately signed it on behalf of DLS. 
MR BURGER:   I state again, Chair, although there was, I 
learnt now, discussions within Denel Land Systems. I only 
got to know about the unhappiness and consequences in 
2016, number one. 
 
Number two, in my mind I also said this is a 
strategic document …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, this is a strictly…? 
MR BURGER:   It is a strategic …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Strategic document. 
20 
MR BURGER:   I did not – wrongly, but I did not put it in 
the same category as a supplier contract. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But they were entitled to supply as a 
single supplier to the exclusion of others unless they were 
in breach, you had to go to them first. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 240 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it was a supplier.  So can you just 
explain this, as a final question, if I may, Chair, can you 
just explain why you did not see this as a supplier 
agreement?  It was, it was a single supplier nogal.  To call 
it a strategic document surely does not detract from the 
fact that at the end of the day that contract required, 
maybe not the memorandum of understanding because that 
10 
is sort of a wish and we might do this and we hope to do it. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the memorandum of agreement 
that was signed – by you, not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did actually give them enforceable 
rights to supply you, Denel Land System, before you can 
go anywhere else, unless they are in breach, they must be 
given that business. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Not so? 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So how does the label of this being a 
strategic agreement and therefore not a supply contract, 
how does that tally? 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 241 of 246 
 
MR BURGER:   The reason – and I state again and my 
apology 
for 
repeating, 
in 
the 
past 
these 
sort 
of 
agreements, in the distant past, these sort of agreements 
were regular and that did not mean that if somebody held a 
single source agreement that there should not be normal 
processes to give that order to that person.  And you are 
right, 
it 
is 
a 
single 
source 
agreement, 
but 
the 
…[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, before I let you carry on, 
can I just debate that last point with you?  Surely every 
10 
contract has to follow certain processes and you are 
suggesting it still required those processes but those 
processes include a competitive process. 
MR BURGER:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For competitive bids. 
MR BURGER:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the very point of this agreement, 
that is why Mr Saloojee was wanting you to give it to these 
politically connected people of VR Laser, was to ensure 
that you did not have to go through an open tender or, for 
20 
that matter, for an RFQ as you had done with three bids in 
the Hoefyster, it was precisely to avoid those processes, 
not so? 
MR BURGER:   True, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Perhaps this – we 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 242 of 246 
 
obviously cannot finish the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We have a fair number of questions 
still. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We have made good progress, I 
believe, but I am afraid we have to take up your indication 
that we need to have another opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I have indicated – taken the liberty of 
10 
indicating 
to 
my 
learned 
friend 
Mr 
Crouse 
that 
the 
scheduling will be done as far as possible in consultation 
with him but obviously up to a limit.  We cannot, for 
example, as colleagues say well, I am tied up for the next 
six months or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me make sure there is no I 
misunderstanding about that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the date that we are looking at is 
close there would be consultation with all concerned but if 
20 
the date gives you a reasonable time we will not negotiate 
the dates, we will just – as long it gives you reasonable 
notice then we will just fix the dates but if we are looking 
at close and we will not be giving you reasonable time, 
then we will seek to see if we can agree with you on the 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 243 of 246 
 
dates.  Okay, you understand? 
MR CROUSE:   Mr Chairman, we do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CROUSE:   We will obviously …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do your best. 
MR CROUSE:   Try to accommodate the Commission as 
best we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CROUSE:   But, for instance, and that is why I 
welcome the suggestion of Mr Kennedy, for the next week, 
10 
for instance, I am not available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CROUSE:   But after that Mr Kennedy has also 
indicated to me that the Commission would probably 
accommodate Mr Burger ’s evidence after five o’clock in the 
afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we have evening sessions, ja. 
MR CROUSE:   And then we are readily available at any 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
20 
MR CROUSE:   I just have a problem for the next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, if we are looking at next week we 
would seek to agree with you on the dates because that is 
close. 
MR CROUSE:   Yes. 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 244 of 246 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so we are not looking at next week 
because you are not available.  And in all probability we 
will look at an evening session. 
MR CROUSE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it enables you in case you 
were in court during the day to still be available. 
MR CROUSE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in all probability – but if it is not an 
evening session, that is still a possibility, but if we are able 
to give you reasonable notice, we will simply determine the 
10 
date.  If it is close, we will… 
MR CROUSE:   We would be grateful for that, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, but we would ask 
for the proceedings to be adjourned at this stage with the 
continuation 
of 
the 
questioning 
of 
Mr 
Burger 
to 
be 
postponed to a date to be determined by you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On the basis as indicated but we do 
have another witness that we propose to call tomorrow 
20 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mantsha, the former Chairperson 
of the Denel board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is your estimate of how much 
12 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 305 
 
Page 245 of 246 
 
time you still need with – for questioning Mr… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For Mr Burger?  I would think 
probably no more than two hours, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, because that can easily fit into 
an evening session. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two hours can easily fit into an evening 
session. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Gives new meaning to the term night 
court, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It gives new meaning to the term 
night court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, we have to try the best we can to 
finish the work of the Commission. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So, Mr Burger, you do understand 
and you have no problem. 
20 
MR BURGER:   I understand, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we are going to adjourn for the day 
and tomorrow I will hear the evidence of another witness 
but arrangements will be made for Mr Burger to come back 
in order to complete his evidence.  We adjourn.
