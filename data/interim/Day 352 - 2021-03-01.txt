10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Mr Koko is

Welcome back Mr Koko.  We – we do have a lot of ground 
to cover and Chair the – just for information purposes Mr 
Koko is coming mainly to testify on the transactions that 
would deal with issues of the cooperation agreement 
between Eskom and Tegeta – and OCM – Optimum.  The 
termination of that cooperation agreement and decision 
made by Eskom based on the submissions that Mr Koko 
would have submitted through one The Board, secondly the 
20 
BTC on two different occasions about pre-payments and if 
we are able to we will traverse issues relating to McKinsey 
and – ja in relation to that Mr Koko it will be the exchange 
of emails with infoportal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 6 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson the last 
time you requested the team to do an investigation into 
whether Mr Koko has used a private email address of Dr 
Ngubane before.  The investigators were able to find two 
emails … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were able to find? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were able to find two emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where Dr Ngubane’s email address was 
used on one occasion on behalf of Mr Koko by Mr Koko’s 
10 
PA and on another occasion by Mr Koko himself.  The – Mr 
Koko that you find in Eskom Bundle 18(B) and that is page 
1568 and 1569.  That is the last two pages in that bundle.  
So the first email on page 1568 – 1568 it is on a 
Wednesday 4 – 4 February 2015 at 16:00 from Noluthando 
Ngugema [?] on behalf of Matshela Koko briefing board 
tender 
and 
the 
email 
is 
addressed 
to 
baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com  and I think Mr Koko is also 
… 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Mr Chairman I – I have. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Copied. 
ADV BARRIE SC: I have great difficulty hearing my 
learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I have great difficulty hearing my 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 7 of 218 
 
learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  But if I may just be directed to the 
relevant page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Then I would appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  If you can try and speak up 
Mr Seleka and of course you said the pages it is Eskom 
Bundle 18 page 156… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  8? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1568 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see you have got 1567 and the 
next one is 1569. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja on the – 1567 it is repeated in 1568 
– it is on the flipside Chairperson.  So we can also use 
1567. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  They decided to write the page 
numbers in a different place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is because it is a landscape printout. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can use 1567 it is also – it is the 
same email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 8 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So let us use 1567 Chairperson it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Again an email from saver to tower 
2013 on behalf Matshela Koko sent on Wednesday 4 
February 2015 to Baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com and it is 
briefing board – board tender.  And there is more 
information there by the sender in Ngugemanl@eskom and 
to whom it was sent again Baldwin.ngubane@gail.com.  
That in 2015 Chairperson – February 2015.  Then you go to 
10 
page 1569 – 1569 this is an email in 2017 then this one 
comes directly from Mr Matshela Koko on Saturday 11 
March 2017 and it is addressed to board members 
including Baldwin.ngubane@gmail.com and you will recall 
Chair the testimony of Ms Suzanne Daniels she said this 
was the private email address of Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
And 
not 
– 
and 
not 
infoportal1@zoho.com.   Mr Koko you see those emails 
there? 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have heard of – you ready to say 
something? 
MR KOKO:  Ja I – I have to comment on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he is waiting for the question. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 9 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  No but I have to comment on this.  He was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well he will give you a chance.  He 
will put the question to you now. 
MR KOKO:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the emails.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You may comment Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:  No, no, no let me (not audible). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I am asking you to comment. 
MR KOKO:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well what – what do you want him 
to comment about?  Do you not want to say – to connect 
the discovery of these emails with the previous… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The previous evidence so that he is clear 
exactly what you are looking for. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Thank you Chair.  So Mr Koko you 
have said that the email infoportal was given to you with 
the explanation that it is Dr Ngubane’s email address? 
20 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you said that was Ms Suzanne 
Daniels who told you that. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
She 
has 
testified 
before 
the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 10 of 218 
 
commission that she did not – she never did that.  She 
never 
gave 
you 
the 
email 
address 
infoportal 
as 
Dr 
Ngubane’s email address.  She testified that the email of 
address 
I 
have 
just 
read 
out 
of 
Baldwin.ngubane@gamail.com is the email address – the 
private email address of Dr Ngubane.  Your comment?  In 
fact it seems to be even known to you that private email 
address of Dr Ngubane of gmail.com. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I have listened to the testimony of Ms 
Daniels and I have a lot to say but I will say very little.  
10 
She has lied to you many times and I do not think she 
knows what lies she has told before.  But I do not want to 
play the man or the person or the lady I want to 00:12:19. 
 
The email on 1567 is February and was sent by my 
assistant to Mr Ngubane that was in February 2015 and 
after that I was suspended for almost five months.  I think 
it is extremely unreasonable for me to remember an email 
that was sent – used by my PA five months after 
suspension (inaudible) to for the first time last night 
actually because we received the batch of – I received the 
20 
bundle again midnight last night I came to realise that 
Suzanne has got more than two covert email addresses 
herself and for her to come and tell you and say Mr 
Ngubane – Dr Ngubane has this email address when she 
has multiple ones is disingenuous.  So – so me – I did not 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 11 of 218 
 
use Dr Ngubane’s email before 2015 my PA did and five 
months after I came back from leave I am expected to 
remember it that is unreasonable.   
 
Ms Daniels gave me this email address for the 
purpose of communicating to the PA – to the Chairman 
after I came back from suspension – after I sat her down 
giving my experience with Dr – with Mr Zola Tsotsi and I 
asked her how do I avoid the same experience.   
 
Now Ms Daniels said to you – page 44 of her 
transcript I had the intention of going through and I hope 
10 
were – you ask her a question.  Did you have access of Dr 
Ngubane’s email address?  She says yes.  In her own 
version in the same sentence she says I did not have the 
private – I did not have access to the  email address – to 
the Eskom email address of Dr Ngubane.  In her own 
version she has access of Dr Ngubane email but she does 
not have access of the Eskom. She also says the Eskom 
email address Mr Ngubane – Dr Ngubane’s PA had access 
of it.  So she only had the private email address of Dr 
Ngubane.  That is one. 
20 
2.  You ask her:  Did Dr Ngubane open any email 
addresses and print and send the documents to Koko or did 
the PA of Dr Ngubane open the email address and send the 
documents to Koko or you did open the email address and 
– to get the document?  She says:  It is a combination of 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 12 of 218 
 
both.   
 
Ms Daniels had access to the infoportal address 
without fail all the emails that I have sent to the chairman 
of Eskom for the purpose of discussing with her on issues 
that 
will 
sit 
before 
board 
reached 
Dr 
Ngubane 
she 
physically printed them and we had a three way meeting 
with Dr Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja well we are a bit confused by your 
explanation Mr Koko because when you were interviewed 
on 702 when you were asked who is Businessman which is 
10 
this email address of infoportal you did not say that is Dr 
Ngubane’s private email address.  You said Businessman is 
Ms Daniels.  Your comment on that? 
MR KOKO:  Right.  I found the submission of Mr Smith very 
interesting and I like your response to him on Friday 
because you said that clip must be made part of the 
bundle.  Because it is a selective clip that is meant in my 
view to mislead you.  Two things if you listen to the 
recordings – to the whole clip it is an interview I did with 
702 Eusebius McAlister I say on two occasions this is the – 
20 
this is an email I was given by Suzanne all information that 
I sent to this email reached the Chairman.  Unambiguous 
un-equivalent and I really hope you will find the time and 
listen to it.  I mean there is a discussion we had about Just 
Coal and I said but I sent this information to Suzanne it 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 13 of 218 
 
reached the Chairman unambiguous.  I really want you to 
listen to that.  But there is a catch to that because it is in 
the end – same interview where Ms – where Ms Daniels 
confesses to committing crime.  It is the same interview 
where Ms Daniels confesses to committing crime and she 
says in her own words after being asked what happens to 
the – to the officer of the court who commits crime?  She 
says they go to jail.  So you are dealing with a weakness 
here that sits before you who in her mind knows she has to 
go to jail for the crime she has committed and she 
10 
confessed to it on the radio.  And the difficulty I have with 
her and I said I did not want to – I do not want to dwell 
much on her I am here to give my own evidence.  I want to 
help you get to the truth.  The difficulty you have Chair 
with the witnesses that come before you their intentions to 
not – is not to assist you to get to the truth their 
assistance – their intentions is to come here to prove a 
point of criminality against Mr Koko for the crime that you 
will hopefully eventually call state capture.  Be that as it 
may I have full confidence in you that today we will stop 
20 
the gossip.  We will stop the gossip and all what we must 
talk about is not he says, they say – said the evidence.  
We must today follow the evidence and I will assist you 
through the evidence to get to the truth not to get to who is 
guilty of the crime that will eventually call state capture. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 14 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Thank you Chair.  Ja.  I really want 
to lead your evidence Mr Koko but what you are saying 
compels me to correct you because you conflating two 
issues.  Ms Daniels concession for wrongdoing related to a 
payment she made approved by the board on behalf of Dr 
Ngubane’s legal fees.  It had nothing to do whatsoever with 
infoportal email address.  So we are busy dealing with the 
status of your knowledge about infoportal email address. 
She said categorically in that interview she did not tell you 
that.  She has come and said here before the commission 
10 
that she did not give you that infoportal email address and 
said it is Dr Ngubane’s email address.  And in fact you 
have received an email directly from infoportal when the 
pre-payment of R1.6 billion was being converted into a 
guarantee.  That email gave you the details of what should 
be – the terms of the guarantee/the underlying agreement.  
You took that email from infoportal and you forwarded it to 
Ms Daniels.  Let me give you the page reference so that we 
can speak about something that is before you.  Again it is 
Eskom Bundle 18 – 18 on page 1087.  The same bundle 
20 
page 1087.  So that email is on 10 December 2015. 
MR KOKO:  This – I think I know the email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know that email? 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which sends you a two pager. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 15 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And it is from Businessman.  A two 
pager between Tegeta and Eskom salient points.  Eskom 
will provide bank guarantee of R1.68 billion.  Then we will 
come back to this email.  That email you then forwarded it 
to Suzanne Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just for convenience Mr Seleka I 
know we may have read it into the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But will you read it into the record again. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sure I will Chair.  The email is from 
Businessman it is dated 10.12.2015 it is after midnight.   It 
is addressed to matshela 2010 subject: Two Pager.  And Mr 
Koko would you confirm matshela2010 is that your – was 
that your Eskom… 
MR KOKO:  That was my private email address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Your private email address.  The 
subject is Two Pager.  Two Pager between Tegeta and 
Eskom Salient Points.   
“Eskom will provide bank guarantee for R1.68 
20 
billion CP which is condition precedence for 
release 
its 
Section 
11 
approval 
from 
DMR 
competitions commission approval. 
• Tegeta 
will 
supply 
from 
OCM 
as 
per 
contract that for the twelve months pre-
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 16 of 218 
 
payment [January 2016 to January 2017] 
will give a 5% discount of the R154. 
• Tegeta will supply from Koornfontein as per 
contract for same period at the original 
R380 not the requested increased tariff. 
• At the end of each month starting [End 
February 2016] Eskom shall deduct R140 is 
that R140 million from amounts due to 
recoup the R1.68 billion. 
• Tegeta receiving pre-payment for two mines 
10 
supply but Eskom can use monies owed 
from all three mines [Brakfontein also] to 
recoup the R140 million per month. 
• Therefore if Tegeta does not deliver full 
volume 
from 
OCM 
or 
00:24:35 
the 
payments 
due 
for 
Brakfontein 
can 
be 
thwart. 
• Any amounts due over the R140 million for 
each month shall be payable to Tegeta.  
Two pager almost as addendum to the 
20 
supply contracts.” 
Then that email is forwarded to Ms Suzanne Daniels by 
yourself at 7:31 on the same day in the morning.  You see 
that Mr Koko?  You see that Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:  Yes I do. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 17 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So how do you explain that? 
MR KOKO:  Chairman  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to complete your sentence how 
does he explain what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  How do you explain sending an email 
from infoportal which you say it is an email address where 
you were communicating with Ms Suzanne Daniel and Dr 
Ngubane you taking that email you forwarding it to Ms 
10 
Suzanne Daniels.  One would expect based on your version 
that she already has that email and then there is no need 
to forward it to her.  Would you please then explain how we 
should understand this? 
MR KOKO:  Chair let me start to – the way Mr Seleka 
started.  Ms Daniels confessed to a crime.  She confessed 
to expecting to go to jail.  Whether it is a crime of Tegeta 
or a crime of murdering a person is irrelevant.  Officials of 
the court that she confesses to a crime that she committed 
while working for Eskom that is the point I am making.  It is 
20 
on that audio that is the point I am making.  Let me get to 
the – to answer the question.  By this time I had sent a lot 
of communication to the Chairman to the – through this 
email.  The pre-payment transaction was an urgent issue 
for me at the time.  When I received this message I 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 18 of 218 
 
received it in the morning I did not read the detail of it but 
I could see it comes from the email that I used for the 
Chairman and I could see it relates to the pre-payment.  I 
phoned Suzanne if you check my telephone records you 
will see that about five/six minutes before I sent this email 
I phoned Suzanne and says I have received an email from 
the Chairman it relates to the pre-payment I do not know 
what it is all about.  Please look at it and let me know if we 
have to go and see the Chairman about it.  I do not know 
what the Chairman is communicating with it.  I have 
10 
learned from the first time that it relates to the – to the 
guarantee.  I did not even know about the guarantee.  I 
subsequently 
related 
after 
we 
met 
Suzanne 
during 
lunchtime.  I asked Suzanne have you looked at the email?  
Do we need to see the Chairman?  She says no, no it is in 
control we do not need to see the Chairman.  But fast 
forward 
the 
guarantee 
was 
– 
the 
document 
for 
the 
guarantee was compiled by the Eskom Treasurer and it is 
not a coincidence why the guarantee motivation would 
come from the Eskom Treasurer because if you go to 
20 
Eskom 
10 
– 
Eskom 
Procurement 
and 
Procurement 
Procedure we call it 103224 page 62 of it I would like to go 
to it.  Can we go to it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
MR KOKO:  It is in Bundle MMK49.   
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 19 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOKO:  And then that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go to it. 
MR KOKO:  49 it is Bundle 15.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that Mr Koko so my Registrar 
can identify the bundle? 
MR KOKO:  MMK49 it is in Bundle 15 and I will give you 
the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Bundle 15 is here.  I have got Bundle 
– 594.  Yes, I have got that page 594, Bundle 15. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Right.  We will try to come back to it but I am 
going to read the middle of the sentence.  It says Eskom... 
 
It says: 
“And advanced payment may be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no.  There is some problem.  
My 594 does not have sentences.  It is MMK-49.  My page 
594 in Eskom Bundle 15.  I think my registrar seems to...  I 
think she has got the ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, if you have got MMK-49? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR KOKO:   MMK-49 has got 156 pages.  If you go to page 
61 of 156.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, this is the end of this bundle.  So 
maybe it is the next bundle.  Let me see.  Mr Seleka, you 
are having – are you able to find it? 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 20 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay I think I have now been 
given...  Oh, there is a...  Okay Bundle 15 appears to have 
A, B and C.  Is it A, B only?  Ja, A and B. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A and B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is in Bundle 15(B).  The one that 
I was looking at was Bundle 15(A). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Just give us the page reference 
10 
again Mr Koko? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have now got 8594.  8594 is the 
same document I saw earlier on, on the other bundle.  
Mr Seleka, are you able to find it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have it.  Mr Koko, just gives us the 
page reference again. 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15, page 654. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   654. 
CHAIRPERSON:   654? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   654. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I think your counsel said 594 and 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chair, I mean the old document. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 21 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
ADV BARRIE:   [Indistinct] [microphone not switched on.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the actual document ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Page 654. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay I have got it. 
MR KOKO:   The document is an Eskom Procurement and 
Supply Management Procedure commonly known as 32-10-
34.  That page deals with two issues and many people 
have really went to town and embezzled what this says.  
10 
First it says:  Advanced payments are allowed in Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that. 
MR KOKO:   “An advanced payment may be an acceptable 
strategy for Eskom ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...in certain circumstances.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   That is very – that is the message that I want 
to put it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   You know, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe you might wish to read the 
relevant portions first and then talk about it. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  And then it says:   
“Approval 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
contract 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 22 of 218 
 
containing advance payment conditions must 
be 
supported 
by 
a 
relevant 
financial 
functionary and approved by procurement in 
the committee ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell us where about on that page you are 
reading mister... 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that starting with SBE? 
MR KOKO:   It starts with Eskom does... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay just read the 
10 
relevant part then. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
“An advanced payment may be an acceptable 
strategy for Eskom in certain circumstances...” 
 
And then the last paragraph says: 
“In the event that you find advance payment 
acceptable, 
approval 
to 
proceed 
with 
a 
contract 
containing 
advance 
payment 
conditions must be supported by the relevant 
financial 
functionary 
and 
approved 
by 
a 
20 
procurement tender committee not within a 
dual or duplicate application(?)...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me just see.   
“Eskom does not infringe(?) the provision of 
advanced payments...” 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 23 of 218 
 
 
That is the first sentence.  Then: 
“An advanced payment may be an acceptable 
strategy for Eskom in certain circumstances.  
This may be considered in cases where the 
supplier will have to make a big capital outlay 
before starting with the contract.  
This may be necessary when assessed of 
goods ordered and paid for and where assets 
of have a long lead or when manufacturing 
starts need to be booked and paid for when in 
10 
advanced of goods being delivered. 
And advanced payment will only be issued on 
condition that an advanced payment on the 
Eskom pro forma working and it provided by 
supplier. 
The relevant contractual provisions relating to 
advanced payments also need to be included 
in the...   
Approval 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
contract 
containing an advanced payment conditions or 
20 
advanced 
payment 
condition 
must 
be 
supported by the relevant financial functionary 
and approved by a PTC not with dual or...” 
 
Okay alright.   
MR KOKO:   Now ...[intervenes]  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 24 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
want 
to 
comment 
on 
the 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Now the next important one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I point to the email.  I want to answer that.  
We will come back to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   When we did prepayment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I will advise you that when you give the 
10 
prepayment you comply to Eskom procedures and I find – I 
will find it very difficult that condemn for complying to the 
Eskom procedures.  And I will also say, if you do not like 
the procedures, change them but do not condemn them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Then the next sentence says – the next 
paragraph it says – it starts with Eskom Treasury.  Now 
this is the part I want to put. 
“Eskom Treasury Department is appointed by 
the 
Treasury 
Committee 
to 
facilitate 
an 
20 
managed the Eskom wide guarantee process. 
A further committee chaired by the finance 
director is responsible for ensuring that Eskom 
through 
Eskom 
Treasury 
Department 
has 
effective 
credit 
risk 
exposure 
management 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 25 of 218 
 
process 
in 
place 
including 
centralised 
administration of guarantees issued in favour 
of Eskom. 
The process also include monitoring of the 
guarantees 
exposure 
against... 
of 
the 
guarantees...” 
 
So I am saying the guarantee was motivated and 
done at the right delegated authority.  It was not, in my 
view, done from outside unless you want to suggest – 
Mr Seleka wants to suggest that the Treasurer of Eskom, 
10 
Caroline Henry, was part of the conspiracy.  She was not.   
 
The email came to me.  It is an email that I have 
used before several times.  It belongs to Dr Ngubane.  It 
had the pocket that was, at that point, most relevant, 
according to Ms Daniels.   
 
I said to Ms Daniels:  Here is a document from 
the chairman.  It relates to a transaction that I have asked 
you to deal with.  Let me know if he has – he wants to 
convey something to you.  I did not read it.  I did not even 
know it deals with the guarantees.   
20 
 
I have learnt about the guarantee issues in that 
email through the process of the Commission.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, going to Mr Seleka’s question and 
that email on the pager.  I may have asked you this 
question before and you may have answered but I just want 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 26 of 218 
 
to make sure that if I did not, you are able to deal with it 
now. 
 
The crux of issues that are dealt with in that 
email do not seem to me to be the types of issues that the 
chairperson of the Board of Eskom would write to you 
about.  Is that a mistaken view?  They seem to be too 
operational. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct.  If I had read it at that point, I 
10 
would have said but why would the chairman talk about 
such issues of details that even me at operational level I 
would not know of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   But I did not look at it.  I simply forwarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   But that level of detail ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It did not come from the chairperson. 
MR KOKO:   ...should not come from the chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Should not come from the chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Let us assume for present 
purposes that you are correct in saying.  You did not look 
at it because if you had looked it at it, that would have said 
to you but this cannot come from the chairperson of the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 27 of 218 
 
board.   
 
Now when – or subsequently when you looked at 
the contents of the email and now when you look at it, to 
the extent that the issues dealt with there, to the extent 
that I am writing, thinking they should not be coming from 
the chairperson of the Board of Eskom. 
 
Would that not be an indication that therefore 
the email did not come from him?   
MR KOKO:   On, Chair in hindsight and having listened to 
the evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And that is why I said to you the last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I would be very angry and flabbergasted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is very clear that it cannot come from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no doubt about that. 
MR KOKO:   There is no about that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   And that is why I am angry, flabbergasted 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...that I am made to communicate to an email 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 28 of 218 
 
that has got third parties.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And for me, it has got nothing to do with Salim 
Essa or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And material to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But is more and more becoming obvious that 
it is an external party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   And that is what angers me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   That is what makes me flabbergasted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   That we have exposed Eskom information that 
should not end up with third parties – end up with third 
parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   But here is the next step that angers me the 
most.  Again, you should go the transcripts of Ms Daniels.  
20 
You have put to him...  I apologise.  You put to her.  It 
says:  Mr Koko says he got it from you.  And her response 
made me truly angry.  Her response is:   
“Mr Koko is trying to mislead the Commission.  
I do not know infoportal address and I have 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 29 of 218 
 
never used it...”   
 
Page 44 of 145.  Page 44 of 146 of that...   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MR KOKO:   Yes, third party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I do not know infoportal address.  I have 
never used it.  Mr Koko has never – is misleading the 
Commission.  And that is why I say Ms Daniels has lied so 
many times because I do not think it is in dispute in this 
Commission that whether she used it or not.  I went 
10 
yesterday – my counsel gave me a list of emails that she 
has used.   
 
She was dismissed at Eskom and the Eskom 
papers say she did not dispute she used it.  All what she 
said was it was for the DG, Mr Seleke.  But she comes 
here and says Mr Koko is misleading the Commission.   
“I do not know infoportal and I have never 
used it...”   
 
That is the type of witness you are dealing with 
and put... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you accept that now that you are 
able to say:  Well, this email could not have not – it did not 
come from Dr Ngubane.  Would you accept or would you 
not accept that it therefore means that all the emails that 
you have got from Businessman did not come from 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 30 of 218 
 
Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:   Without a doubt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept? 
MR KOKO:   Without doubt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So you – and you have 
already said you accept that, it came from outside, not 
from inside Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the only issue you make – the only 
point you make is to say you did not know that you were 
10 
communicating – you are receiving communication from 
somebody from outside and that when you were sending 
emails to Businessman, that you were sending emails to 
somebody from outside.  That is the point you make? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   
MR KOKO:   Just one second Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR KOKO:   Sorry.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  There are a couple of things 
mentioned about you there Mr Koko but let me pick up on 
the last one.  The last one you are saying doctor – not 
doctor – but Ms Daniels’ evidence is that she never used it 
but Ms Daniels has accepted to using the email address as 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 31 of 218 
 
on her version given to her by Dr Ngubane.   
 
In fact, it was you who said you never sent an 
email to infoportal for Businessman.  It was you who said 
that.   
MR KOKO:   Chair, I – what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay hang on.  Let me hear what your 
counsel says. 
ADV BARRIE:   Because what is being put to the witness is 
simply not correct.  On the 19 t h of February, very recently, 
should have been my learned friend’s memory.  Ms Daniels 
10 
– it was put by my learned friend that this Businessman 
was then the address used communicate with Dr Ngubane 
and Ms Daniels said:   
“Oh, no Mr Chairman, I think Mr Koko is trying 
to mislead the Commission.  I at no stage told 
him that the infoportal address of Businessman 
address belongs to Dr Ngubane.   
I did not use it.  I categorically deny that.   
Dr Ngubane had a personal email and it was 
Baldwin, etcetera.” 
20 
 
That is her evidence.  But my learned friend 
does illustrate though is – well, I trust that that is what he 
will illustrate to you, is that Ms Daniels’ version about facts 
before you changed from day to day.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 32 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  We – 
Ms Daniels has accepted using the email Chair previously.  
The documentation clearly show that as well.  When there 
was an exchange of the – of an email with – from infoportal 
regarding cutting ties with media houses, Mail & Guardian, 
City 
Press 
and 
so 
on, 
Ms 
Daniels 
was 
in 
that 
correspondence and the resolution was passed on from 
Dr Ngubane to Ms Daniels which became a Round-robin 
resolution of the board.  So that is the evidence before us.  
What I think she is trying to – she is emphasising here 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
ADV BARRIE:   Not my learned friend.  My learned friend 
was questioning her at the time.  It is not for him to tell 
you Mr Chairman what he thinks is relevant to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am not sure...  Well, just remind 
me what your question was that Mr Barrie had... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct Chair. 
ADV BARRIE:   So I think my learned friend does confirm 
20 
what I said, I trust that he was going to demonstrate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I want him to repeat the 
question that gave rise to the debate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The – it was a statement Chair to 
Mr Koko that Ms Daniels has accepted to using infoportal 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 33 of 218 
 
as given to – the infoportal address as given to her by 
Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said that to Mr Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then I added this because Mr Koko 
was saying Ms Daniels said has never – has denied using 
the email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I am saying to Mr Koko, in fact, it 
10 
was Mr Koko himself who said he has never sent an email 
to infoportal.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I was about to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think let us say that.  Mr Koko 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it your recollection that you said you 
never sent an email to...?  Mr Seleka, to...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To infoportal or Businessman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  I have never told this Commission 
that I have not sent it ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not just ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   The question came from Parliament, from 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 34 of 218 
 
Ms Mazzone ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is exactly my point. 
MR KOKO:   Ms Mazzone asked me ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Mr Seleka?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us be quiet.  He is speaking.  I 
thought you were saying something.  Yes, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Ms Mazzone asked me two related questions:  
Did you send an email to Salim Essa, Businessman email 
address on Yahoo2010?  I said to her:  You know, this 
10 
Yahoo2010 has been disconnected for – by Yahoo.   
 
And they have sent me an email that there are 
suspicious activities.  So I immediately investigated before 
I could even answer that question.  And then she asked a 
questions:   
“Did you ever send an email to Salim Essa on 
infoportal Businessman email address?”   
 
That is what I understood.   
 
I said:   
“No.  No, I never done that.  I have never sent 
20 
an email of Salim Essa emails to infoportal 
address or Businessman.  I have never done 
that.”   
CHAIRPERSON:   So that seems not to be so different 
from what Mr Seleka was saying.  Because I think what you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 35 of 218 
 
are saying is.  You asked specific questions but your 
response was that you had never sent an email either to 
Businessman or infoportal or Salim Essa. 
MR KOKO:   Ja-no, Chair, the question there was that I 
disputed.   And I still dispute.  It is the link that I sent an 
email to Salim Essa on infoportal address.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So your evidence is that.  What 
you said there in response to Ms Mazzone was that, you 
had never sent any email to Salim Essa or infoportal. 
ADV BARRIE:   No, Mr Chair that was not the witness’s 
10 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am trying to clarify his evidence. 
ADV BARRIE:   It was Salim Essa ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Barrie, please sit down.  I am getting 
clarification. 
MR KOKO:   I have not sent an email to Salim Essa at that 
address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At infoportal? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Now I 
20 
understand.  Okay.  Does that mean – or I take it and you 
must clarify if my understanding is correct.  Does that 
mean you are not denying having – you are not denying 
having sent any email to infoportal or to have used that 
email address but all you are saying is, you never used 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 36 of 218 
 
that email address to sent an email to Salim Essa? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, the...  I call interrogation.  The 
interrogation at the Parliament ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   The issue at the Parliament of did I send 
emails to Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To Salim Essa? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And your answer was no. 
MR KOKO:   The answer was no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Full stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in your answer earlier on you said 
something about infoportal as well. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, because the parliamentarians, in their 
view, was infoportal is Salim Essa.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, but what I am trying to 
understand is whether – I mean, if it is – it is clear from 
what you are saying to me that to the extent that you were 
being asked whether – or maybe it is not clear.  [laughs]  
20 
Let me ask it this way.  Had you, as at the time of 
answering the question in Parliament, had you sent any 
email to Salim Essa under whatever email address? 
MR KOKO:   That is what I understood the question to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 37 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   And my answer was no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I understood the question exactly to that 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now then the next question I want to ask 
is.  As at that time when you were in Parliament answering 
the question, had you sent any email to anybody using the 
infoportal email address? 
10 
MR KOKO:   No.  Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You had not? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no.  At that point, I would have said 
yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have said yes? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay because you had. 
MR KOKO:   Because I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
hope 
that 
has 
clarified 
things 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, then let us go to the question.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go to the question.  It is in 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 38 of 218 
 
15(B), Eskom Bundle 15(B) on page 1090.   
MR KOKO:   I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   15(B).   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   15(B).  Well, that is the same bundle 
where you referred us to that document with, advanced 
payment.   
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1090.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You said 1090.  Is that right? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Chair, you could start on the 
previous page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which will give you context of what the 
debate was about.  So that is page 1089.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I will start with Ms Mazzone, the 
second last.  Let me tell you.  She starts by saying that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You are starting from where 
about?  The last... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Almost the last big paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the second last paragraph. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 39 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Against the name Ms Mazzone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says: 
“Let me tell you.  When it was active, a few 
interesting, maybe disturbing things happened. 
On 4 November 2015 at 22:39 an email left 
matshela2010@yahoo.co.za and it went to the 
DG of Public Enterprises who had a private 
email address, an infoportal email address. 
10 
And it said:  Please give the boss...” 
 
Now when they are talking about the DG Chair, 
you will see what Mr Koko says in response because the 
impression here ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you do not intend to read the 
whole paragraph. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am not reading it now because I 
am going to Mr Koko’s answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Let me just...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Then Mr Koko answers.  He says: 
“I have never sent an email to the DG, Richard 
Seleke.  I have never done that...” 
 
Then the next page: 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 40 of 218 
 
“Did you ever send an email, perhaps to 
someone called Businessman?” 
 
And this was his response: 
“Not at all.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Chair, it is not even whether you 
sent an email to Salim Essa.  It is specifically to 
Businessman.  And in the context of talking about Richard 
Seleke because there is a version that says infoportal is an 
email address at Richard Seleke. 
10 
 
And it goes on to say – Ms Mazzone says: 
“Because 
that 
is 
the 
address 
used 
for 
Mr Seleke, him, on his email.   
You know how my email – when I sent it to you 
it says Tasha, his comes out as Businessman. 
So maybe Businessman rings a bell. 
So these emails that have come from your 
email address or are you thinking that these 
were created to put you in a bad light?” 
 
Mr Koko says: 
20 
“I have heard many versions about those 
emails and I think that there is a way to verify 
them and they must be verified...” 
 
Now that question did not relate to Salim Essa.  
Mr Koko, it related to Businessman and the infoportal 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 41 of 218 
 
address. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the reason I said there are many 
versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   There are many versions.  My understanding 
of that question was unambiguous.  In fact, if you accuse 
me of anything, it is me saying I have never sent an email 
to DG Seleke because I have.   
 
The Businessman, Salim Essa, that is how – at 
all material times in that discussion, Salim Essa.  And that 
10 
is why I said to Mazzone but there are many versions of 
this story.  You need to verify it.  So at all material times, 
Salim Essa.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are saying that to the 
reference to Businessman, you associated with Mr Salim 
Essa? 
MR KOKO:   No, I did not associate it.  The committee 
members associated it with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   They generally associated it with him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I mean, I have a lot of questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Including this.  I mean, this story and that of 
Mr Seleka has now made, there are many versions of that. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 42 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I did not – I personally did not but many 
people that comes to me says:  Mr Koko, you sent 
Businessman email address.  Who is this?  Salim Essa?  
No, I have not done that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not understand your evidence in 
this regard then.  If you did not associate the term 
Businessman with Mr Salim Essa, how could you have 
understood – how could you have meant your answer to be 
that you never sent an email to Salim Essa when you are 
10 
asked the question did you ever send an email to 
Businessman? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, because Businessman has been 
induced to describe Salim Essa by ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but if you do not associate Salim 
Essa with Businessman then your answer – your question – 
your answer would expect when you are asked that to 
apply your mind to who is businessman, as far as you are 
concerned. 
MR KOKO:   That is why I am saying we must verify this 
20 
email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why? 
MR KOKO:   I say verify this email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is to the transcript? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 43 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, after you said not at all Ms 
Mazzone says because that is the alias used for Mr Seleka 
– Mr Seleke. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka, that is the alias 
used for Mr Seleke on his email.  You know how my email, 
when I send it to you it says Asha.  His comes up as 
Businessman.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe Businessman rings a bell.  So 
these emails that have come from your email address or 
are you thinking that these were created to put you in a 
bad light?  So in this explanation that Ms Mazzone gives 
after you had said not at all, after you had said you had 
never sent any email to Businessman and you say that you 
were – in your mind you were saying you were thinking 
they were asking you whether you had sent an email to 
Salim Essa, as I understand it.  She then explains and her 
20 
explanation does not talk about Salim Essa, it associates 
Businessman with Mr Seleke who I think was Richard 
Seleke and may have been DG of Public Enterprises at the 
time.  So she does not refer to Seleke – to Mr Salim Essa. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you may be right but I am saying at all 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 44 of 218 
 
material 
times 
when 
I 
engage 
with 
her 
and 
the 
parliamentarians and the journalist, Salim Essa is in my 
mind, at all material times, and I have none done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at that time you knew – you 
accepted or did you not accept that you had sent emails to 
businessman, whoever you thought Businessman was. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, so – and then after she had 
given this explanation you say: 
“I have heard many versions about those emails and 
10 
I think that there is a way to verify them and they 
must be verified.” 
And then she comes up with – she says in the next 
paragraph: 
“I think in actual fact that is exactly what is 
happening even as we speak because I was very 
honest with Mr Singh last night and I am going to be 
very honest with you, I required these documents to 
be forensically audited because I think we need to 
know for sure that these are legitimate email 
20 
addresses and as the Public Enterprises committee 
we certainly do need to know that.  In 2015…” 
Then she talks about Dubai. 
 
I will say this to you that on the face of it it seems 
to me that once she explained that businessman, on her 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 45 of 218 
 
understanding, was the alias for use for Mr Seleke – I must 
be sure that I do not say Seleka – Seleke, I would have 
expected you after she has said that to say look, when I 
say I have not sent an email to Businessman, I am talking 
about Mr Salim Essa because she was now telling you that 
she had in mind Mr Seleke as the businessman.  What do 
you say to that? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  So when you are not in the ring, 
you do not understand.  At that point there were many 
versions about the email address.  Even members inside 
10 
parliament and outside parliament had many versions and 
frankly, I got to a point where I said listen, go verify this 
thing before you come put it to me.  That is where I was at 
that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why did you not say to her look, I 
have sent emails to Businessman but my understanding of 
who I was sending those emails to was so and so? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, that was not the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you can see that on your 
understanding of who the Businessman is and on her 
20 
understanding it is two different things.  As I understand 
you, at that time, when 
you sent the 
emails, your 
understanding was that Businessman was Dr Ngubane and 
on her understanding she understood that Businessman 
was Mr Seleke, Richard Seleke. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 46 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   I understand that [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then journalists, you have told me, 
journalists or some other people understood Businessman 
to be Mr Salim Essa. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am suggesting to you is that 
once you understood if you had thought that she was 
asking you a question, the question have you sent emails 
to Mr Salim Essa because you thought that is what she was 
10 
talking about because a lot of journalists were saying 
Businessman is Salim Essa.  Once she had revealed to you 
that she was thinking it is somebody else, seems to me 
that that was the opportunity for you to say well, you have 
somebody else in mind, the person I have in mind in regard 
to Businessman was Dr Ngubane.   I have sent emails to 
Businessman which I intended to reach Dr Ngubane.  What 
do you say to that? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I did not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I did not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But I have – frankly, she had already told – 
said a lot of times that we are being rid of forensics on 
this.  So go do it, get rid of forensics, go do it. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 47 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you understand what I am 
saying, I am saying what you are confronted with is you 
have been asked a very specific question, have you ever 
sent any email or emails to Businessman and your 
understanding is that a lot of people think Businessman is 
Salim Essa and you know that you have used – you have 
sent emails to Businessman but you thought on your 
version you were sending emails to Dr Ngubane.  She 
comes up, she says in effect her understanding is that 
Businessman is Mr Richard Seleke.   
10 
So what I was putting to you is that once you were 
aware of that, I would expect you to say no, you know 
what, there seems to be different understandings, I have 
sent emails to Businessman but my understanding was that 
Businessman was Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I did not do that.  I did not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
MR BARRIE SC:   Chairman, may I just ask something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BARRIE SC:   Because in the bundle of documents, 
20 
bundle 18 that has been made available to us, there are 
emails from Mr Koko but they are all addressed to info 
portal, I have not been able to find any that are addressed 
to businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 48 of 218 
 
MR BARRIE SC:   I do know whether my learned friend has 
been keeping – whether there are documents that have not 
been made available to us but in bundle 18 I cannot find 
any email from Mr Koko that went to businessman.  Maybe 
my learned friend can clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka, do you want to 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Chair, the answer is a simple one.  
I think my learned friend could have asked Mr Koko to 
explain because Businessman is Info Portal and it appears 
10 
on the other emails that are already in the bundles. 
MR BARRIE SC:   I do not think that addresses the issue, 
the documents before you, there is no documents on Mr 
Koko that goes to Businessman.  It goes to the Info Portal 
address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we can check if we need to check 
but my own understanding of your client, Mr Koko, is that 
he would be the first one to point that out if that was – if 
he had never sent a email to businessman. 
MR BARRIE SC:   And I just want to interrupt again 
20 
because you will recall that you said to me I must sit down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BARRIE SC:   So I did not want to interrupt your 
questioning of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 49 of 218 
 
MR BARRIE SC:   But all I am saying is that on the 
documents before you… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR BARRIE SC:  …there are no documents.  So if Mr 
Koko, on the documents before you, say to Mr Mazzone I 
never sent an email to businessman, that is quite correct 
on the documents before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BARRIE SC:   Because there are no documents that 
went to Businessman from Mr Koko on these documents. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka, I am …[intervenes] 
MR BARRIE SC:   But if my learned friend knows better 
and he has another document to that effect then he is 
obliged to make it available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I think you probably have 
something to say.  I think say that and then we take the tea 
break and, if necessary, during the tea break the two of 
you can talk, clarify whatever and when you come back we 
can proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair, I was going to say 
exactly that because we can show my learned friend from 
the documentation that Businessman is Info Portal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 50 of 218 
 
MR BARRIE SC:   Ja, that is of course not the point that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you will talk about it during the 
tea break.  Okay. 
MR BARRIE SC:   Because my learned friend is not 
assisting you by avoiding the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I have a recollection that does 
not seem to make this issue for me – this difference an 
important one but let us take the tea break and if there is 
anything to thrash out between the two of you, you will 
10 
discuss, and then we can take it from there.  Of course we 
have a situation where the witness has given an answer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when Mr Barrie re-examines he is 
free to clarify that if he wishes to have it clarified but if 
there are any documents, you will show him the documents 
that you have in mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The emails, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, indeed, the emails, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the tea adjournment.  It 
is twenty past, we are going to resume at twenty five to 
twelve.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 51 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.   
MR BARRIE SC:   Mr Chairman, if I may, what is at issue 
at this stage is what Ms Mazzone put to Mr Koko, the 
following and he pointed out to the witness and what is 
evident is Ms Mazzone operated on the premise that the 
Info Portal address belonged to the Director General Mr 
Seleke.  So that is on page 15 1089 where Mr Koko 
explained that the Yahoo address has been tampered and 
that have been discontinued and Ms Mazzone then puts to 
10 
him: 
“Let me tell you, when it was active, a few 
interesting, may disturbing things happened, on 4 
November 2015 and email left Matshela Koko and it 
went to the DG of Public Enterprises.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Barrie, I am sorry to interrupt you.  
What is the purpose or the …[intervenes] 
MR BARRIE SC:   Well, the purpose is – well, let me just 
cut to the chase then, at the foot of that page Mr Koko was 
asked about an address WDRSA and his respond was – 
20 
and it was not really a question, I said I have never sent 
an email to the DG David Seleke, I have never done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what is the purpose of whatever 
point you want to make or what …[intervenes] 
MR BARRIE SC:   It then goes on: 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 52 of 218 
 
“Ms Mazzone:  Did you ever send an email to wrap 
this up …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Barrie, Mr Barrie, Mr Seleke 
is in the middle of questioning Mr Koko.  He put a certain 
question answered.  I put certain questions, Mr Koko 
answered.  Now …[intervenes] 
MR BARRIE SC:   May I just suggest to you, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BARRIE SC:   I did not – Mr Koko during all that 
questioning, he did not confirm that he ever sent anything 
10 
to Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you can ask that in re-examination 
to clarify, is it not? 
MR BARRIE SC:   But what the point that – the point that 
is at issue, my learned friend pointed me to email 
addresses, emails from Mr Koko that went to Info Portal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will …[intervenes] 
MR BARRIE SC:   But there is still no …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will clarify if you wish to clarify, Mr 
Barrie, in re-examination. 
20 
MR BARRIE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
MR BARRIE SC:   Well, that is the purpose why I am 
addressing you at this stage …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, you …[intervenes] 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 53 of 218 
 
MR 
BARRIE 
SC:   Because there 
seems 
to be a 
misunderstanding regarding the emails that were sent by 
Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BARRIE SC:   Because he did not send any emails to 
Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
MR BARRIE SC:   On the document that my learned friends 
have available or that are available to you in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  Mr Seleka, continue. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chairperson.  Chair, what 
we have done previously when Mr Koko was here, we have 
taken him through the emails exchanged by him with Info 
Portal.  Those emails – and I will quickly just run through 
them, you will find them in Eskom bundle ’18, Chairperson, 
I think it is (A) at page 1032. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 1032.  Now that is on the 20 July 
2015.  Chairperson, that is a significant date because that 
is a date when Mr Koko returns from suspension.  So there 
20 
is 
no 
confusion 
about 
Info 
Portal 
and 
Businessman 
because last time we were able to establish that the email 
address belongs to Businessman, just like it is being 
explained by Ms Mazzone in that exchange with Mr Koko 
that when I sent an email my alias name is Tasha.  So you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 54 of 218 
 
will see my name as opposed to my exact email address 
and this is what you see here.  The first one is this email 
on page 1032.  That’s from Mr Matshela Koko, Monday 20 
July 2015 at 7.57 in the morning.  It is addressed to 
InforPortal1xoo.com, Top Engineers 2.  And those emails, 
Chair, a couple of them on the day so there is an email and 
then the attachment to the email on the next page, then 
there is an email on page 10.35, also from Mr Koko, 
Monday 20 July 2015 at 8.01 addressed to InfoPortal.esco 
ResolutionPDF. Findes12.  Then you have the resolution 
10 
following on the next pages.   
 
And then on page 1056.  1056 is an email again 
from Mr Koko on Saturday, 8 August 2015 at 22.20, twenty 
past ten, to Info Portal.  The subject is Online Vending PDF 
and it says: 
“We did not finish our discussions about this 
transaction, this is what is going to board of 18 
August.” 
And the attachments follow.  Then there is another email, 
Chair, on page 1075.  This is one is from Mr Koko on 
20 
Monday 21 September 2015 at 16.32 to Info Portal, the 
subject is “Re”.  The attachment …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 1065? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1075. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1075 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 55 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1075.  We traversed these emails last 
time when Mr Koko was here.  1075, from Mr Koko on 
Monday 21 September 2015, 16.32.  The subject is just 
“Re” and it has an attachment of an intention to suspend 
Mr Petla.  Another email on …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, is the attachment the letter 
on page 1076? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1076, that is correct, Chair, which has 
Mr Matshela Koko at the end of it, the Group Executive 
Technology and Commercial.  Then page 1078.  Another 
10 
email 
from 
Mr 
Koko 
to 
Info 
Portal, 
Wednesday 
13 
September 2015 at 14.42.  Again the subject is just “Re”, 
when you turn the page, Chairperson, is that letter on page 
1079 which is Dr Ngubane’s letter to Minister Brown.  On 
page 1080 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the letter at page 1079 an attachment 
to the email at page 1078? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  Then on page 1080 is 
another email from Mr Koko on Saturday 14 November 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   On what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1080. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The next page.  On Saturday, 14 
November 2015 to Info Portal.  It’s just “Re” there’s no 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 56 of 218 
 
message and what is attached to that email follows on the 
next pages, Electricity Load Shedding Review and Way 
Forward.  There is another email on page 1084. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On page 10…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1084.  From Mr Koko, 25 November 
2015 to Info Portal and the message is just: 
“Give the boss please.” 
And the attachment follows, Chair, on the next pages 1085, 
1086.  Then on page 1087 is this email we have referred to 
before and it comes from Businessman dated 10 December 
10 
2015, it is addressed to Mr Koko@Matshela2010 and the 
two pager with regard to the guarantee.  That email which 
Mr Koko forwards to Ms Suzanne Daniels.  Then, Chair, 
turn to – then on page 1088, the middle of the page is an 
email from Businessman, and you see the email address, 
InfoPortal1@zoho.com.  Now you see who is Info Portal 
and it is addressed to Matshela Koko 2010.  It is a one 
visa for travel.  This is on the 3 January 2016 and with that 
string of emails, Chair, we have established last time when 
Mr Koko was here that Info Portal email address belongs to 
20 
Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The question has been whether 
Businessman is Salim Essa and that is what Mr Koko was 
trying to explain to you earlier. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 57 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I seem to remember that on one of 
the previous occasions when Mr Koko was giving evidence 
that he said he understood that when he sent emails using 
this Info Portal address he was sending it to Dr Ngubane 
and that he was associating this Businessman to be Dr 
Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
that 
was 
certainly 
my 
understanding of the effect of his evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the evidence that emerged last 
10 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Yes, Mr Koko, do you want to say 
anything about my understanding? 
MR KOKO:   Chair ,the Info Portal email address belongs 
to Mr Ngubane and that is what I have been saying all 
along. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you not say that you accepted or 
understood that the Info Portal address was associated 
with Businessman and that Businessman was Dr Ngubane? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  Info Portal address is Dr Ngubane.  
20 
It is no doubt that the Info Portal address in the public 
space is associated with the Businessman.  It is not 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But in terms of your 
understanding …[intervenes] 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 58 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   My understanding, the Info Portal address is 
Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think it may be necessary to go 
back and check the transcripts in terms of …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because my understanding was that it 
was clear from Mr Koko’s evidence and maybe it was not 
clear and that is why it is necessary to check that he knew 
the Info Portal email address to be associated with 
Businessman and Dr Ngubane being the owner of the email 
10 
address. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is no doubt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Based on the evidence that has been led. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   That Businessman is linked to the Info Portal 
address, there is no doubt about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Based on the evidence that has been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That has been led, ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   But you will not be correct to say when I was 
sending the Info Portal address I was sending to the 
Businessman at the time. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 59 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So I think that needs to be 
checked in terms of the transcript but you may have your 
own 
understanding, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
know 
exactly 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   You will not be correct to say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understood. 
MR KOKO:   I understood when I was sending the email to 
the Info Portal address I was sending to Businessman.  
That will not be correct.  Based on the evidence that has 
been led now, it is clear that it is linked to businessman 
10 
but you can say the same that when I was sending the 
emails, these emails that we have been taken through, I 
was sending to the Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   You cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think your junior could in the meantime 
be checking from previous evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  .The way I understand, Mr Koko, what 
he is 
saying is although he 
accepts Info Portal is 
associated with Businessman or it is Businessman or it is 
Businessman’s 
email 
address. 
 
That 
was 
not 
his 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 60 of 218 
 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At the time …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is what he says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That when he sends emails to Info 
Portal he is sending them to Businessman.  I think I 
understand what you are saying. 
MR KOKO:   You are right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .Ja. 
MR KOKO:   You are right. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we separate your understanding at 
the time on the actual name behind the email address.  So 
I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what needs to be checked is the 
evidence that he gave previously. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which I may have I misunderstood to 
mean, according to him, I may have I misunderstood to 
mean 
he 
understood 
that 
Info 
Portal 
belongs 
to 
Businessman. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who he understood to be Dr Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what needs to be checked 
because he is saying …[intervenes] 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 61 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …at that time I did not understand Dr 
Ngubane to Businessman. 
MR KOKO:   Oh certainly, Chair, that is for sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR KOKO:   At the time I was sending the emails through I 
did not understand Dr Ngubane to be Businessman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But based on the evidence that is led, I have 
10 
come to understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept now. 
MR KOKO:   That Info Portal is linked to Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But we cannot say that was the case in 2015 
when I was sending this, you cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Okay.  So maybe it might be 
important to ask the question was it only as a result of the 
evidence that has been led in the Commission that you 
have come to accept that Businessman was definitely 
20 
associated the Info Portal address or long before the 
Commission led evidence you had come to accept that? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, a lot of evidence that has been 
presented here was in the newspapers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 62 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   All that I am saying is, the information that 
was in the newspapers and the information that was led 
here were not to my knowledge at the time when I was 
sending the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   What I was sending my email …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take your answer to be already before 
the evidence was led here from what you read in the 
newspapers or heard in the media …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accepted that Businessman was 
behind Info Portal email address. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you, Chair.  Because, Mr 
Koko, that is very clear from page 1088, the one of 3 
January 2016 where Businessman Info Portal is sending 
you an email …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, page 1088 of bundle 18? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Eskom bundle 18 where we were 
20 
going through those emails, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1088, ja.  I am there, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That it is very clear from that email 
Businessman has this address Info Portal and he sent you 
an email at your private Yahoo email address and he sends 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 63 of 218 
 
one visa for travel, forward, forward.  So this email must 
be coming from somewhere, I think from the travel agent, 
Sajieda Mayeta(?) and it is being forwarded to you, three 
times Koko family visa. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is not clear, it is not clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .Okay, we will go to the travel agent’s 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I want to make sure what it is that 
Mr Koko says is not clear.  What does appear to be clear 
on this email is that it says from Businessman and next to 
10 
Businessman the email address given is Info Portal – is the 
Info Portal address that you have been talking about. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I do not know whether this is the 
question that Mr Seleka has in mind but my question is 
anyone reading this email would see that whoever presents 
himself or herself as Businessman is the person from whom 
the email comes and he or she is using this Info Portal 
address. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, that is a reasonable take when you 
20 
read the detail.  When I received this I was waiting for the 
visas and when I received it, I opened – I did not pay 
attention to detail and read Businessman.  I did not recall 
and the difficulty that I am experiencing now is that 
because we are going through this process, you are 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 64 of 218 
 
looking into a fine comb but human behaviour does not 
work that way.  Depending on the subject you are dealing 
with you get observant or get you want you want.  What I 
wanted from this email was my visas and I got my visas 
and I sent them to the receptionist to go print.  That is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that time did you still understand the 
Info Portal address to be Dr Ngubane’s email address? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I mean, this is quite interesting because 
before I received this email I called Suzanne because I 
asked her to arrange the visas for me and I was getting 
10 
desperate because I was running out of time and I text her, 
I think I also text her.  And then she says to me do not 
worry, your visas are coming, give them couple of minutes 
and couple minutes they came boom, voila, that is what 
made me happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But am I - do you accept that it would 
seem that the visas or Businessman had something to do 
with the three Koko family visas, whoever the Businessman 
is. 
MR KOKO:   Right now? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, right now.  Right now, yes.  You 
accept, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
you 
have 
accepted 
that 
Businessman was not Dr Ngubane. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 65 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is your understanding of who 
Businessman was that was having something to do with 
your family visas? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, remember that my arrangement with my 
family was done with Suzanne. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your arrangement with? 
MR KOKO:   With my family visas was done with Suzanne.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MR KOKO:   So all my communications was done with 
10 
Suzanne and when I received and when she contacted me 
to say they are coming and they came, she had done what 
I asked her to do, the other issue – in fact that part I asked 
her when I came back, how did you get Dr Ngubane to 
arrange my visas?  It is unusual because I expected to get 
the email from her, not from the email that I know belongs 
to Dr Ngubane and her answer was it was convenient.  
That is what her answer but my visas arrangement had 
nothing to no one else except Suzanne, that is the person 
who dealt with it for me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   When she said it was convenient, what 
did you understand her to be saying really, what was 
convenient about Dr Ngubane getting involved in your 
family visas? I am trying to see whether the answer she 
gave you made sense to you. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 66 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   It did not make sense to me and I told her 
then.  I said but, does it not make sense?  Convenient for 
what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was her response to that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, we did not progress that discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But I remember telling her but it just does not 
make sense, Suzanne, but I did not have the presence of 
mind 
that 
something 
untoward 
is 
happening 
to 
identification 24.24 because, Chairman, what you also 
10 
must realise, at this stage Suzanne and I was very close.  
Suzanne and I were in a very professional relationship.  
You know, we – I would not say we were friends, we would 
never visit each other over the weekend.  We would never 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were close professionally. 
MR KOKO:   But professionally we were very close and I 
trust her professionally.  She – I had worked with her for 
not more than a year but she was first recommended by Mr 
Marokane and she has proved to be competent.  So I tend 
20 
to trust her but because she was in my office, she was my 
senior manager in the office.  I would ask her in fact she 
would call herself the chief of staff, in her office, that how 
she introduced herself to – I will ask her to do some, you 
know, book me this, book me that, do this for me, and she 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 67 of 218 
 
will do it.  So I did not push her but I did find it to be odd. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you would accept, I guess, that 
Chairman of the board of Eskom should have nothing to do 
with your arrangements for your family visit, the visas. 
MR KOKO:   That is why I asked her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   That is why I asked her but when I expected – 
I expected an email but that is when I came back, not when 
I was still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.  Oh, you did not ask her then. 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, I did not ask her then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   But I – I did not ask her then, by that time I 
was in a panic mode because I wanted to move on but 
when I came back, I thanked her for doing what I asked her 
to do but I asked her but why did Dr Ngubane send me my 
visa when it does not make sense? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let me establish this, asking her why 
did Dr Ngubane not get involved in my family visas, was 
that after you had come back from whatever trip or was it 
20 
before? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, after I came back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After? 
MR KOKO:   After, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and that is when she said to you it 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 68 of 218 
 
was convenient. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes but then you did not take it further.   
MR KOKO:   But I did tell her that it does not sound – it 
sounds odd. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is odd, ja. 
MR KOKO:   But I did not take it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would expected you to want to get to 
the bottom of these kind of things because she gets the 
Chairperson of the board involved in something very I think 
10 
private, your family, travelling with your family and you had 
not asked her to ask Dr Ngubane to be involved in that, 
she gives you an answer that does not make sense.  I 
would have expected you to deal with it, get to the bottom 
of it because it does not make sense. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is when you assume that 
something untoward is happening, I did not suspect that 
there was something untoward happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What had you asked her to do connected 
with your family visas? 
20 
MR KOKO:   I have her copies of my – I gave her my 
tickets and copies of my ID and I said to her I am off to 
Indonesia, my son in particular wants to do shopping in 
Dubai, we have not booked for Dubai but on our way back 
instead of going through Dhuhr back to South Africa, if you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 69 of 218 
 
can arrange my visa for me because I just do not have the 
time, my Dubai visa, then please do so and confirm my – 
here are my tickets, change my tickets as well, then if it 
happens on time and we get our visas through Dubai, we 
go through Dubai, otherwise we will come back through 
Dhuhr and she did that, she actually got my visa sorted, I 
think I paid R5 000 for that, that was the price for 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paying who? 
MR KOKO:   Suzanne.  I think that was the cost of the 
10 
visa.  That was the cost for the visas, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It was around 5 000.  And then she got my 
tickets sorted out and then we went through Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sure Mr Seleka has some 
questions around this issue but before he might deal with it 
or whatever he might still be wanting to deal with other 
issues, I want to go back to the question of your 
understanding 
that 
the 
Info 
Portal 
address 
was 
Dr 
Ngubane’s address.  If I recall correctly – oh sorry? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have the exchange from the evidence 
of Mr Koko previously, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Shall I read that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 70 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because I think it is important.  So you 
say Chair so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:    I am sorry are you able to say what day 
it was or whatever, you know the transcript sometimes say 
day 117 or something. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, I will have – which page am I on 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or give whatever reference that will 
enable somebody to go to the same document later on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well the date is the 12 t h of January 
10 
2021. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And the page number of the transcript 
is page 226, and I am reading against line – just above line 
10, the Chairperson is talking. 
“So then what, the question that arises in my mind 
is that why this would not have made you say but 
the Chairman cannot be talking about this thing, 
what is going on, who is this Businessman, because 
the Chairman cannot be talking.” 
20 
Then Mr Koko intervenes and says: 
“Chairman responding to you, I knew who is the 
Businessman.” 
You say “yes” and he says: 
“It was the Chairman.” 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 71 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So I think Chair you are; your 
recollection was correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, yes. 
MR KOKO:   But Chair remember my evidence I am saying 
to you, is that at that point, when I was sending, I did not 
know that the info portal is associated to the Businessman. 
I have come to know after. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After I when? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I just said to you by the bid up to 
10 
this Commission, if you read the newspapers, you will see 
that the info portal is linked to the Businessman but that is 
if you meet, it does not matter - you do not have to do, if 
you Google it you will find it an extensively that has been 
led, here.  But at the time 2015 the part that I knew of it is 
info portal, but you would be correct to say, at that point 
when I was sending it, I was sending to Businessman, I did 
not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought I thought the passage that Mr 
Seleka read, included an answer from you, and he is going 
20 
to read it again, that says you knew pass tense, Mr Seleka. 
MR KOKO:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka do you want to read it. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have listened to him and I did not 
misunderstand him, I think what you heard is right, all what 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 72 of 218 
 
I 
am 
saying 
what 
I 
meant, 
and 
I 
may 
have 
used 
Businessman as an unfortunate term there, but from where 
I am standing, and from what I understood at the time, I 
knew of him for portal address.  And that is why if you look 
at my emails, all of them are not - there is none of them 
that says Businessman, none of them, and the one that 
came to be Businessman came in January.  
The one that we are talking about…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And January 20? 
MR KOKO:   January 2016, so you cannot say between 
10 
July 2015 and the 3 r d of January, there was any concept of 
a Businessman, it was never there in writing or anywhere, 
it was never ever there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I just want us to be on the same 
page.  Do you accept that the passage that Mr Seleka 
read, reflected that you said you knew and the reference 
being you knew at some stage during the time of the 
sending of the emails as to whether 2016 or whatever we 
can look, but are we on the same page that the answer that 
Mr Seleka read was to the effect that you knew at whatever 
20 
time the context will reveal that info portal belonged to a 
Businessman. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, that is what he says but let us look at 
the evidence please, Chair let us look at the evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 73 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   You can only know that the email belongs to 
Chief Justice Zondo when you see it, to the DCJ Zondo 
when you see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   You can only say then, I challenge Mr Seleka 
to take you through the emails from info portal from 2020, 
from 20 July which is the very first time I started using it, 
20 July, until the 3 r d of January.  You will to never find 
Businessman, you never will.  
So I could not have known as Businessman because 
10 
that concept did not exist, it did not exist at all, so you 
cannot say it belonged to Businessmen when there was no 
Businessman at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see the good thing, I think, is 
that we are on the same page as to what the transcript 
reflects there.  But what I think what you are seeking to do 
is to say, in effect, well I may have said that, but because 
it was nowhere in writing until January 2016, I think it is. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot say I knew. 
20 
MR KOKO:   You cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you are saying.  
MR KOKO:   You cannot if you go one by one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course you could have known even 
though it may not have been written…[intervene] 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 74 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   How? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you were in touch with Businessman in 
some other way, talking to them telephonically or even 
meeting them, but in emails not writing it. 
MR KOKO:   I have never met this Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I am not saying that, I am not 
saying you did.  I am simply saying another way in which 
you could have the knowledge that Businessman is behind 
info portal address is if there was other communications. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but Chair I am clarifying there was 
10 
nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I - you are talking about what as 
far as you are concerned is a fact. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember you asked me how, so 
I was just pointing out that another possibility of gaining 
that knowledge would be this one, but you are saying you 
did not as a matter of fact. 
MR KOKO:   I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   And Chair I am going to say this, again Mr 
Seleka has done that, they are about I do not know how 
many emails, about 8,10,12? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is quite a number of them. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, and they start from 20 July 2015, the only 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 75 of 218 
 
time a Businessman arrives is on the 3 r d of January.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So I could not have said this info portal is 
Businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but we are going back now, Mr 
Koko. We - I think I accept that except for one of the 
emails to which Mr Seleka referred all the others do not 
seem to have any reference to Businessman. 
ADV BARRIE SC:    Chairman, I am weary to interrupt but 
you 
must 
just 
remember 
where 
this 
whole 
train 
of 
10 
questioning started it starts with the witness's response to 
the question in Parliament from Ms Mazzone.  Did you send 
an email to Businessman and the answer we know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:    That is the issue my learned friend 
may or may not suggest that that use that to attack the 
witness's credibility.  Question then was when he said I 
have never sent an email to Businessman, was he telling 
the truth?  Was he being truthful?  So that is the real issue 
that we essentially now spending time on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I was making the point that my 
recollection is that out of a number of emails that Mr 
Seleka referred to us to only the one that refers to 
Businessman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Not, no Chair. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 76 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not, it is not true, how many? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
 
There 
is 
another 
one 
is 
page…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is another one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Page 1087. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1087.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Which is in December 2015.  The 
email was from Businessman about the two page of a 
guarantee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes okay, that was December 2015.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there are two, is that right?  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, at least two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, at least two okay.  So, that 
part is factual, okay.  So the question that the transcript 
resolved is what Mr Koko said about knowing what 
Businessman, who Businessman was or the association of 
Businessman with the info portal address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that the transcript resolves that part 
20 
and Mr Koko and I understand that but what Mr Koko has 
sought to say afterwards, as I understand him is to say, 
because in many of the emails, to which you referred us Mr 
Seleka there is no reference to Businessman he could not 
have known that Businessman was behind the info portal 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 77 of 218 
 
address.  Of course whether that is reasoning is correct is 
something else, but that is the point he makes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And Chair might I point out that the 
context under which you were seeking clarity even at that 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    It was in regard to this email of 
December 2015. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Where Businessman sends the terms 
of what would be the guarantee and the underlying 
agreement, and my question to Mr Koko on that very 
transcript of 12 t h January 2021, it is page 225 because I 
read from 226 I said, and the Chairman was here, who 
testified he knew nothing about this guarantee.  They 
converting the R1.6billion pre-payment guarantee.  
The Board said they know nothing, Dr Ngubane 
says the same.  So how would that email have come from 
20 
the Chairperson to Mr Koko when the Chair said I know 
nothing about the guarantee, that was the question.  And 
that is how then you Chairperson wanted to know, but who 
is this Businessman.  So Mr Koko said he understood him 
to be Dr Ngubane, that is way back in December 2015. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 78 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  So am I right, Mr 
Koko to say what you are saying is that despite – or part of 
what you are saying is that despite the fact that you got 
two emails, at least from Businessman, one being the one 
at page 1087 of Eskom bundle 18 that is the two pager.  
The one where the subject is two pager, and the one on 
page 1088 of the same bundle.  Are you saying that 
despite having received these emails from Businessman 
you did not think that Businessman was Dr Ngubane? 
MR KOKO:   No Chair, I never associated Businessman 
10 
with Dr Ngubane, never did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I never did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Despite the fact that you were receiving 
emails that were from the email address that you said you 
had been told was Dr Ngubane’s private email address. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair and both emails and I have given 
the context it and both - one has got the guarantee, all that 
I looked at was the content and then info portal addresses, 
I said this is the Chairman and I forwarded it to Suzanne. 
20 
And the second one had to do with Suzanne as well.  
At no stage did I internalise that Businessman – in fact 
what attracted me was info portal address you cannot miss 
it.  So when I see info portal address I see the Chairman, 
Businessman not at all. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 79 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Despite the fact that in these two emails 
Businessman is written there.  
MR KOKO:   Yes Chair and that is two of the - how many 
address there is two of the many, you know if it was visa 
versa then I will understand, but it is two of the 12 or two 
of the 15, I do not remember.  I did not do that despite the 
two, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And am I correct to say the explanation 
that you were giving, a few minutes ago when you and I 
were having an engagement on the issue of what you knew 
10 
about Businessman in 2015 and so on.  It seems to me that 
the effect of the explanation you are giving is to say I take 
note of the fact that the transcript reflects that I said, I 
knew this is a Businessman to be Dr Ngubane despite the 
fact that the transcript reflects that.  
I am saying I was not; I did not know or I could not 
have known because of the fact that a number of the 
emails that related to this email address did not have the 
name Businessman. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, thank you Chair.  So Chair, you 
will recall that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I should just ask this question, I 
am sorry Mr Seleka please do not forget the question that 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 80 of 218 
 
you want to put to Mr Koko, so that I can just complete at 
least the picture.  I understood you to say, Mr Koko, that 
these emails that you believe in 2015 and 2016, you 
believed you were sending to Dr Ngubane using the info 
portal address, would go to or would be opened by Ms 
Daniels, is that is that correct, is that what you said or am 
I – did I misunderstand? 
MR KOKO:   Chair my expectation is that the way Eskom 
works, Dr Ngubane will open it himself, and the assistant 
will open it to. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, sometimes it would be the assistant, 
sometimes it would be…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright and I understood you to 
also say, pursuant to such emails, you sometimes had 
meetings 
that 
involved 
yourself, 
Ms 
Daniels 
and 
Dr 
Ngubane to discuss the issues in the emails, is that right?  
MR KOKO:   Chair it is not sometimes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is not sometimes, the documents that I sent 
20 
on info portal now I am careful how I am communicating 
now 
because 
it 
is 
easier 
to 
say 
Businessman, 
my 
information that I sent to info portal were information that I 
thought in my view, if I do not discuss with the Chairman 
may lead to conflict down the line.  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 81 of 218 
 
So, when I sent the document I would insist that we 
meet Dr Ngubane and I explained to him why I wanted to 
meet him, and you will see sometimes I will discuss with 
Suzanne and say Suzanne with this document, we need to 
meet the Chairman I will send it to you.  And when I said it 
I say pin this to that because I would have discussed it 
with him and in this case, I would know who is going to 
open it because I discussed it with him, with her I 
apologise.  So there is no document that I can recall that I 
sent on the info portal address that Suzanne, Ms Daniels 
10 
and Dr Ngubane and I have not discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now even that it must be so that on 
your version Dr Ngubane would have seen these emails 
that you sent to this info portal email address many times, 
is that right? 
MR KOKO:   It is my expectations, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 Yes, 
now 
let 
us 
go 
beyond 
the 
expectation. 
When 
you 
actually 
had 
these 
meetings 
involving Dr Ngubane and Ms Daniels, to discuss issues 
that were dealt with in these emails.  Obviously, he would 
20 
not participate in those discussions without knowing about 
this email address, this emails that you sent to the info 
portal address, which you thought were going to him. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now, you did not, did he - because 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 82 of 218 
 
here in the Commission he, if I recall correctly, said that 
his understanding was that this info portal address was for 
Mr Richard Seleke, it was pointed out to him that at the 
time when some of the emails came to Eskom from this info 
portal address.  Mr Seleke was not he DG of the 
Department 
of 
Public 
enterprises 
as 
yet 
and 
my 
recollection 
that 
his 
answer 
was 
that 
was 
the 
understanding which he said he got from Ms Daniels, he 
accepted that Mr Seleke only became DG of Public 
Enterprises. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I remember that, Chair I know what you are 
talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now it seems to me having regard 
to what he said about this info portal address, that there is 
no way his going to say he is aware, or he received emails 
that came from you under this info portal address and 
came to him that you even sit down and just asked because 
he would have told you that no, I have got nothing to do 
with this email address.  What you think comes from me 
does not come from me. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Except Chair, every time we went into his 
office, the documents were already printed and there will 
be a copy for me, there will be a copy for Ms Daniels and 
the will be a copy for Dr Ngubane. 
And that is what made me so confident that the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 83 of 218 
 
documents I am sending to info portal reaches Dr Ngubane 
because he had the documents, how did they end up 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you also saying that the 
discussions that you had with him and Ms Daniels when 
you were discussing these, the issues covered by these 
emails were such that he was discussing on the basis that 
these emails that came to you from info portal were from 
him and that he received these emails that were from you 
to info portal a discussion, because when you have sent an 
10 
email or letter to somebody and you subsequently have a 
discussion on the subject of the email or letter, you can tell 
if sometimes that they do not know about the letter that I 
sent them and then you say but I sent you a letter where I 
explained this and they say I never received such a letter.  
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you never had that kind of situation 
with him? 
MR KOKO:   So Chair, the way the way it works is that he 
gets briefed before you come in, so by the time you come, 
20 
he already knows what you are going to engage him on and 
his got a document in front of him.  So how that was 
introduced to him I do not know but on many occasions in 
the meetings when we discussed, I have mentioned many 
times that I have emailed this document, this is from me to 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 84 of 218 
 
you, I have emailed it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he never said, I never - this is not 
my email address? 
MR KOKO:   Well I have never said that I have sent it to 
you on this email address. 
ADV BARRIE SC:     
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, you would see the email 
address, is it not?  
MR KOKO:   No, they - what they do they print the 
documents. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   They print the documents and you interact 
with the document, but I would verbalise it that at these 
documents I have sent and his is what I want, and the 
reason I sent it this is what I want, I want to discuss it and 
then we will discuss, and then we will conclude and we will 
resolve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at no stage did he disassociate 
himself from this email address, disassociate in a sense of 
saying, you know, this is not my email address. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have never discussed with Dr 
Ngubane and say…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this your email address. 
MR KOKO:   Is this your email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 85 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   I have never done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the discussions…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   All that I have done, all that I have done is to 
say Chair, I have sent you the documents.  Have you 
received the documents?  He says ja, these are the 
documents that Ms Daniels has given me, the discussions 
ended up there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but of course, as you speak now, I 
think of what you first said. 
MR KOKO:   I hold a different view now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   I hold a…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You, accept that these emails were 
therefore going to somebody else and not to Dr Ngubane.  
MR KOKO:   I hold a different view and if you ask me what 
that view is, I will tell you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, tell me. 
MR KOKO:   I think that that addresses is an info portal 
address and the description fits when well and different 
people had access to it and Ms Daniels was one of them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you accepted I think you accepted 
previously that it was not Dr Ngubane, the email address 
did not belong to him and that you accept that now. 
MR KOKO:   Knowing what I know, I do not think so.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 86 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   Knowing what I know I can resolve we were 
sold downhill; I think we sold down the Mississippi.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but then the question arises, 
knowing what you know, now one has got to say it was 
somebody else who was responding to you and not him and 
I think you accepted that, it was somebody else outside of 
Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, most certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the question again, is how 
would emails that you thought you were sending to him but 
10 
now we know were going to somebody else, how do they 
end up in these meetings with him on his desk…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   And that is why I am convinced that Ms 
Daniels had access to the portal and I am very attached to 
their story of who the identity could be because there are 
many pointers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   You will remember that when we were 
suspended on the 10 t h of March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 11 t h, on the 11 t h of March. 
20 
MR KOKO:   On the 11 t h of March 2015.  The day before 
this evidence before you that our suspension letters four of 
them were written by Suzanne Daniels and modified by 
Salim Essa, were written by Ms Daniels and modified by Mr 
Essa.  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 87 of 218 
 
What more proof do you need of the content Mr 
Seleka asked Ms Daniels did Mr Essa asked you, she said 
no.  There is no any other evidence that can conclusively 
show you a contact between Ms Daniels and Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:  Mr Seleka says to me the last time I was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR KOKO:  It was established that the probability it is Mr 
Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR KOKO:  In the disciplinary hearing of Mr – Ms Suzanne 
Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  And I have gone through the documents of Ms 
Suzanne Daniels’ disciplinary hearing and I got them from 
the commission and there is an expert witness there and the 
word they use if probability but she – he says he relies on 
the properties of the attached documents 00:00:40.  So if – if 
you have to rely on the properties of the attached document 
to get to a conclusion that it is most probably Salim Essa it 
20 
suffices to say the link between Mr Essa and Ms Daniels is – 
is giving an obvious based on the suspension letters of the 
10t h of March 20111- 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  Because they are there.  You know I have – I 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 88 of 218 
 
have noticed how quickly Mr Seleka ran to look for emails – 
the two emails that he told me he gave you about the private 
email address of Dr Ngubane.  He was very quick.  I mean 
until today Mr Seleka has not told you the authenticity of 
those further tests that were written by Ms Suzanne Daniels 
and – and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you that he is busy trying to 
get an expert to look into the issue of those letters so it is 
not something he is not pursuing; he is pursuing I know that 
he is. 
10 
MR KOKO:  I wish he could have done it as quickly as he 
has done the other two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But… 
MR KOKO:  I mean he is taking ages and I think – I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is looking into that. 
MR KOKO:  And I tell you – I tell you how I feel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Hang on.  He is looking into it 
because I am interested in it too.  I am interested in – in that 
evidence because it might be very critical.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I wanted to say this.  On the face of 
it what I think one can conclude from the concessions you 
have made with regard to what appears to be – who appears 
to have been behind this infoportal address namely it 
appears that it was Mr Salim Essa.  If that is so it would 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 89 of 218 
 
follow would it not that therefore those emails that you got 
from this infoportal address that were coming to you as 
opposed to those that were sending must have been coming 
from him.   
MR KOKO:  Chair all what I can tell you is that where I am 
even regards to the evidence that has been led I am 
relatively convinced that it is an external party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just say that again. 
MR KOKO:  I am relatively convinced that it is an external 
party.  Chair I –  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your voice goes down. 
MR KOKO:  I – I am saying having regard to the evidence 
that was led I am much more than convinced that the – those 
emails came from an external party.  Has it – did it come 
from Salim Essa I –  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure. 
MR KOKO:  I cannot – I cannot explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR KOKO:  But what I can tell you now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is external parties. 
20 
MR KOKO:  It is an external party and this is – this is where 
in – from day 1 I have told you for me you may have interest 
in Salim Essa that is – that is you.  My interest is that this is 
an external party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 90 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  Who should not be getting this thing.  That is 
what angers me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR KOKO:  I find myself being put in a position where 
Eskom documents through me ends up in the hands of third 
parties and that is what upsets me and that is what makes 
me angry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  I did not send Eskom information to a third 
party.  You know – I did not.  I sent information to infoportal 
10 
address that I thought belongs to Dr Ngubane.  But I have 
listened to the evidence here and I am convinced now and I 
am reasonably convinced that I think Dr Ngubane was being 
abused and this is actually a third party email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Out of the emails that Mr Seleka 
referred us to there is an email – one of the emails you sent 
to infoportal which would mean it would be this external 
party whoever the external party was says – ja it is at Bundle 
– Eskom Bundle 18 page 1056.  You say to the person to 
whom you are sending this email “we did not finish our 
20 
discussions about this transaction, this is what is going to 
board on 18 August”.  Now you must have been speaking to 
the external party? 
MR KOKO:  Yes but let me tell you about that transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 91 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  We discussed – Dr Ngubane, Ms Daniels and I 
discussed that transaction and it is a transaction that we are 
going to back to because I think Mr Seleka is sending you 
the wrong way.  The – the – that relates to a master vending 
transaction – 00:07:01.  It became very sensitive issue after 
I was suspended.  When I came back it was boiling and the 
storyline is this. 
 
Eskom set a procurement strategy for mast – for 
vending.  The procurement strategy was approved by the 
board on the basis of which a bid specification committee sat 
10 
and produced a specification.   
 
The specification once was approved was sent to the 
market. 
 
The 
market 
tendered 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
that 
specification that was approved that was based on the board 
on the strategy that was approved by the board. 
 
When I came back I was briefed by the – the person 
that was acting through me that there is a strategy change.  
The – the bid adjudication committee adjudicated the 
tenders.  They have appointed ten suppliers to be appointed 
but out of the blue there is a proposal from Blue Label to be 
20 
a master vendor.  So you appoint one vendor no longer ten 
vendors and the sweetener there is that Blue Label will pay 
Eskom in advance for twelve months. 
 
That was completely wrong.  You cannot do that and 
remember I was the Head of Procurement at the time.  You 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 92 of 218 
 
cannot say I 00:08:50 procurement strategy appointed – 
strategy approved the bid adjudication committee has made 
a – specifications it is approved; sent to the market.  The bid 
adjudication 
has 
adjudicated; 
you 
have 
appointed 
ten 
suppliers then out of the blue because you probably do not 
like the outcome then you want to bring a master vendor and 
Blue Label – you bring Blue Label as a master vendor, no 
you cannot.  By the way Blue Label was one of the then ten 
that was appointed. 
 
It cost so much grievance in the business that I was 
10 
not going to support it and I saw myself being suspended 
again if it came from the board.  But – but to the – to the 
benefit – and this is why I respect Dr Ngubane; I really do.  
Once he is done with you and you put the facts on the table 
and he sees them he will not interfere with you and he did 
exactly that. 
 
And that transaction never happened; not in my time.  
I heard Mr – Ms Matepo saying it happened – it never 
happened in my time I can assure you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but remember my question is; you are 
20 
writing here to the person that you under – you are writing to 
infoportal whoever the person is. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are referring to a discussion or 
discussions that you had had with that person. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 93 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this transaction. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am – what I am putting to you is that 
even the concession you have made that with what we know 
now it could not have been Dr Ngubane who was using this 
email address it must have been an external party. 
MR KOKO:  I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – who – you accept that. 
MR KOKO:  I accept that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the question is who is this external 
party that you were having discussions with because you 
must have known who you were speaking to? 
MR KOKO:  No, no, no Chair I think you – you are – you are 
confusing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  At that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja this is August 2015. 
MR KOKO:  Ja at that point I was talking to infoportal and 
understood him to be Mr – Dr Ngubane – at that point. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you suggesting that you had this dis – 
this email address you understood – well this discussion you 
had it with Dr Ngubane? 
MR KOKO:  Yes that is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But even though – even though of course 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 94 of 218 
 
you accept now that Dr Ngubane could not have been. 
MR KOKO:  No but that discussion I had with Dr Ngubane 
and Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Look it is a follow up discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  That I am asking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Because the previous discussions we had we did 
not conclude and I did not want to go to the board and 
10 
EXCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  And having fighting with nagging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you insisted this discussion was 
with Dr Ngubane. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have taken you off completely your 
course feel free to go back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To where you were and… 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 95 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No that is fine because there are 
questions arising from this now thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are being enlightened by you Mr 
Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I understood your explanation referring 
the pre-suspension letters you say were authored or the 
metadata showing they were authored by Ms Daniels and 
modified by Mr Salim Essa to be an indicator to you that Mr 
10 
Salim Essa is behind the email address infoportal? 
MR KOKO:  No, no Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are not… 
MR KOKO:  No Chair you cannot – you cannot conclude on 
the identity of the – of the owner of the infoportal address 
based on the foiled suspension letter.  You cannot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Because those are – there is no email there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that was… 
MR KOKO:  There is no email there.  You cannot.  What you 
20 
can conclude you know on the document – on the suspension 
letters is going to the properties and you will find in the 
properties that the documents were saved first by Suzanne 
and edited by – they were saved first by Ms Daniels and 
edited by Salim Essa.  That you can find. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 96 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  Ms Daniels response to you was first she said 
you can doctor it and said Mr Koko doctored it.  That was 
00:14:10 but the point I am saying to you is if – if there is 
any evidence you want about the proximity of Ms Daniels and 
Mr Essa all what you have to do is to look at the properties 
of those documents then you will find that places Ms Daniels 
and Mr Essa together.  On the other hand there are emails 
that I have conceded to you that it is an external party.  
There are emails that the – Mr Seleka says on the basis of 
10 
the disciplinary hearing from Eskom it is most likely Salim 
Essa and that we all do which I do not like to do is you 
connect the dots. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because I wanted to understand why 
you were referring to those pre-suspension letters, the 
author and the modifier in the context of infoportal because 
infoportal does not feature in those exchange. 
MR KOKO:  Ja but I am just explaining to you.  I am saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Koko let him finish. 
20 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja so because the way you were 
answering the Chairperson you were saying you can make 
the 
conclusion 
and 
you 
suspect 
who 
it 
is 
and 
the 
Chairperson tell me who it is?  And then you went to the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 97 of 218 
 
letters.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair let me… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you – you do not need belabour it I 
think if you. 
MR KOKO:  No, no, no but I have to – have to say it again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No it is fine. 
MR KOKO:  If you do not understand me.  There was a 
disciplinary hearing of Ms Daniels.  This disciplinary hearing 
of Ms Daniels concluded two things.  That Ms Daniels did 
send emails to infoportal address.   
10 
2. On the – based on the probabilities this email address 
belongs to Mr Essa.  That is one thing.  It has got nothing to 
do with the documents.   
 
Now I am saying to you if you want to know the 
proximity between Mr Essa and Ms Daniels look at these 
documents.  These documents brings them together.   
 
Right so now I know that Ms Daniels is associated 
with Mr Essa based on these documents.  And if you then 
say out of the hearing the email is most likely from Mr Essa 
then you can draw the conclusions.  You can draw the 
20 
conclusions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  Are you making that conclusion? 
MR KOKO:  Come again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you making that conclusion? 
MR KOKO:  No I am – I am – Chair I have made one 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 98 of 218 
 
conclusion.  The conclusion that I have made is that this 
email address is an external party.  That is conclusion I can 
tell you I am.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is cogent? 
MR KOKO:  It is cogent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MR KOKO:  I have come a long way to accept that.  Is it Mr 
Essa?  Then going to the probability issue – we go into the 
probability issues I leave it to you.  All that I am – all that I 
am highlighting to you is when you make those probabilities 
10 
do not forget the proximity of Mr Essa and Mr – and Ms 
Daniels based on those four documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the meeting on the 10t h of March at 
Melrose Arch we will not forget it. 
MR KOKO:  It never happened.  Mr Seleka can choose not to 
accept it.  You know Chair my Counsel will give you 
telephone 
records. 
 
We 
have 
made 
noise 
about 
the 
telephone records and the reason we have made noise about 
the telephone records it is because part of the reasons we 
have this commission was based on the telephone records of 
20 
Mr Molefe and as analysed by Professor Thuli Madensela.  
And she made – she made a conclusion that Mr Molefe while 
we were busy with the transactions on many occasions was 
calling the – the Gupta and was in the vicinity of or – and he 
visited the Gupta compound.  So the telephone records are 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 99 of 218 
 
very important in telling you the movements of people and 
that is why I and my Counsel made a lot of noise about these 
telephone records. 
 
First I was told that this commission do not have 
them.  And my Counsel went through the legal route and 
thanks to you we got them.  It turns out you have them since 
2019.  Since 2019 you had them but you told us you do not 
have them.  But those records do not tell you that I have met 
Mr Masongo at Melrose Arch.  They do not tell you that I 
have met Ms Daniels at Melrose Arch and that is the reason 
10 
why you have not been giving those records.  Those records 
you were – they were kept away from you because they are 
telling you they are – they are telling you the story that the 
meeting that Mr Seleka is excited about on the basis of the 
telephone records you cannot prove it.  So you can choose 
not forget the meeting that never happened but it never 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what of course one can – one could 
say is that if indeed – if you – if the meeting did take place 
there may have been a discussion about the suspension if 
20 
the position is that on the same day both Ms Daniels and Mr 
Salim Essa who in terms of that version were at the meeting 
with you.  If it did take place then the suspensions may have 
been discussed because it looks like at this Ms Daniels and 
Mr Essa had an interest in the issue of the suspensions in 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 100 of 218 
 
terms of the version even by – is it Mr Khoza who pointed to 
the properties? 
MR KOKO:  It is Mr Khoza and Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khoza and Ms Klein.  So if it did 
happen it means to say the least two of the people who were 
at the meeting had an interest on the subject of the 
suspensions.  That part I guess you would accept? 
MR KOKO:  I will but what I am saying to you is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  If that meeting happened between the two of 
10 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  They must not drag me in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Okay.  I think the – this might be 
the right time to take the lunch break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless you have one question you want to 
… 
MR KOKO:  It is the right time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless there was one question you wanted 
20 
to put before we go on lunch? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a couple Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So let us adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Let us take the lunch 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 101 of 218 
 
break.  It is one o’clock or one minute to one and then we 
will resume at two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is ready too? 
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes, Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, the 
first affidavit and I have – it is not an affidavit, it is a 
supplementary statement that Ms Daniels made to the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  And that is...  Sorry, I 
am switching the sequence Chair.  It is in Eskom Bundle 
8(A) from page 87.5.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we going to a different affidavit 
now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is why I say Chair, I am 
switching the sequence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just for context.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Thank you, Chair.  Page 87.5 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, start by telling us whose affidavit 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 102 of 218 
 
this is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes.  This Chairperson starts on 
page 87.2.  It is a further submission, it reads:   
“Further submissions by Ms Suzanne Margaret 
Daniels in response to the evidence presented 
to the committee.” 
 
And this was submissions to the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee.  The document is dated 18 April 2018.  
And I am only referring to a paragraph on page 87.5, 
paragraph 8 and it reads: 
10 
“In May 2015, I was acting Senior Management 
in the office of the chairman and I can confirm 
that 
I 
was 
tasked 
with 
liaising 
with 
the 
suspended 
executives 
to 
convene 
and 
I 
arranged meetings with the executives and 
directors. 
I 
was 
not 
appointed 
as 
acting 
Company 
Secretary in May 2015 as Malesela Phukubje 
was the Company Secretary at the time and my 
appointed 
as 
Company 
Secretary 
only 
20 
transpired after 1 October 2015...” 
 
That is the one aspect.  But Chair, I want to then 
go to the affidavit that we want ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one hang on.  One second.  Did you 
read up to paragraph 9 or only paragraph 8. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 103 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I only read paragraph 8 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know there are certain aspects of 
interest in that affidavit but... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we will deal with them in due 
course.  Then 8(B) on page 1082.  This is Exhibit U-18.3, 
the supplementary affidavit of Ms Suzanne Daniels.  On 
10 
page 1082, it reads – paragraph 10.  And Mr Koko, I will 
ask you to comment after this. 
“On the morning of 20 July 2015, one of 
Mr Koko’s first meetings was with Mr Johan 
Bester, 
the 
follow-up 
on 
the 
coal 
supply 
agreements. 
Mr Bester refers to this at paragraph 36 of his 
affidavit 
to 
the 
Commission 
signed 
on 
16 January 2019. 
Of significance is that Mr Koko requested 
20 
detailed 
information 
and 
documentation 
relating to new local projects...” 
 
Let me go to the next paragraph: 
“I met with Mr Koko shortly after his meeting 
with Mr Bester at this time. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 104 of 218 
 
I still held the position of Senior Manager in 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Group 
Executive 
of 
Technology and Commercial and thus Mr Koko 
was my direct superior...” 
 
Now this on the 20 t h of July 2015. 
“After the initial pleasantries, he began issuing 
instructions on the items which we needed to 
focus on...: 
 
So when you came back then Mr Koko, and I 
wish you to comment on this, Ms Daniels says she was still 
10 
holding the position of Senior Manager and I believe this is 
in 
your 
office, 
Group 
Executive 
Technology 
and 
Commercial.  Your comment on that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there are two things.  What Mr Seleka 
read on 87.5 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR KOKO:   [Speaker moves away from microphone – 
unclear.]   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you will have to bring it closer to 
you because I do not think the record ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is 87.5, paragraph 8.  What Ms Daniels 
is saying is correct.  She was not the Company Secretary.  
Mr Malesela Phukubje was the Company Secretary. 
 
I may have said she was a Company Secretary at 
that point.  I think that is what she is trying to correct.  And 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 105 of 218 
 
she is right.  That what she is trying to correct, she is 
correct. 
 
She 
was 
– 
she 
never 
came 
back 
to 
my 
department after I suspended her.  She never.  The 
paperwork may have taken longer to do but I can tell you 
know, 
from 
the 
10 t h, 
from 
the 
11 t h 
of 
– 
the 
11 t h  of March 2015, Ms Daniels was in the office of the 
chairman. 
 
The paperwork to transfer her, may have taken 
time, X time but she never came back to my office.  When I 
10 
came back she was not in my office.  I did have a meeting 
with Mr Bester on the first year I came and Mr Bester was 
– his role was General Manager of Procurement. 
 
And she – he updated me on issues around 
Primary Energy.  One most important one, which we deal 
with today, is Optimum.  I asked for the document.  He 
refused to give me.  He choose to resign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said, he – you do not mean 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Mr Bester. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   I asked for the documents and we will go to 
the details.  And let me tell you this Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought we will reserve it for that 
time. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 106 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   No, but I need to conclude – I need to say this 
because I have always wanted to say this and I did not 
want to say to the media and I wanted to say it here.  
Mr Bester is not used to a competent white guy – a black 
guy asking him for details and he says so in his affidavit.   
 
I am Engineering Graduate.  You have just said, 
I love detail.  When he gives me feedback, he expects me 
to walk away and say:  Your own baas said so.  I refused.  
I asked for detail.  He resigned on that day.   
 
And the evidence that comes out and I received 
10 
his supplementary affidavit last night.  It explains to me 
why he had to run because if he did not run, I would have 
catch up with him and I would fire him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Well, let us just 
focus on Ms Daniels, Mr Koko, so that we can get clarity on 
this.  You are saying when you came back from your 
suspension, she never came – she was never back into 
your office.  So are you saying here when she says: 
“I met with Mr Koko shortly after his meeting 
20 
with Mr Bester. 
At this time I still held the position of Senior 
Manager in the office of the Group Executive 
Technology and Commercial and thus Mr Koko 
was my direct superior...” 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 107 of 218 
 
 
Are you saying the statement is incorrect? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct.  I am saying precisely that.  I 
was not Ms Daniels’ supervisor on the 20 t h of April.  She 
had transitioned to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 20 July. 
MR KOKO:   ...the 20 t h of July.  I beg your pardon.  So – 
thank you.  She had transitioned to the office of the chair.  
I do not – I cannot tell you when her paperwork was 
concluded.  I think Eskom can do that.  But since I left on 
the 10 t h of March, I never ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 11 t h of March. 
MR KOKO:   The 11 t h of March.  I never was her supervisor 
officially.  The chairman was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And she goes on to say that you and 
her, paragraph 12, after initial pleasantries you started – 
you began issuing instructions on the items which you 
needed to focus on – he needed to focus on. 
“It was during this discussion that he began 
reading off a sheet of paper when referring to 
the transactions. 
20 
He showed me this piece of paper and told me 
that this was a list of transactions that his 
principals told him to focus on. 
At the time I assumed his principals to be the 
Eskom Board members. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 108 of 218 
 
As I indicated in my affidavit to the PC, which 
is the Portfolio Committee, the piece of paper 
which he was reading off was undated and 
inundated with handwritten notes. 
I do not know who the handwriting belongs 
to...” 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“He started going down the list when we were 
interrupted by him being called by Mr Molefe’s 
10 
office. 
During the time, I took the list and made a 
copy for my own files and record. 
When he returned from Mr Molefe’s office, he 
instructed me to ensure that his direct reports 
deliver the information that he requested. 
I left his office for my own...” 
 
So is that – what do you say about that version 
of hers? 
MR KOKO:   No, that is false. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   That is false.  I could not have – I would give 
my direct reports - ask to do things and I did not even do it 
on that day.  I did not do it on that day.  On that day, for 
me was sitting.   
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 109 of 218 
 
 
Remember, I have had – I am not sure if I 
mentioned it the last time.  I was not – I was asked to 
come back on the 15 t h of July.  I came back on the 28 t h.  
And in between I had a series of meetings, one-on-one 
with my direct reports.  And when I got into the office, that 
is when I actioned them.  That is why you see a lot of 
emails to infoportal address and these many.   
 
I cannot give an instruction of detail.  She is a 
lawyer.  She cannot comprehend that and I do not 
understand that.  I do remember the note, by the way.  I do 
10 
remember ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which note is that? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The one she says you are reading from? 
MR KOKO:   The one that is on 1084. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The note is super imposed.  Yes, on 
the next page Chair.  On page 1084 but we have it as an 
annexure 
to 
her 
supplementary 
submissions 
to 
the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee which is in the first file.  
I will give the Chairperson the page reference.  But that is 
20 
super imposed there. [Speaker in discussion with junior 
counsel – unclear.]  Page 1084.  No, ten...  No, just the 
next one.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Koko says... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Speaker in discussion with junior 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 110 of 218 
 
counsel – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko, the note that you say you 
remember, is it the one appearing at page 1084? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, you were answering a 
certain question that Mr Seleka had put and then you said 
there was something that was false but you said you 
remember this note. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR KOKO:   This note is the one that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I want us to finish that question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Ja.  No, I did not give her instructions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I did not give her instructions.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And those are the instructions 
that she says were – were to do what? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, what instructions did she say 
20 
in the affidavit Mr Koko gave? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She does not specify the details Chair 
in paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that why she says:  Mr Koko 
began issuing instructions on the items which he needed to 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 111 of 218 
 
focus on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh sorry you...  Chair, is that 
paragraph 12? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, after the initial... 
 “...he began to give instructions on the items 
which he needed to focus on.   
It was during the discussion that he began 
reading off a sheet of paper when referring to 
the transactions. 
10 
And he showed me this piece of paper and told 
me that this was a list of transactions that his 
principals told him to focus on...” 
 
So Chair, it seems it relates to that list then 
which you will find on page 1084. 
MR KOKO:   And Chair, I cannot relate this list to this 
paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think – I mean, is there anything in 
the text of the affidavit...  Well, she says in paragraph 17.  
I think that is where ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From her review of the document: 
“...the highlighted items below coincide with 
what was testified about and also coincide with 
the emails put to Mr Koko by the evidence 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 112 of 218 
 
leader...” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think you must start somewhere.  
We must go back or I think we have all lost track of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of what we are really focussing on 
here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she talks about a note in 
10 
paragraph 12, a piece of paper that she says Mr Koko was 
reading from.  And then, which she says was undated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then in paragraph 13, I think she is 
still talking about that piece of paper. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she says Mr Koko went to see 
Mr Brian Molefe and left the piece of paper.  And she says 
she made a copy for her files. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she does not seem to say anywhere 
here it is that piece of paper. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let us carry on at 14 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “At paragraph 10.11 of my  
supplementary affidavit, I point out that the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 113 of 218 
 
McKenzie transaction was Item 2 on the list 
and was assigned a value of R 10 million...”   
 
Is that R 10 million? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “...which was consistent with the  
testimony of other witness at the PC that the 
McKenzie/Trillian packet was valued at this 
amount...”   
ADV SELEKA SC:   15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “It is also consistent with Ms Matjeko’s  
10 
evidence, 
the 
transactions 
focused 
on 
deciphering(?) of large fees, rather than the 
substantive value of the work provided...” 
 
It is not clear to me that – certainly she had not 
said so far that piece of paper, a copy of which I had made 
on that day, is attached hereto marked whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, it may not be clear from 
this but she refers to her supplementary submissions to the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  There ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She attached it? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She attached it as an annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Have 
we 
got 
that 
supplementary 
affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us rather go to it.   
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 114 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is in the first file.  It is the 
Eskom...  Sorry, Eskom Bundle 18, page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Has Mr Koko been given this affidavit 
before?  Has he filed an affidavit in response? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he comes way back to you from the  
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I recognise this note from the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This note here? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I recognise it from the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us see.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the bundle and the page 
number where we will find the supplementary affidavit to 
which he attaches the note. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So, ja, that red pagination is 
incorrect.  It is Eskom Bundle 8.  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page...  The annexure is on page 
20 
87.88.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Bundle 8(A) or (B)?  Is it not the 
one where we have the A’s and B’s? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is A Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   8(A)? 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 115 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   8(A). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think where there is A and B, we 
must... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Specify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...specify, so that those who read the 
transcripts after years or months, they will know which 
ones we are talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Please repeat the page number. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the page number – let me refer 
10 
the Chairperson to the page number in the submissions, 
87.9.  Mr Koko, it is that file where you are reading 
paragraph 10 from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got 87.9. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chairperson, paragraph 10.9.  It 
says: 
“I note that this is detailed in my report to the 
Minister at pages 11 to 14. 
Mr 
Koko 
attempts 
to 
portray 
me 
as 
the 
architect 
of 
the 
payments 
to 
Trillian 
20 
Management Consulting. 
However, during my tenure as Senior Manager 
in his office, he shared details of a number of 
transactions 
where 
he 
indicated 
that 
his 
principals told him to focus on. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 116 of 218 
 
I surreptitiously attached hereto a copy as 
Annexure marked SMD-4...” 
 
Now that is on page 87.88.  And Chair you will – 
as you go there, I will read further in her affidavit – in her 
supplementary submissions.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, I am at ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   87 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...at page 87.88. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In her affidavit, she carries on with: 
“The piece of paper was undated, informal with 
handwritten notes and I accordingly filed the 
paper amongst my files...” 
 
And you will see, she talks in this affidavit she 
talks about handwritten notes been made.  She does not 
know whose handwriting it is.  So MSD-4 is exactly the 
document which is on page 1084. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Did not she say – I thought she said 
it was a handwritten note. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, they are handwritten notes and 
she says she does not know whose handwriting it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I was saying I was under the 
impression that the whole ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 117 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...piece of paper was handwritten, rather 
than typed... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I take it that if the handwriting 
was that of Mr Koko, maybe she would know?  Maybe 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The only handwriting of Mr Koko, she 
might have seen might be the signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not... 
MR KOKO:   Correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   This is your handwriting? 
MR KOKO:   This is my writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is now that has resolved, my 
question that I wanted to see the note. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the way it was in the other affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you can take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, I could...  Let me go into 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 118 of 218 
 
this because we have not finished off and I will do quickly 
on those emails again of infoportal.  Let me deal with this 
Chair.  Mr Koko will know.   
 
You see, Mr Koko talked about Online Vending.  
One of the emails at Online Vending and Mr Koko was 
saying:  I am leading the chairperson the wrong way.   
 
But you did not explain why you say I am leading 
the Chairperson the wrong way, because I have not even 
come to that email in relation to the significance of Online 
Vending.  Now maybe we can go into that now Mr Koko  
10 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Before you do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Koko.  When you say one 
of the emails talks about online banking ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Vending. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Online ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Vending? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Vending. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  That is the one that where he 
refers to discussions.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one I asked him about?  I 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 119 of 218 
 
think it is.  Ja, it was – I think it is that one ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me see whether ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...where I asked the question who was 
he talking to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So you want – you say you want 
to deal with that now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright let us deal with it now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  He said:  I have not said 
anything about it and Mr Koko said I am leading you the 
wrong way.  I do not know what did he mean by that.  The 
evidence is presented by the witnesses Mr Koko.  Chair, 
what you see from Ms Daniels’ affidavit and she links it to 
Ms Mothepu’s evidence.   
 
Ms Mothepu, when dealing with aspects or 
projects that Eskom wanted Trillian to do, refers to some of 
the items on that list of Mr Koko.  And Online Vending is 
20 
also there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if the questions you will ask in 
regard to Online Vending ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...includes questions on the piece of 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 120 of 218 
 
paper that Ms Daniels talked about in that affidavit that we 
referred to a few minutes ago. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should you not first get Mr Koko’s 
response to the version put to Ms Daniels as to how she 
came to have a copy of that?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko has said the handwriting 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is his. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us get to know where – what the 
position is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because Ms Daniels has a certain 
version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you can then continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  So Tsotsi, yes...  
I mean, Mr Koko.  We have read the version of Ms Daniels 
and she relates how she got to obtain this copy.  It was in 
20 
your office, she says, and you were given instructions in 
regard to that.  She made a copy without you knowing and 
she has disclosed this, not only here, but firstly did so to 
the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  It seems also she 
is saying to the report to the Minister.   
So 
you 
have 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 121 of 218 
 
heard her version.  Would you comment on that, please? 
MR KOKO:   Ja, I was surprised from day one in 
Parliament.  I was pretty surprised in Parliament.  This 
document, if I remember it, never arose on the day I 
attended the committee.  It came much later.  And she 
brought it to me.  She brought it to me and went with me – 
the point of interest to her and how that being handled in 
the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry when she briefed you on 
projects and then I did not hear what comes after that. 
10 
MR KOKO:   She brought it to me wanting an update on 
this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Because some of them were in my area and 
that is why I wrote on them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Giving her an update.  It is her document she 
brought it to me, she brought it to me, what is the update 
on this project.  It is not unusual.  She always comes and 
say we need update on project.  I gave you my project and 
20 
gave you my thought.  I was shocked in parliament when 
she said we discussed on that did.  We never did.  I am 
still shocked that she links this with the Minister.  I am still 
shocked that she links this with Mr Molefe.  It is a 
fabrication, the Minister has nothing to do with this, Mr 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 122 of 218 
 
Molefe has nothing to do with it.  It is her document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say she came – she brought it to 
you much later than the 20 July. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Much, much, much later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  At that time I take it she was based 
on the Chairman’s office. 
MR KOKO:   Chairman’s office, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What would be the grounds for her to 
10 
want to be updated on projects under your portfolio when 
she was not I take it your senior.  Why would she want 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it the Chairperson who would 
have sent her? 
MR KOKO:   It is normal, it is normal for the secretariat to 
ask for feedback.  Remember, I do not sit in the board.   I 
do not know what issues get discussed in the board and 
now and then she would come and say I need feedback on 
20 
this, draft a memo on this, and I truthfully draft a memo 
and it is up to her what she do with it.  I always assumed it 
is for principals.  That is what I always assumed but she is 
trying to create something that does not exist.  It is her 
document, she brought it to me, I did penned in notes, I 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 123 of 218 
 
even told her some of these projects are nonsensical, she 
must forget about them if they indeed – if it is the intention 
of the board from being - for example, the matter 
replacement 1000 megawatt, that’s nonsensical.  You 
know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was your understanding that she was 
asking for an update on behalf of the Chairperson or was 
your understanding that she was personally interested in 
the projects or both or you were not sure. 
MR KOKO:   I was not sure, I never got the impression that 
10 
she was personally interested.  I have always assumed 
when she comes to me asking for feedback and she would 
do it with other executives as well that the recipient of that 
information is the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  At that time she was not 
company secretary as yet, she was [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR KOKO:   No, she – no, this when it is charged, it was 
later on, it was not on that day, it was later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I was even not even Commercial, when she 
asked me this, some of this I did not answer, I said this is 
– I am not in Commercial, go with it to Commercial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Ja, in her affidavit – 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 124 of 218 
 
Chair, that is Eskom bundle 8(B) page 1083.  Remember 
she …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   1083, Eskom bundle 8. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom 8(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Remember she talks about this in 
the context of the meeting on 20 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And so paragraph 14 says: 
“At paragraph 1021 of my supplementary affidavit I 
10 
pointed out that the McKinsey transaction was item 
2 on the list and was assigned a value of R10 
billion which was consistent with the testimony of 
other witnesses …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so that was R10 billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, 10 billion. 
“…other witnesses at the PC that the McKinsey 
Trillian package was valued at this amount.  It is 
also consistent with Ms Mothepu’s before this 
Commission that the transactions focused on the 
20 
siphoning of large fees rather than the substantive 
value of work provided by the consulting firms.  The 
evidence of Ms Mothepu compelled me to look at 
the transaction list once again and see if there was 
any congruence.  She also testified that the emails 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 125 of 218 
 
show 
that 
documents 
were 
exchanged 
in 
July/August 2015 which was around the same time 
that Mr Koko returned to office and started sending 
off the emails that were put to him.” 
And then she says: 
“From a review of the document the highlight items 
below coincide with what was testified about and 
also coincide with the emails put to Mr Koko by the 
evidence leader.” 
And then there are certain items highlighted on the next 
10 
page, highlighted in yellow ink.   
“Duvha 3 received 5 billion.  McKinsey...” 
There is the 10 billion. 
“…funding restructure 600 million, project Lever(?) 
Anglo, load management, load management fibre 
lease cash unlocked, on line vending cash unlocked 
for 35 billion.” 
So Ms Mothepu’s evidence and Mr Koko was referring to 
her earlier, was that she interacted with Mr Koko when he 
was at Trillian Regiments.  Mr Koko, you will remind us, 
20 
she has given an email exchanged with you and that she 
said that online vending was one of the projects added to 
the proposal to be – of work to be given to Eskom by Mr 
Koko and Mr Anoj Singh.  So the project online vending 
was added to the proposal by Mr Koko and Mr Anoj Singh.  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 126 of 218 
 
The message that is sought to be conveyed, Chair, is that 
Mr Koko comes with this list and he will comment, comes 
with this list, he says my principals want me to focus on 
these projects.  Some of these projects ultimately to go to 
be done by Trillian.  When Trillian, as you will hear later, 
did not have any contract with Eskom and payments were 
made pursuant to Trillian and McKinsey.  So this was the 
mandate 
supposedly 
Mr 
Koko 
had 
to 
achieve 
these 
transactions on his return from suspension, for McKinsey 
and Trillian.  Mr Koko, is that made clear? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chair... 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that – sorry, let me complete it and 
that some of those emails, Chair, we have looked at which 
are sent to Info Portal Businessman, a third party, was in 
pursuance to this list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this list, the [indistinct] 09.10 list is Mr 
[indistinct] 09.10  list and the list I remember did not even 
have highlights on and it was not discussed on the 20 t h, it 
was not all, Mr Ness(?) must tell you what the background 
20 
to this is.   
Secondly – and I am glad we are getting to Ms 
Mothepu now.  You know one of the things that frustrates 
me is listening to this Commission which I – to witnesses 
which I think are blue eyed boys and girls telling you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 127 of 218 
 
something and you take it as a fact.  Ms Mothepu says Mr 
Singh …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, nothing is taken as fact until 
the findings are made, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Ms Mothepu says Mr Koko and Mr Singh 
added to the scope including online vending.  She has 
never shown to anything that I did there, she has never 
ever showed you and says this is what Mr Koko added 
because I did not, one. 
 
Two – and my counsel will take us – will take me 
10 
through Ms Mothepu’s affidavit because I need to go to 
those items because if you look at those items, none of 
them, none of them have to do with my position as a Group 
Executive Technology and Generation.  You are a judge, 
you are a Deputy Justice, you have got your delegations of 
authority, you do not fiddle with issues that are in a 
delegation of authority of other judges, you executive your 
delegations of authority.   
 
All the things that Ms Mothepu talks about without 
fail are not technology or engineering, they have got 
20 
nothing to do with me.  I could not - you know, in the 
context of those items I am incompetent.  I cannot have a 
decent 
conversation 
about 
insurance, 
I 
am 
just 
incompetent in that space, so I cannot.  Now she says I 
gave her people to work with.  She has never told one 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 128 of 218 
 
single name of who I talked to.  She gave you five emails 
and I want – I am going to go into the transcripts right now 
and it is a nice – it is quite interesting because in there, 
you know, tells you what her intentions is.  
 
In one of the emails she sends to Mokajima(?), you 
have read Mokajima’s email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, your PA. 
MR KOKO:   So she copies Ms Mokajima and she writes to 
Ms Mokajima and she copies me and you ask her a 
question but why do you not – if you have met Mr Koko, 
10 
why do you not write straight to Mr Koko?  She says oh, I 
remember now, Mr Mokajima is an Indian guy that Mr Koko 
introduced me to and I was working with.  You know, and 
that is the point and the reason she – she cannot even pick 
that Mr Mokajima is not an Indian guy.  She comes here, 
she wants you to believe that I gave her an Indian guy and 
her address is an Indian guy and I will go to her transcript.  
But she is lying.  I am sorry, she is.  If you read the 
transcript and you know the faces and the bodies, you can 
conclude out of that that this Ms Mothepu – and she even 
20 
says now I remember, Chair, this is what happened and 
what she remembers is a fabrication, never existed. 
 
Eskom board appointed the negotiating team to 
negotiate the McKinsey transaction.  I was not part of any 
person negotiating that transaction. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 129 of 218 
 
 
Two, the negotiations on a [indistinct] 13.34 basis 
was with McKinsey, was not with any other party.  So 
Eskom could not have negotiated with Ms Mothepu and her 
company.  We could not have done that.  I mean, I have 
seen last night and I am sure Mr Seleka will take you 
through it, where I emailed to the team in September and 
there is a reason for that, colleagues, what is the update 
on this?  If I was negotiating, I would not be sending 
emails to say what is an update because they are 
negotiating with me, I will be giving them updates.   
10 
 
So it is absolutely wrong, Chair, for this committee 
to tolerate people who come and say just trust me, Mr Koko 
changed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Koko, everybody comes and 
tells their version and we might have certain – I might have 
certain prima facie impressions but findings will only be 
made once I have heard everybody and I try not to show it, 
even I do not believe what a witness is telling me.  So it 
may be that somebody might say – somebody might think 
that I believe what a witness is telling me but I have – all 
20 
the evidence will be considered once all the witnesses 
have given their evidence.  Okay, Mr Seleka? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, can I read it?  I found the - please, I 
beg to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 130 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   I found the chapter I wanted, can I read it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, how much time do you think it will 
take to read it?  Two minutes, three minutes? 
MR KOKO:   Less than two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, you may read.  Just start by 
telling us where you are reading from so that... 
MR KOKO:   I am reading... 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is transcript of what date or...? 
MR KOKO:   I am reading the transcript of Ms Mothepu, 
page 181 of 274 ,14 January 2021, day 328. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   That is the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MR KOKO:   Right, so the Chair says: 
“Sorry, why would you address the email to him 
when he was not the addressee but he was only 
copied...” 
He is Mr Koko.  So she says: 
“I think now my memory is jogged.  Remember I 
said it was a pleasure meeting you last week?  So 
20 
he introduced me to this gentleman, I forgot his 
name and I spent 30 minutes on this proposal, so 
what I needed Matshela to be aware of is that I 
have spoken to your team but I need information 
from you and he was a gentleman from Indian 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 131 of 218 
 
descent, I forgot his name.  Yes, but it was Mr Koko 
who introduced me to him.  Yes.” 
But he is addressing my PA, Ms Mokajima, so she forgot 
about that.  She is trying to cover the story – and I will tell 
you why and I happen to know – I am an African, I know 
her background, so she cannot have – from where she 
comes from, Mokajima sounds foreign to her, so it looks 
Indian.  So she looks at it and says this think looks Indian 
and I am going to tell the judge it is an Indian.  So it is one 
of – it is the first email and that you are talking about.  
10 
Now, Chairperson, this is the type of things I am facing, 
these are not the people who are here to assist to get to 
the truth, these are people who are here to create a story 
so that you can find guilt on a crime that you later define a 
state capture.  It is hurtful. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just give me the page reference again, 
just on where you were reading? 
MR KOKO:   181, 274.  I mean, she says I gave her this 
Indian gentleman and this Indian gentleman was running 
and she communicates with her and she copies him. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  We will read, Mr Koko, and see 
how we arrive – how we come to that.  I just want to finish 
off on the emails because the travel agent, emails that you 
refer to of the travel agent, they ultimately come to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I have this file taken away for the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 132 of 218 
 
time being? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 8(B)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it can be taken away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I will be left with Eskom bundle 18. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, ja, you are going to the emails that 
we discussed before lunch. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Those emails, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Any particular one you want to 
10 
start with? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that email with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got bundle 18 in front of you, 
Mr Koko?  If you do not have then somebody can bring it. 
MR KOKO:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1088. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1088? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  1088, those are the emails 
that relates to your visa for travel, 3 x Koko family visa.  
That is on the 3 January 2016.  Now I did email you or your 
20 
attorneys the affidavit of the travel agent. 
MR KOKO:   You have emailed me a Section 25 statement 
of the travel agent. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of the travel agent. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  It is not an affidavit, it is a statement of 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 133 of 218 
 
2018, that was Section 25. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Right, it is commissioned though. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 1287 of the same bundle, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 1087? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1287. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What will I find there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You will find an affidavit of I believe is 
Ms Halima Alana.(?) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is a travel agent, as she says in 
paragraph one: 
“I am an adult female personal travel agent at 
Travel Excellence, the travel agency situated at 
Signet 
Terrace, 
Gemsbok 
Street, 
Lenasia, 
Johannesburg.  My contact details are provided.  
The facts deposed to herein are within my personal 
knowledge.” 
She writes.  She received a subpoena. 
20 
“On 13 November 2018 I received a Section 205 
subpoena which required Travel Excellence Agency 
to provide the following information.” 
Paragraph 3.1: 
“Travel records of Mr Anoj Singh… 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 134 of 218 
 
With identification number given.  And the period is 8 June 
2014 to 26 February 2017.  3.2: 
“Matshela Moses Koko…” 
With identification number given. 
“…for the period 4 January 2016 to 5 January 2016. 
Proof of payment and identification of the source of 
funds used to purchase the flights tickets, liaison 
person 
who 
was 
involved 
in 
the 
travel 
arrangements.” 
Then, Chair, in regard to Mr Koko, the relevant paragraph 
10 
is on page 1290. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, page 1290, paragraph 13 reads: 
“On 4 January 2016 to 20 January 2016 Matshela 
Moses Koko was issued with air ticket number…” 
And the number is given. 
“…travelled to Denpasar Indonesia to Dubai and 
back to Johannesburg with two other members of 
his family namely…” 
And the names are given with their ticket numbers. 
20 
“The total air tickets price for all three passengers 
was R100 000 including service fees.  The air 
tickets were paid by means of cash deposit to 
Travel Excellence by Salim Essa on 20 January 
2016.  I annex Travel Excellence tax invoice number 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 135 of 218 
 
of proof of payment as HA7.  I know and understand 
the contents of this declaration, I have no objection 
to taking the prescribed oath.  I consider the 
prescribed binding on my conscience.” 
And the affidavit is signed on 29 November 2018 at 
Lenasia.  Mr Koko, I know that at the parliamentary 
portfolio committee you had been asked about your trip to 
Dubai and who paid for it – well, in fact, they didn’t ask 
you who paid for it as much as they put to you that the 
documentation they have shows that Sahara Computers 
10 
and Salim Essa paid for your trip and most probably for 
your stay at the hotel and now we have the travel agent 
who says about your travel the payment came from Mr 
Salim Essa.  What is your comment? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman... 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Just 
remember 
 
- 
I 
think 
the 
Chairperson has been at pains to explain that to you, the 
only way to test every information given to the Commission 
is to put to a witness that information and get a response.  
So it has nothing to do with whether or not we believe what 
20 
is being said, it is just to give you a chance to respond to 
what is being alleged. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  Chairman, I am very happy that this 
comes out and it comes out this way because it exposes 
the full suite of what people are prepared to go – the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 136 of 218 
 
extent people are prepared to go to and I really hope that 
the 
investigators 
of 
this 
Commission 
looks 
into 
this 
because somebody has to be held to account for the 
conspiracy and the lie.  This affidavit has been with the 
police since 2018.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that sentence? 
MR KOKO:   This affidavit, this statement has been with 
the police since 2018 and nothing has come out of it up 
until now and nobody has ever come to talk to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say it has been with the police 
10 
since 2018? 
MR KOKO:   2018 up until today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not mean that it was deposed to 
before the police in 2018, is that what you mean? 
MR KOKO:   It is what I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   It is what I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that when you say it has been 
with the police it is like it has been staying there with the 
police. 
20 
MR KOKO:   No, no, it has not – I want to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was deposed to in November 
2018? 
MR KOKO:   Yes and nothing has come out of it and there 
is a specific reason why and I suspect the reason they are 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 137 of 218 
 
bringing it here is because we found nothing, let us bring it 
to the committee and hope Mr Koko will implicate himself.  
Let me take you very slowly through that.  On the 4 
January 2016 to the 20 January 2016 Matshela Koko was 
issued with an air ticket number and travelled to Indonesia, 
to Dubai and back to Johannesburg with two members of 
his family.  A simple check, Chair, of my travelling at home 
affairs will tell you this is false.  You know, when I was at 
the parliament and this was put to me I said to Ms 
Mazzone, I will give you my passports, and then she says 
10 
no, I do not want your passports, I will check it with Home 
Affairs.  Last night I said to my wife, should I take the 
passport with me?  Says no, just tell them to go the Home 
Affairs.  Just a simple check, this is false.  Now why would 
people go to this extent?  On the 5 January, I was at home, 
I was at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you were at home, you were at 
work? 
MR KOKO:   I was at work at Megawatt Park.  So this is 
false, that is one.  But two, the money was paid through a 
20 
cash payment.  Chair, on Friday I went to the bank to do a 
cash deposit in the bank and I got a cash deposit slip and 
my lawyer was doing something for me, I went to pay for it.  
And after I received it, it dawned on me that I must bring it 
to you.  When somebody says Salim Essa paid 100 000 on 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 138 of 218 
 
a cash payment and the proof you will find it in HA7.  When 
you go to HA7 you want to find a cash deposit slip.  That is 
a proof.  What do you find?  Let us go to HA7. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page?  What page number? 
MR KOKO:   I must find it first. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, you want the annexure? 
MR KOKO:   1315. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is 1315, Chair.  At 1315 it is a 
receipt, a payment receipt, Travel Excellence, the name to 
whom it is issued seems to be …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, at page 1315... 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One sees a document there which is 
HA7, a document written Travel Excellence and it says 
received and below the word received is the landline and 
the fax number and then there’s the postal post address 
and the street address and then it says TE number 590-
505-4595.  I am not sure which of it which is, and then it 
says name, then it says Matshela Moses Koko, and then it 
says route, and then it is written Matshela Moses Koko – 
20 
re-issue.   
Then it says ticket number, there is no indication 
justification, below that it INV number, which I guess is 
invoice number.  AS or A5 I am not sure 99862 and then 
below towards the end of the document it says amount R 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 139 of 218 
 
and then it is written 100,000, the date given is 21/16.  And 
then it says paid by, and then it says cash or card there is 
no indication and then it say EFT and then there is a tick 
under EFT.  
And then under that it is written or in that last line 
of the document, it says received by and then it is a word 
that seems to me like Elma or Galiema. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Galiema. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And then at the opposite end of that, 
there is S Essa, and that then is there is Travel Excellence 
10 
and then there is the SAPS which I assume may, I do not 
know whether it may have been used when she was 
deposing to the affidavit.  I was just reading into the record 
what one sees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    He wanted to make her a point about it. 
MR KOKO:   This is not a cash deposit slip so the money 
was paid in was a cash deposit, so you expect a cash 
deposit slip.  You find something else that canvassed for 
this one but two in the slip it says it is an EFT payment it 
20 
is no longer a cash deposit.  
Now I thought about it and I thought maybe let me 
give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it is a cash 
deposit, somebody went into the bank and then did an 
electronic transfer.  In your bundle there is Gupta bank 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 140 of 218 
 
statements so it is simple if it is an EFT and you say there 
is proof of payment, you put a bank statement, you see you 
received R100 000,00 reference Salim Essa on this day, I 
have the copies of the deposit slips that I got on Friday 
here and I will give it your lawyers this is how they look.  
This is not, you know if you go on this and they say there 
was…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    So is your story, or at least maybe one 
of your poems that you are saying this on the face of it was 
an EFT payment. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I am not saying that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I do not want to attach a meaning here.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I am just; I just want to show you…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are saying it is not proof of a cash 
deposit.  
MR KOKO:   …how I interpret it. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It says on the 4 t h of January 2015 to the 20 t h 
20 
of January 2015 I was issued a ticket to travel to Indonesia 
to Dubai and then back to Joburg, I am saying a simple 
check with the Home Affairs will tell you that is false, one. 
Secondly, the ticket is allegedly paid by cash 
payment and the proof is in HA7 1315.  You go to HA7 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 141 of 218 
 
1315 it is something else which tells you it is paid by EFT.  
I do not even know how to interpret it. 
Three, it has got an invoice number now this invoice 
number I found very interesting because the AS there is 
Anoj Singh, it stands for Anoj Singh.  If you go to the tax 
invoices…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    How do you know AS stands for Anoj 
Singh on this document? 
MR KOKO:   I am taking you there, Chair eventually, it is in 
page 1305, no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    I have got 1305. 
MR KOKO:   No, it is not, you go to 1292 you will see an 
Excel spreadsheet and in there it says Anoj Singh and at 
the bottom it is a stamp of excellence and at the bottom 
there, you have got my names there.  And then there is no 
invoice there, but I will get to that invoice.   Yes, and then 
if you go to 1314 you will find a cash slip, yes bundle 18, 
1314. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you not – what is the last page we 
missed? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Mr Barrie I think these are the, this is 
what…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well Friday, Saturday…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hang on let us not all talk at the same 
time.  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 142 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I thought the last page you gave us Mr 
Koko was 1317. 
MR KOKO:   1314.  
CHAIRPERSON:    That is the last one you gave us. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I think I understand where my counsel 
is getting confused because these documents came last 
night and I do not think he is done with it yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh, okay Mr Barrie you wanted to say 
something? 
10 
ADV BARRIE SC:    Yes, the bundle of documents we got 
on Friday was up to 1148 it is a 3116-page document but it 
stops at 1148 and I could not see regarding what Mr Koko 
refers to. What we do have is the alleged affidavit of - but, 
and I do not know whether there is a correlation there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I think Mr Koko is still answering the 
question, or is giving his comments on the affidavit from 
the person from the travel agent, saying that Mr Salim 
Essa made a cash deposits in respect of his travelling.  He 
is, I think, as I understand it, Mr Koko wants to point out 
20 
certain things that he says show that this version is not 
correct or something like that or it is a fabrication. 
MR KOKO:   It is not only it is not correct but the 
documents before me suggest a fabrication. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, so I am just saying, I understand 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 143 of 218 
 
that that is where you are going but Mr Barrie stood up 
while you after you had referred us to page 1314 but you 
had not said what you want us to look at, at 1314. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is a tax invoice and it is that number 
as AS99862. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Where about on the page is that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, to your right there is a box there 
that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Has it got a date? 
MR KOKO:   Date and invoice number.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, the invoice number there is A99862, 
Ja, what do you - the last time you were referring to the 
letters AS and you said, that is a reference to Anoj Singh 
and I asked you, where do you take that from then you 
started. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, if you go to the left of – where it says 
worked in Johannesburg Mr Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but the invoice number does not 
say AS.  
MR KOKO:   It does. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    H’m? 
MR KOKO:   It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Not on what I see, unless we have 
different pages Mr Seleka, what do you have? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, mine too does not say AS, invoice 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 144 of 218 
 
number is capital A99862. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, that is what I have to. 
MR KOKO:   Chair if the passenger on the invoice is Koko 
Moses, the other two I mentioned.   If you go to 
1315…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Page? 
MR KOKO:   1315. 
CHAIRPERSON:    1315. 
MR KOKO:   We have been there it is AS99862, it is the 
same number that is on 1314. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Except that there is no S. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, so this one is AS99862, the other 
one is Aa without the S but the number is the same. 
MR KOKO:   But the number is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MR KOKO:   But the passenger ’s name is my name. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Both the one at page 1315 has got your 
name, as well as the one on page 1311, is it not?  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    So both do have your name, the one at 
page 1311 has got your name as well as Mr Anoj Singh’s 
name.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    And I think your family members maybe 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 145 of 218 
 
mentioned?  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, so the one on 1312 and does not 
make a reference to the full name Mr Anoj Singh as is 
reflected in the one on one on page 1311 but it does have 
your name, your full name and the invoice number is 
reflected as AS99862. 
MR KOKO:   So what, you a couple of things.  She says 
the proof of payment is in here and it is a cash payment, 
and the proof of payment is not here and it is not a cash 
10 
payment is an EFT according to her and it has got Anoj 
Singh, why would Anoj Singh make my bookings. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I have never discussed…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    But when you say it has got Anoj Singh 
I am not saying Island are referring to the one of 1311 or 
1312? 
MR KOKO:   1314. 
CHAIRPERSON:    1314? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. I am sorry, when I said 1311 and 
1312 I am sorry, I think were confused whoever reads the 
transcript.  When I said 1311 I was looking at the red 
numbers, which I should not have done, I should have 
referred to - I should have said 1314.  When I said 1312 I 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 146 of 218 
 
was looking at the red numbers, I should have said 1315. 
Okay, alright you are talking about the one at 1314?  
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you are you are saying why would 
Mr Anoj Singh make a booking for you?   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
 CHAIRPERSON:    Are you basing that only on the words 
walk in, in other words, it is like somebody who just walked 
in and said can you make a booking. 
MR KOKO:   So Mr Singh walked in or made a call and said 
10 
you know book Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have never discussed my travelling with Mr 
Singh.  He has got nothing to do with my travelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, let us go to - let me ask this 
question you said that on the version of the person from 
the travel agent, you would have travelled or you travelled 
on 4 t h of January and you say no, you did not travel. You 
were at home and you were at work. 
MR KOKO:   No, no on the 4 t h  - you remember now on the 
20 
4 t h I was in Indonesia already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, on the 4 t h. 
MR KOKO:   Yes I did not travel to Indonesia on the 4 t h, I 
was there already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 147 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   I arrived, I left South Africa on the 23 r d of 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   To Indonesia with six members of my family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And came back after the 4 t h. 
MR KOKO:   And I came back on the 5 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you Chair.   Just a couple of 
things to clarify Mr Koko, at the Parliamentary Portfolio 
Committee Ms Mazzone I think had made a mistake which 
10 
you 
corrected, 
about 
you 
having 
gone 
to 
Dubai 
in 
December 2015, you said: 
“No, I was not in Dubai in 2015, you just mentioned 
and I confirmed that I was in Dubai on 3 to 5 
January 2016.” 
MR KOKO:   I was not in Dubai in 2015, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja but you were in Dubai from the 3 r d 
to the 5 t h January 2016, that is what you said there. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I think the 3 r d is a mistake, I think I was 
in Dubai ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is this a mistake? 
MR KOKO:   The 3 r d is, I think I was in Dubai on the 4 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 4 t h.  
MR KOKO:   The 4 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 148 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you do say on the 23 r d of 
December you had travelled.  
MR KOKO:   I left South Africa, I have got my travelling 
arrangement I will give them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then could she have had that in 
mind maybe? 
MR KOKO:   You see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you wanted to refer to some 
documents Mr Koko. 
10 
MR KOKO:   No I wanted to get my exact date, I know I left 
South Africa ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can have a look at that. 
MR KOKO:   And this is my frustration Chair, people read 
newspapers and go and put affidavit, and then when they 
put to me, the same thing happened to Ms Mazzone, but 
Ms Mazzone I was not in Dubai in 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No that’s fine ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   They read newspapers that there was a party 
in Dubai, I was not there, I left South Africa with my six 
20 
members of my family on the 23 r d of December at two 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it the 3 r d or 23 r d? 
MR KOKO:    23 December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 149 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   To Dubai – I beg your pardon, to Indonesia. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indonesia yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dubai is from the 4 t h of January. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, Dubai is from the 4 t h of January, which is 
then after I got my visa.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because that is – I have seen 
page 13.15 that slip we were looking at as re-issue. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I see it seems to be explained on 
10 
page 12.92 because there was a first issue, on the 3 r d of 
January 2016 and then a re-issue, which was an upgrade 
on the 4 t h of January 2016.  The last two lines in that table 
Chair.  So Koko Matshela Moses, the ticket number is 
there, date of issue is the 3 r d and it shows that you got the 
ticket desk, it shows new issue.  Is the Chair there?   And 
on the 4 t h it is an upgrade and it is a reissue, do you see 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see on page 1292 that the last two 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Entries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is Kolumso, horizontal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, oh, rows, these are rows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have Koko Matshela Moses and 
the you have and then you have got ticket number and then 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 150 of 218 
 
you have got ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Date of issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Date of issue and then date of issue is 3 
January. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Excuse me, date of issue is 3 January 
2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Your microphone is off Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, date of issue according 
to page 1292 was 3 January 2016, date of travel appears 
10 
to have been 4 January 2016, I don’t know what date the – 
no, no that is not a date, it comes up like that, but it looks 
like his route, routing here, GPS-DXB-Johannesburg I 
guess, and then there is tickets, this and so on, okay I see, 
is that what you wanted me to look at? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair, then you have new issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the first time they issue it, then 
you have a ticket amount, that’s R18 000, the invoice 
number is there, it has 988 again. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is the invoice number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Next to the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, ja, I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you go further right, amount paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 151 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hundred thousand, date paid 20 Jan 
2016, and then payment by cash deposit S Essa, which 
according to the affidavit is Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then deposit amount and they again 
indicate cash deposit R100 000.  The last line it seems it is 
an upgrade Mr Koko, is that right? And then there is a re-
issue so you start again Koko Matshela Moses, the ticket 
number, the date of issue now is the 4 t h of January 2016, 
the data of travel 5 t h January 2016 and that appears to be 
10 
the route, upgrade ticket desk reissue the amount is given 
of R32 590, the invoice number and the other parts are 
blank. 
 
But the information here Mr Koko but because she 
says in her affidavit on 4 January 2016 to 20 January 2016 
which is the date when payment was made. Matshela 
Moses Koko was issued with air ticket number and she 
gives the number and travels to then Pasar Indonesia to 
Dubai and back to Johannesburg with two other members 
of his family. 
20 
 
So the whole trip to Dubai date in terms of this 
summary on page 19, I mean 12 of 92 , seems to be 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Seleka shouldn’t you just go to 
the point, let us hear Mr Koko.    
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 152 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko are you saying that to the 
extent that the ...[indistinct] from the travel agent that you 
depose to the affidavit that Mr Seleka react to and who 
attaches these documents to the extent that she says, 
because I think it is a she, she says that her travel agent 
made bookings for you and your family members to travel 
and that the payment for either the whole travelling or part 
of the travelling was paid for by Mr Salim Essa to them, are 
you saying that that is factually, that is true?   
10 
MR KOKO:   No false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is false and you ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   And the obvious errors you can see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:  The errors are obvious. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you are not saying – or are you 
going that far, to say objectively speaking this is all false, 
or are you saying look I don’t know what Mr Essa or 
whoever may have paid into that travel agent and what he 
may have paid for, all I am saying is that I am not aware 
20 
that anybody paid for me to that travel agent, I know that I 
paid for my family, so in other words is the position that 
objectively you are saying when they say Mr Salim Essa 
paid for your trip that is factually true, you are not saying, 
well you were not there, you don’t work in their offices, you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 153 of 218 
 
don’t know who paid but if he did pay it wasn’t with your 
knowledge and you had not asked him to pay. 
MR KOKO:   No, no Chair, that would be gross, nobody 
pays 100 000 for you and you don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
MR KOKO:   Nobody pays 100 000 for you and you don’t 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am trying to make sure that we 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No, that would be ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying to be sure because you 
remember with regard to Mr Salim Essa about the emails 
you ended up with the position that says as you sit there 
you accept that the emails came from somebody outside of 
Eskom and that the emails that you thought you were 
sending to Dr Ngubane were going to somebody outside, 
but you are saying you were not aware, so that is why I am 
asking this question. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no Chair that will be – in this instance 
that will be gross. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so you say nothing like 
that happened. 
MR KOKO:  So I am saying nothing like that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I have booked, my family and I have booked, 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 154 of 218 
 
here are documents, there’s six of us we have paid 
R332 255,94.  After I received the documents from Mr 
...[indistinct – word cut] I went back to the agency we 
used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This agent or another agent? 
MR KOKO:   No, another agent that we use for travelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I said to him I have difficulty with 
commission give me ...[indistinct] I will give this to your 
colleagues.  Give me the invoice, give me copies of the 
10 
invoice and you will see there Mr Seleka has emails, you 
see the email audit trails on there, and eventually they say 
to me, and I am giving them to you Chair because your 
investigators can do better, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But let me just also get this before you 
might – you may read from the documents, this travel agent 
did you ever use it for anything? 
MR KOKO:   I don’t know her, I don’t know of her, I have 
never heard of her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the company itself, Travel Service 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I don’t know the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know the company. 
MR KOKO:   I don’t know this company but I – I – after 
receiving it I can venture one or two explanations of what 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 155 of 218 
 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I don’t know them,  I have never met them, I 
have never spoken to them, I have my records of my 
travelling plan ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:    And you never asked anybody to make 
bookings with them? 
MR POPO:   I never asked anybody to make bookings 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
MR POPO:   I have got my records here, God is always 
with Moses, I said I will find them, I have found them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, you wanted to read something 
from the documents? 
MR POPO:   Yes, so, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you read if you can just say what 
document it is and what date, and then you will make them 
available to Mr Seleka and then in due course they will be 
part of the bundle. 
MR POPO:   I must find the order.   This is an email from 
20 
my wife, Khomotso Choma, on the 17 t h of February 2021, 
your receipt 17 February 2021 correlates with the date you 
sent me the affidavit, a couple of days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POPO:   Then my wife says to them ...[intervenes]  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 156 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is addressed to whom? 
MR POPO:   To Jacobs, Johan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the travel agent? 
MR POPO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR POPO:   As discussed please send me the invoice and 
payment statement for this booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says please send me the invoice and? 
MR POPO:   For this booking, the 2015 booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR POPO:  Because I would say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR POPO:  Here are my details I mean somebody says he 
paid for the – this is what I paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Ja that is what she says 
ja. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And what is the response? 
MR KOKO:  Then I get a – my wife gets an email from I do 
not know whether it is a she or a he and this is Thomson’s 
20 
company; Vanessa [?].  She says: 
“Hi Khomotso.  Johan has forwarded your email – 
your mail to me to try to assist.  I see this dates back 
to a booking of 2015 and was done by Excel Sandton 
Travels.  What is that you are needing so we can 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 157 of 218 
 
understand your request?” 
Then my wife sends – my wife responds and says: 
“As discussed please send me the confirmation – 
send me the confirmation – “ 
Oh then they had discussions I think on the phone.  Then” 
“As discussed please send me the confirmation of 
what you just discussed with me that the records 
beyond 2019 that you cannot assist – and that you 
cannot assist for the invoice attachment.” 
Then she responds. 
10 
“As explained Mr – here Khomotso you would not 
have access to invoices of 2015 anymore we have 
changed our accounting program in December 2019 
and our previous IT say which is blocked the problem 
so we do not have access to it.” 
The reason I am giving this to you Chair is because you have 
investigated them.  They say they no longer have it.  It is 
Thompson - it is – big company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  They can engage with them to get to the details.  
20 
But what I am saying to you me and my family six of us paid 
– and it is all my blood kids – five girls; one boy we have 
paid R372. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how much did you pay them for the – 
that is the travel agent there for the trip?  I just wonder 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 158 of 218 
 
whether there is any 00:02:19 with the R100 000.00 paid 
here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair there is a big company.  I can – 
there is a break down per family member.  My ticket – my 
ticket Matshela Moses Koko was R50 015.00.  My wife was 
R50 015.00.  My son who was then was R13 280.00.  My 
other daughter Mogebeleke was R50 000.00.  My other 
daughter Fatho was R50 000.00.  My other daughter Mogade 
was R50 000.00.  My other daughter Thatho was R50 000.00.  
together it sums up R332 255.00. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Make it available to them 
they will make copies and then they will come into the 
bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In due course. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then obviously that needs to be 
looked into. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Mr Koko this question… 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Chair may I just point out something that 
pertains to the 00:03:43 and that is you will notice and I do 
not have those page numbers before me but the tax invoice 
number I see – well A99862 is the only page in this whole – 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 159 of 218 
 
in these documents that do not have the policeman’s stamp 
on it which every other page has a policeman’s stamp on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  This particular one for some reason does 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you just want to place that on record – 
what one makes of it is something for … 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I am not sure what one makes of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For another time.  Ja okay. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Very well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you said Mr Koko that you have an idea 
of how it would have come about that on your version… 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This – all of this was fabricated. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me about that. 
MR KOKO:  Now that I – I am listened – I have listened and 
have gone through this.  Remember that my visa and my 
tickets was done by Ms Daniels when I was in Dubai. Three 
members of my family came back through Doha and once my 
20 
ticket was – once my visa was confirmed then my ticket on 
Qatar Airways was cancelled and then I got a booking on – 
on another airline – a popular airline.  Now the – the 
payment for that and so for me it was very clear that the 
Qatar Airways was cancelled and they have moved the ticket 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 160 of 218 
 
to another airline and there the costs let itself off.  So – and 
the only payment I paid was the visa payment and I 
remember it was around R5000.00.  So it was cleared of [?].  
I do not owe anybody.  I paid myself.  If there is any other 
middle man that Suzanne interfered with I really want to get 
an explanation.  But besides the – the face looking of these 
documents they do not look legit.  They just do not look legit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you believe or suspect that 
somebody or a number of people may have collaborated to 
fabricate this story against you based on this. 
10 
MR KOKO:  Chair look at this document.  Just looking at this 
documents – look at this document.  I was issued a ticket on 
the 4t h to the 20t h that is false. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  If – if it is a travel agent that has done the 
booking she will know – she will go into her system and she 
would give the proper details.  She cannot get it wrong.  And 
if she is paid by a cash deposit and she pulled the 00:07:45 
just give your (inaudible) what it looks like.  We know how 
the – she will give you the right one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do the dates in the Thompson’s Travel 
Agents – well the documents from Thompson’s Travel Agents 
do they refer to the same dates of your travelling? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja from 23 December 2015 coming back on 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 161 of 218 
 
the 5t h of January. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They cover that period? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the amount is R300 and something 
thousand. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not R100 000.00? 
10 
MR KOKO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  I guess then the whole thing 
needs to be looked at. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both in terms of the one travel – travel 
agents saying one thing and then saying the bookings were 
made through us and then the one saying the same thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko please clarify on this one 
20 
because on the one – the one trip you say you were in 
Indonesia the other one you say it is in Dubai.  So the Dubai 
one I understand it to be on the 4t h – the one on the 4 t h of 
January. 
MR KOKO:  It was one trip.  Johannesburg. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 162 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  It was one trip.  Johannesburg. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Indonesia. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  Then Dubai.  Three of my members Doha and 
then back to Johannesburg.  It was one trip. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I am asking for clarification 
because at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee your 
response was you were in Dubai on the 3rd to the 5t h so you 
10 
have corrected it you say it is the 4 t h – you think it is the 4 t h 
January,. 
MR KOKO:  Yes – the – my 00:09:32 will be more factual 
than me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No sure.   
MR KOKO:  My attorney will be more factual than me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  Than that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is at the one level so that we 
understand – so if you say it was one trip throughout that 
20 
period I mean then probably reference to December 2015 
was not necessarily incorrect it was just that you were not in 
Dubai in that December but you were overseas in Indonesia. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 163 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  And this is – this is my point.  People take 
gossip on the newspapers bring it into Parliament and bring 
it into affidavits.  So the story that I was in Dubai in 
December when everybody was in Dubai it is false.  It is 
blatant false.  It is – it is added by people who are on a hunt.  
My – the records speaks for themselves. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no but I think she did ask the 
question so that you can give a response which is fair 
enough.  The other point of clarifications the emails that we 
have been going through relates to you and two members.  
10 
So there is a Koko x3. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you have been mentioning you and 
are  you saying six members or five members of your family? 
MR KOKO:  Six members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Six members. 
MR KOKO:  Three go to go through – come back through 
Doha and three go through Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is six including you? 
MR KOKO:  Six including me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh but Chair I think you need to just – so 
that the Chair can hear what you say there.  So six go 
overseas to Indonesia. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 164 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Three of the six come back. 
MR KOKO:  Through Doha. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR KOKO:  Through Doha. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They – ja they go to Doha and from there 
they come to Johannesburg. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR KOKO:  So – and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You split – the family splits. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
MR KOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So the other three then go to 
Dubai.  And this information here relates to the three. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Only, yourself, your wife and your son? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This one we are dealing with here.  And it 
is this information in relation to the three of you you say is 
20 
incorrect. 
MR KOKO:  That is correct yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The payment of R100 000.00 which is 
alleged to be made by Mr Essa you know nothing about it? 
MR KOKO:  I know absolutely nothing about it. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 165 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The email that came from Mr Salim Essa 
and forwarded it to you through infoportal it had exactly – it 
related to exactly three persons. 
MR KOKO:  Three persons yes correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and a visa which was obtained.  So 
what did you say about that email because it relates to this 
person who deposed to the affidavit? 
MR KOKO:  It is attorneys. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The name appears there. 
MR KOKO:  Yes.  It is exactly what I told the Chairman.  
10 
Remember I said my – I paid R5000.00 for the visa and it 
was arranged by Suzanne and it came on the infoportal email 
address.  That is the discussion – and that is why I am – I 
ventured 
on 
the 
explanation 
that 
I 
think 
could 
have 
happened.  I really want to understand from Ms Daniels how 
if ever this is correct I doubt it is correct because I paid for 
myself.  What is this mean?  What is this concoction because 
at the face of it it is just not right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as far as she is concerned what part 
do you say is a concoction given the fact that as I 
20 
understood your evidence you had asked her to make 
arrangements for you to – and your family members to obtain 
the visas that part? 
MR KOKO:  That is correct and I paid for it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and she made arrangements. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 166 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you and your family members got the 
visas. 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you paid R5000.00? 
MR KOKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you saying you do not know the 
details of what arrangements she made? 
MR KOKO:  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR KOKO:  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not find – you did not try and 
find out? 
MR KOKO:  I did not for a simple reason.  I paid for the trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  So the – the outcome makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOKO:  I paid for it and it makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOKO:  So there is nothing outstanding. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka do you want to take it from 
there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Koko I think – you know that Ms 
Daniels does not accept that version. 
MR KOKO:  That was Ms Daniels accepted Chair. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 167 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you asked her to arrange – you 
asked her to arrange your travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us do this.  We are at ten past 
five. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us have an understanding.  I am quite 
happy to – for us to proceed at this stage shall we say we 
would try and proceed and see where we are by what half 
past six? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with everybody? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Chair I have got… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with you? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Koko is that fine with you? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  May – maybe we would really like to see 
the original (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would like to? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  See the original of this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay yes.   
20 
ADV BARRIE SC:  And I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure arrangements can be made. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  No Mr Chair that has not happened.  You 
– on every occasion that we have come here you said you 
sure arrangements can be made between me and Mr Seleka.  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 168 of 218 
 
We cannot get any documents from Mr Seleka but we happen 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you not tell me. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  We happen to a notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the morning you got documents.  Some 
of them last night. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Ja we – we had to issue a notice in terms 
of the promotion of access to information act to get those 
cell phone records which you Sir assured us if we speak to 
Mr Seleka then arrangements will be made. So we have a 
10 
difficulty with that.  We want you if at all possible to direct 
that the original of this document be produced to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me say something that maybe I 
should have said earlier on.  I think the last time you were 
here was the time when you still have not – had not received 
certain documents and I – I undertook that there was to be a 
meeting where I would be briefed fully and I indicated that 
after that meeting the commission would come back to you.  
But what then happened which I assume you may have been 
told or may have understood is that on the Friday I think of 
20 
that week I think the meeting that I had talked you about I 
contemplated was going to happen on the Saturday if I am 
not mistaken.  On the Friday of that week I had to go into 
isolation because somebody… 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Yes, no. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 169 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that disturbed the arrangement for a 
meeting and so on. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  No, no we are not saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
subsequently 
I 
believe 
some 
documents or – were sent – 00:17:44.  The original of the 
affidavit do you have it?  Does the commission have it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair we have liaised with the other work 
stream to obtain this information so we will .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will give it… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will reach out to them to assist. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will show the original to them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  There may be that the original should 
be left with the commission but if they want to see the 
original. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no reason why they should not 
see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair can I – can I say something?  
Because every time my learned friend stands up he likes 
20 
saying things about us – he has not been given this or the 
other but he fails and this goes into the public with 
misinformation.  The submissions that he is making before 
you.  When the Chairperson first made the order that the 
parties should liaise with each other in regard to the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 170 of 218 
 
telephone records they failed to do that.  They wrote directly 
to the Chairperson and I responded to that letter and saying 
the Chairperson directed us that we should deal with each 
other to find an amicable resolution.  I said that in the letter.  
Now he cannot stand here and say he is not getting any 
documentation from us and he refers to the telephone 
records when they have already been given to him by this 
time.  And if he wants the original affidavit we will make the 
means also to get it to him and show it to him as the 
Chairperson says.  He will not be given that original he will 
10 
have to have sight of it and then we retain them.  Because 
he has been given that copy of the affidavit.  And the other 
thing is Chair I think it is – it will be proper if my learned 
friend reserves his question for re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And not to interject every time when he 
sees that the witness is in trouble. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just keep his questions and he can come 
and clarify those things when he re-examines.  We are 
20 
wasting valuable time and Chair I got a note that you have 
an engagement but I am guided by you as to the time.  We 
will certainly not finish but we will have to stop at some 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no the – I think whoever gave you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 171 of 218 
 
the note the engagement is meant to be after we are done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no it is not meant to interrupt. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The proceedings.  So I think – but in terms 
of I think Mr Koko I had just asked you whether it is fine with 
you if we review at half past six how far we will go this 
evening. 
MR KOKO:  I am happy Chair with the 00:20:38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka you are fine? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay let us take a break now for ten 
minutes.  It is quarter past – let us take a break for ten 
minutes and then we will resume. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, I 
understand 
– 
I 
understood 
you 
to 
be 
saying 
this 
information you obtained from the travel agent.  You 
obtained it when?  After you received this affidavit? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 172 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know that having looked at your 
transcript at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, that 
you were being asked about...  Chair, can I just read?  It is 
Eskom Bundle 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, as long as you tell us where you are 
reading from. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is Eskom Bundle 15(B), page 
1115. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Koko is being asked about the 
10 
travel to Dubai.  A number of your colleagues raised the 
issue of your stay at the hotel in Dubai and I want us to 
conclude this thing by making a concrete proposal on this 
particular one so that we can close it for once and for all 
but I am going to cut a long story short.   
 
Then – because you are being asked: 
“Are you then able to provide records which 
proves this committee wrong? 
If you cannot do it now, can you commit 
yourself that you will submit these documents 
20 
through the chairperson?...” 
 
Okay it loses ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that in the Portfolio Committee? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 At 
the 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
Committee. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 173 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what the person is communicating 
with you Mr Koko, you will recall, is mister – is it Tsedi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mister who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is Tsedi.  Is that how you 
pronounce it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   T-s-e ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Tsedi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he was saying:   
“We have documentation that shows somebody 
else paid for you.  Can you show us that we 
are wrong, that you paid for yourself??   
 
And then Mr Koko says: 
“I think I was supposed to be here late last 
year.  I approached them for a receipt and they 
20 
sent it to me and I will make it available.  A 
direct 
payment 
received, 
I 
will 
make 
it 
available.” 
 
And he asked: 
“By when should we expect it?” 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 174 of 218 
 
 
And the response was: 
“Tomorrow morning.” 
 
This is the 24 t h of January 2018.  Was that 
information 
provided 
to 
the 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
Committee? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct Chair.  It was provided. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we will asking for that. 
MR KOKO:   I am happy to give you again what I gave 
Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I was about to ask whether what 
10 
you gave Parliament is among the documents that you have 
made available or it is an additional document? 
MR KOKO:   It is actually in the bundle.  Because it is in 
the – it is in the Eskom Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   So the Commission has it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR KOKO:   You must go to my Eskom Bundle- my 
disciplinary bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   There you will find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And if you do not, I will give it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   I will give it but the Commission has it. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 175 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay thank you.  Chair, I want to open 
the door to moving on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so the investigators must just 
investigate the issue of there being two travel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One of which has records that suggested 
they made arrangements and received it, the payment in 
respect of the same trip undertaken by Mr Koko and his 
family members.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That needs to be investigated.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I also ask Mr Koko, whether – 
okay... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  You want to move on? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That moving on Chair, there is a 
whole lot of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you move on. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to put – mention this to 
Mr Koko.  As I understand the position with regard to any 
association or alleged association between yourself and 
Mr Salim Essa.  When it is said by Ms Daniels and 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 176 of 218 
 
Mr Masango that on the 10 t h of March 2015, each one of 
them had separate meetings with you and Mr Salim Essa at 
Melrose Arch.  Both of them are fabricating that story.  Is 
that correct? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When subsequently you received 
and sent emails using or you sent emails to the infoportal 
address and you received from them.  Salim Essa may or 
may not be involved as far as you are concerned.  At this 
stage, we do not know what the position is.   
10 
 
All you say is, it was somebody from outside of 
Eskom.  But you say Ms Daniels must have been – and you 
must listen carefully because I do not want to put words in 
your mouth – Ms Daniels must have been, once again, 
trying to get you to be associated or to be seen as 
associated with maybe Mr Salim Essa.  And...  That is two.   
 
Three, when Mr Salim Essa is send by this travel 
agent to have been involved in making payment for your 
trip and the trip of your family members.  It must be 
somebody, once again, trying to get you to be seen as 
20 
associated with Mr Salim Essa.   
 
And all of them doing so without any good 
reason.  That is – is my understanding correct that is the 
thrust of your – of the point you are making? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is period(?). 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 177 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   There is period(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When I sent information to infoportal, I 
was not talking to an external party.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what you knew? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In terms of what I knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was not talking to an external party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But two, the reason that person got me 
entangled in that mess on his or her part, it is not only to 
trap me in.  I do not think that is all of it.  But there must 
have 
been 
initially 
symbiotic 
beneficial 
relationship 
between that person and the outside who may or may not 
be Salim Essa.  It can...  What is in it for him to pull(?) in?  
What is in it?  It must be a symbiotic beneficial relationship 
between the external party and that person.   
20 
 
But I also want to add that the fact that mails 
were sent to me specifically by Ms Daniels and copies to 
this external party, shows you the extent of the rod.  It may 
have been sent to me and copied to infoportal address 
which may or may not be Salim Essa by this person who I 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 178 of 218 
 
think may have a symbiotic relationship with this external 
party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I do know that you said the 
idea that Mr Salim Essa paid for your trip through this 
travel agent, Travel Excellence, is false.  But the one 
about the emails, you are not saying Mr Salim Essa was 
not involved.  All you are saying is, it was an external party 
and you did not know at the time that it was an external 
party but you accept now that it was an external party? 
MR KOKO:   I say much more but you are correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But I say there is a proven link. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Between Salim Essa’s Gmail address and the 
infoportal email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   That link is proven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.   
MR KOKO:   So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, ja.  No, you are right.  You are 
20 
right.  You accept, as you sit there now, that that link is 
there? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that...  I guess I am trying to be very 
careful not to put words into your mouth.  So as you sit 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 179 of 218 
 
there, you accept that the link involving the infoportal 
address and Salim Essa is there? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I am not saying it is Salim Essa.  I am saying 
the link is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The link.  Ja, ja, ja.  It is – it is just 
interesting when one looks at this, at least at this stage, 
you know, there is still more evidence to be heard and the 
investigation about the two travel agents, both claiming to 
10 
have 
made 
arrangements, 
travel 
arrangements, 
you 
received payment.   
 
It is like, if it is true, it is like Mr Salim Essa was 
following you.  [laughs].  It is like there is – if the version – 
if the other version that you rejected were true.  It is like 
maybe 
he 
got 
you 
involved 
in 
the 
meeting 
on 
the 
10 t h of March.   
 
Then he started sending emails – I assume – I 
cannot remember whether you started – you initiated the 
emails or the person, the external party, as we – as you 
20 
know it now, was the one to initiate.   
 
Then there were those emails and then now on 
the version that you reject, if he seems to want to pay you 
for your travelling in circumstances where you have not 
asked.  It is like his – if that version is correct, it is like he 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 180 of 218 
 
is just following you.   
 
You know what I mean?  You might not be able to 
comment.  I am just sharing with you what is going on in 
my mind. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no.  I hear you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   I have told you I have no relationship with 
Mr Essa.  I have never met with Mr Essa or corresponded 
to Mr Essa telephonically or otherwise in 2015.  I have 
never done that.  I have met Mr Essa in February – after 
10 
the 10th of February 2016.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   And I have met him, I think twice again, after 
releasing(?) my – it is in my affidavit.  I have never met 
Mr Essa alone.  No.  I meet – I used to meet Eskom 
suppliers.  I used to go to their offices and there is nothing 
wrong with that but I would never do it alone.  I would 
never do that alone.  There is nothing prohibiting me from 
doing that.  It is just an awkward position to do.  So I have 
never done that.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Daniels has testified, and I 
know you would have listened to this or watched it, that 
after 
her 
appointment 
as 
the 
Company 
Secretary, 
1 October 2015, she met Mr Salim Essa at Eskom premises 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 181 of 218 
 
as she was passing.   
 
And Mr Salim Essa congratulated her on her 
appointment as the Company Secretary and told her that 
he was having a meeting with you.  He was coming to see 
you, on that occasion.  Your response? 
MR KOKO:   Once again, I have never met Mr Salim Essa 
in 2015, not at Megawatt Park, not anywhere. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  I know that your answer to the 
Chairperson or explanation to the Chairperson about you 
attending to suppliers’ offices is in fact in relation to 
10 
Trillian.  You attended the offices of Trillian in Melrose 
Arch.   
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes.  I am hesitating because I do not 
have it clear in my mind when the transition happened to 
Trillian but, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  And ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   The date in my submission.  The date in my... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You mean, your affidavit or your 
submission? 
MR KOKO:   In my affidavit. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. Well, I have picked that up, not 
from your affidavit but from your parliamentary testimony 
where you said – you were being asked about Mr Salim 
Essa and Trillian and McKenzie.  And you mentioned that – 
you were asked specifically whether you went to their 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 182 of 218 
 
offices.  You said yes.  You did not put a date to it.   
 
You mentioned:  They were at Megawatt Park 
providing a workshop.  And you went to their offices 
because you meet with suppliers.  And the question was:  
But if you say the services there were to render were 
falling outside of your department, why would you have to 
go to meet with that supplier? 
MR KOKO:   I have met with Mr Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And your response was:  It is because 
you are interested in the BEE component of the suppliers.  
10 
I can find the ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Oh, no, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we can go ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   I recall that, yes... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I did not see you indicating there 
that you have gone to those offices, not alone, with 
somebody.  The – your version seems to be that it was you 
who had gone to their offices to meet with the supplier.   
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you know, I have kicked myself in the 
foot many times when this topic comes because – and I 
remember very clearly, it was a meeting late in the evening 
in Parliament when an Economic Freedom Fighter MP, EFF 
MP said to me:  You are having secret meetings with the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 183 of 218 
 
suppliers.   
 
I was livid and irritated because that is not what 
I said.  The interesting part about that is that that comment 
was taken out of the parliamentary hearing and it had been 
highlighted that Mr Koko met Trillian – had secret meetings 
with Trillian and had therefore had improper relationship 
with Trillian.   
 
That is not what I meant Chair.  It is not what I 
meant.  If they have asked me more details about the two 
of them who I was with, I would have told them.  I actually 
10 
told them – I think I mentioned the workshop we had at 
Trillian in my answering ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   At Megawatt Park.  You said it was at 
Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Uhm...  I – the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let me for the benefit of the 
Chairperson.  Chairperson, let us go back to Bundle 15, 
which is Bundle 15 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would I need to go there or you just 
want for the reference? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you may ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   IO need to go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You may want to see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 184 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat what bundle, what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Repeat the page number? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The bundle and the page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, that is Eskom Bundle 15(A), page 
1112. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uhm... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1112.  1, 1, 1, 2.   
CHAIRPERSON:   1112? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
MR KOKO:   [Indistinct] [microphone not switched on.] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Is that it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, 15(B).  I beg your pardon. 
MR KOKO:   15(B). 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
the 
transcript... 
 
Sorry, 
Chairperson.  The transcripts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She is giving me the wrong page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the – these files are forever 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She did not change it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...increasing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 15(A)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   15(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not ...[intervenes]  
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 185 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   She gave me A.  15(B), 1112? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1112, Chair.  It is an exchange with 
Mr Dlamini, right at the bottom of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is at the Parliamentary Inquiry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Dlamini is asking: 
“Do you know Salim Essa’s offices?” 
 
Mr Koko says: 
“I do.” 
10 
 
Mr Dlamini says: 
“In Melrose, you have been to his office?” 
 
Mr Koko says: 
“I have visited him, yes.  I have been to his 
office.” 
 
Mr Dlamini then asked: 
“What were you doing in his offices?” 
 
Mr Koko says: 
“We discussed the Trillian payments.” 
 
Mr Dlamini: 
20 
“What position were you holding at that time 
when you went to their offices to discuss 
Trillian?” 
 
Mr Koko: 
“I was Group Chief Executive for Generation.” 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 186 of 218 
 
 
Mr Dlamini: 
“And 
that 
contract 
was 
under 
your 
department?” 
 
Mr Koko: 
“No, it was not.” 
 
Mr Dlamini: 
“So how did you leave your office at Eskom 
and go to Melrose to meet Salim Essa about 
the contract that is not yours?” 
 
Mr Koko: 
10 
“We 
had 
a 
workshop 
with 
McKenzie 
and 
Trillian at Megawatt and we met the CEO of 
McKenzie that day.  And through the CEO of 
McKenzie, we met him and the reason that I 
met him is because I am interested in all the 
BEE partners of the big suppliers.  They raise 
the issue of payment and I said no.” 
 
Mr Dlamini: 
“You had a workshop with McKenzie and 
Trillian at Megawatt and you met the CEO of 
20 
McKenzie and you leave the workshop to go 
and meet someone in Melrose.  Is that the 
norm on an operation that does not sit within 
your department?” 
 
Mr Koko: 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 187 of 218 
 
“I mean they were suppliers.  That is nothing 
unusual.” 
 
And Chair it goes on but I will stop there.  Let 
me see if I need to go any further.  So Mr Dlamini says: 
“Okay so you have visited your suppliers.  
What were they supplying you, McKenzie and 
Trillian?  They just what?  What?  And they 
were ready to pay you.  What were they 
supplying you?” 
 
And then I think that should be Mr Koko: 
10 
“He had a project in Megawatt Park.  McKenzie 
has been in Megawatt Park since 2011.  In 
fact, earlier than that.” 
 
Yes, so.  Mr Koko, a couple of things from here.  
One is that – is the emphasis on the I.  I have visited him 
as opposed to we, which bears on the explanation earlier 
that you have never gone alone to the suppliers.  You have 
made sure that you go with somebody else.   
 
So how do we understand this part which seems 
to be not in congruence with that explanation? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, and this is why I said I was kicking 
myself in the foot because I did not go alone.  On two 
occasions I can remember which I have referenced in my 
submissions to this Commission in my affidavit...  I 
generally do not go alone – I have never gone to the 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 188 of 218 
 
suppliers alone.   
 
And that is why even – if you see submissions 
from Mothepu and others, they will tell you:  If we meet Mr 
Koko, he brings this guy.  He brings this guy.  We never 
met Mr Koko alone.  I just do not do it.  It is generally not 
me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you done? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Number two is, when exactly was this? 
MR KOKO:   The first time, I can tell you the exact 
10 
proximation.  It was after the 10 t h of February 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay when was the workshop? 
MR KOKO:   It was on the same day, actually. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   It was on the 10 t h of February.  That is why I 
met again.  We had a press conference and then we had 
the workshop.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Trillian was never a partner to 
McKenzie. 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  And the significance because the 
20 
date of 10 t h of February is quite important because it is the 
10 t h – it is the date in the afternoon after the press 
conference and the workshop that Ms Coetzer came to see 
me with an invoice of R 30 million for me to pay Trillian.   
 
Again, you will see in her affidavit she says 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 189 of 218 
 
when she came to meet me, I brought back Mr Mabelane.  I 
brought with me Mr Mabelane.   
 
And interestingly, on that day, I made sure I met 
her in a public space.  So I met her in the foyer.  So we sat 
there on the sofas in the foyer.  And she asked me for 
payment.   
 
I said to her I understand why you – Trillian 
wants to be paid directly by Eskom but I cannot.  I cannot 
because we do not have a contract with you.  There is no 
reason why we should pay you.  We will pay for the 
10 
services done, McKenzie.  You have a relationship with 
McKenzie, you do not have a relationship with me.  So I 
cannot pay you.   
 
And Ms Coetzer had put it in an un-doctored way 
and I agree with her how she put it.  And I agree with you, 
we did not have a contract with... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, that does not address the 
question I am asking.  I think your answer was sweet and 
short, correct, that Trillian was never the BEE partner to 
McKenzie? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So then my next question is.  Why 
did you have to go to their offices that you are interested 
in the BEE partners of the suppliers? 
MR KOKO:   Quite simply.  I have done it before.  And 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 190 of 218 
 
Trillian was introduced to me in Eskom as a BEE partner of 
McKenzie.  So I would interact with them in that manner.  I 
was...  SAGA arranged a meeting after the 10 t h as a follow-
up to the meeting I had with Ms Coetzer at Megawatt Park, 
and when we ended up at – and I went, and I saw nothing 
wrong with going there, it is a business partner.  When we 
go there, they raise the issue of payment again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think part of the question Mr 
Seleka is asking or has asked which I am interested in, you 
just find yourself ending up at Trillian’s offices when you 
10 
did not intend to go there or do you leave Megawatt Park 
with a clear intention that you are going to Trillian offices? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, I left Megawatt Park with the clear 
intention of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Going to Trillian offices. 
MR KOKO:   Trillian, there was no decoy.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   There was nothing.  Let us meet at Melrose 
Arch at Trillian’s offices to discuss payment issues and 
contra scope.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But precisely what Mr Dlamini in the 
portfolio committee was asking is something I am trying to 
understand too.  You at Eskom are not the person involved 
on this issue of this payment, you are not involved in the 
transaction to which this payment relates, how do you 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 191 of 218 
 
decide to go to discuss that issue at Trillian’s offices? 
MR KOKO:   Good question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Instead of them asking the right person 
to have a meeting with them to discuss that. 
MR KOKO:   Good question, good question and that is why 
I took the Commercial person with me and the project 
manager with me.  The misconception that you see a lot is 
that the biggest scope, the biggest scope of McKinsey work 
was in technology and generation so people always 
thought I am in charge but the Commercial do the 
10 
transaction and once there is a contract then we use the 
contract but everybody thought Mr Koko is in charge and 
when we went there, I went to that meeting with one mind, 
one mind only, to kill this payment issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but as I understand the position 
unless you tell me that I misunderstand, why do you go to 
kill this payment issue when it has got nothing to do with 
you?  Why do you not let people who are connected with 
that transaction go there? 
MR KOKO:   I did, Chair, I brought the people who were 
20 
connected with the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I mean go there alone, not without 
you because you must be having a lot of your own business 
schedule with matters that fall within your portfolio. 
MR KOKO:   Because part of what was going to be 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 192 of 218 
 
discussed was a scope that was in my area. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was – part of what was to be 
discussed was what? 
MR KOKO:   Was the scope. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   What was being done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR KOKO:   Was in my area. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was that, what was to be done, 
the transaction? 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, it was not – what the – the contract with 
McKinsey, the design to cost one had different cost 
element to it and one of them was to get Generation to 
give to its cost, that is why we call it a design cost strategy 
and that was Generation’s part and that was led by 
McKinsey and that is why I met them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are moving from Megawatt Park 
with them, as I understand it, to go to Trillian, why do you 
not finalise the discussion here? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  No, Chair.  The – Wickus was in 
20 
the meeting, was at Megawatt Park, the Trillian guys were 
not at Megawatt Park.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I was under the impression that Trillian 
people were also in the workshop – was it a workshop? 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
No, 
no, 
no, 
the 
McKinsey 
people 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 193 of 218 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Only McKinsey were in the workshop. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Trillian people were not there.  We went 
to see the Trillian people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so – and whose idea was 
it that …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   It was Wickus, it was McKinsey’s Wickus. 
CHAIRPERSON:   McKinsey people who said let us go to 
Trillian offices? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you say that they said the 
purpose for going there was to discuss the payment? 
MR KOKO:   Payment and the transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the transaction that you say related 
to your portfolio? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, design to cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Are you able to give more details 
what transaction that was that related to your portfolio? 
MR KOKO:   So they have looked at different issues in 
Generation but the first one, the biggest cost rival in 
20 
Eskom Generation is what we call blank(?) unavailability, 
we call it energy availability but you get it under control, 
your cost collapses and that is a task I gave them for the 
fleet(?) and we did a case study at Majuba power station 
and they started focusing at Majuba power station.  So that 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 194 of 218 
 
what it was all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, a couple of 
issues again.  Your response to the parliamentary portfolio 
committee says not just McKinsey had a workshop, it says 
we had a workshop with McKinsey and Trillian at Megawatt, 
so it is both McKinsey and Trillian at Megawatt. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the people at Megawatt for Trillian were 
– maybe I should correct that, they were very junior 
people, they were, you know, in engineering terms we call 
10 
them appies.  They were appies, they were not discussing 
– there was no CEO of Trillian, for example, at Megawatt 
Park.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was not correct to say there were 
not Trillian people at Megawatt Park, there were but you 
say there were junior people. 
MR KOKO:   They were very junior people, they were 
appies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Number two, Ms Goodson’s 
affidavit about the meeting of the 10 February 2016, is that 
20 
the meeting was arranged by Mr Salim Essa for her to 
come to you at Eskom Megawatt Park which is what 
happened.  She met with you there about the invoice that – 
or a payment that Trillian wanted to be paid directly to 
them.  So that meeting about the payment was there at 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 195 of 218 
 
Eskom, correct? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So why did you then have to go to 
Melrose Arch again after that? 
MR KOKO:   Because, Chair, I said there was a follow-up 
meeting after the meeting of the 10 t h, one.  Two, I do not 
know who arranged the meeting for Ms Khusela  I deal with 
it in my affidavit.  For all I know, Ms Khusela was in the 
press conference that we came from, I think she walked 
with us from the press conference.  I do not know who 
10 
arranged that meeting when I said no.  Clearly when she 
went back to her principals they arranged a follow-up 
meeting with McKinsey and they added other topics which I 
found of interest and I took my people to go with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but what I am saying to you is or 
trying to understand from you because you have already 
refused Ms Goodson’s request which is actually Mr Salim 
Essa’s 
request 
for 
a 
payment 
to 
be 
made 
directly 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   It was not Mr Salim Essa’s request, it was Ms 
20 
Goodson’s request. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Koko, let Mr Seleka finish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is Mr Goodson’s version because 
she did not come there on her own, the meeting was 
arranged, she says in her affidavit, he met with you to 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 196 of 218 
 
convey the request of Mr Salim Essa for a payment to be 
made.  You – we know from you and her that you said you 
were not going to make the direct payment, so if you 
“killed” the payment issue in that meeting, what was the 
need for you to go to Melrose Arch? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, I said not Ms Goodson, the meeting 
did not end well and I walked away quickly(?). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What do you mean by that, sorry?  That 
it did not end well? 
MR KOKO:   She says in her affidavit – she says the same 
10 
in her affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but it is not because of that 
meeting, she says she broke down because she felt the 
McKinsey people were sideling her. 
MR KOKO:   That is what I mean, the meeting did not end 
well in that meeting.  The meeting I was with her, the 
meeting did not end well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please, Mr Koko, can you explain what 
you mean by the meeting did not end well? 
MR KOKO:   Because she cried in the meeting. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For what reason? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me make sure that follow this 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Does not matter why she cried. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, you referred to a person that 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 197 of 218 
 
you said is giving or has given a version about Mr Essa’s 
request I think to Mr Koko for payment, who did you say 
that person was? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Goodson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Goodson? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Bianca Goodson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in terms of her version when was 
that, when she made that request on behalf of Mr Salim 
Essa to Mr Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The date of the meeting is the 10 
10 
February 2016, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   10 February, okay.  And Mr Koko you 
accept that there was such a meeting with her? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you accept that she was there 
to convey a request that payment be made to Trillian? 
MR KOKO:   A request from who? 
CHAIRPERSON:   A request for you for payment.  I am 
checking the facts. 
MR KOKO:   No, I do not accept that, she never 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not accept that. 
MR KOKO:   I do not accept that she was there to convey 
request. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
what 
on 
your 
version 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 198 of 218 
 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   She came to ask me to pay for the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was there to ask you to pay for an 
invoice? 
MR KOKO:   To pay Trillian directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that previously sent an invoice. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you refused.   
MR KOKO:   Well, I told her why it cannot be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  And you say at the end of 
10 
that meeting she cried. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why was she crying?  I think you have 
explained that, I just want to make sure. 
MR KOKO:   Why? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, why. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, remember I said I met her in the public. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, she is the one that you met in the 
open? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   From the beginning I did not feel comfortable 
meeting her in my office because she – I met her once or 
twice but the person I met on that day was not normal 
person. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 199 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did not appear to be the way you knew 
her. 
MR KOKO:   She did not appear the way I know her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   That is why I call Mr Mabelane and I called – 
and we met outside.  We had a very cordial fruitful 
productive conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Conversation? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On that day? 
10 
MR KOKO:   On that day.  I understood her problems and 
her problems were not unique, I have heard them before 
and she had taken them quite seriously and she clearly 
was hurt by what she was going through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that personal stuff? 
MR KOKO:   It was work-related. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was work-related. 
MR KOKO:   It was related to how she felt she was treated 
by McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
20 
MR KOKO:   And over and above her asking for the 
payment to be paid she opened up and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On work-related issues. 
MR KOKO:   On work-related issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 200 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   On me and I could hear her, I could 
emphasise, I could sympathise with her and I committed to 
her and – but at the end I think she just could not take the 
pain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And that I am saying it did not end well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  But the not ending well had 
nothing to do with the issue of the payment …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was personal stuff. 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, no, it had nothing – the payment had 
nothing to do with this, it is just what she was going 
through in her relationship with McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So, for example, I asked her, we have a 
contract with you – and we had a contract with them then, 
the least for me, as a BEE partner where you are 
meaningfully engaged by McKinsey and at that point 
emotionally she took a dip as she was trying to list where 
she should be involved and she was not involved.  I even 
20 
asked her are you involved in primary energy?  Are you 
involved in this, are you involved in this and her answers 
sent her into a negative pain and eventually it was not 
nice.  So I walked away, politely, I did not just – I did not 
just… 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 201 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I made sure she does not [indistinct – 
dropping voice]   But that is what happened on that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that what made you 
uncomfortable to meet with her in your office was the way 
she looked? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of you thought she was not her 
usual self? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  She – remember we used to have a  - 
10 
you do not remember, we used to have steering committee 
meetings and she is a very pleasant person, she is very 
pleasant but that day she was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am just trying to understand, if you 
are used to meeting with somebody in your office and she 
is a pleasant person, generally speaking. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, I have not met her in my office 
actually. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh, 
you 
have 
never 
met 
her 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR KOKO:   I have never met her, I do not recall her 
meeting in my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, I though you said you decided 
on that day that you did not want to meet her in your office, 
you wanted to meet her outside [inaudible – speaking 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 202 of 218 
 
simultaneously] 
MR KOKO:   No, I decided that on that day I am not 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you had never met …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I have never met her in the office, that would 
have been the first day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Had you met her in a 
boardroom within Eskom? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, we had, yes, yes, yes and that is why I 
know her problem. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but on this occasion you did not 
even want to be in a boardroom with her. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wanted to be outside. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you, Chair.  Ms Goodson is 
yet to testify, Chair, but obviously Mr Koko having been 
provided with her affidavit has addressed those – Ms 
Goodson’s averments in his affidavit and I would just like 
20 
to read passages from her affidavit.  I will read them on 
record because Mr Koko knows them.  She writes – 
because it is in another Eskom bundle 14, says: 
“Essa had arranged for me to meet with Matshela 
on 10 February 2016 at 14.00 to discuss issues that 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 203 of 218 
 
I was encountering with McKinsey.  My working 
relationship with the McKinsey partners had become 
strained as I felt that TMC…” 
Which is Trillian Management Capital. 
“…was not being included in decision-making in 
relation to the Eskom programme.  At that time I did 
not understand the resistance on the 
part 
of 
McKinsey to include TMC in decision-making.” 
Then there is a paragraph 32.4: 
“Once the meeting was confirmed I was instructed 
10 
by Angel on behalf of Essa to convey a message to 
Matshela articulating Trillian’s request that invoices 
are submitted to Eskom directly and paid directly to 
Trillian not via payment from McKinsey.” 
So this is where I am saying on her version the request 
was coming from Mr Essa, Salim Essa.  And then she goes 
on to say: 
“I met Matshela in the executive off of Megawatt 
Park and we had a discussion in the open lounge 
area.  Matshela requested that Mabelane join us.  
20 
Matshela enquired about TMC’s representation on 
the various modules.  I gave him feedback.  He was 
concerned there was representation on Primary 
Energy work stream and wanted to know what I was 
doing about it. Given my background in the mining 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 204 of 218 
 
industry I told him that I would be involved directly.  
However, my involvement in this work stream did 
not materialise.  When we spoke about TMC direct 
invoicing to Eskom, as I had been instructed to do, 
Matshela responded that he understood TMC’s 
request to invoice directly but could not support it.  
Simply put, there were no contracts in place 
between Eskom and TMC.  At some point I cried in 
front of Matshela and Mabelane, my emotion was 
driven by relentless altercations with McKinsey 
10 
team.  Matshela and Mabelane displayed empathy 
towards my engagements with McKinsey and gave 
me the sense that I was not crazy.  I found it 
difficult to compose myself so the meeting was 
short.  I returned home and told no one about my 
breakdown apart from my family.  At 8 a.m. the next 
morning Angel called and asked why I broke down.  
He 
was 
told 
by 
Essa 
who 
was 
informed 
by 
Matshela.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just say those last two 
20 
sentences? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“I 
returned 
home 
and 
told 
no 
one 
about 
my 
breakdown apart from my family.  At 8 a.m. the next 
morning Angel called…” 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 205 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which will be the 11 February 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“…Angel called and asked why I broke down.  He 
was told by Essa who was informed by Matshela.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who was – is it Angel or Angela? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Angel is Clive Angel of Trillian, Clive 
Angel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Clive Angel? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So what is striking there, Mr 
Koko, is the basis of your refusal to pay McKinsey directly 
– Trillian, I beg your pardon, that they did not have a 
contract with Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct but Chair, I need to comment 
on what you read. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR KOKO:   The only person I talked to after the meeting 
of the 10 t h was Mr Sagar.  I gave him feedback on the 
meeting I had with her, I have met your subcontractor and I 
20 
agree with her on the following issue.  That is all.  I never 
talked to any other person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one you say you spoke to, you said 
what is the name? 
MR KOKO:   Sagar, Mr Sagar. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 206 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  S-a-g-a-r. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  He was a McKinsey director, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes, that understanding on your 
part that Eskom did not have any contract with Trillian, it is 
a well-grounded understanding for your refusal to make a 
payment but it still begs the question – and I am sorry, I 
am going back to it, but why did you then need to go to 
Melrose Arch to visit Mr Salim Essa and talk about 
payments? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Because I did not see anything wrong in doing 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I am not saying it is wrong or right, 
I am asking you why after having given a well-grounded 
reason why you cannot pay Trillian directly that you still 
see the need to go to Trillian with whom you have no 
contract, as Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   But they are subcontractor of McKinsey, you 
do not understand, they are subcontractor of McKinsey, 
they are on my site, they are working on my site. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so what does that make? 
MR KOKO:   That is why I had met Goodson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is why? 
MR KOKO:   That is why I met Goodson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no, no, why did you have to go to 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 207 of 218 
 
Trillian offices at Melrose Arch . 
MR KOKO:   Because, Chair, I did not see anything wrong 
in doing that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but it is not a question of right or 
wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us look at it.  The payment that Ms 
Goodson talked to you about was a payment that was, as 
far as they were concerned, meant to be made to Trillian, 
is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Trillian had not contract with Eskom, is 
that right? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Trillian have a contract with 
McKinsey? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And McKinsey had a contract with 
Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Trillian was a subcontractor of McKinsey. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The payment that there were looking – 
okay, the payment arrangement in terms of the subcontract 
between Trillian and McKinsey, one would expect, if when 
they are a subcontractor, that it would be a matter between 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 208 of 218 
 
McKinsey and Trillian and not Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be correct. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So how did it come about that they were 
approaching Eskom for a matter that they should be 
approaching McKinsey?  What was your understanding of 
why you were bothering you about this issue? 
MR KOKO:   I was familiar with what was happening, it was 
happening not only with Trillian and McKinsey, it is still 
10 
happening today, where you have big suppliers, Eskom has 
got a requirement of supply development, they subcontract 
to the big guy and it is nice at the beginning and when 
things go wrong, that is who they go to first, they come to 
Eskom.  The supplier development programme of Eskom is 
full of these problems and Eskom executives engage with 
the subcontractors to understand what is going on and 
where they can help they will help, where they cannot, they 
cannot.  It is nothing unusual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you say when things go wrong, 
20 
I take it you mean when the main contractor does not pay 
them? 
MR KOKO:   Generally, and I have seen this happening 
many times, the main contractor at Eskom and these 
subcontractors starts having their own problem. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 209 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
main 
contractor 
and 
the 
subcontractor.  
MR KOKO:   Yes and their BE partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   There starts to be a fall out for whatever 
reason.  And the BE partner feels powerless in this 
relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And where do they run to?  They go to Eskom 
and say, you know, you have awarded this guy a contract 
10 
on the basis of this specification and he is not playing ball, 
please help us.  Generally what Eskom does, where they 
can mediate, they will do, but they do not get involved in 
the contractual issues.  Happens often and all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you went to that meeting at Trillian in 
that context. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you do the same with McKinsey? 
MR KOKO:   Same what at McKinsey? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you go to McKinsey to talk about 
payments? 
MR KOKO:   McKinsey did not raise a payment issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   McKinsey did not raise a payment issue. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 210 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe let us start this way.  Did 
McKinsey ever have issues or complaints of payment 
against Eskom? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, they never did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   They never did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at the meeting at the Trillian offices 
was McKinsey represented as well? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was the client that is Eskom, the 
main supplier, that is McKinsey. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subcontractor Trillian. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, correct.  And this problem, Chair, are 
normally – they normally arise from the BE guys, not from 
the main guy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   The main guy dictate terms. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  We will come to the 
details of McKinsey/Trillian, Mr Koko, because we know 
from the evidence that in fact the SLA, service level 
agreements/MSA, 
master 
service 
agreement 
between 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 211 of 218 
 
Eskom and that was supposed to be the agreement 
between 
Eskom 
and 
McKinsey 
had 
some 
suspensive 
conditions and CDH advised that it appeared that those 
conditions 
had 
not 
been 
fulfilled 
and 
therefore 
the 
agreement never came into being, which means there was 
no agreement as a matter of fact or law between Eskom 
and McKinsey. 
MR KOKO:   Chair there was an agreement that I signed, 
so I don’t know what Mr Seleka is talking about, I signed a 
contract with McKinsey for R101million in September, a 
10 
valid contract and till today I still think it is valid.  The MSA 
I cannot comment to the MSA but I signed a contract with 
McKinsey for R101million and the contract that I signed 
had nothing to do with CDA so there was no conditions, 
suspensive conditions whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    H’m.  What was that contract? 
MR KOKO:   Contract designed to cost it was a 101million 
contract, 101million contract signed in September 2015, I 
signed that contract, it was signed by me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    You’re calling out? 
20 
MR KOKO:   I beg your pardon out, you are going to take 
me to task for this.  I signed the letter of award. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter of award? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 212 of 218 
 
MR KOKO:   The contract was signed by somebody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But the letter of award was signed by me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, what was it for? 
MR KOKO:   That is for the designed cost, so Chair what 
happened is this ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:    No I want to get that, design costs. 
MR KOKO:   Designed to costs yes, costs, yes I think I 
have seen different terms used to it, I think in certain 
10 
documents they call it a business plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And you signed it September 2015. 
MR KOKO:   September 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he said somebody else signed it. 
MR KOKO:   I signed the letter of award. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the letter of award you signed but 
the actual contract. 
MR KOKO:   The contract was signed by Mr Mabuyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And for how long was that contract? 
20 
MR KOKO:   I think it was meant to be a couple of months, 
I don’t think September, October, November, December, 
February, it was meant to be five months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but that contract is in – if it is 
September 2015 it predates the interaction here we are 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 213 of 218 
 
talking about, which is in February 2016. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is not relevant to what we are talking 
about. 
MR KOKO:    No, but the contract we are dealing with Ms 
Goodson and the invoice was under that contract.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because in September 2015 there was 
no Trillian, it was Regiments. 
MR KOKO:   Of course and that is why Chair I hesitated 
about the transition, that is why I hesitated about the 
10 
transition. 
 
We 
signed 
a 
contract 
for 
R101million 
...[indistinct] design to costs, I took it to the Board, I 
signed the letter of award and Mr Mabuyane signed the 
contract.  The invoice we are talking about, that R30million 
contract, the invoice we are talking about, was under the 
contract that I signed, that I took to the Board, and it is 
one of the reasons that they kept on coming to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may relate it to the letter of award 
that you signed? 
MR POPO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and the contract that the Mr 
Mabuyane signed? 
MR POPO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, ja I think we are going to end here, 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 214 of 218 
 
the other issues we will have to traverse in – but let me 
ask you this before we adjourn Mr Koko, if Regiments – 
okay, let me put it this way, the contract relative to the 
letter of award that you signed did it include a sub-
contractor? 
MR KOKO:   It includes a BEE partner, we always 
...[intervenes]     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whose name was not identified.  
MR KOKO:   No, no, no the name was not identified. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The name was not identified? 
10 
MR KOKO:   No it was not in there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know who is the BEE partner? 
MR KOKO:   I knew eventually, I knew after the contract 
was signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who was the BEE partner? 
MR KOKO:   Regiments, which later became Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but Trillian didn’t have a contract 
with McKinsey. 
MR KOKO:   And then? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am not sure why you ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well isn’t the position Mr Koko that first 
there was Regiments. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at a certain stage there was Trillian. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 215 of 218 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when there was Trillian there was 
also Regiments.    
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They both existed at the same time, at a 
certain stage, in other words you can’t say Regiments so to 
speak died and Trillian took its place, isn’t the position that 
once there was Trillian there were two entities, one called 
Regiments and another one called Trillian? 
MR KOKO:   No Chair I only saw one face, I saw one – I 
saw McKinsey and its partners, that is all that I saw. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you mean you did not know at any 
stage that whilst there was Trillian there were two separate 
entities? 
MR KOKO:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You thought they were, you thought 
there was one entity that changed its name. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but I also knew something in March, I 
knew that the relationship between McKinsey and Trillian 
failed on a due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.   Mr Seleka you were thinking 
20 
we could adjourn now, let’s talk about how much time you 
still need with Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s just for purposes of me having a 
good idea when we adjourn how much time. 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 216 of 218 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know it sometimes can be difficult to 
give an estimate, because things don’t always go as one 
plans. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair we haven’t touched the 
transactions, so we need another day at the very least with 
Mr Koko, one full day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is even on that score a 
conservative estimation Chair, but we will try our best. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe we can adjourn but when on 
the day that – maybe if we use evening sessions we may 
use, we might have to use two evening sessions, if we 
have a clear day starting in the morning then we can use 
the whole day and try going into the evening as well, then 
hopefully we can finish.    
 
Maybe we can adjourn, I think that there has been 
cooperation from everybody that if we need to use evening 
sessions we use them.   Mr Barrie Mr Seleka suggested we 
adjourn now but obviously try and find another day, either 
20 
a clear day where we will start in the morning and use the 
whole day, if we need to go into the evening we do so and 
try and finish and I am just adding that in case another 
option might be to use maybe two evening sessions, we 
could have, if we have three days on each day we end up 
01 MARCH 2021 – DAY 352 
 
Page 217 of 218 
 
with six days of evidence, six hours I am sorry, three hours 
per day per evening session that takes us to six hours and 
it may well be we might even make it four hours, 
depending, is that fine with you? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   That is in order, again subject to 
everybody’s availability. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   It must be strike two, it is not a rugby 
match but because of the dentistry that didn’t - so he has 
to go in for an operation for that, so that might, but we will 
10 
deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that is fine, if we are looking 
at a day that is too close, is close then there will be no 
negotiation, if it is a day that gives you reasonable notice 
and then we can just fix a date as we normally do. 
 
Okay Mr Koko you understand?   Yes, okay.  Alright, 
thank you to everybody, let’s adjourn for the day and then 
we will find another day or evening for Mr Koko’s evidence 
to be continued, and tomorrow’s evidence who will I be 
hearing? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is Mr Brian Molefe Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Brian Molefe? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
