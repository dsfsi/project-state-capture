PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 30 JUNE 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Soni, good morning Mr 
Molefe, good morning everybody. 
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright let us continue.  The oath 
that you took yesterday Mr Molefe will continue to apply.  
Thank you. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Molefe yesterday… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  I do not know whether this 
distance is enough.  Do you want to sit a little further?  Ja, 
okay.  I am – no I do not think further that side I think further 
that way.  I am trying to make sure that there is enough 
social distance. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between us. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes Mr Soni. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  As it pleases Chairperson.  Mr Molefe 
yesterday we were dealing with your replying affidavit in the 
Swifambo matter, do you remember? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do remember Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And you recall that we adjourned on the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 4 of 203 
 
basis that you had not read the document in a long time and 
we would give you an opportunity to look at it? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now have you had an opportunity to look at 
your replying affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:  I did Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And as far as your recollection now goes is 
what is contained in the replying affidavit what happened? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  So to the extent that there was an indication 
that not all the documents were contained in the envelope 
given to Mr Mamabolo you confirm that that – that the 
documents that you name in your affidavit were in fact 
contained in that envelope? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I ask, did you check that with Mr 
20 
Mamabolo between yesterday and today? 
MR MOLEFE:  I did do so Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay right.  Now I just want to ask you did 
you also read Mr Mashaba’s response to your replying 
affidavit? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 5 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  I did Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And when one looks at it is there much 
difference between your version and his version? 
MR MOLEFE:  There is very little difference.  I think he 
refers to paragraph 9 – 9.4 and paragraph 10 where he says 
he disagrees.  But overall, he agrees with the content of the 
affidavit and to the extent that he says he disagrees with me.  
I refuted that because I based my affidavit on the documents 
that he gave to Mr Mamabolo in an envelope. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I just want to check 
10 
maybe both you Mr Soni and Mr Molefe you might just raise 
your voices a bit. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to check with the transcribers.  Are 
you able to hear everybody?  Oh, they give a thumbs up so 
they can hear you better than I can hear you.  But I think let 
us try and raise our voices a little bit ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just – just for the record Mr Molefe can 
20 
I ask you to turn to page 327 which is where his response 
starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just place on record again what docu – 
what bundle we are still on. 
ADV SONI SC:  Bundle D Exhibit SS6. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 6 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you are speaking away from the 
microphone. 
ADV SONI SC:  Bundle D Exhibit SS6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay and what page do you… 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 327. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  So I just look at the areas of difference very 
quickly Mr Molefe.  So if you look at what was crucial about 
your evidence is the meeting and at paragraph 65 of his 
affidavit in response to paragraph 9.6 of your affidavit he 
10 
says:   
“I admit that a meeting took place between me and Mr Molefe 
at the Maslow Hotel in Sandton on the 31 August 2015.” 
You confirm that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I confirm it yes – confirm it Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And – and then in fact he hardly disputes 
anything in particular he says at paragraph 71 of his affidavit 
that you did ask him about the contributions but he says it 
was not in relation to Swifambo he says it was in relation to 
his contributions to the ANC.  What do you say about that 
20 
Mr. 
MR MOLEFE:  I deny that Chairperson.  I did not know Mr 
Mashaba.  At that stage I did not even know if he was a 
member of the ANC and I would not have asked him if he 
was making a contribution to the ANC. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 7 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  And what was the purpose of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni.  Should we not just 
have Mashaba’s paragraph 71 read first to hear what he 
says. 
ADV SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Mr Molefe can respond to that 
version. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think 72, 73 I think – you would know 
better but I see that he – he seems to talk about what 
10 
transpired in that meeting in those paragraphs. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you can take the – the points point by 
point. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  So let us just to put in context Mr 
Molefe if you go to page – keep your finger on page 328 but 
if you go to page 263 that is where you make the allegation 
about asking him for the proof of the docu – for the proof of 
the contributions.   
MR MOLEFE:  Page 20? 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 263. 
MR MOLEFE:  263.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what of course can be done Mr 
Soni even without necessarily reading the paragraphs except 
or advise Mr Molefe might wish to refresh his memory is to 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 8 of 203 
 
put to him what his version … 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Molefe’s version was and how Mr 
Mashaba responds to that point by point and then he can 
deal with them. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point by point.  That is another way but I 
will leave it to you how you deal with it ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  As it pleases Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whichever is convenient. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Now if you look at from paragraph 9.6 on 
page 262 to 9.12 on page 263 this is where Mr Mashaba is 
asking you for assurances that there will not be any 
consequences for him, would that be correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And your response to him when he asked for 
those – for those assurances was what?  That you would like 
proof that those payments were made. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct but… 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in the context of the conversation on 
20 
the 31 August at Maslow what was the proof in relation to? 
MR MOLEFE:  In relation to the payment? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Well the proof was in relation to what he said 
where monies he was requested to pay to Ms Maria Gomes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 9 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And the monies that he said were through her 
company called – which was paid into the account a 
company called Similex.  A couple of instalments.  And the 
money that was paid to Mr Nkosi Sabelo… 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry I just want to get the context again.  
That was – he needed to pay that as a result of what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe – maybe let me put it differently 
because I think I know what Mr Soni is looking for – this 
might help.  The – as you understood the position at the 
10 
meeting the payments that he said he had made to Similex 
and to Mr Nkosi Sabelo or his company were – was he 
talking about payments that he was making to Similex and to 
Mr – and to Nkosi Sabelo Incorporated personally or was he 
talking about payments that he was making on behalf of 
somebody else or on behalf of some entity? 
MR MOLEFE:  He was not – the context was that he – he 
said that he was asked by Ms Gomes, Maria Gomes to pay 
money into those accounts and the money was linked to the 
money that PRASA would pay to Swifambo but she said that 
20 
that money – she needed that money for what she called the 
movement.  So that was the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  So it was the money that Swifambo was 
receiving as a result of its contract with PRASA and it was 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 10 of 203 
 
receiving that money from PRASA? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  She had said earlier that this contract is 
going – it is a contract amounting to billions.  It should not 
be difficult for you to give 10% of that to the movement.  And 
I must hasten to say that I do not know Ms Gomes myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes this is what was relayed to you by Mr 
Mashaba at that meeting. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As having been said to him by Ms Gomes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And during the meeting was there a 
common understanding between you and Mr Mashaba as to 
what the reference to the movement was? 
MR MOLEFE:  The – the common understanding – well I 
think he understood that as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But the common understanding of what the 
movement was and is now is the African National Congress. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright now – now it is that context that we 
look at what Mr Mashaba says at page 328 paragraph 71 and 
can you just say more or less well I mean can you just 
paraphrase what he says in relation to the payment at 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 11 of 203 
 
paragraph 71.  If you want you can just read it into the 
record. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is? 
ADV SONI SC:  At page 328 paragraph 71. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the lighting – is the lighting fine for 
reading purposes there Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  It is okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:  It is fine Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  He says: 
“At the meeting on”  
That is paragraph 71 he says: 
“At the meeting” 
Mr Mashaba says: 
“At the meeting on 31 August 2015 Mr Molefe asked me 
whether I supported the ANC financial.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just – if you could just stop there.  Did 
you ever ask that question? 
MR MOLEFE:  I did not ask that question. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  The context in which this interaction took 
place on the 31s t was that he had called for the meeting – Mr 
Mashaba had called for the meeting. 
MR MOLEFE:  He had called for the meeting and it was 
about how he could preserve the assets that he had 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 12 of 203 
 
accumulated before he became part of the Swifambo tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now with reference to that sentence in that 
paragraph is your version that you never asked this question 
in relation to him personally or is the position that you never 
even asked it in relation to Swifambo in case you – you said 
you meaning Swifambo because he was part of Swifambo 
and he thought that you meant him personally. 
MR MOLEFE:  I did not ask the question Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In …[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:  Or in the context of him being the Chairman 
of Swifambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  I did not ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry the – while on that point.  At the 
meeting did you know or before the meeting did you know 
that he had made contributions to the ANC? 
MR MOLEFE:  I did not know that he made any contribution 
20 
to the ANC Chairperson.  And I should just draw the attention 
of the commission the Chairperson to the fact that that 
meeting was asked for by him and I – I was listening to him.  
He is the first one who told us of individuals and or 
companies that he paid money to which then gave rise to me 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 13 of 203 
 
saying but we would need to see the records of those 
payments. 
ADV SONI SC:  When he – oh sorry carry on.  He then says I 
did not think. 
MR MOLEFE:  He says, I did not think I am now continuing 
that paragraph Chairperson that is paragraph 71 and he 
says: 
“I did not think there was anything untoward about his line of 
questioning as I have Mr Molefe in a high regard and 
understood him to be a loyal respected senior a member of 
10 
the ANC.  To my mind the discussion in respect of the ANC 
had no relevance to the issues between PRASA and 
Swifambo.” 
ADV SONI SC:  What is your reaction to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  No he is – he is correct because at that stage 
there was no reason for – for us to speculate about what the 
relationship could have been between Swifambo and the 
ANC.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  But he said it had no relevance. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  He says it had no relevance and he is correct.  
It had no relevance at that stage. 
ADV SONI SC:  Well I do not understand because… 
MR MOLEFE:  What I am saying is that I – firstly I did not 
ask him. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 14 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  So it did not arise but I also agree with him 
that the meeting was not about the relationship between 
Swifambo and the ANC.  But neither was it about relationship 
between Swifambo and PRASA.  It was about his concerns 
regarding what the implications of the investigations that 
PRASA was conducting might have on him as a person and 
the assets that he had accumulated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would he… 
MR MOLEFE:  Before he joined Swifambo. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the – would the position be that the 
relevance of the – of any relationship that the ANC may have 
had with Swifambo would the position be that that relevance 
if any would have arisen once he said that the payments that 
he – that Swifambo had made to Ms Gomes were for the 
movement?  Is that when the relevance of the ANC would 
have arisen? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson without any further evidence that 
monies given to Ms Gomes through – to the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know how one could – well it will be 
the relevance in the fact that she mentioned – he mentioned 
the movement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well what I mean is my expectation is 
that if you are in a meeting such as the meeting that you had 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 15 of 203 
 
with Mr Mashaba on that day where he was coming to I do 
not know whether plead is the correct word but to talk to you 
to say please do not touch my assets.  I have worked hard 
for these assets without Swifambo you know whatever 
investigation is done. If in that context and in the context of 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
and 
your 
board 
were 
conducting 
investigations into allegations of corruption at PRASA if 
somebody said part of the money that is paid to Swifambo is 
actually going to the ANC there might be no proof at that 
stage but my expectation is that that would raise – that 
10 
would make the ANC and its relationship call it alleged 
relationship either with Ms Gomes or with Swifambo relevant 
because you would be saying, well is it possible that 
proceeds of corruption are going to my movement.  That they 
may be going to the governing party and therefore you might 
say, well I want proof of that.  I want – I want to see all of 
those things because maybe the ANC does not know that this 
money comes from corruption.  Maybe it does know but this 
is – this would be a serious allegation if somebody makes it.  
That is my – my thinking of what you would think. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson at that meeting I do not know Mr 
Mashaba.  At best that would simply say what was your state 
of mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  We should have existed in mind that well part 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 16 of 203 
 
of the additional evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That we would I want to see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Would probably prove peace order.  But it is 
not something that I said to him.  I want evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To see whether those monies went to the 
ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  But naturally my state of mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  I would have been concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  There are two issues Mr Molefe. One is he 
calls the meeting to say, please do not take away my assets 
because your investigations will show I gave certain monies 
to a Ms Gomes.  That was part of the purpose of the 
meeting. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is – well – well – well once he started 
20 
talking about people, he paid monies to clearly his fear was 
that he would be implicated in the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Molefe I am just trying to understand 
your state of mind.  You file your founding affidavit in the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 17 of 203 
 
Swifambo matter in which you say the Swifambo contract 
was tainted by corruption. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  Investigations are done and then you 
discover certain things but Mr Mashaba in the meantime 
comes to you and says, look man you may discover certain 
things, you may discover these payments, before you 
discover them, I want to reveal them to you.  Is that the 
sequence of events? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct.  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Now what the Chairperson is saying is when 
he says these payments were made to Ms Gomes to give to 
the movement that is what you must have understood.  That 
the payments we made to Ms Gomes allegedly to be paid to 
the movement. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct.  But – but that is in my state 
of mind that is not what I asked him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I think… 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh yes, no, no that is…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we understand that. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not ask him. I think the question 
simply arose because there was the question of – because 
you said you agreed with Mr Mashaba’s statement that the 
relationship between I think either Swifambo or Ms Gomes 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 18 of 203 
 
was irrelevant and you said you agree that at that stage that 
was the term you used it was irrelevant and certainly I 
thought that what you meant was at a certain stage I had no 
information about the ANC possibly getting – getting paid or 
allegedly getting paid out of this therefore it was irrelevant.  
But then I was thinking that based on the fact that your 
evidence is that at the same stage in the meeting Mr 
Mashaba did say Ms Gomes said, these payments to be paid 
to her company were for the movement.  I then thought at 
that stage I would not expect you to think that allegation is 
10 
irrelevant.  I would expect that you would say, well if what 
you are telling me is correct then I will be very concerned so 
I would therefore wait to see what proof there is because my 
expectation is certainly that if you were to be presented with 
proof that your movement is being given shall I call it “dirty 
money” from corruption that is not – that is not what you 
would like your movement to – that is not the kind of money 
you would like it to receive.  And that is the kind of thing that 
if somebody makes an allegation like that that you would like 
to see there is proof of it.  So I think that is where I was 
20 
coming from.  But when you said at that stage you became 
concerned but there was no proof, I was happy to – to leave 
it at that.  But I want to make sure that we are on the same 
page. 
MR MOLEFE:  The – I - maybe I am struggling to articulate 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 19 of 203 
 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I – if I knew another language that you 
knew I would say speak it but I am limited in my languages. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, ja.  Chair – Chairperson the – perhaps to 
say that there would have been no relevance may not be 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Accurate. 
MR MOLEFE:  But to say that although the purpose of the 
meeting had to do with his concerns about his personal 
assets.  Once he brought in the question of paying monies to 
10 
people who said that they need the money on behalf of the 
movement it raises an important question of potential 
involvement of the movement of the ANC in matters that 
affect him, Swifambo and Ms Gomes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No I think that fits in with what I 
expected would be the position.  Ja, ja, okay.  No thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  And – and Mr Molefe it comes against the 
backdrop that you had already alleged in the founding 
affidavit that the Swifambo contract was tainted. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Sir. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  And so this just was in a sense proof of the 
nature of the tension.  Not only was it an irrational uh-uh, 
contract for... for PRASA maybe interlinked to but we also 
know now that funds were being diverted to somebody else 
which then turned out to be allegedly the movement.  Would 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 20 of 203 
 
that be accurate? 
MR MOLEFE:  That... that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  In the...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  For... I am sorry.  For what it is worth uh, I 
just want to say that uh, of course, at this stage uh, we have 
no proof that money from Swifambo was paid to the ANC.  
We... we... we... certainly, I am not aware of anything.   
I 
do 
not 
know 
if 
there 
are 
something 
in 
the 
documents that I have not seen yet uh, but if anybody makes 
such an allegation, it would be such a serious allegation 
10 
because...  
Not only because it would be wrong for any party but 
to... to... to... to receive such monies knowingly that... 
[laughs] maybe I should emphasise it, knowingly knowing 
where they were coming from. 
 
But it would be much more serious when that party is 
the governing party because part of the questions that many 
South Africans, I think, ask when they look at the levels of 
corruption in our country, particularly within the public 
service, the is SOE’s. 
20 
 
Part of the question that they should be asking or are 
asking is. “who were the people who are supposed to make 
sure that this does not happen both within government and 
outside off of government within an executive and outside of 
the executive?” 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 21 of 203 
 
 
And uh... and uh, and uh, the question arises whether 
some of those people or some of those bodies and 
organisations turned a blind eye because they may have 
been benefiting. 
 
So 
those... 
those 
questions 
in 
this 
kind 
of 
investigation that the Commission is doing, we have got to 
keep our minds open to... to check. 
 
is it possible that here, so and so could have done 
something but did not do something because uh, he or she 
or his or her organisation was benefiting all because it was 
10 
friends that were involved and therefore action was not 
taken. 
 
We have to keep our minds quite open for that.  So 
but I thought I must just mention that at this stage I am not 
aware that there is any evidence to... to that effect but once 
an allegation is made it is very important that we... we... we 
probe. 
Particularly because the allegations of corruption at 
PRASA went on for many years without one seeing any uh, 
um... without... without one seeing the levels going down. 
20 
 
Um, and of course, the evidence that you have given 
Mr Molefe, is very clear that when your board starts to deal 
with this issue of corruption... I think your evidence says, 
“we were attacked”.   
“We were attacked.  We did not get support from 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 22 of 203 
 
quarters where we expected we would get support.  We were 
being attacked.  We were attacked for doing the right thing 
and ultimately we were kicked out”. 
 
And uh... well, other people will come and give 
evidence and we want to know whether what they have to 
say about this because indeed, if this is what happened it is 
terrible but they must come give evidence and say whether 
they deny what you are saying. 
 
That in the end, if... when I make my findings, I find 
that this is what happened, you are right, it is terrible.  It is 
10 
something very serious.  Okay thank you.  You want to say 
something?  
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe counsel uh, if it exists anyway in the 
uh, the document, you will refer me uh, to that. Uh, but I 
agree with counsel that the meeting takes place against the 
backdrop off uh, investigations that were demonstrating that 
Swifambo was tainted. 
 
And that is detailed in how process was undertaken.  
The roll off Mr Mtimkulu designing uh, the RFP’s in a manner 
that favours.  Their particular party changes from what was 
20 
originally uh, supposed to be a lease arrangement uh, to be 
coming now a lease and outright patches but only that done 
by Swifambo. 
 
So... so... so that... that... that is correct here.  I 
have no recollection of uh, my evidence.  Um, as stating 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 23 of 203 
 
categorically that uh, the ANC received money.   
Uh, whether it is in my founding affidavit in that 
matter or in public statements that I made.  Every time I 
spoke about it, was in the context of what Mr Mashaba said 
to us.  So in fairness to the ANC, I do not have evidence that 
says, “you got that money”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Now that is what I was also 
emphasising.  That at this stage, I am not aware of any 
evidence that the ANC got money from uh, Swifambo. 
 
Uh, I have only heard evidence of what you are 
10 
saying Mr Mashaba told you about what his commerce said.  
So that is how far it goes. 
But I was simply saying, you know, one needs to 
have a look.  One needs to... to probe.  We have got to do 
the... the... the job that we have been asked to do properly.  
Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Thanks, Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, uh, you 
are quite right.  Uh, you never said that you have the proof.  
You have merely said, that these were the reports you have 
received and... and... and that one accept. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  But... but I just want to make this point 
though.  If we go to paragraph 72 of uh, the response to your 
replying affidavit.  Mr Mashaba...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 24 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry.  At page 329 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Paragraph 72. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Now, he uh, he says... oh, sorry.  At 
the end of paragraph 71, he says: 
“To my knowledge, no donations were made by 
Swifambo to the ANC.” 
That is... that is the point he makes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And if you look at the affidavit as a whole 
and you have, you see that is the constant theme that, “yes, 
10 
I made the payments.  I received the payments on behalf of 
Swifambo.  I made payments to my own company.”  That is 
the crust of Mr Mashaba’s evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And that is all we have to go on an... 
and we must accept that as the Chairperson so... so uh, 
clearly pointed out that that is the only link we have, his 
statement to you, that:  
“I received payments on behalf of Swifambo and I 
was asked to make those payments to Ms Gomes who 
20 
would then distribute it to the movement.  I do not 
know whether or not she did”. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  But what is significant at paragraph 72.  In 
the middle he says, Mr Mashaba says: 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 25 of 203 
 
“I made the payment set out in Annexures RA15, 17, 
20, 21 and 22.”   
Those are the payments referred to in the payment schedule 
that you were given.  You remember yesterday...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  So the only question, as the Chairperson 
has pointed out is, were those pay... can those payments be 
linked to the ANC?  That is the issue.  Would be that be 
correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well, the [laugh] the... the payment can only 
10 
be linked to the ANC to the extent that uh, according to Mr 
Mashaba and Ms Gomes presents herself as a fundraiser for 
the ANC. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes, that is correct.  Then at paragraph 
73 under that, he says: 
“I gave the annexures to Mr Mamabolo to show that I 
supported the ANC as requested during the meeting 
by Mr Molefe”. 
What is your reaction? 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, that is not true.  It had nothing to do with 
20 
whether uh, we wanted to put payments to the ANC.  Uh, the 
document was requested for him to demonstrate that when 
he says he paid money to Similex of Ms Maria Gomes and 
uh, the trust that was held by uh, uh, those uh, that... that 
law... law firm and... and... and uh Mr Sabelo, Ngozi Sabelo, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 26 of 203 
 
that, in fact, those payments were effected.   
That is... that is... that is what the evidence was 
supposed to prove for us because I have already said that I 
never asked him whether he was supporting the ANC or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [throat clearing]  Excuse me.  As I 
understand your evidence and you must tell me if I 
misunderstand.  The meeting was called by Mr Mashaba. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is point one.  Point two, the meeting 
was 
called 
by 
Mr 
Mashaba 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
10 
investigation that PRASA was... the investigations that 
PRASA was conducting.  That is number two.  Is that right?  
The meeting had a link. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
That 
it 
was 
...[intervenes] 
by 
the 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, his request for a meeting. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...had 
something 
to 
do 
with 
the 
investigations that PRASA was conducting. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Um, am I correct in also saying that uh, in 
particular, this request was connected with the investigation 
that PRASA was conducting that affected Swifambo? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was correct.  And um, at the meeting, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 27 of 203 
 
he requests you to uh-uh... uh, he requests that his assets 
should not be touched as a result of this investigation.  Is 
that right? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And uh, and he... since he is the one who 
called... who requested the meeting, obviously he is the one 
who were... who was going to tell you why he wanted the 
meeting. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And... and he tells you why he wanted the 
10 
meeting.  His... and he says he is fearing that as a result of 
the investigations that um, relate to Swifambo, he fears that 
his assets might be in danger of being taken away.   
Uh, as far as you know, he himself had no business 
or no business that he was uh, doing with... with PRASA in 
his personal capacity or though any company other than that 
he was chairperson of Swifambo. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So... so... so the whole meeting was really 
about how the investigation of PRASA relating to Swifambo 
20 
was affecting him or could affect him. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because he was the chairman...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he was the chairman.  Yes, yes.  
Yes.  No, thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  And he had been asked to be chairperson by 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 28 of 203 
 
somebody else.  Who was that person? 
MR MOLEFE:  That person was uh... the person who asked 
Mr Mashaba to be the chairperson of Swifambo was the 
founder of Swifambo, Mr Mabunda Makhensa. 
ADV SONI SC:  Makhensa Mabunda? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, Makhensa Mabunda.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And what company was he associated with, 
Mr Mabunda? 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, Mr Mabunda was associated with 
Swifambo.  Uh, he... he was with what was called the S-
10 
Group which had a lot of subsidiaries under it.   
A consulting uh, an engineering consulting firm.  Uh, 
general consulting uh, business.  And then, of course uh, the 
other one was called Swifambo Rails.  
 
And then I think that is the one that was supposed to 
then deal with the procurement of locomotives. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now the S-Group is short for what company 
of what group of company? 
MR MOLEFE:  The uh, S-Group is short for Swifambo Group 
of Companies. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  The evidence elsewhere is the S-Group is 
short a... is short for Siyaya. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh, okay.  Ja.  Yes, Siyaya also that he is 
involved in.  It is also a uh, consulting business. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then finally.  Can I refer you to 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 29 of 203 
 
paragraph 79 of Mr Mashaba’s response which appears at 
page thirty... uh, 331?   
MR MOLEFE:  [No audible reply]  
ADV SONI SC:  Wherein response to paragraph 9.13 of your 
replying affidavit, he says these... the contents of these are 
admitted, save that he did not provide certain documents but 
I can ask us to go back to paragraph 9.13 which is at page 
264?   
MR MOLEFE:  [No audible reply]  
ADV SONI SC:  And you will see that is where you list the 
10 
documents that were contained in the envelope given to Mr 
Mamabolo.  Page 264, mister... 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, sir.  Uh, Chairperson...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:  I have found the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just... just so that there is no dispute 
about that.  Do you confirm that the envelope that Mr 
Mamabolo gave you contained these documents as you list 
them? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  I confirm, Chairperson.  There is no other uh, 
place where I could have gotten documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Mashaba...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 30 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  ...outside what he uh, sends to us in an 
envelope. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  I am sorry, Mr Soni.  I think, go 
to the page two hundred and...? 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry.  Page 264, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  264.  Uh... 
ADV SONI SC:  That is the page I have actually finished 
yesterday, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Un, 
I 
wonder 
whether 
uh... 
these 
documents that were in the envelope are very important.  I 
10 
wonder whether we have placed them on record, apart from 
simply saying documents listed in page 26... I am looking at 
264. 
ADV SONI SC:  264. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then maybe we should just...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Uh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...place on record...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Identify what...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...exactly what documents were that were 
in the envelope, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Uh, Mr Molefe, 
at paragraph nine... 9.13.1, the first document you say that 
was in the envelope was RA15 and that appears at page 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 31 of 203 
 
283.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh, he... he... he might not need to go to 
each one. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, I... I could identify it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he knows... Ja, if he knows.  He has 
checked already. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just confirm. 
MR MOLEFE:  I... I confirm, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this could be the document uh, that 
we referred to yesterday.  This is the schedule of payments. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  The next document is the one at RA16 which 
is at page 284 and that is a string of emails between Mr 
Mashaba and Mr Sabelo. 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, that is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then the next one is 217 which is a 
letter written by Mr Mashaba to his bank, asking them to 
facilitate a payment to Knowles Husain or ten million for 
20 
R 100 000,00. 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, that is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And you have checked that ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  I... I will check it, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the next one... the next document you 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 32 of 203 
 
refer to is RA18 which is and this is the document we went 
through yesterday, the first invoice that Similex sent to Mr 
Mashaba. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then RA19 is the second invoice. 
MR MOLEFE:  I have... I have uh, I confirm that. 
ADV SONI SC:  And RA20 is the payment authorisation letter 
to the bank again by Mr Mashaba for a payment to be made 
to Knowles Husain. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And RA21 is a similar document that in 
relation to a... a different payment to Knowles Husain who 
sent for R 14 500 000,00. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And RA22 is the payment notification sent by 
ABSA Bank to Mr Mashaba’s company. 
MR MOLEFE:  Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  For R9 400 00,00. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then RA23 is emails between Mr 
20 
Mashaba and Ms Gomes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in these, she just refers to the invoices 
we have talked about earlier. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 33 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just finally in relation to these... this... 
your evidence relating to what Mr Mashaba told you, this 
replying affidavit and the documents attached to you, I just 
want to confirm that you do confirm that what is set out in 
the replying affidavit is correctly records what happened at 
the time? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do confirm that Chairperson.  That the 
contents of the affidavit confirms what happened at the time. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Chairperson, may I... may I make this 
point?  You have raised an important issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh, please raise your voice. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  You have raised an important issue that I... I 
intended raising uh, uh, bringing it up.  Clearly what one 
needs now is the evidence of Mr Mashaba and the evidence 
of Ms Gomes and to the extent necessary, Mr Mamabolo.   
So those are the witnesses whom we will... well, Mr 
Mamabolo, 
perhaps 
an 
affidavit, 
just 
to 
confirm 
the 
correctness of this but perhaps to call him, depending on Mr 
20 
Mashaba’s response and Ms Gomes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  But uh-uh, Mr Mashaba and Ms 
Gomes, 
we 
will 
obviously 
have 
to 
get 
them 
to 
respond...[intervenes]  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 34 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...to Mr Molefe’s uh-uh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...affidavit and evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  And... ja, that... that needs to be 
done. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, just... just finally on this issue.  Again, 
we are talking about state of mind, sir.  Mr Molefe, when you 
were told this by Mr Mashaba and... and remember you are a 
member of the ANC.  I suppose you thought “oh, but that is 
10 
not...” but certainly at that stage because he says you 
...[indistinct] members.  What was your reaction to how 
PRASA was awarding tenders if that allegation was correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  I think counsel should rephrase the question, 
Chairperson because uh, counsel says how PRASA was 
awarded tenders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  Counsel wanted to say something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am afraid I also did not pay 
attention because I was reading something here. [laughs] 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh, do you want to...? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chair.  Yes, it should be, maybe Swifambo 
was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 35 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  [Indistinct]  
ADV SONI SC:  Obviously, I... I can particularise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  H’m.   
ADV SONI SC:  In regard to this particular tender.  No, you 
are quite right Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, maybe just... just uh, articulate the 
question...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...whether it is the same question or an 
amended one. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, I... I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just so that one understands it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ja.  Now, Mr Mashaba was with Swifambo 
had been awarded a tender for more than R 2,5 billion.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  You look at the tender documents 
and uh, the process and you find that dock... Mtimkulu as he 
called himself, had tailormade the concept to sue Swifambo.  
That was your evidence and that was the finding of the 
20 
supreme court of appeal and high court. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now you are then are told by Mr Mashaba 
that there is this all added dimension and he mentions 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 36 of 203 
 
money being paid to the movement.  I am not saying he 
includes it but that is what he tells you.  What is your 
reaction to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh, I am... I... I understood Mr Molefe to 
say his reaction was of being concern uh but bearing in mind 
that there was no proof.  He was just getting this allegation.  
Is my understanding correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  That... that is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But uh, but one can take as... it a step 
10 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:  And say... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:  ...that it raises the question...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...as to whether... as to the extent to 
which...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...the tender process itself...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...might have been influenced...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...uh, by parties...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 37 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  ...that uh, Mr Mashaba alleges...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...that Ms Gomes uh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...she was raising...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ..the funds for... 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now when you met the top 6, was one... was 
this one of the matters you raised with the ANC top 6? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  We... we um... I... I... I think...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe... maybe...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  ...refresh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me start uh, with an earlier question.  
When you met with... when you met with Mr Mashaba, had 
you already met with the top 6 or did that meeting with the 
top 6 happen later? 
MR MOLEFE:  When... when I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  When I met with Mr Mashaba...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...the meeting with the top 6 had already 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, ja.  That... that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:  But the meeting with the top 6 uh, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 38 of 203 
 
Chairperson would have dealt broadly with the investigations 
and what was mentioned and the Swifambo matter was the 
biggest and it was key in uh, what was imaging as big 
irregularities. 
 
Another one was the uh, what I refer to as the 
Braamfontein depot, uh, modernisation uh-uh, and the 
procurement of rails and turnouts as part of the preparations 
for the trains that were to come from Brazil.   
 
There would have been many other smaller uh, 
matters that were imaging uh, like uh, a bit of Siyangena and 
10 
so on because the others, Siyaya and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Siyaya GP would have also been involved 
in that Braamfontein depot transactional advisory service, 
designed how the depot should look like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so the thrust of what you are saying 
about your meeting with the top six is that you spoke to 
them and told them in general about what was emerging 
from the investigations that your board was conducting at 
PRASA but you specifically mentioned certain important 
20 
contracts including the Swifambo because it was the 
biggest, as I understand you.  You mentioned, specifically 
mentioned it and you would have mentioned many others. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 39 of 203 
 
MR SONI SC:   Now when you filed or when the replying 
affidavit about what Mr Mashaba had told you was lodged 
in court it would have become a public document, would 
that be correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson, it would become a public 
document. 
MR SONI SC:   So people generally would have known that 
such an allegation had been made. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
MR SONI SC:   Were you contacted by anybody from the 
10 
ANC about that allegation? 
MR MOLEFE:   I was not contacted by anyone from the 
ANC.  I recall this matter being raised pertinently by the 
gentleman who later became the Minister for Transport, Mr 
Maswanganyi saying that, you know, I have accused the 
ANC of receiving monies from – and that I did not even 
produce evidence to prove that they did not why I 
mentioned this matter but nobody from the headquarters of 
the ANC raised an issue with me. 
MR SONI SC:   When 
Mr Maswanganyi made this 
20 
accusation or made this – said this to you, was he saying it 
as a member of a committee in parliament?  I think 
yesterday you mentioned that …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, he was saying it in his 
capacity as a member of the Portfolio Committee on 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 40 of 203 
 
Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  I take it you would 
have explained to him that you were simply making 
reference to a report that was made to you, you were not 
making the accusation yourself about the ANC receiving 
the money. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson, and as 
counsel correctly points out, that allegation was published 
in the media as a result of the court papers, my replying 
affidavits there which was in court.  It was not like I went 
10 
to the media just to release a media statement. 
MR SONI SC:   And did you at any stage communicate this 
to any other person in the ANC except through the court 
papers, the allegation that Mr Mashaba had made to you?   
MR MOLEFE:   Let us start off by saying my minister was a 
member of the National Executive Committee of the ANC.  
My 
minister 
was 
receiving 
regular 
reports 
on 
this 
investigation, and we referred to those reports yesterday, 
in the context of my reply to the minister ’s letter where she 
was asking us to close off the investigation and that letter 
20 
is dated the 24 August.  Ja, 24 August 2016. 
 
So a member of the executive committee who 
reports to the President and the cabinet, who also sat on 
the subcommittees of the National Executive Committee of 
the ANC was privy to all of these investigations and I did 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 41 of 203 
 
say yesterday, well, it looks like it was much later, in 2017, 
detailed letters had been written to various institutions in 
parliament but at that time also – it was public knowledge 
that we had reported a series of cases to the Hawks for 
further investigation in terms of PACCA. 
MR SONI SC:   So on that note can I ask you to go back to 
your affidavit which is bundle D and turn to the point at 
which we left off yesterday which is page 28, paragraph 
113? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni and Mr Molefe, you 
10 
will come back to this question.  I just want to ask 
something else.  You can look at the page later.  You have 
just mentioned that your minister – and I think you are 
referring to Mr Maswanganyi, he was the minister at the 
relevant time, when you said your minister was member of 
the cabinet, member of the NEC, is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:   I am referring to Minister Dipuo Peters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Minister Dipuo Peters, oh. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was at the time when we dealt with the 
Mashaba. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   My affidavit and the application of 
Siyangena she was, you know, the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Minister of – ja, alright.  Now it 
seems obviously every minister is supposed to report to 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 42 of 203 
 
the President about what is going on in their departments 
so that the President can see whether the department is 
doing well or not and whether that particular minister is 
doing well or not because if the minister is not doing well 
or if the minister is not up to the challenges of the 
department then the President should consider whether to 
ship the minister elsewhere or remove her or him and get 
somebody else who is up to the challenges of the 
department. 
 
So the President would be receiving reports from 
10 
each minister – he is supposed to receive reports from 
every minister and probe whether the work is being done 
properly and I would imagine that also apart from every 
minister reporting to the President.   
So I would imagine that the cabinet has occasion to 
hear what everyone, every minister – how every minister is 
doing, what are the challenges they facing in their 
departments and to see what decisions as cabinet can be 
taken but then if a minister is also a member of the NEC of 
the governing party, one would expect that since the 
20 
governing 
party 
talks 
about 
deploying 
its 
cadres 
in 
government and elsewhere, one would imagine that the 
governing party also keeps an eye on how its deployees 
perform because it should have an interest in them doing 
their job quite well because if they do their job quite well 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 43 of 203 
 
and the populace thinks that its deployees are doing a 
good job the chances of getting elected – re-elected next 
time 
are 
greater 
than 
if 
they 
mess 
up 
in 
various 
departments. 
Now you have been in government – certainly I 
remember at provincial level, you are a senior member of 
the ANC, do you know whether what I am talking about 
does happen? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson, it happens 
and when I was in the province, I was also a member of the 
10 
National 
Executive 
Committee, 
so 
I 
was 
both 
the 
Chairperson of the ANC in the province and a member of 
the National Executive Committee.  But in addition to all of 
that we had what was called the President’s coordinating 
council where the President would meet with all the 
premiers of the provinces, members of the cabinet to do a 
review of the performance of government on strategic 
priorities that would have been identified in their strategic 
plans.  So there was that regular report. 
 
Of course, in addition to that there would have been 
20 
what was called – I think it was called the budget council 
or forum where premiers and MECs of finance ministers 
and the President would meet before the final budget was 
appropriated and informed in those discussions by the 
reports of the finance and fiscal commission which was to 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 44 of 203 
 
ensure equitable allocation of resources throughout the 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  I feel that it is cold. 
MR SONI SC:   It certainly has got cold, Chairperson.  It is 
still cold, it was a little warmer some time ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know, I think maybe heater here 
is not a very good – because even yesterday when it got 
better it was only slightly warmer, I do not think it went 
beyond that but most of the time it seemed to make 
certainly me quite cold.  I do not know what can or cannot 
10 
be done, I do not see Stimela here.  Maybe somebody is 
listening.  If there is anything that can still be done to 
make the heater more effective please, somebody should 
follow that up.  Okay, thank you.  You had asked a question 
and I interrupted you. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that we are at quarter past. 
MR SONI SC:   It would be the ideal time to take… 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is convenient we can take the tea 
break now then.   
20 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the tea break, will 
come back at half past eleven. 
MR SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 45 of 203 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
CHAIRPERSON:   We may proceed.  Your mic, your mic. 
MR SONI SC:   Sorry, Chairperson.  May I point out that I 
did raise the question of that the room is cold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SONI SC:   I am informed that the air conditioning is 
controlled centrally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Centrally, yes. 
MR SONI SC:   But that they are attending to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
10 
MR SONI SC:   Chairperson, I know that I have indicated 
that I was going to turn to another topic but there is 
something that I omitted to raise with Mr Molefe.  May I, 
with your leave, raise it in relation to his replying affidavit 
in the Swifambo matter? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you. 
MR SONI SC:   Mr Molefe, can I ask you to turn to bundle 
D page 268, that is – it says 6, page 268.  Now one of the 
– we have dealt with the documents that Mr Mashaba gave 
to Mr Mamabolo but in those documents, you refer to a 
20 
series or an exchange of emails between Mr Montana, Ms 
Gomes, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
MR SONI SC:   Now, firstly, you raise two issues.  You set 
out the exchange between them at RA30 which is at page 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 46 of 203 
 
323.  Can I ask you to look at page 323? 
MR MOLEFE:   Is it 13…? 
MR SONI SC:   323, RA30. 
MR MOLEFE:   RA…? 
MR SONI SC:   RA30, your replying affidavit, annexure 30. 
MR MOLEFE:   I hope I am looking at the right documents.  
Are we in bundle A? 
MR SONI SC:   Bundle D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle D is the one we have been using 
this morning. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Bundle D, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 323, hey, Mr Soni? 
MR SONI SC:   323, yes.  Sorry, Chairperson, yes.  Now – 
sorry, can I just ask you to identify what these documents 
are? 
MR MOLEFE:   RA330, Chairperson …[intervenes] 
MR SONI SC:   RA30. 
MR MOLEFE:   RA30? 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is an email. 
20 
MR SONI SC:   Email sent from Maria Gomes on the 17 
December 2013 and to whom is it addressed? 
MR MOLEFE:   Addressed to Mr Lucky Montana, PRASA 
Corp. 
MR SONI SC:   Okay, if you just go to the document at the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 47 of 203 
 
bottom of that, what is that document, on the second half 
of that page? 
MR MOLEFE:   That document at the bottom is an email 
from Mr Lucky Montana and it is addressed to Comrade 
Sonia. 
MR SONI SC:   Well, it is Maria Gomes, am I right? 
MR MOLEFE:   It is address to Maria Gomes. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But it also says: 
“Dear Comrade Sonia.” 
10 
MR SONI SC:   And what is the date of that? 
MR MOLEFE:   The date of that document is 16 December 
2013. 
MR SONI SC:   And the document from – I mean, the email 
from Ms Gomes is the 17 December, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct. 
MR SONI SC:   So can we look at the document at the 
bottom, the email of the 16 t h.  Mr Chairperson, I submit it 
is a document and I would ask the witness to read it into 
the record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is fine.  I see the sequence 
is that the one at the bottom is 16 December, the one at 
the top …[intervenes] 
MR SONI SC:   Is the 17 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 17 December.  Okay, alright. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 48 of 203 
 
MR SONI SC:   So I just want to ask you, in regard to the 
email from Mr Montana to Ms Gomes, what is the subject 
matter? 
MR MOLEFE:   The subject matter, Chairperson, of the 
email of Mr Montana to Ms Gomes is the Capital Project 
that PRASA will undertake.  I do not know if I have to read 
…[intervenes] 
MR SONI SC:   No, no, I am …(intervenes) 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Quite, 
you 
know, 
running 
out 
of 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Molefe, I think 
what counsel is asking, he is asking for what appears at 
the top where it says from T Montana and his email 
address to Maria Gomes and the email address, then there 
is some – then it says Subject.  I think that is what he is 
asking about when he says what was the subject of that 
email. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, the subject of the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Emails, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Summary, it says Summary Note.  And it 
20 
…[intervenes] 
MR SONI SC:   Well, the importance of that you will see 
when your read Ms Gomes’ but I just want to point out that 
the subject is, according to the email, Summary Notes, is 
that correct? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 49 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct. 
MR SONI SC:   Now can you then read the email please? 
MR MOLEFE:   The one by Mr Montana? 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   It says: 
“Dear Comrade Sonia, as discussed please note as 
follows:  Moloto Rail Corridor, this project is about 
the introduction of multimodal transport system to 
serve as a catalyst for economic development in the 
Western 
Region 
of 
Mpumalanga, 
Limpopo 
and 
10 
Gauteng.  It also involves three municipalities which 
include 
Ekangala, 
Sekhukhune 
and 
Tshwane 
Metropolitan.  The rail line is approximately 113 
kilometres with estimated cost of R12 billion, (the 
cost to be revised once the review is complete.) 
The 
project 
is 
currently 
undergoing 
an 
option 
analysis phase with the project review expected to 
be completed by March 2014.” 
Then it goes on, it says: 
“Johannesburg, Durban High speed rail.  This 
20 
project is about introducing a high-speed train 
service between Johannesburg and Durban.  The 
project is currently being conceptualised with the 
detailed feasibility study expected to be undertaken 
in 2013/2014 financial year.  Detailed options 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 50 of 203 
 
analysis will be undertaken to assess the viability of 
a 
separate 
Passenger 
Rail 
service 
for 
a 
combination of freight and passenger rail services.” 
It then goes on to say: 
“Park Station.  This is the largest railway station in 
South Africa situated in Johannesburg with over 
200 000 commuters connecting through the station 
daily.  It is, however, anticipated that the commuter 
numbers will reach 260 000 by 2020.  It is planned 
that a full backing of the station will be undertaken 
10 
in order to create more space for commercial use.  
In 
the 
medium 
term 
PRASA 
will 
invest 
approximately R1 billion as part of phase one of the 
project which mainly focuses on creating additional 
commercial space on the lower part of the station.  
The fourth project is Pretoria station.” 
It says: 
“Similar to Park Station in terms of the planned 
works the project is currently being conceptualised 
for future development.  Approximately 130 000 
20 
passengers, 
commuters 
connect 
through 
the 
stations daily.  Hope this will be of assistance to 
you and the team from DBA.” 
MR SONI SC:   Can I ask you, do you know who DBA is? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, I am not sure, this may well mean – I 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 51 of 203 
 
am not sure, I am not sure, let me not answer, I am not 
sure who DBA referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the abbreviation stands for?  You 
do not know what the abbreviation that he used stands for?  
Ja, no that is fine, I think that is what you mean, you mean 
that you do not know what this abbreviation stands for. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know what this abbreviation stands 
for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SONI SC:   Alright, can we then read the email of the 
10 
17 December 2017? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we do that… 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I notice and I just want to confirm 
whether you notice the same thing, Mr Molefe, that in this 
email that you have just read the author tells Ms Maria 
Gomes 
or 
Comrade 
Sonia, 
as 
he 
calls 
the 
person 
concerned, he tells her about projects that PRASA was 
undertaking or was planning to undertake, what they 
entailed, at least in regard to two, he also tells her what 
20 
monetary value would be attached to them. 
 
The one, the first one he says – and the estimate 
cost of the project is about R12 billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other one that he tells, that is in 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 52 of 203 
 
paragraph 3, he says would be approximately R1 billion 
and, of course later he says: 
“I hope that this will be of assistance to you and the 
team from DBA.” 
That is part of what he is telling the person about.  The 
projects and in some cases the costs involved.  Is that 
what you notice as well? 
MR MOLEFE:   I am noticed that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, okay, thank you. 
MR SONI SC:   As you please, Chair.  I will want to come 
10 
back to that issue as he sets it out in his – as Mr Molefe 
sets it out in his replying affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR SONI SC:   Now what is the subject matter again in 
relation to Ms Gomes’ email? 
MR MOLEFE:   The subject matter in Ms Gomes’ email, 
Chairperson, is summary notes. 
MR SONI SC:   So putting it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
We 
you 
just, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness mention again for the record that that is the 
20 
email that appears at page 2, at page 323 of bundle D, that 
is marked RA30 to – ja, that is marked RA30 and it is an 
email from Maria Gomes to Mr Lucky Montana dated 17 
December 2013 at 12.25. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 53 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have just confirmed that the 
subject matter is Summary Notes.  The subject matter is 
the same as the subject matter of the email that came from 
Mr Montana to Maria Gomes, is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Yes, Mr Soni? 
MR SONI SC:   As it pleases, Chairperson.  Could you read 
the whole email including the manner in which Ms Gomes 
addresses Mr Montana? 
MR MOLEFE:   May counsel repeat that question? 
10 
MR SONI SC:   I say could you read the whole email from  
Ms Gomes addresses Mr Montana including the manner in 
which she addresses Mr Montana? 
MR MOLEFE:   The email reads as follows, Chairperson: 
“Dear Comrade Happy, I am sorry to come back to 
you only today but yesterday dinner finished too 
late but otherwise, how are you feeling now?  Hope 
much better.  However, it was good help for the part 
of our conversations related to railways issue.  Now 
today I will have a meeting with Vice-President of 
20 
the bank to go to some more details of how and 
what we would like to go forward.  The meeting will 
be in Sandton at 4 p.m. in our office.  So if you feel 
you can come and participate, will be most than 
welcome.  Otherwise I will see you later because 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 54 of 203 
 
our man is completely desperate.  So please.  With 
regards, SG.” 
Which I think is Sonia Gomes.   
MR SONI SC:   Now just putting the two emails in context 
would it be fair to say that Ms Gomes’ email is a response 
to Mr Montana’s email of the 16 t h? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am sorry, Mr Soni.  The salutation 
in the email from Ms Maria Gomes to Mr Montana is: 
“Dear Comrade Happy.” 
10 
Do you know that name as one of the names for Mr 
Montana or is it a name that you do not know?  I do not 
know whether it is – I am taking it that it is a name, so – 
but I do not know.  Is that something that you associate 
with him or not? 
MR MOLEFE:   Where I am sitting now, I am not certain but 
it is very clear that is a response to a discussion they 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And the notes that appear in the email of 
20 
Mr Montana to Ms Gomes dated the 16 December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I guess what you are saying is I 
do not know about Comrade Happy but when I look at the 
two emails it is clear to me that the one is a response to 
the other. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 55 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:   That is so, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
MR SONI SC:   Now in your replying affidavit at page 268 
you deal with – or you comment on this exchange of emails 
at page 268 paragraph 9.15.10.  Can I ask you to read into 
the record what you said in paragraph 9.15.10 of your 
replying affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:   Paragraph 9.15.10 of my replying affidavit 
reads as follows: 
“The first alarming feature of this correspondence is 
10 
the familiarity between Ms Gomes and Mr Montana.  
For instance, they refer to each other as comrades. 
The second alarming feature is that Mr Montana 
sends Ms Gomes details of various projects within 
PRASA.  Mr Montana had no business sending such 
information to Ms Gomes, Similex is not a tenderer, 
supplier or contractor to PRASA.  Ms Gomes, to the 
best of my knowledge, is not involved in any 
entities supplying services to PRASA.” 
MR SONI SC:   And, of course, the third point that ought to 
20 
be made is the one raised by the Chairperson that not only 
are you giving details but you are giving approximate costs 
which are not trifling amounts. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
MR SONI SC:   Now where did you acquire – where did you 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 56 of 203 
 
get this document, this set of emails from, Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   My recollection, Chairperson, the set of 
emails was found in the course of the investigations by the 
investigators. 
MR SONI SC:   And by the time it was found Mr Montana 
had left, so [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MOLEFE:   He had already left.  A lot of work had to be 
done, imaging the laptops and computers. 
MR SONI SC:   Chairperson, I just wanted to place that on 
record again to say that obviously these are matters that 
10 
will be canvassed with Ms Gomes and Mr Montana when 
they come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  I just want to go back 
to something else that we dealt with earlier, Mr Molefe.  
When we were looking at certain paragraphs of Mr 
Mashaba’s affidavit earlier on – I do not remember in which 
page, but you do not need to go there for now – I noticed 
that he says in that affidavit that he was instructed by Ms 
Gomes to make certain payments to Ms Gomes’ entity.  Is 
that part of what he told you at the meeting that you had 
20 
with him and other people, that he was instructed? 
MR MOLEFE:   He said that he was requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was requested.  Yes, okay.  Okay, 
well, I am just wondering what relationship he would have 
with her or her to instruct him to make payments to her 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 57 of 203 
 
entities, but obviously you cannot help with that because 
he did not use that terminology in the meeting. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson, I do not know how she 
would then instruct somebody who is not her subordinate in 
the same business.  It is probably – is the use of language. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe it is just the use of language.  
Well, I hope Mr Mashaba will come here and then he can 
explain. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes.  Can I raise one issue? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR SONI SC:   Relating to that, Mr Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SONI SC:   Mr Molefe, can I take you to page 263 of 
bundle D and in particular paragraph 9.11.  This is still part 
of your replying affidavit.  Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, what is it, paragraph? 
MR SONI SC:   Paragraph 9.11, page 263. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am looking at it. 
MR SONI SC:   Will you read it into the record please?  It 
relates to the issue about the instructions. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   
 “Mr Mashaba explained further that Mr Mabunda  
had instructed him to pay some of the money 
received from PRASA into a specified accounts 
without Mr Mashaba knowing who was being paid or 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 58 of 203 
 
the reasons for the payment.  Mr Mashaba insisted 
that he did not know the identity of the beneficiaries 
and he was merely informed that the money would 
benefit the movement.” 
MR SONI SC:   So that is the difference between the 
two.…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am trying to look for Mr 
Mashaba’s affidavit because maybe it might be helpful for 
me to… 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Maybe 
I 
will 
be 
able 
to 
catch 
…[intervenes] 
MR SONI SC:   Let me just try and find the passage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is 32 something. 
MR SONI SC:   I think it is at 329, paragraph 72, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think we – that is fine, we will 
move on but I think I did see where he seems to say he 
made 
these 
payments 
effectively 
– 
where 
he 
says 
effectively 
that 
he 
made 
these 
payments 
on 
the 
20 
instructions of …[intervenes]. 
MR SONI SC:   Ms Gomes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Gomes.  But that is okay, I can check 
that later. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 59 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Molefe, just before tea you 
had indicated that you had approached the different law 
enforcement authorities …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni. 
MR SONI SC:   Oh, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am terribly sorry, I just picked up 
something that links to those two – which may link and not 
links but may link to the two emails exchanged between Ms 
Gomes and Mr Montana.  So I just mention I see that in 
paragraph 9.10 at page 263, I think that is a – no, I am 
10 
sorry, that is Mr Molefe’s replying affidavit. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says, that is Mr Molefe speaking 
now in his affidavit: 
“Mr Mashaba explained that he met with Ms Gomes.  
Ms Gomes told Mr Mashaba that she wanted money 
for the movement.” 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    
“Ms Gomes also told him that she knew the bid to 
20 
supply locomotives to PRASA was worth billions and 
she could not understand why 10% of the value of 
the bid could not be paid to the African National 
Congress.” 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 60 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I do not know whether it is connected 
with these emails but we saw from the emails that Mr 
Montana, according to the email, was telling Ms Gomes 
about projects that PRASA was undertaking or was going 
to be undertaking and telling her even the costs involved, 
the value, monetary value of those projects and here you 
are saying what he told you and you are saying he said he 
said he met with Ms Gomez and he said Ms Gomez told him 
that 
it’s 
Mashaba, 
that 
she 
wanted 
money 
for 
the 
movement and Ms Gomez – Mr Mashaba told you that Ms 
10 
Gomez also told him that she knew the bid to supply 
locomotives to PRASA was worth billions and she could not 
understand why 10% of the value of the bid could not be 
paid to the African National Congress.  You don’t need to 
comment, you may comment if you want to, I was just 
saying maybe there is a connection between how Ms 
Gomez gets to know information that maybe should only be 
known at a certain time, only by people within PRASA.  
That’s what I was saying, that it may be that there is that 
link but it might not be that it links to this particular one, 
20 
okay but as I say, you don’t have to comment on it but if 
you want to say something, I’m not preventing you from 
saying something. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I would rather not comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 61 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I don’t know where it would stop 
save to say that there seem to be the probability of the link 
in the emails and what appears in this response that a 
person get given, the values project and the values well in 
advance and the person says probably that’s what they had 
agreed with Mr Montana that they must get 10% you know, 
for the movement but the 10%, as she is putting it of each 
one of those projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Molefe, can I then go to page 28, 113 of 
10 
your main affidavit, page 28 paragraph 113.  
MR MOLEFE:   Is that Bundle B? 
ADV SONI SC:   The same bundle yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   This one? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, page 28 paragraph 113, are you 
there? 
MR MOLEFE:   I am there Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson I just wondered in the 
interest of time because I’m also considering how to deal 
with this complaint beyond merely recording it as a 
20 
complaint because we know from what’s contained in the 
affidavit that – and in the answering affidavit of the police 
that there’s no answer for why they’ve delayed up to now 
and I wondered whether it may not be an idea to get Mr 
Molefe to confirm the correctness of this and then get the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 62 of 203 
 
new head of the police inspectorate to come and explain 
why  nothing has been done now?  It’s just in the interest 
of saving time Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well this is non-action by Law 
Enforcement Agencies, well it shouldn’t take long for him 
to just say, bang, bang, bang.  
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   So in these – in paragraphs 113, 114 and 
115 of page 29 you set out the approaches you made to the 
10 
police, would that be correct, Mr Montana? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   And at page – paragraph 113 you refer to 
a letter that you wrote to the Law Enforcement Authorities 
including the head of the NDPP at that time? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   And the head of the Directorate of Priority 
Crime Investigation? 
MR MOLEFE:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that letter appears at page 192, you 
20 
don’t need to go to it but I’m just asking you to confirm 
that, that is the letter you, in fact, wrote to the different 
persons? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do confirm that I wrote that letter and I’ve 
seen it several times before I appeared here. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 63 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Can I just ask, if, in about two or three 
sentences you can summarise what you said in that letter, 
no not two or three sentences but as summarised as 
possible. 
MR MOLEFE:   The essence of the letter, Chairperson, was 
a complaint about the fact that nothing had been done 
about the cases reported to the DPCI and relating to what 
we considered to be very serious violations of the law or 
criminal activities and the fact that we’d registered several 
of these cases, I think elsewhere, probably in the founding 
10 
affidavit in the previous – in my letter to the Minister and 
previous affidavit, most likely, we tabled some 69 cases 
that we had reported.  So we were concerned that there 
was no movement. 
ADV SONI SC:   And did you ask…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   And of course, I – my view was that – and 
the view of the Board was that it was improper for what 
was the organ of State charged with the responsibility of 
investigating crimes, offences and prosecuting, laying a 
basis for prosecution in that regard. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   And can I ask you just, the extent of the 
details you gave in that letter, if you look at page 197 
paragraph 11.4 you point out that you were annexing to the 
complaint, the founding affidavits in the Siyangena and the 
Swifambo matters, at page 197. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 64 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Hundred and? 
ADV SONI SC:   Page 197 paragraph 11.4. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   Right and then on the next page, page 
198 you set out the formal request for assistance, if you 
look at paragraphs 14. 15 and 16, you point out why the 
police and the NDPP are required to look into these 
matters 
on 
account 
of 
the 
legislation 
dealing 
with 
corruption. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes it is so Chairperson…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Molefe…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   But it relates to – we’re dealing with where 
we talking about Corporate Governance, the constitution 
obliges 
organs 
of 
State 
to 
support 
one 
another 
to 
collaborate in dealing with the problems and to the extent 
possible avoid unnecessary litigation.  Litigation is to be 
dealt with as last resort. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It must have been frustrating to you and 
the Board to have a situation where you had to even 
remind 
Law 
Enforcement 
Agencies 
about 
what 
the 
20 
constitution says about their responsibilities to try and get 
them to do their job, it must have been frustrating to have 
to 
approach 
so 
many 
entities 
or 
institutions 
and 
functionaries without really getting support for your fights 
against corruption because yesterday you told us about 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 65 of 203 
 
writing to the Minister and – Minister Maswanganyi not 
getting the support, writing to the Chairperson of the 
Portfolio Committee on transport in Parliament, not even 
getting acknowledgement of receipt of your letter, writing 
to the Speaker of Parliament, raising these very important 
issues not even getting acknowledgment of receipt of your 
letter. Writing to the Hawks laying complaints with the 
SAPS and the Hawks, excepting them to do their job but 
them not doing their job then having to go to Court to try 
and get them to do their job, it must have been quite 
10 
draining and…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was certainly frustrating and it was 
inexplicable the way it was dealt with and again these 
matters became public knowledge, the question that one 
might ask, and bearing in mind that political interference is 
undesirable but certainly the Minister of Justice under 
whom such – and the Minister of Police under whom these 
organs resort should have been able to say, look we see in 
the public domain and in the reports given to our Minister 
of Transport that there are these cases that have been 
20 
lodged with you, give us a status report, these are very 
serious matters what are we going to do about them, they 
involve monies that could easily disappear which are 
continuing to be used against the tax payers interests.  So 
it’s a question that begs for answers. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 66 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m and it may well be that to the 
extent that it is said that State Capture involved or entailed 
paralysing certain institutions so that they don’t do their 
job properly, that they’re supposed to do.  It may well be 
that, 
what 
happened 
with 
your 
Board 
trying 
to 
get 
assistance might well – and not getting it and institutions 
not doing their job, it may well be that it’s a manifestation 
of that kind of paralysis. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is so Chairperson, the backdrop to the 
point that is made by the Chairperson is that there was the 
10 
head of the DPCI or the Hawks who appeared to be 
effective 
and 
committed 
to 
doing 
– 
discharging 
his 
responsibility, 
Mr 
Anwar 
Dramat, 
he 
was 
removed 
unceremoniously on spurious allegations which never were 
seriously tested in a proper Court of law and that is when 
Mr Ntlemeza was appointed in his place.  Our experience 
with this case, and I’ll try to be very brief, Chairperson, 
also, is that there were very – quite a number of 
professional Police Officers in the Police Service, the DPCI 
but every time those professional Officers put their teeth 
20 
on the cases, they would be removed and cronies would be 
appointed in their place, clearly with the instruction to do 
nothing and there was no movement after that.  Several of 
them became casualties and I think one of those who 
became casualties would have been – but though relating 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 67 of 203 
 
to a different case would have been Major – I think Major 
General Colonel – Brigadier Sibiya something like that who 
later became head of the Forensic Unit in the city – 
metropolitan city of Johannesburg.  So there was a 
deliberate crippling of the system and what was happening 
in the Police Services was also happening in the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m and I guess that from the point 
of view of anyone who may have been pursing State 
Capture and who may have been pursuing the agenda of 
benefiting from corruption, it would make sense to make 
10 
sure that the Law Enforcement Agencies would not do their 
job, even if evidence relating to them – evidence of crime 
relating to them would be placed before them because 
whatever they did, if they knew the Law Enforcement 
Agencies would do their job properly, the chances that – 
would be that they would be caught and they would be 
brought to book and – so the idea of paralysing the Law 
Enforcement Agencies seems to be something that they 
would really have – that would have benefited them. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is so Chairperson, maybe at some point 
20 
we must get someone to present to this Commission what 
exactly happened in the interaction between PRASA and 
the DPCI in particular.  The DPCI – I attended a couple of 
meetings with them, in particular with the gentleman, I 
think he’s called Major General Khana, he was the deputy 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 68 of 203 
 
to Mr Ntlemeza.  When we started, and we do indicate in 
some of our documents that they said that they were going 
to prioritise the Swifambo and Siyangena matter, when we 
started, he said that they needed – they didn’t have 
forensic capacity to investigate.  We agreed with them that 
the capacity that we had in the PRASA investigation would 
be given to them with full control of those forensic 
investigators that they didn’t even need to give – those 
investigators didn’t need to give reports to PRASA because 
once they’re under the police, DPCI, they should account 
10 
to them even though PRASA was paying the bill for that.  
Several reports, many - actually were files – lever arch 
files were made available as a result of that investigation.  
They did not want to touch them because dealing with them 
would 
have 
meant 
they 
have 
to 
follow 
the 
people 
implicated in those things.  I think at some point, 
Chairperson, as counsel correctly pointed out earlier on, 
they must be called to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no they will be called there is a – 
we call them a work stream, there is a work stream within 
20 
the Commission which consists of members of the legal 
team as well as investigators that is focusing on Law 
Enforcement 
Agencies 
and 
included 
in 
the 
Law 
Enforcement Agencies is the Hawks to say to what extent 
did they not do their job as part of this paralysis that we 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 69 of 203 
 
are talking about and I know that there have been 
consultations with senior people within the Hawks.  So it is 
in the plan that at some stage we are going to look at 
those things, what the – what I think the investigators – 
what I’m not sure about is whether they may have 
appreciated the particular special place that the PRASA 
cases must occupy in that investigation, namely the PRASA 
cases – the cases that PRASA placed before the SAPS, 
placed before the Hawks and said, investigate and what 
happened so that the information will be shared with them 
10 
but the information will be shared with them but they are 
certainly looking at how, for example, the Hawks operated, 
to what extent were they paralysed who was responsible 
for that, how did that come about, same thing with the NPA 
and so on. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson maybe I should make the last 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   If allowed, lest I get misunderstood, I need 
to credit the new leadership of the DPCI, I think they are 
20 
busy rebuilding that institution, I think General Lebeya and 
quite a couple of other officers with whom I had met and 
who are now back, very professionally attending to these 
cases. 
 
Show 
commitment 
that 
a 
professional 
law 
enforcement Officer needs to exhibit, so I think we 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 70 of 203 
 
acknowledge the work that they are doing including what 
the NPA is doing to fix a broken system.  So it shouldn’t be 
like all is lost they are doing nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no that’s fine I think we – I 
think everyone understands that we certainly talk about the 
past what was – what may have happened during that time 
and certainly, I think, you are right that the new leadership 
in some of these institutions seem to be committed to 
fixing the problems that have been there and I think that is 
why, I think the Commission will be – is getting a lot of 
10 
cooperation from them – from the leadership, thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:   If I could take that issue further, 
Chairperson, what we will do is, we will ask Mr Molefe 
outside these proceedings to give us details of any of 
those interactions so that we can pursue it with the Law 
Enforcement work stream. Now what was the reaction to 
your request to the DPCI?  This is the letter that we were 
looking at Mr Molefe, in other words, did they exceed to 
your request and pursue the matter? 
MR MOLEFE:   The – there was a matter that, as I 
20 
indicated, which said that they were prioritising certain 
cases, maybe we should look for that exhibit and look at 
what the response is but up until my term of office ended 
there was no progress in this matter.  Of course, in the 
end, Chairperson, we had to institute action in the High 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 71 of 203 
 
Court of the Republic of South Africa to try and compel 
them to do their job asking them to explain to the Court, 
why is it that they are not doing their job.  Of course, their 
response to that, was to raise a technicality that says – 
which now links what they are doing to what the new 
Minister was – Mr Maswanganyi was saying, to say, you 
don’t have the authority to take us to Court because your 
Board did not have a quorum when this decision was taken.  
Of course, I must say it was incorrect because I had a full 
mandate taken in 2015 which allowed us to investigate and 
10 
to litigate on the matters arising out of the investigation. 
ADV SONI SC:   So, because of their lack of response to 
your request for assistance from the Law Enforcement 
Authorities, you turned to the Courts, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   I’m going to deal with the judgment in a 
moment but effectively the relief you sought was a 
mandamus, an order that they must do their job as you had 
set out in your letter of request. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Now – and then you’ve explained to the 
Chairperson that their response was to take a technicality 
– a technical point that the Court didn’t have – the Board 
didn’t have the locus standi to bring the application 
because it wasn’t a quorum. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 72 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now I just want to, Chairperson to 
take…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to say, of course it was – it 
must have been an indictment on the executive that a 
Board of a parastatal, a government entity had to go to 
Court to get another organ of State to do its job when 
actually, if you were getting proper support from the 
Minister responsible for PRASA, once you reported these 
things to the Minister to say, the police are not doing 
10 
anything about our cases, we have been – we have laid 
complaints, they are not doing anything, it would – it 
should have been the Minister who speaks to the Minister 
of Police and tells the President this is – the Hawks are 
not doing their job and then the Hawks should have been 
talked to, to say why you not doing your job and of course 
if Parliament was giving you support, Parliament could 
have called the Hawks to Parliament as well to say, what’s 
going on, why are you not doing this but to have a situation 
where taxpayer’s money now must be taken to pay lawyers 
20 
in order to get an organ of state to do its job when another 
organ of state is saying, here is a problem it falls under our 
jurisdiction please do your job.  It is a very strange 
situation.  But of course, you – you had nowhere else to go 
by then that is why you had to go to court. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 73 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson.  But to the 
credit of SCOPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  SCOPA did call them 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To come and account on what they were 
doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  About these cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  General Ntlemeza was there. 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  And Major General Khana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Of course, in their answers they sounded to 
have been at sixes and sevens because they were really not 
– Mr Ntlemeza had – General Ntlemeza had just recently 
been appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  And they were really not able to give – 
20 
answer properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To answer properly. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To those questions but SCOPA did attempt… 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 74 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To get them to address issues but nothing 
happened after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  They were not called back later on 
to say, you have just been appointed maybe you do not – 
you have not familiarised yourself with what has happened.  
Go back, come back in a month’s time, tell us what you 
have identified as going wrong and what you are going to do 
to fix it. 
MR MOLEFE:  They might have been called but this 
10 
particular day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  We were together in the same meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Where of course they were disputing what I 
was reporting as being done by PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Without any factual basis for their rejection.  
I do not know if they were called back later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  And what they said when they went back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  The reality of the matter is that we are sitting 
here today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Not much [intervenes] 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 75 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  There is no evidence of anything much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless, unless. 
MR MOLEFE:  That has been done except what we have 
taken to the courts as PRASA and their matter of Swifambo 
which resulted in the setting aside of – of that contract it 
having been declared invalid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you had not taken the matter to 
court it looks like not – nothing would happen.  Nothing 
would – nobody would have done anything. 
MR MOLEFE:  It would have been business as usual. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been business as usual. 
MR MOLEFE:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you can see.  Now the Chairperson has 
said that it is strange that you had to go to court to get the 
law enforcement of authorities who are other organs of 
state to – to do their job.  They took a technical point.  And 
just ask you – Chairperson may you refer to the judgment 
because the learned Judge in rejecting the point made by 
the police that there was no locus standi raises this issue 
and I just would like to place it on record Chairperson.  May 
20 
I ask you to turn to page 206 of Bundle D which is part of 
the judge – which is page 3 of the judge – page 5 of the 
judgment of the court?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page in the bundle? 
ADV SONI SC:  Page – the Bundle – the judgment starts at 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 76 of 203 
 
page 202 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  202? 
ADV SONI SC:  202. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And paragraph 5 is the passage.  But 
perhaps I should just place on record who the parties are 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  At page 202 Mr Molefe you wills see that 
this is a case in the Gauteng Division of the High Court and 
10 
it is case number 36337/2017 and the parties are PRASA, 
who is the applicant and OUTA this is the organisation 
undoing tax abuse which is an intervening party and the 
respondents 
are 
the 
Directorate 
for 
Priority 
Crimes 
Investigation and the National Prosecuting Authority.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now again just as background to the 
judgment they had taken 2 points.  The first point is that 
you did not have locus standi and OUTA ought not to be 
20 
admitted as an intervening party.  Is that what happened? 
MR MOLEFE:  That was correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now at paragraph the learned judge just 
gives a comment about the approach adopted by the 
respondents and I would just like you to read that into the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 77 of 203 
 
record. 
MR MOLEFE:  The honourable judge at paragraph 5 says: 
“I consider it inimical to the interest of justice that where 
matters of public interest are concerned organs of state 
indulge in costly squabbles of interlocutory and somewhat 
technical nature rather than engage with the merits of the 
matter in an expeditious, responsible and transparent 
manner.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And in fact, again just to give it context 
they had not filed an answering affidavit in regard to the 
10 
substance of your complaint as set out in the case. Am I 
right? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  So at paragraph 14.1 on page 218 of the 
papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just – I just want to. 
ADV SONI SC:  And paragraph 14.1 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is before we go there. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not answer the substance of your 
20 
complaint they filed an affidavit taking these preliminary 
points but the Judge went on to deal with the merits in the 
matter.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they ask to be given an opportunity if 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 78 of 203 
 
there are – if there are points, preliminary points were 
dismissed to be given an opportunity to file an affidavit to 
answer the substance of the complaint.  Or is that 
something you would not remember. 
MR MOLEFE:  I would not remember because at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  I think I had ceased to be the Chair of 
PRASA> 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh okay, okay.  Okay.  Because it is 
quite strange. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normally when a party who has been sued 
takes a – the kinds of points that they took they would 
nevertheless answer the substance of the allegations on the 
merits on the basis that if the court dismissing their 
preliminary points the courts should have their response to 
the complaint.  Now one wonders whether the reason why 
there was no response – there was no affidavit containing a 
response was that whatever they could say was going to be 
embarrassing to them.  In other words, they did not have a 
20 
defence to the allegations on the merits that is why they did 
not put them up. 
MR MOLEFE:  My – yes Chairperson my view is that they 
had no defence because all they could say is that no 
PRASA is wrong we are in fact intending to act on your 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 79 of 203 
 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.   
ADV SONI SC:  Again, I will address that issue through the 
judgment Chairperson the question of what was go happen 
to the substantive – their response to the substance of the 
trial.  Again, at paragraph 14 the learned Judge deals with 
the question of costs and at 14.1 he again comments on the 
unacceptable approach adopted by the respondents.  Could 
you read 14.1 into the record? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson 14 – paragraph 14.1 of the 
10 
Judgment reads as follows and it relates to the costs: 
“As indicated earlier in this judgment it is to be deplored 
that organs of state engage in interlocutory skirmishes with 
each other whilst the main battle is raging around them and 
they by their conduct delay any meaningful engagement 
therein.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And then if you look at the order itself you 
will see on page 219 Mr Molefe in paragraph 15.1.1.2 an 
order is made as to when the answering affidavit is to be 
delivered.  And you will see that the learned Judge gave 
20 
them just 5 days to deliver their answering affidavit.   
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then I just want to refer to the last 
paragraph of the judgment and the order and can you just 
indicate what the order was because it seems to express 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 80 of 203 
 
the learned Judge’s displeasure at the approach that the 
respondents have adopted?  Paragraph 5 of page 220. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson paragraph 5 of page 220 it is 
paragraph 5 of the judgment and it relates to the order 
handed down by the court.  It says: 
“The 
DPCI 
is 
ordered 
to 
pay 
PRASA’s 
cost 
of 
the 
interlocutory 
applications 
including 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
condonation application and PRASA’s counter application 
on the – on the scale as between attorney and client 
including the costs of three counsels were employed.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a – it is a – it is an order – it is a 
very unusual or rare order for a court to make and – and it 
is made when a court strongly disapproves of the conduct of 
the party against whom the order is made. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“On an attorney and client scale and it is costs of three 
counsels.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Three counsels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a – It may be – it may be a pity if 
20 
person who did not do their job did not get to be the ones to 
pay those costs because in the end those costs come from 
the taxpayers it is the institution that pays. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That it is persons that fail to do their job.  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 81 of 203 
 
So – but it reflects how displeased the Judge was with the 
conduct of DPCI.  Okay so I thought I would just mention 
that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It reflects very serious disapproval by the 
Judge of DCPI’s conduct in – in the matter. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is so Chairperson I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now you carry on at page 100 and – 
paragraph 115 of your affidavit Mr Molefe where you point 
10 
out that the DPCI then filed an answering affidavit and 
PRASA filed it replying – sorry its answering affidavit and 
PRASA filed it to a replying affidavit but the matter has not 
been taken further.  And then you make the point: 
“It is clear that the interim boards that were installed simply 
do not have the determination of the dismissed board to 
hold those world power to account.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson that is right. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh sorry. 
MR MOLEFE:  I know the page… 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  That is at page 28 Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  At page 28.  I found it and that is paragraph? 
ADV SONI SC:  Paragraph 115 right at the end of the page. 
MR MOLEFE:  I have … 
ADV SONI SC:  So effectively what you are saying here is 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 82 of 203 
 
we pursued this matter.  We got it into court.  We got past 
the technical stage but nothing has happened since then 
when you say this is partly due to the fact that the interim 
boards that succeeded yours – your board did not pursue 
the matter with the required enthusiasm in zeal.  They are a 
public entity or a public board should do. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see Mr Molefe this is really very 
serious.  Even when your board had been dismissed nobody 
can say that whoever the different Ministers of Transport 
10 
have been after your board had left would not know that 
there was this litigation that was still pending.  If they were 
really interested in dealing with corruption and if they were 
really interested in having the cases that you had sent to 
the HAWKS being properly investigated and the relevant 
Portfolio Committee in Parliament ought to have known that 
your board had launched an application and had since been 
dismissed.  They ought to have kept an eye on what would 
the next board do about that litigation.  They ought to have 
– Parliament ought to have asked where is that litigation 
20 
now, why is it not being finalised?  They ought to have 
asked the Minister.  They ought to have called the interim 
board and asked them about these things if they were doing 
their oversight functions properly.  And if there seemed to 
be too much of a delay, they ought to have been interest to 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 83 of 203 
 
say why.  Why are these matters not being finalised?  These 
are old matters.  So it is as if – it creates an impression as 
if any corruption connected with PRASA was not supposed 
to be investigated.  Any criminal cases arising from 
corruption in PRASA were not supposed to be investigated 
by the police, were not supposed to be investigated by the 
HAWKS.  It creates that impression and it is very worrying.  
Some of these things I am saying you do not have to say 
anything but it is just the impression that one gets to say 
you have Ministers, you have a government that almost 
10 
[indistinct] says we are committed to fighting corruption.  
You have got point help parties that almost [indistinct] 
saying we are committed to fighting corruption.  You have 
got Ministers who will say the same thing in – on public 
platforms.  Members of Parliament, everybody but here is a 
case from PRASA – here are cases.  Here is a board that 
has been trying to get these cases investigated.  Nobody 
comes up to say, this board has been dismissed it had 
reported these cases let us pursue them.  Nobody does 
that.  And if the HAWKS do not do anything nobody does 
20 
that.  The President ought to have been interested to say to 
the HAWKS, how can the Board of PRASA have to take you 
to court to do your job?  And when your board is not there 
the President is supposed to say to the Minister what is 
happening?  Both the Minister of Police and the Minister of 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 84 of 203 
 
Transport, what is happening about those cases that were 
reported to the HAWKS?  Why are people not doing what 
obviously is what they are supposed to do?  Cabinet must 
be 
interested 
in 
these 
things. 
 
Parliament 
must 
be 
interested in these things.  The governing party must be 
interested in how its own employees perform their job.  Are 
they displaying a fight against corruption that the party says 
it is committed to?  Is that commitment to fighting 
corruption manifested in how people conduct themselves in 
performing their job?  It is very, very worrying.  It is very, 
10 
very worrying.  You may have been doing your job what you 
considered to be your job but it raised a lot of things 
because it gave an opportunity to various institutions, 
various functionaries if they were committed to fighting 
corruption to join you, to assist you and when your board 
was – had been dismissed to take that baton and say we 
want to see those cases finalised.  And if there were people 
who were not doing their job get them fired.  Because you 
are employed to do a particular job and if you cannot do it 
you must not be there.  Now five years later not much has 
20 
been done about these cases.  And then of course when you 
get reports that say certain things about certain connections 
you have got to prove and see whether the reason why 
nothing has been done has got anything to do with who are 
being mentioned in regard to certain things.  It is very 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 85 of 203 
 
concerning.  Okay Mr Soni sometimes I say these things 
that I say that you – you might feel that you have to say 
something but you do not need to but I think you want to 
say something Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Just two points Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
I 
think 
quite 
clearly 
from 
what 
the 
Chairperson has said.  Those who sing that they are 
fighting corruption but not acting probably think that all that 
they have to do is to sing a ritual. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  About corruption.  That is one point.  The 
second point is that yesterday the Chairperson said that 
perhaps there is a need to look at the record of discussions 
of some of these Parliamentary committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  The – my last Minister of Transport when he 
was still a member of the PCOT, Portfolio Committee on 
Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Was very much opposed to the fact that the 
PRASA Board was taking Law Enforcement Agencies to 
court to compel them to discharge their responsibilities and 
obligations to the citizens of this country.  Probably those 
records are made available that could be picked up in those 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 86 of 203 
 
discussions.  But it shows that there was no willingness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  To deal with these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  And that would also perhaps show that we 
read earlier on projects that Mr Montana was giving to Ms 
Gomes in his notes and one of those projects is called the 
Moloto Corridor. The Minister, my last Minister of Transport 
Mr Maswanganyi when he got into office that was one of the 
projects that he wanted to see happen regardless of what 
10 
National Treasury had said about the viability of that project 
because National Treasury had said this is not viable.  But 
it is one of the projects they wanted to happen because all 
you needed is to commit capital to it.  And those who are 
beneficiaries of it will get what they have to get out of it. 
ADV SONI SC:  What happened to that project the Moloto 
Rail Project? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well I – when I left office we had said to the 
Minister – the earlier Minister, Minister Dipuo Peters that 
this project is not doable based on the study that was done 
20 
by National Treasury.  I do not know what is the status of 
that project now. 
ADV SONI SC:  But to your knowledge it has not been 
implemented? 
MR MOLEFE:  It has not been implemented.  There was 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 87 of 203 
 
towards the last days of my office some pronouncements 
that there will be the Chinese investors in that project with 
– but I have got no further information on that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Chairperson you will forgive me that I 
am going to go to a parallel concern that you have raised 
with the witness.  The Chairperson has raised… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we are at one but I suspect we 
about to finish. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my assessment correct? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because then we can finish and allow Mr 
Molefe to – to go.  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  The Chairperson has raised with you the 
following concern that Law Enforcement Authorities did not 
do their job.  Notwithstanding the fact that all these 
complains had been made to them and nobody followed up 
upon it.  But there was two – there were two civil cases that 
PRASA had been involved in.  The one is the Swifambo 
matter in which you were successful to the tune of R3.5 
20 
billion.  Do you know whether any attempts were made to 
secure the money that PRASA had paid those contractors 
for a contract that was said to have been cancelled? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson I – I do not know of any effort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 88 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  To secure that money – to get that money 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  And the application was that the – the 
contract was unlawful, it needed to be set aside and the 
court did so.  The second part of it was that the locomotives 
will be returned to the – our argument should be returned to 
the supplier and the supplier should pay back the money.  
At the time R2.6 billion had already been paid and only 13 
locomotives had been delivered when we said we do not 
10 
want anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  To be delivered.  In the interim if Counsel 
allows me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  Vossloh was bought by a company – a Swiss 
company called Stadler Rail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  And when I was already now out of the Board 
of PRASA I got communication that said Stadler Rail want to 
20 
talk, they want to – to make good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  Of the wrongs of Vossloh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  That they were willing to consider paying 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 89 of 203 
 
back the money but they also would not be willing to – they 
can leave those locomotives which are already in the 
country if there was any adjustment should be made for 
them to be usable, they were willing to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  But suddenly the person who approached me 
said no, no they have now advised that they do not want to 
go that route.  Obviously, I would still have referred 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  ... and because I would not have been able to 
make any decision on the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  H’m.  So... so... that... that money, I think uh, 
it is... it is one of the issues that uh, perhaps the 
Commission...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...should ask...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...the executive authority...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...and the board to explain...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  ..what is being done about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 90 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  I know that Minister Maswanganyi when he 
came here...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...uh, one of the things that he was saying 
that “no, those locomotives uh, are okay.  They... they should 
be used”.  And that was against the backdrop of the 
judgment...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...[laugh] that had that uh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  ...that contract um... uh-uh, so... so uh, um, 
that... that is what we have to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  So to the best of your knowledge 
and uh, I accept that you say that your knowledge might not 
be up to date but to the best of your knowledge, those 
locomotives are probably sitting somewhere uh, that were 
delivered.  Sitting somewhere ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, the ones that had not been delivered yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then those that had not been 
delivered...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...uh, 
remained 
undelivered 
because 
nobody has um, nobody has done anything about these 
matters after your board had left? 
MR MOLEFE:  Those that had not been delivered are 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 91 of 203 
 
probably still in uh, uh, Barcelona. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Uh, 
and 
those 
who 
were 
delivered 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...as I understand it, with the uh, there was 
an application for the liquidation of Swifambo Rail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...and they were put to auction.  I do not know 
how many of them...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...were sold in that auction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  And uh... and... and the 
money, I think you said R 2,6 million that had already been 
paid? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was already paid to Swifambo or 
to...? 
MR MOLEFE:  That... that... that is so, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Although, Swifambo was conduit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  He said, “get the money...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  and...[intervenes]  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 92 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  pass it on. 
MR MOLEFE:  and he passed it on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Most of it to ...[indistinct 00:02:34] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that... that is the money that uh, 
you are saying you... you do not think anybody has done 
anything to get... to get it back despite the judgments 
declaring that the contract was uh, invalid? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  And I recall that. [laughs]  I recall sending a 
WhatsApp message to the interim chairperson of the board 
uh, the last uh-uh board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kweyama. 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kweyama.   
MR MOLEFE:  Ms Kweyama.  Um, and... and it was in the 
context of an article I had read in the... in the papers that 
uh, a previous board would be called to parliament to 
account and I said but I had asked ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...for this public hearing...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...and I would welcome that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 93 of 203 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Um, and... and then I said, “well, you 
know...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct 00:03:39]  
MR MOLEFE:  ...your next step now is to get the... send 
these locomotives back and get your money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...in your country”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  H’m.  But at the end of that there was nothing 
more uh, that was done. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I mean, certainly, there should be no 
scarcity of state functionaries and bodies who are interested 
in that money being recovered uh, from the president 
through the minister to the relevant DG’s through the board 
um, to say the courts have made a declaration uh, steps 
should be taken to recover that money. 
 
Uh, obviously, those who have got the money might 
resist but the fact that they... they will resist is no ground 
for... for... for people to do nothing, to try and get... get it 
back.  H’m. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  May it please, Chair.  The second matter, 
again parallel to what the Chairperson raised about, the 
criminal issues is, in the Siyangena matter, the amount 
involved, if I understand it now, with interest and so on, is in 
the region of R 6 billion.  Would that be about correct from 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 94 of 203 
 
your understanding? 
MR MOLEFE:  The... that is the estimated uh, amount Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in regard to that, that issue, you first 
took to court in 2016.  There were technical points taken and 
you... then, after you left, the sitting review was filed and 
that is now to be heard in August.  Do you know why it is 
taken so long to get that matter in court and debated before 
a judge? 
MR MOLEFE:  As I recall it again it was uh, a... a problem.  
Uh, when an interim board was appointed before the interim 
10 
board of Ms Kweyama.  Uh, that interim board wanted to 
enter into negotiations to pay money to Siyangena and not to 
proceed uh, with the... with the uh, civil action. 
 
Uh, and perhaps that then links uh, very well with the 
evidence of mister... Mr Holele, where he says that uh-uh, 
Mr Moodley came to demand payment uh, on the basis of 
what they said, the guarantees that a... that a PRASA had... 
had given to uh, Siyangena and we said also ballooned by 
that time to R1,5 billion. 
ADV SONI SC:  So what we have is probably raised 
20 
yesterday.  You do not have a permanent CEO.  You only 
have acting CEO’s.  You do not have a permanent board.  
You only have acting boards.  And for five years, effectively, 
nothing has been done to secure or PRASA what is it due.  
To have criminals behind bars and to get the money back on 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 95 of 203 
 
behalf of taxpayers. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson, in respect of the Group Chief 
Executive, yes.  For five years approximately there was no 
Group Chief Executive but in the intervening period there 
had been two uh, interim boards. 
 
And there is also now um, the administrator who is 
like a substitute board.  So at that level of accounting 
authority, there were uh-uh, people who... who should have 
acted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know, two comma something 
10 
billion.  One comma... you are talking lots of money here, 
taxpayer’s money.   
Why despite all of this being well-known to the 
Portfolio Committee of Transports to members of parliament 
to uh, uh, the executive, whether the executive at that time 
was the executive now, why is there no clear action that is 
known in the public domain is being pursued to get this 
money back because this is taxpayers money? 
 
So that... that is part of the worry.  Why... why do you 
have five years without an institution having a CEO?  Why 
20 
interim boards?   
I mean these things... these questions just make you 
think that there may be quite something big behind this 
whole thing.   
This... how... how can... how can there be no visible 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 96 of 203 
 
action to recover R 2,6 billion lost by an organ of state from 
different functionaries and uh, state organs? 
And yet we know the people on the ground have lots 
of needs that they need to be... that need money.  Why does 
it... what... why... why have this been just left hanging?   
Nobody seems to say, “hang on.  We remember what 
Mr Molefe’s board was doing.  He is no longer there.  But 
what has happened to that money?” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “Who is following this up?”  Why is it like... 
10 
like everyone just wants that to be forgotten?  So the... the 
Commission must look into that.  Who has been doing what 
and why have they not been doing... who has not been doing 
what they are supposed to do?   
Because, I mean, with the Covid-19 problem, I mean, 
a lot of money has been diverted from what projects that it 
was going to... to... to do.   
Now all of that money would have been needed but 
without... even without Covid-19 uh, you know, if... if... if any 
organ state loses money illegally that should not have lost 
20 
there.  There should be a clear determination to... to recover 
it. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I guess Mr Molefe [laughs] you may 
be looking at me and maybe feeling that I am... maybe 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 97 of 203 
 
feeling some frustration that you know about.  [laughs] 
MR MOLEFE:  I have permanently.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  [laughs] 
MR MOLEFE:  I can... I can sense the Chairperson’s 
frustration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  But there is also something very interesting.  
I must say to counsel that...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...we had said we would connect the dots.  I 
10 
think Chairperson has connected a lot of dots.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  So we are not going to have to spend a lot of 
time on that.  [laughs]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] Okay.  [laughs]  Well, I am happy 
if that is... ja, but if there is anything left we can... we can 
finalise it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  But why... you... you yesterday said 
20 
you would like to be given that opportunity and the 
Chairperson has laid the stage for you to... to connect the 
dots as you see it.   
We may see it differently and the Chairperson 
differently from me but it would be helpful to have your 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 98 of 203 
 
views, you being at the core phase of one of the biggest 
battles 
that 
state-owned 
entities 
have 
had 
with 
the 
executive.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Would you... would you then ...[indistinct]  
MR MOLEFE:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  H’m.  H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson, uh, thank you very much.  Uh, 
the... we have traversed in a... in our evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Uh, a number of uh, key uh, areas of... of 
what happened.  Uh, we... we spoke about, in the course of 
evidence uh, a report called PRASA uh, in turmoil but uh, 
which is, I think uh, SS6A uh, PM16, I think we said.  That... 
that is what it is going to be.   
 
And in the evidence that we... we have dealt with, we 
have seen a lot of correlation of what... what was happening 
in a number of institutions or what ministers were doing uh, 
or what Portfolio Committee has omitted to do or failed to 
date.  I speak of parliament and so on. 
20 
 
And all of it, when one looks at it and... and of course 
we... we go over some exhibits in the... in the... in the files 
here, linked to for 
example 
uh, the 
evidence of 
Mr 
Mamabolo.  I will not go specifically to that exhibit. 
 
When one looks at what has happened up until now, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 99 of 203 
 
it all starts with the board of directors on November 20... 
November uh, ...[indistinct 00:15:20] 2014, né?  2014.  
 
Demanding assurance that the R 2,4 billion that the 
Group Executive, Chief Executive through the FSAIP was 
recommending for approval by the board uh, ostensible for 
the modernisation uh, of Braamfontein depot that would have 
included some construction work uh, the...  
 
That... that would also have included the patches of 
rails and turnouts.  Um, and we said, “you say this is urgent.  
We agree.”  But as a board we cannot just agree to 
10 
R 2,4 billion being spend without being assured that the 
process followed was proper.  That there was properly uh, 
conducted on... on this tender.   
 
And being the Chairperson, of course, we have been 
lied to.  The result was that we had stop that uh-uh, 
procurement for ...[indistinct 00:16:43] for that time because 
it had to be done properly.   
That had not been done properly and the reports 
were there.  So that is that side.  The second issue is, when 
we learnt about the interim report of the public protector and 
20 
we insist that the Group CEO who has had that report and 
which raises a number of questions that PRASA had not 
responded to adequately, be made available to the new 
board. 
 
There 
are 
two 
key 
events 
happened 
and 
uh, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 100 of 203 
 
immediately we received... I... the board received the letter 
of Mr Montana saying uh, he will not seek extension of his 
contract. 
 
Of course, he had verbally told me when I had just 
been appointed chairperson of the board that uh, you know,  
he... he... he had been there for too long.  He had previously 
wanted to leave but uh, the... the board at the time uh, 
prevailed on him to stay. 
 
So that is that.  Now, we as a board accept mister... 
the fact that Mr Montana will not seek a new contract and 
10 
that uh, we will not give that contract but also, of course, 
now we are beginning to look at the investigations that have 
to be done, arising out of uh, um, the... the report of the... or 
the general and of course uh, what uh, what the public 
protector later on said. 
 
The... 
the 
report 
of 
mister... 
the... 
the... 
the 
annexures to the affidavit of uh, Mr Mamabolo uh-uh, 
indicates that from that time onwards, Mr Montana became 
very busy to meet with a range of organisations uh-uh, one 
of them being SATAWU, a union that was benefiting out of 
20 
PRASA contract through uh, Black Star and uh, it’s Bashumi 
Trust. 
 
And he was bringing in groupings like your MKMVA 
which... which is supposed to be the former military veterans 
uh, of the... the ANC.  Uh, the student organisation called 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 101 of 203 
 
COSAS, 
the 
Congress 
of 
South African 
Students, 
an 
organisation which I mentioned earlier on in my evidence, 
called the South African Commuter Organisation led by a 
man, Stephen Sangweni.   
 
They attempted also to draw the South African 
National Taxi Corporation (SANTACO) into this company.  
The campaign is to say, “bring Montana back.  We want him 
back.” 
 
And we must demonstrate that there are many 
institutions that say that “this is our man”.  Of course, I... I... 
10 
which is uh, document I have not tabled but if the counsel 
might want to do so.  It is a small thing.  So again a... a 
whistle-blower’s report that shows how directly Mr Montana 
himself was involved in this thing. 
 
And how in one meeting when he was confronted by 
SATAWU in Cape Town, he says... and when they say to him 
“but why do you want us to support your campaign because 
you told the board you want to go?  The board accepted your 
wish”.   
 
And he said, “ja, I blundered.  I did that but I thought 
20 
that this board would... the chairman and the board would 
persuade me... or try to persuade me to stay on.” 
 
The Chairperson will recall that this is similar to what 
I have said in my earlier evidence of how his contract earlier 
on had been extended because he said to the board he was 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 102 of 203 
 
leaving. 
 
The board uh, said, “no, but why are you leaving?” 
and then he... he went to... he came with the bogus uh, a 
fake uh, offer of a job from a company called Gibson Fatal 
Fertilisers. 
 
Uh, and the board had to then match and actually did 
better... to better what he said was the offer and that was not 
true.  So it is clear that he thought he would do a similar 
thing uh, to this board. 
 
Now, I am... I am... I am dealing with that.  And then, 
10 
of course, you being to realise that your Portfolio Committee 
is beginning to talk his language uh, which... which is in this 
thing.  Um, so...[intervenes]  
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
Would 
the 
statement 
being 
the 
...[intervenes]  
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
The 
PRASA 
in 
Turmoil. 
 
There 
uh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I remember.  Mister, sorry.  Not... do 
not speak too far away from the mic otherwise the transcripts 
to the record what is happening. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, in turmoil.  But maybe I should try quickly 
to bring these matters together.  To say that there is a 
common thread that connects uh, the... the termination of 
uh, the contract of Mr Montana, the acceptance of his wish 
by the board uh-uh, his so-called PRASA in Turmoil. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 103 of 203 
 
The series of media attacks uh, on... on... on... on 
the Board of PRASA, all of which are a substance uh, is 
informed by... by uh, this document called PRASA in Turmoil. 
 
The... the refusal by the Minister of Transport to 
allow the Board of PRASA to appoint a Group CEO, ignoring 
the process of interviews that had happened and later again 
that company is not ready for that. 
 
And then, enforcing on the Board of PRASA an 
appointee who is from her department to be the Group, 
acting Group CEO.  And one of the issues that the board 
10 
disagreed from the ...[indistinct 00:24:38] with the minister 
on, was when she wrote to... to the board to say that uh, she 
has been told that the board is interfering in operations. 
 
Now that again is linked to the document of PRASA in 
Turmoil.  The new person that the minister appoints takes 
queue from these documents and begins to complain that uh, 
the board is interfering. 
 
The minister does not stop there.  She goes on to 
say, “I have directed the acting Group CEO to review the 
practices... the performance of the board on governments in 
20 
accordance with the best practices to determine whether 
they comply with the best practices”. 
 
Basically saying, the board is under administration of 
an appointee of the minister.  So the board is being 
emasculated.   
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 104 of 203 
 
 
Then you have a series of meetings of the Portfolio 
Committee.  Their attack there also is finding its genesis on 
this document, PRASA in Turmoil.   
 
This document, in one page where Mr Montana 
complains, refers to the fact that the board meets too often.  
It should not be meeting more than four times a year.   
 
So those members of the PCOT latched on the 
argument of Mr Montana which shows that we are dealing 
with the coordinated uh, campaign. 
 
Then you have... following this PRASA in Turmoil, a 
10 
meeting convened by the president, whose express purpose 
is to say, “bring him back”. 
 
Uh, and it is saying because he says in PRASA in 
Turmoil, “I am the best... the best thing ever that this country 
has had in the rail business and I understand also the... your 
political uh, economic demands.   
Uh, 
your 
political 
situation 
and 
the 
regional 
challenges of regional integration.  I am the only one who 
can implement the decisions of the African Union.  Nobody 
else here”. 
20 
 
And he says that this board knows nothing.  The 
board led by Molefe knows nothing.  All it knows is uh-uh, to 
interfere.  
 
And they say that we are causing divisions amongst 
management and so on.  It is again in this document.  Uh, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 105 of 203 
 
and in this document, they say that there is a state of 
paralysis in the company because the board is fighting with 
management which is not true. 
 
So the president, Mr Jeff Radebe, called us to that 
meeting.  They allow him to present a long speech informed 
by PRASA in Turmoil.  And it is all about bad the chairman of 
the board and the board is.   
 
Of course, to some extent, also saying how bad the 
Minister uh, of Transport was.  So it goes on like that.  Then 
you... you have the minister who later on says to us “stop 
10 
your investigations”.   
 
And she says so.  Uh, again there, I have given... 
there is a document here that shows uh-uh, one of the 
regular briefings to the minister uh, on what we were 
uncovering in our investigations and steps that we have 
taken. 
 
My letter, also, in reply to the minister when he said, 
“close down the investigations” detailed the importance of 
these investigations and what we had done. 
 
And it also says to her “by the way, do not plea 
20 
ignorance”.  Not in so many words, of course, but you know 
that we have been giving you reports and it sets out 
meetings uh-uh that had taken place one at the international 
airport.  One at the Werksmans’ offices.  The other one at 
Rivonia Offices. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 106 of 203 
 
 
And these reports were revealing some of the things 
that Chairperson was talking about and connecting the dots, 
saying the behaviour here appears to suggest that there are 
some people in powerful places who are benefiting and 
would not want action to be taken.  So I part that, the 
minister having failed to do that, look for other ways of 
dealing with us.  But before that, we make an application 
to law enforcement agencies and the NPA, which we 
referred 
to. 
 
Nothing 
happens. 
 
Instead, 
they 
get 
emasculated, good people are removed who would have 
10 
been able to ensure that action is taken, they are removed.  
Those who are brought in, who are cronies, do nothing.   
 
There is systematic also weakening of the NPA, of 
course, following the appointment of Mr Shaun Abrahams.  
So all of these actions seemed to point to protect the 
protection of certain individual of a group – certain 
individuals or a group of people or a section of a people. 
 
As if that is not enough, the minister now appearing 
to be frustrated, that none of their tricks in the book are 
working, summarily dismisses the board of directors and, 
20 
having done so, does nothing about the work that that 
board had done.  
 
But it does not end there.  We have the governing 
party, we have the government, we have had senior people 
who are officials, all of these things were reported to them.  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 107 of 203 
 
So therefore, when you connect all of these dots they 
suggest that there might well be a common purpose served 
by this corruption that is happening and none of these 
people with the authority to make decisions wanted to 
upset 
the 
applecart, 
they 
wanted 
to 
preserve 
that 
continuing as it was continuing regardless of how much 
misery was caused to the poor people of this country, the 
poor commuters of this country, by billions which have 
been siphoned off which should have served our people. 
 
But that situation also suggests that if there are 
10 
good people out there, they are overwhelmed by the bad 
apples so much that the bad apples have more power than 
them and therefore they are unable to assert their authority 
over the bad apples. 
 
But in a broader context, what does this say to us?  
It says to us the democracy that so many paid so dearly for 
is being undermined, is being incapacitated but it also says 
that you are actually, by failing to deal with these sorts of 
things, creating a situation where you might end up with an 
autocratic rule in this country where the constitution of the 
20 
country, the institution of public representation of our 
people become meaningless to the poor, that they no 
longer serve as the voice of those who elected people who 
serve in those institutions.   
 
We do not have to go too far but to look just here, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 108 of 203 
 
the United States and see what is happening there and I 
mentioned this yesterday, that there is a danger in allowing 
individuals to have unassailable powers in a democratic 
order.  In fact, in the debate of the impeachment, many 
speakers, speaker after speaker said when we adopted the 
constitution of the United States of America we were not 
adopting a constitution that would institute a monarchy, so 
we do not want a king, we want a commander-in-chief who 
is the president and representing our people. 
 
If you look at what is happening in Brazil now, you 
10 
have a president who does not care how much Covid-19 is 
killing our people.   
 
So, Chairperson, in summary, therefore, what the 
evidence that we have given here points to is that state 
capture seems to have successfully captured key people in 
the governing party and the governing party, l having been 
captured, allowing further capturing of organs of state 
through which it has to execute its responsibilities as a 
government of the day or as the state.  So it, itself, has 
been paralysed and it also says that.   
20 
 
I am not going to make many people happy but it 
also says that the governing party and various political 
parties need to take a lesson from relief of this corruption 
fight that unless you deal frontally with corruption in 
political 
institutions, 
particularly 
those 
who 
have 
the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 109 of 203 
 
authority to act on behalf of the poor people, using 
parliament, using other organs of state as instruments to 
advance the interest of the poor people and to protect their 
wishes 
 
expressed 
in 
 
term 
after 
term 
election 
in 
parliament.  Unless you deal with that question within the 
parties themselves, this corruption is not going to end.  It 
is not going to end. 
 
So – and I say I am not making myself – I am not 
covering myself in glory in saying what I am saying, but it 
has to be said because we have tried to allow things to 
10 
happen, expecting people would act in a manner that is 
ethical, that reflects courage by those put in office to lead 
that places the interests of the people and the country first 
rather than sectarian interests of little groups in the 
country.  The interest of the constitution first, we will try to 
get that to be done.  It is not happening.   
So we need to have a crescendo of voices now that 
say act and act now, you are wrong, do not sing us a ritual 
about how you are opposed to corruption.  Demonstrate 
with your action, demonstrate in how you hold organs of 
20 
state, including boards and management of the SOEs, 
accountable, that you mean business, as professed in your 
anti-corruption statement. 
I thought I should make that point and to say all of 
what we have seen starts with the removal of Mr Montana.  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 110 of 203 
 
The question that then would arise is was he placed there 
for a purpose rather than that of running this all important 
public good delivering organisation and to serve the poor 
people of our country, to ensure that we achieve the 
objectives set out in the mandate of the legal succession 
to South African Transport Services Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Molefe, you might not have 
covered yourself in glory by saying certain things in the 
eyes of certain people but I think certainly a lot of what 
you have said needs to be said and in the eyes of those 
10 
who put the interests of the country first and in the eyes of 
those who are really committed to serving the public, 
serving the poor.  Some of the things you have said should 
make them very happy. 
 
Part of what you have said raises issues that I 
continue to be concerned with as I look at what this 
Commission is doing and what it should be doing and what 
areas it should be focusing on and I know that for quite 
some time I have been placing a lot of emphasis on the 
issue of the role of parliament in terms of oversight but it 
20 
may be that part of the problem is that if a senior official 
within the governing party, for example, is aware that 
another senior member of the governing party or a leader, 
one of the leaders is involved in wrongdoing, he or she will 
be afraid to do what is right and say but you cannot do this 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 111 of 203 
 
and the organisation must take action when you, as a 
member of the organisation, do this because you are 
bringing the name of this organisation into disrepute.   
 
He or she may be afraid to take that stand because 
maybe she needs or he needs that leader in order to 
progress in her political career or he or she needs the 
supporters of that leader to vote for him or her next time 
she wants or he wants to ascend to a higher position or 
next time he or she wants to have his or her name put in 
the list of those to go to parliament or to the legislature. 
10 
 
And if I am in a parliament and I am member of the 
governing party and I see that somebody within the 
governing party, who is in government, who is in the 
executive, whether the person is President or whether the 
person is a minister and I know my obligation to hold them 
to account and I want – I am thinking about doing my job 
properly, I get scared because that person, if he is 
President, he is the person that I rely on to make me a 
minister or to make me a deputy minister, or he and his 
supporters are the people that I rely on to be made 
20 
Chairperson of a committee in parliament.  If I stand up 
and do my job properly in parliament in keeping with the 
oath of office that I have taken when I became a member of 
parliament, which effectively says the country first, the 
people first,  I decide not to do my job properly because I 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 112 of 203 
 
cannot be minister, I cannot be deputy minister, I cannot 
be chairperson of the portfolio committee if I displease 
these people if I ask them difficult questions, they are 
going to ask me, are you a member of my party or are you 
a member of the opposition?   
 
And if I am a minister and I see another colleague 
who is a minister, that he or she is not doing the right 
things, here is a board that is supposed to have enough 
members to have a quorum, he or she is not appointing 
those members, the board has to go to court in order to get 
10 
a job done that is supposed to be done by an organ of 
state,  I do not say anything even if I am aware because I 
read about these things in the newspapers because I know 
that if I raise those things I am going to be unpopular 
within government, within the executive or within the 
governing party and I will be limiting my career or I will be 
without a job if I get fired either for this or for something 
else because I am asking too many questions.  
I am supposed to maybe mind my own business, 
look at my own department.  I am not supposed to ask 
20 
these questions. 
 
And if I am the President and I see that a certain 
department is not run properly and that minister is not 
doing a proper job maybe I will not fire them because they 
have a constituency that I am going to need when next 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 113 of 203 
 
time I want to be re-elected as President.   
If I take action against that minister who has got 
that kind of support, he or she is going to go out and 
mobilise support so that when next I want to be elected or 
re-elected as President, I will not succeed, other people or 
somebody else will be put up. 
 
It may well be that unless these issues are 
resolved, whatever we do as a country in trying to reduce 
the levels of corruption significantly, it is not going to be 
effective.  It may well be that we need a President who is 
10 
going to be in a position to stand up in parliament and say 
when members of parliament coming from the governing 
party do not ask me difficult questions to hold me 
accountable, I know they are not doing their job and they 
should not be here. 
 
When 
you 
do 
not 
ask 
my 
ministers 
difficult 
questions, coming from the same party, I know you are not 
doing your job but your party requires you to do this job, 
and it is not a career-limiting thing for you to ask difficult 
questions to ministers coming from your own party, to your 
20 
own President in the interests of the country and in order 
to make sure that these high levels of corruption are 
brought down. 
 
It may be that the country needs somebody who can 
stand up and say let us start with me.  Start with me.  The 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 114 of 203 
 
more questions you ask me, the more I realise you are a 
good member of the governing party, you are a good 
member of parliament. 
 
Well, I am sure some will say I am just dreaming, 
such a thing can never happen but it seems that we need 
something quite drastic, maybe we need somebody who is 
not going to be looking at even re-election to start 
changing things, we need somebody who is just going to 
say let us do the right thing, everybody.  Let us do the right 
thing for the sake of the country.  The country comes first.  
10 
The people come first.  Because when there are elections, 
I am sure every political party will tell the voters the 
people come first but we need to see this in action, we 
need to see in action, we do not need speeches of how 
people say they are committed to fighting corruption.   
 
When it comes to this Commission, we also need 
actions to show that people are supporting the Commission 
by coming to the Commission to give evidence.   
You have come to the Commission, you have come 
here many times and you have given evidence.  I have no 
20 
doubt that there are many other senior members of the 
governing party who know a lot that should come before 
the 
Commission 
who 
have 
not 
come 
before 
the 
Commission. 
I know there are others who have come before the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 115 of 203 
 
Commission and we are grateful for what they have done 
but there are many others, I have no doubt, that have not 
come before the Commission.  And because they do not 
come 
to 
the 
Commission, 
give 
evidence, 
to 
give 
information 
to 
the 
Commission, 
they 
are 
failing 
to 
contribute to a solution to some of these problems of state 
capture and corruption in our country. 
But I thank you for the contribution that you are 
making.  There will be people who will come and they will 
give evidence and some of them maybe will say that what 
10 
you have said is not true and whatever and I have made no 
findings about whether what you say is true or not, I will 
make findings later on but for the fact that you came here 
and you said things that you believe need to be said, you 
have shared with the Commission your experiences.  I am 
grateful that you had the courage to do that and I just wish 
there were more people who would come and help the 
Commission in that way.  Thank you very much, Mr Molefe.  
Thank you. 
MR SONI SC:   Mr Molefe, after that rousing address by 
20 
the Chairperson, on behalf of the PRASA stream, I just 
want to say to you I know how you must have agonised 
over whether you should make the revelations you did.  
Can I just make this observation?   
True patriotism is speaking truth to power in the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 116 of 203 
 
most difficult circumstances and we hope that your coming 
here is going to be a clarion call for other patriots who 
have done so much for our country because unless patriots 
like you do come, we are not going to find the solution that 
the Chairperson has been asked to forge so that we can 
move the country forward. 
 
Mr Chairperson, may I say you are not the only 
dreamer as John Lennon said, we all are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you very much, we can 
release Mr Molefe now.  Yes, we are at two minutes to two, 
10 
I think we will take a lunch break that will go up to three. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But once again, thank you very 
much, Mr Molefe, we really appreciate your having come 
here and assisted the Commission, I really appreciate it 
very much.  Thank you very much. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is my pleasure, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You are released.  We will 
take the lunch break and resume at three o’clock. 
MR SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV SONI SC:   We finished with your third affidavit which 
appears at Bundle E as EXHIBIT SS7C, at page 386.   You 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 117 of 203 
 
don’t need to go to it, I am just pointing it out to you for 
the purposes of the record. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now during your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Soni I may have missed 
some of what you have said, I guess you need to remind us 
which Bundle we are using, which Exhibit and then what 
page you want us to look at or did I…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   It’s just for the record…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   So, it’s Bundle E1, EXHIBIT SS7C, page 
386, that’s the last document, I’m going to go back to 7B in 
a moment Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, you go ahead I’ll wait for when you 
go to a particular page and then – ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   You might recall that in that affidavit you 
dealt with what was contained in paragraph 21 in your 
founding

in 
the

just for, also the benefit of viewers and listeners and so 
on, just to re-cap what evidence and what issues she was 
dealing with when we stopped last time and then announce 
this is what she will cover today and then you start asking 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 118 of 203 
 
her. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   So there are two basic matters I’m going 
to raise with you today Ms Ngoye, the first is relating to 
Siyangena’s response to the allegations at paragraph 21 
which dealt with the property dealings between Mr Montana 
and Mr van der Walt who was Siyangena’s lawyer, you 
recall those four properties that you dealt with? 
MS NGOYE:  I do Chair. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   I know you didn’t have anything to do with 
the 
opposing 
affidavit 
but 
because 
it’s 
an 
opposing 
affidavit to your founding affidavit I just want to place it on 
record through you.  The second issue I’m going to raise 
with you is what you raise in paragraphs 53 to 58 – sorry 
to 62 of your affidavit of February 2020, that was your 
second affidavit. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that’s where you deal with the 
attempts by the Director General to settle certain matters 
20 
which has become an issue as – well you were not here but 
Mr Molefe raised that issue as well.  So, if I could ask you, 
then, Ms Ngoye to go to your review application now and 
those relevant pages are at Bundle B2 EXHIBIT SS3. 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson, I’ve got here Bundle B SS3 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 119 of 203 
 
Court applications continued. 
ADV SONI SC:   That’s the one. 
MS NGOYE:  Is this the one? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   If you just went to page 401, I just want to 
alert you to the document that we are talking about – sorry 
it’s page 400 rather than 401, have you got it? 
MS NGOYE:  I’ve got it Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remember to, once again, just 
remember to once again mention or identify what the 
document is and in regard to what matter with reference to 
the case number and the parties. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, so this is case number 14332 of 2018 
in the Gauteng Division of the High Court and it’s a matter 
between PRASA and Siyangena Technologies, do you 
remember this matter? 
MS NGOYE:  I do Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now just for orientation sake again, you 
20 
will recall – sorry what is this application about? 
MS NGOYE:  This application, Chair, has been brought by 
PRASA to set aside the contract that was concluded 
between PRASA asking the Court to review and set aside 
the contract that has been concluded by PRASA at the time 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 120 of 203 
 
that, you know, the whole deals were entered into, it 
involved a number of contracts, sub-contracts relating to 
the tenders so to speak that PRASA had concluded with 
the company Siyangena.  So, following the investigations 
that were conducted by the Board it was felt that it was 
necessary to review the contract and set it aside. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now, the – just again, for orientation, this 
was the second case that PRASA had brought.  There was 
a review application in 2016 and you did deal with it, but 
just again, for completeness sake, what happened to that 
10 
application? 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson the first application, the review 
application, in fact, was deposed to by Dr Popo Molefe as 
he then was the Chairperson of the Board and during that 
period the issue that we needed to deal with or that we 
were found wanting on as PRASA was the issue of the – I 
think it’s the 180 days if I’m correct within which to bring 
your own review as a state owned enterprise and because 
we were way out of time in relation to bringing this matter 
to Court, the Court found that there was no basis for us 
20 
because we were out of time so that’s why we lost that 
review in relation to that 180 days requirement that was 
there. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that decision was made without 
considering the merits of the case? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 121 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair, we didn’t go into the 
merits of the case. 
ADV SONI SC:   As a result of a decision of the 
Constitutional Court in the Gijima matter the technical 
point fell away and you were now entitled to persuade the 
Court to hear your review application. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair, the Gijima case, 
obviously you know, decided on the basis that legality was 
important more than the 180 day timeframe that was 
required.  So, it’s on that basis, we believed as an 
10 
organisation that we needed to take the matter up again 
and bring it to Court.  That’s why we have the second 
review which I have then deposed to because at the time, 
Dr Molefe had already left PRASA. 
ADV SONI SC:   And just again for completion sake this is 
the matter that’s going to be heard, I think, on the 19 t h of 
August this year, is that correct? 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now, in your…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can keep your mic on Ms Ngoye. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Okay, thank you Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   In your founding affidavit you raise a 
number of concerns, we’ve been through, about the 
propriety of the process and the lawfulness of the process 
but in paragraph 29 in particular – paragraph 21 you dealt 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 122 of 203 
 
with the question of property dealings between Mr Montana 
and Mr van der Walt, you recall that? 
MS NGOYE:  I do recall Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now, in the opposing affidavit as it is 
called it starts at page 400, Siyangena opposes the whole 
application, the whole review application, is that correct? 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now who deposes to this affidavit? 
MS NGOYE:  The deponent, Chair, is Thomas Andreas 
Dubek. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And in his capacity as the CFO. 
MS NGOYE:  He’s the CFO of the first respondent 
Siyangena Technologies. 
ADV SONI SC:   Can I then ask you to look at page 516 of 
that – well of the papers but it’s a continuation of that 
affidavit.  Now, in this part of the affidavit Mr Dubek deals, 
generally, with the allegation that the property dealings 
between Mr Montana and Mr van der Walt, in some way 
taints the award of the contract to Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  I know that Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   And I just want to place on record what 
their position is in regard to the broad allegations you 
make.  Can I ask you to look at paragraph 176 in regard to 
how the property dealings started, would you read that into 
the record? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 123 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  At paragraph 176 of the affidavit, Chair, it 
reads, 
“During Siyangena’s involvement in Isams Phase 
one, Montana and Ferreira had a discussion in 
regard to Ferreira’s other business interests which 
inter alia related to investments in immovable 
property and construction”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Who is Mr – well we know who Mr 
Montana is, that’s the former CEO of PRASA, group CEO of 
PRASA, is that correct? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   And Mr Ferreira? 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Ferreira was the attorney involved in the 
transaction. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, Mr van der Walt was the…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:  Oh, sorry Mr van der Walt was the attorney, I 
can’t remember who Mr Ferreira – just remind me please 
counsel. 
ADV SONI SC:   Wasn’t Mr Ferreira on the Board or a 
representative of Siyangena and was he not the person 
20 
who wrote a letter in June 2014 before the R2.5billion 
contract was concluded? 
MS NGOYE:    That’s correct Chair, I recall, there’s too 
many of these people Chair, you will pardon me. 
ADV SONI SC:   Okay so this is now Mr Ferreira from 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 124 of 203 
 
Siyangena who Mr Dubek says had a meeting with Mr 
Montana? 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Okay and at paragraph 177 he goes on – 
Mr Dubek goes on with the interaction between Mr Ferreira 
and Mr Montana. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   What does he say? 
MS NGOYE:  Okay in response,  
“Mr Montana noted that, similarly he was also 
10 
involved in such industries, Montana enquired as to 
whom Ferreira used to assist him in this regard as 
he was always on the lookout to improve his team 
and in particular, was looking for a good lawyer.  
Ferreira then referred Mr Montana to van der Walt 
whom was, at the time, the attorney that attended to 
the transfers of the immovable property acquisitions 
within Ferreira’s other interests and whom, from 
time to time, recommended and was a partner in 
some ventures which came across his table in his 
20 
day-to-day activities”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now, Mr van der Walt is described as 
being 
Mr 
Ferreira’s 
lawyer 
in 
respect 
of 
property 
transactions. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 125 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:   What is your knowledge of Mr van der 
Walt’s involvement? 
MS NGOYE:  My knowledge, also, Chairperson was that Mr 
van der Walt was also Siyangena’s attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I know that this is not your affidavit 
that you are reading from but based on your knowledge of 
the papers involved in this matter, namely PRASA’s 
application to Court, are you able to put a time when the 
deponent might be talking – when the time was when he’s 
talking about Montana and Ferreira having this discussion, 
10 
which year and so on, is that something you, based on 
your knowledge of the papers are you able to say because 
it doesn’t say here when it was. 
MS NGOYE:  It doesn’t say Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not able to say? 
MS NGOYE:  I’m not Chair, I think I suppose one would 
surmise that it was during the times that Mr Montana 
started with his property transactions but I’ll have to be 
reminded of the years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m it may be that when one reads your 
20 
founding affidavit and reads the paragraph to which this 
deponent is referring to, one might be able to say it was 
earlier than a certain event or that kind of – so it might be 
important to have an idea when this discussion happened, 
okay. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 126 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, he says though, Chairperson, if you 
look at page – paragraph 176 it was during the IS and AS 
phase one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so when was that? 
MS NGOYE:  Phase one would have been – remember we 
had the two – the confederation cup which was 2009, 
phase one would have started just, you know, 2010/2011 
round about that time Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MS NGOYE:  That would have been the time when the 
10 
phase one of the tender for the Siyangena process started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   And phase two started around June 
2014…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chairperson there’s quite a 
number of phases, if you recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Phase one, phase one extension and then 
phase two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, I think that’s helpful too, if 
20 
phase one was around 2010/2011 I think that timing makes 
quite some sense, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, and then at paragraph 178 Mr Dubek 
goes on about the nature of the relationship, could you 
read that into the record. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 127 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Paragraph 178 reads this Chair, 
“Neither Ferreira, Siyangena or any other entity 
associated with either of them had any knowledge 
of subsequent dealings between Montana and van 
der Walt until November 2014 when, during a 
conversation with van der Walt, Ferreira became 
aware of these dealings.  Ferreira’s requests to van 
der Walt was to ensure that any and all dealings 
with Mr Montana by van der Walt were completely 
above board and completely transparent.  Van der 
10 
Walt, 
heeding 
Ferreira’s 
request 
and 
after 
requesting Montana on various occasions to deposit 
monies into his trust account to continue with their 
proposed joint 
venture 
decided not to include 
Montana in the dealings and proceeded with the 
transfer of the subject properties on his own accord 
without Montana”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you obviously have no knowledge of 
the dealings between Mr van der Walt and Mr Montana or 
the 
dealings 
between 
Mr 
Ferreira 
through 
his 
other 
20 
holdings, for example, TMM and Mr van der Walt? 
MS NGOYE:  I don’t Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chair, may I just point out that 
subsequent to all of these we are going to be leading 
evidence in the next two days dealing with these matters 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 128 of 203 
 
and I merely want to place Siyangena’s response in context 
so that when you look at that evidence you will know what 
the real facts are as emerge from documentary evidence 
not from the say so of this witness but I thought I should 
just  place that on record that it is important you are aware 
of what Siyangena is saying was the relationship and in 
comparing it to what the documents will show.  Then if you 
go on to page – sorry if you go on to paragraph 180, what 
does he say then, Mr Dubek? 
MS NGOYE:  He says, 
10 
“What is more, what the nature and extent of the 
dealing were between van der Walt and Montana is 
completely 
unknown 
to 
Siyangena 
and/or 
any 
person, particularly Ferreira related to it”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, then if you look at paragraph 185, 
what does he say? 
MS NGOYE:  Paragraph 185 says, 
“The striking absence of primary factual allegations 
to this effect in the founding affidavit is telling.    
PRASA is challenged to produce primary admissible 
20 
facts in relation to the unsubstantiated contentions 
levelled against in this regard”. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is what, Chairperson, you will be 
asked to assess after we’ve led that evidence.  We don’t 
need to go into the further aspects at that stage but later 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 129 of 203 
 
in his affidavit at page 516 of the recorded pages – oh 
sorry page 604 if you could go to please. 
MS NGOYE:  I’ve got it Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   If I could ask you to read paragraph 393.3 
into the record please Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  Chair paragraph 393.3 reads…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry before you do that, can I just say 
that paragraph – the heading to paragraph 393 is – are 
paragraph 21 and sub paragraphs of your affidavit in the – 
your founding affidavit in the matter. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry. 
MS NGOYE:  Okay paragraph 393.3 reads, 
“I 
have 
indicated 
herein 
above 
that 
I 
cannot 
comment on the relationship between van der Walt 
and Montana save to confirm that as far as I know 
van der Walt is a developer or property investor in 
his own right whilst Montana obviously displayed a 
desire to become involved in the business of 
property development and investment.  Van der Walt 
20 
and Montana conducted their business amongst 
themselves and I can only refer to the affidavit 
deposed to by van der Walt in this regard, which is 
an Annexure to these papers”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Then can you look at paragraph on the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 130 of 203 
 
following page which is page 605, paragraph 393.7. 
MS NGOYE:  393.7? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, that’s just lower down on that page. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, I’ve got it Chair, it reads, 
“There is no allegation that Siyangena paid van der 
Walt 
any 
benefit 
to 
use 
any 
of 
the 
alleged 
transaction with Montana”. 
ADV SONI SC:   And at 393.8? 
MS NGOYE:  It reads, 
“There is no proof or allegation that Montana 
10 
received any benefit since the factual end result of 
the transactions between van der Walt and Montana 
is that van der Walt asked that Montana, on their 
relationship and is at present the only and sole 
owner of these properties via his entities”. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:  And in 3.3.8.1 Chair it reads, 
“Nowhere in Ngoye’s affidavit is one single fact 
which could imply or indicate that Siyangena is 
linked to any benefit actually or even potentially 
20 
received by Montana”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Right will you just finally read paragraph 
394. 
MS NGOYE:  Paragraph 394, 
“As a consequence of the aforesaid, I submit that 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 131 of 203 
 
Ngoye failed to establish any grounds on which a 
Court can realistically rely to assume any undue 
benefits from Siyangena to Montana”. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson I just place that on record 
because I will come back to it at a later stage after we’ve 
led the evidence and obviously after Siyangena, Mr 
Ferreira and hopefully Mr van der Walt will respond to what 
is said in allegations that have already been presented to 
you.  Now Ms Ngoye can I then ask you to turn to your 
affidavit at Bundle E1, which is EXHIBIT SS7B which starts 
10 
at page 277 but I want to refer you to page 300. 
MS NGOYE:  I’ve got it Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now again, just to orientate you Ms 
Ngoye, you might recall on the last occasion you were 
giving evidence you gave evidence on this affidavit up to 
paragraph 52 and then we went into your allegations in 
regard to the property transactions. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, I want to now return to the 
allegations you make in regard to PRASA in general. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Okay Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now one of the matters that you dealt with 
at paragraph 51 in this affidavit – sorry it’s on the previous 
page, is what you call, in paragraph 53, the interference of 
Ms Makhubela in the contractual relationship between 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 132 of 203 
 
Siyaya and PRASA or the contractual dispute. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in paragraph 53 you say, in the 
previous section I note the interference by the Chairperson 
of the Board in Management matter, is that what you were 
referring to? 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now just again to orientate ourselves, 
your complaint there was – what was the nature of your 
complaint there? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Well in this regard, Chairperson, we were 
dealing 
with 
an 
issue 
where 
we 
believed 
that 
the 
Chairperson of the Board was interfering in management 
issues and the fact that she wanted to settle or had 
contemplated settling a particular matter which we, as 
PRASA and especially the fact that we were dealing with it 
in the legal department and believed that we had huge 
prospects of success she wanted it settled and she wanted 
it settled without the involvement of the legal function and 
had indicated that fact. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you already gave evidence on that 
issue…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:  I have Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   But there is, just for, again orientation, 
who was the party involved, the other party involved? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 133 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  This particular transaction, Chair, which the 
Chairperson of the Board at the time sought to settle, was 
Siyaya 
and 
you’ll 
recall, 
Chairperson, 
Siyaya 
is the 
company where Mr Makhensa Mabunda was involved and 
it’s one of those which was under the S banner of 
companies, I think it was called, S companies. 
ADV SONI SC:   And the amount involved – it was an 
arbitration a series of matters that had been referred to 
arbitration. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair there was about five of 
10 
them that had been referred to arbitration. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what was the total amount involved? 
MS NGOYE:  Roughly it was about 58 Chair, with interest it 
came to about 60 that we had to go fight in Court. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now one of the things that always strikes 
me as – in one of the matters you dealt with on the 
previous 
occasion 
where 
Ms 
Makhubela 
says, 
given 
PRASA’s financial dealings every year, what is R60million, 
was that not her attitude? 
MS NGOYE:  It was her attitude Chairperson. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright but now you dealing with a slightly 
although connected partly to Siyaya you dealing with a 
slightly different issue perflated.  
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now you refer in this to a meeting if you 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 134 of 203 
 
look at paragraph 54 held on the 25 April 2019. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And well firstly let me ask you were you 
present at that meeting? 
MS NGOYE:  I was not invited to this meeting Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  But that means you were not present? 
MS NGOYE:  I was there Chair yes, I was not present. 
ADV SONI SC:  But you have subsequently been given a 
copy of the Minutes of that Meeting. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes correct I received a copy of the Minutes 
10 
from the Acting Group CFO of PRASA Ms Thobeka Mohlati 
at the time. 
ADV SONI SC:  We will get to the circumstances and that 
that came to your notice.  But what was the meeting about 
in general? 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson this meeting was about various 
matters.  In fact, the meeting was called by the DG, the 
Director General of the Department of Transport Mr Hlabisa 
– let me get his surname Chair.  What is his name?  Mr 
Chris Hlabisa was the DG of the Department of Transport.  
20 
He had called this meeting Chairperson because apparently 
various 
suppliers 
of 
PRASA 
had 
complained 
to 
the 
Department about PRASA litigating you know unnecessarily 
and had suggested that their matters be settled and 
therefore had referred these matters to the Department and 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 135 of 203 
 
requested the Department’s intervention in the settlement of 
these matters. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now you cannot vouch for the correctness 
of the minutes because you were not at the meeting. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  But all we have are the minutes. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I – I do not want us to go through the 
whole minutes but the minutes appear at page 367.   
MS NGOYE:  I have got it Chair. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And what does the first page read? 
MS NGOYE:  The first page it is on the letter of the 
Transport Department Republic of South Africa.  DG 
meeting with stakeholders that have financial disputes with 
PRASA.  It is dated 25 April 2019 the time is 12:30 and the 
venue 
was 
the 
DG’s 
boardroom 
DOT 
which 
is 
the 
Department of Transport. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Can I then ask you to turn to the next 
page and Item 1.  I am not going to go through everything. 
MS NGOYE:  Sure. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry who – you know what – how many 
matters were discussed at this meeting? 
MS NGOYE:  I do Chair.  I do have roughly.  I know two of 
the matters and they are significant matters that were 
discussed at this meeting was the Siyangena matter.  The 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 136 of 203 
 
settlement of Siyangena matter as well as the settlement of 
the Siyaya matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  And I know there was a Bigale [?] matter also 
that was referred to as part of the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you – did you not cover this last time? 
ADV SONI SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This meeting? 
ADV SONI SC:  No. 
MS NGOYE:  No we did not Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I see markings that I made so I may 
have made them when I was reading.  But I also thought that 
I had heard you speak about a meeting where the DG was or 
acting DG I am not sure was trying to push for the settlement 
of certain matters. 
MS NGOYE:  It was not this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not cover this? 
MS NGOYE:  No it was not this one Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both of you cannot be wrong.  Okay 
alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  You never can tell Chairperson.  But I – my 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 137 of 203 
 
note on my file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Tells me that we had not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Covered this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  I just want to say that paragraph 1.1 tells 
you what the meeting is about.  Could you just read that into 
the record please Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  Paragraph 1.1 reads: 
10 
“The acting Director General Mr Chris Hlabisa henceforth 
Chairperson welcomed all members to a meeting to discuss 
financial disputes with PRASA’s service providers that were 
invited to present their cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not earlier on give a different 
name for the acting DG? 
MS NGOYE:  No I said Mr Hlabisa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No the name of… 
MS NGOYE:  Chris Hlabisa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said a name other than 
20 
Chris.  I see here they say Chris Hlabisa. 
MS NGOYE:  That is him – that is who I said Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Chris. 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Chris Hlabisa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 138 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to have heard something else.  Well 
I happened to remember that the acting DG or DG was 
Hlabisa but… 
MS NGOYE:  Hlabisa it is Mr Chris Hlabisa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I heard something different.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  I know what happened Chairperson.  The 
witness did not remember the first name. 
MS NGOYE:  The first name and I went back to check. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then she went back to check. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – oh. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – ja.  I think – I think that is – ja okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now I just want you to look at paragraph A 
and perhaps read paragraph A into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that under … 
MS NGOYE:  Is that of 1.2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under paragraph 1.2? 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh sorry 1.2A yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1.2A. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  1.2A Chair the – it says: 
“The Chairperson highlighted the following salient matters. 
a. The meeting was as a result of serious allegations by 
some companies and or service providers who claimed 
that they are owed monies for services rendered to 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 139 of 203 
 
government especially its entities such as PRASA.” 
Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And b. 
MS NGOYE:  B Reads: 
“Other service providers went as far as reporting PRASA to 
Parliament to the Minister and to the Accounting Officer of 
the Department.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And C. 
MS NGOYE:  C. 
“Parliament noted the accusations and referred the matter 
10 
back to Minister and the Accounting Officer.” 
ADV SONI SC:  So these were service providers who were 
going to complain to if I may put it higher authorities. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Against PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  But let me ask you this.  At that stage in 
regard to Siyaya and Siyangena what was the position in 
regard to the court processes? 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson we had not finalised the litigation 
20 
processes with both companies in fact and in fact Siyaya 
was in the process of having its companies liquidated and 
Siyangena were – I mean it has been common knowledge 
and public knowledge that we have been in court with 
Siyangena you know for quite some time. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 140 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  By the time this meeting took place had your 
– had the issue that Judge Makhubela raised later had that 
been sorted out? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair what becomes interesting is that this 
meeting happens after – you know we have been to court to 
go and you know retrieve the monies that you were unduly 
sought to be taken… 
CHAIRPERSON:  April 25, 2019? 
MS NGOYE:  That is right Chair.  At this time the court 
process of getting the money back in relation to the Siyaya 
10 
matters had been finalised.  In fact, we had received the 
monies back from the sheriff.  So this matter comes after 
that and it becomes interesting that you know it is still 
brought back to the Department for discussion.  When in fact 
when we took it to court, we had to get the permission of the 
Minister Chairperson.  If you recall part of the evidence that 
I gave was that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I remember that evidence. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You and the then Chairperson were asked 
20 
by the Minister to make reports and so on. 
MS NGOYE:  To go and make submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But I am – what I want to understand 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 141 of 203 
 
now is whether insofar as Siyangena was concerned at this 
meeting what it was talking about was the money that they 
alleged they were being owed being the same money about 
which you had gone to court and – and you were waiting for 
them to take the next step as I understand your previous 
evidence.  It was after you – you went rescission. 
MS NGOYE:  That is Siyaya Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Siyaya. 
MS NGOYE:  So we have got Siyaya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Which is the one that we went to rescission to 
court for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Siyangena is the one that is still in court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is this about Siyangena? 
MS NGOYE:  This is both of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I am now concentrating of Siyaya. 
MS NGOYE:  Siyaya is the one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Siyaya is the one where the 
former Chairperson got involved. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am – so my question is whether 
insofar as Siyaya was in this meeting or was representing 
this meeting was that what they were about? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chairperson.  So they wanted that money 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 142 of 203 
 
that we went to go get back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja through the proper processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the ball was in their court was it not? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you had obtained a rescission. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they needed to take the matter further 
if they wanted to. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry Ms Ngoye can I ask you to turn back 
to page 368 and I know I only asked you to read three of the 
paragraphs but can I also ask you to look at paragraph e and 
what does that paragraph say?  Paragraph E. 
MS NGOYE:   So paragraph E of the minutes says: 
“These accusations were to be addressed and concluded 
before the Adminis – before the new Administration is 
appointed.”   
ADV SONI SC:  So what is that in reference to the new 
20 
administration? 
MS NGOYE:  Well Chair I mean I – one can only surmise.  I 
mean – as I have indicated I was not at the meeting but this 
was just before.  There was a change between the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the elections. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 143 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  That is it.  Before the new Ministers were going 
to be appointed for the different portfolios and so on.  And so 
this meeting was just before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so…. 
MS NGOYE:  It is interesting that the minutes record that it 
was important that these decisions were to be made before 
the new administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  You know came into effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The new administration is a reference 
10 
to the administration that would follow after the general 
elections. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now if you then look at page 369 and this 
deals with the presentation to be made on behalf of Siyaya.   
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I just ask you if you look above in the 
block above that who represented Siyaya at these – at this 
meeting? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson Siyaya was represented by Mr 
Makhensa Mabunda together with Mr Prince Paweni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  Then we do not need to look at the 
discussions.  I would just like you to turn to page 371 and 
look at the decision that was taken in relation to the Siyaya 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 144 of 203 
 
matter.  It is at page 371 paragraphs 3.1.9. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair I have got it.  It reads at a it reads? 
“The DOT will intervene to address the litigation issues and 
see if government was not unnecessarily losing money 
through this process.  Siyaya DBI to assist the panel – this is 
b. by availing itself when requested to clarify additional facts 
in their submission should any of the submitted information 
be unclear.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I just ask you to look at the top of that 
page and in regard to amount that Siyaya said was owing to 
10 
it what figure is – is set out? 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson in paragraph c of the minute what 
I am reading here it says: 
“The 
total 
litigation 
amount 
by 
Siyaya 
DB 
was 
R111 641 219.18.  This amount is made up of capital 
expenditure 
of 
R82 978 039.84 
plus 
interest 
of 
R28 663 179.34.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now two years ago what was the amount 
that was the settlement amount? 
MS NGOYE:  It was interesting Chairperson because we are 
20 
talking about the figure of about 60 million – 58/60 million so 
it has gone up now.  In this meeting we talking 87 million 
Euros so it is interesting.  But now it is plus interest.  I mean 
82 million plus interest it is about 111 million.  It is almost 
double the amount that was initially the amount in dispute. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 145 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Anyway, the DO – the Department of 
Transport 
was 
then 
to 
engage 
with 
PRASA 
and 
the 
contractors? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct.  But Chairperson may I say 
this?  I have – you know I find it very interesting that this 
matter was dealt with in this manner.  This matter was not 
coming to the Department for the first time.  The Siyaya 
matter.  As I indicated Chairperson when the Minister at the 
time took office, Minister Blade Nzimande we brought this 
matter to him because we were – we did not know where to 
10 
go as I indicated previously in my evidence.  And we raised 
this matter with him to say, Minister we need your help, can 
you please assist us in recovering this money for PRASA?  It 
becomes interesting that the very same Department that you 
know had knowledge of this meeting – of this meeting and of 
the reports that we had given is dealing with it again as 
though it is a new matter and they did not know about it.   
ADV SONI SC:  And then ask you in the block under that 
there is a presentation by Bagele Construction. 
MS NGOYE:  It is Mogale. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Mogale. 
MS NGOYE:  Mogale Construction. Yes Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Did you know anything about that – I 
do not want you to go into any details? 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  I knew about the Mogale matter.  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 146 of 203 
 
Chairperson this was one of the matters that we were 
dealing with as the legal function within PRASA.  We were 
once again in dispute with Mogale.  It started a while ago it 
was a 2010 matter that related to the consultancy agreement 
that we had.  And it is interesting also if I may Chairperson 
to indicate that in fact not so long ago PRASA was 
successful in this matter where Mogale was claiming about 
R36 million from PRASA that the matter was finally decided 
through an arbitration and we were successful and defeated 
Mogale in the matter. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And yet the indication was if – if what was 
being contemplated the matter was – would have been 
settled with PRASA paying something or the other at least. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before Siyaya approached the acting DG 
as a result of which the acting DG called this meeting had 
there been any time after the court proceedings in which 
PRASA was involved to stop to get the money from the 
sheriff was there a time when Siyaya came back to PRASA 
and say, let us talk about this matter?  Or they just went 
20 
straight to the acting DG of Transport without approaching 
PRASA again after that period of litigation? 
MS NGOYE:  To my knowledge Chairperson – I mean unless 
they approached the Group CEO I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 147 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  But to my – in fact if that was the case I would 
have expected to have been asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  As the Group Executive responsible for legal 
but to my knowledge there was no such interactions between 
and Siyaya at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Chairperson I am constrained in light of 
what Mr Molefe said to refer you back to paragraph 1.2 on 
page 368 because what the DG says there is: 
10 
“The meeting was as a result of allegation by some 
companies who claimed they were owed monies especially 
by – which they had – where they had rendered services to 
government.” 
And then the point is that they had approached Parliament, 
they had approached the Minister and so on and so on.  So I 
am merely making the point that it was not simply going to 
somebody it was that whole gambit of people that Mr Molefe 
was talking about.  And I just submit that one needs to keep 
those nuances in mind Mr Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright then Ms Ngoye if you could look at 
paragraph – page 375.  This is the third presentation and the 
presentation is now made by Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 148 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  If I could ask you to go back to page 369 
and just indicate who made the presentation on behalf of Mr 
Siyangena of … 
MS NGOYE:  Siyangena. 
ADV SONI SC:  Siyangena yes.  You will see it in the top 
block. 
MS NGOYE:  Siyangena – yes under 2.3 of the minute 
Chairperson it says: 
“Mr P S Reddy MD Siyangena Technologies and Mr Tom 
Dubeck CFO Siyangena Technologies.”   
10 
And obviously Chairperson I have just read the opposing 
affidavit that was deposed to by Mr Dubeck himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  So a presentation is made and then if 
you look at the next page 376 the decision is summarised.  
Could you indicate what is said at paragraph a? 
MS NGOYE:  a.  At 3.5 paragraph a says: 
‘The DG emphasised that he would not want government 
money to be wasted on litigation matters which would only 
benefit lawyers and not government.  The CFO must take 
20 
away the issue of the legal debacle re the September court 
date.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And when there is a reference to the 
September court date to your knowledge what does one – 
what was that a reference to? 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 149 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  They were supposed to have gone to court.  
Chairperson the – the Siyangena matter there has been quite 
a number of postponements you know in the matter.  I mean 
we have now even postponed from January this year to now 
August this year so it obviously would have been a date 
where we were supposed to have gone to court with 
Siyangena. 
ADV SONI SC:  So – so it was supposed to have gone to 
court in September last year? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And what seems to be the plan is to take it 
away from the hands of the court. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
ADV SONI SC:  And leave it in the hands of the Department. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the same Mr Dubeck who says, you do 
not have a case. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Is the person who goes with this request. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then Ms Ngoye if you could just read 
paragraph 3 because it now comes back to you the DG asks 
the PRASA CFO to do certain things. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 150 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Which – sorry which paragraph Counsel? 
ADV SONI SC:  Paragraph 335B. 
MS NGOYE:  B.  B reads Chair. 
“The 
DG 
requested 
the 
PRASA 
CFO 
to 
check 
the 
submissions that are going to be emailed and describe and 
verify the amounts that are owed to them.” 
Second bullet point says: 
“The CFO should settle the claims as soon as PRASA had 
verified that they had a legitimate claim.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so the acting DG is effectively 
saying the CFO of PRASA – is that the CFO of PRASA that 
you are talking about? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should settle a claim about which PRASA 
has gone to court because PRASA believes Siyaya is not 
entitled to payment? 
MS NGOYE:  Siyangena Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this is Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  This is Siyangena Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I have this… 
MS NGOYE:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mixing them up.  Oh are we on Siyangena 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 151 of 203 
 
now not Siyaya? 
MS NGOYE:  We are on Siyangena now Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  I am re-orientating myself 
from Siyangena to – so from Siyaya to Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja Siyangena remember you said Siyanbenga 
the last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know. 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But [African language].  Okay.  Alright.  
Yes continue Ms – Mr Soni. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  So effectively it was not going to be let 
PRASA’s lawyers tell us it was let the CFO who is a financial 
person because you do not want lawyers to make money but 
it does not matter if PRASA is to be paid – I mean if 
Siyangena is to be paid R5 billion. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  That is the nett effect. 
ADV SONI SC:  And that is effectively the attitude. 
MS NGOYE:  That is the nett effect of what was happening 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so – so when he was talking – when 
20 
the acting DG was talking about the CFO verifying the 
amount and paying he was talking about billions? 
MS NGOYE:  Billions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the matters which he was 
saying should not go to court, should not be dealt with by the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 152 of 203 
 
courts. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes – Yes Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in the last bullet point under C he 
asks the CEO and could you just read that into the record Ms 
Ngoye. 
MS NGOYE:  Under C Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes the last bullet point. 
MS NGOYE:  The last bullet point. 
“The DG requested the CFO to have both Siyangena and 
PRASA lawyers in one team however the DOT will initiate the 
10 
meeting.  PRASA CFO would instruct its lawyers to work with 
Siyangena’s lawyers.” 
I do not know whether it is Chair I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand that to mean Ms 
Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  It is – look Chair I mean it does not make 
sense to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  You know first and foremost I am the Group 
Executive Legal Risk and Compliance in the matter I do not 
20 
get invited to this meeting and then they giving instructions 
to the CFO who is not even – who is not you know dealing 
with these matters on a daily basis and they are instructing 
the CFO to then get the lawyers of PRASA and the lawyers 
of Siyangena together.  The whole to me just does not make 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 153 of 203 
 
sense.  I do not – I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so if one goes back to you the 
evidence you gave last time you have a situation where after 
the Chairperson got involved – well I know that the 
Chairperson from what you said was really interested in the 
Siyaya matter. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not in the other matters. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you said in regard to her and in regard 
10 
to the Siyaya matters after she got involved as Chairperson 
of the Board your department, you and Mr Dingiswayo got 
side-lined. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said that Ms Mogashoa who was 
PRASA’s attorney. 
MS NGOYE:  Diale Mogashoa Attorneys.  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Told I think Mr Dingiswayo that the 
Chairperson had said he should not deal with… 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  He is barred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With you in – ja. 
MS NGOYE:  From dealing with the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the Siyaya claims. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 154 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So here now you are talking about 
Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  It is the same names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But thereto you are saying that the acting 
DG of the Department of Transport which is responsible for 
PRASA calls a meeting at which claims allegedly owed by 
PRASA to various parties will be discussed but their legal 
department is excluded. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yet they will be talking about whether 
10 
those matters should be settled or not. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  I mean I think Chair if I may the whole thing – 
look I suppose you know some things are designed that is 
my view, they are designed and – and the one thing that 
always comes to mind if that I would have obviously raised a 
lot of objections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  At that meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  To having these discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  You know and I guess they did not want that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 155 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  First and foremost, Siyaya was in liquidation. 
ADV SONI SC:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  One would say where is the liquidator. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  Because Mr Makhensa Mabunda you have got 
no authority to be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And those are things that the CFO nor the 
Group CEO of PRASA would not have known to raise you 
know but once again you know it is that thing that says that 
10 
that legal department is problematic.  In fact, they should 
just be kept out of these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is also like even with regard to 
Siyaya that when the settlements – settlement was entered 
into it was not just the liquidators. 
MS NGOYE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who were represented it was people who 
actually had no locus standi. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the liquidators take control of a 
20 
company once it is in liquidation. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the claims were being settled… 
MS NGOYE:  By the lawyers elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With people – with lawyers acting for those 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 156 of 203 
 
people. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  That is correct.  It goes to the conduct of 
those lawyers as well in my opinion Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Because honestly, I mean if you have to look at 
it you really cannot be conducting yourself in that manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Also, in the legal profession he speaks about 
this meeting which they had with the DG and... and about 
these uh-uh-uh, service providers that were owed by PRASA.  
10 
And obviously, my ears, you know, uh, were very keen to 
share what... what is this about now. 
 
Um, and that is when I got to know about the 
meetings and I got to share who the service providers were 
and... and I took issue at exco, you know, with obviously 
what he was... what... what... what he was reporting to exco. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, at that meeting, if you look at 
paragraph 57 of your affidavit, on page 301, you make the 
point that: 
“At the meeting he allude to the possible settlement 
20 
of these matters”. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is the third last line of uh, on that page of 
paragraph 57.  Have you got that? 
MS NGOYE:  That is right here.  “He alluded to the possible 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 157 of 203 
 
settlement of these matters”.  Yes.  I made it very clear to Dr 
Sishi that the suppliers that he was referring to were all in 
litigation with PRASA and thus PRASA... as... as... as 
PRASA we were fighting these cases accordingly. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Then if you look at the next page. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m? 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry.  Perhaps you should read that in 
because it gives...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...because it gives context to how he

reacted. 
MS NGOYE:  “I also indicated that as the legal function and 
having consulted extensively with business on the various 
matters, we believed that PRASA’s prospects of success 
were good um, as the evidence in the CI Rescission matter 
which had saved PRASA some R 16 million which he had 
uh... which had been attached by Siyaya”. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  So if you could stop there for a 
minute?  Clearly your attitude as expressed here and at the 
meeting was, we cannot settle these matters. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Uh, we have got good cases. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  We have a right to do this. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 158 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  What was his attitude?  You then deal with it 
in the rest of that paragraph. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  When I said that Chairperson, Dr Sishi 
state um, that there were complaints even amongst um... I 
will read it here, sir... uh, Chair.  It says that: 
“There were complaints in amongst PRASA staff 
members about how the legal function together with a 
particular law firm, whose name he did not mention, 
was treating employees”. 
Shall I read further? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
MS NGOYE:  “I was surprised and asked him to provide 
details after the meeting.  He suggested that a separate 
meeting would be held on the 9t h of May 2019 to discuss 
these matters.   
However, to date this meeting has not happened but 
on the 22 n d of May 2019, he placed me on special leave”.  
And I have dealt with being placed on special leave in 
another portion of the affidavit which I believe Chair, is going 
to be... a matter dealt with on papers. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Chair, may... may I just deal with that 
issue because ...[indistinct 01:04:22] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
ADV SONI SC:  Uh, in that issue... now, in that affidavit Ms 
Mboya deals with concerns about a possible contract 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 159 of 203 
 
between PRASA and the DBSA.   
Ms Kweyama, at the end of the last week, filed a one 
hundred page response to that and it would not be fair to Ms 
Ngoye to deal with that matter. 
And we thought we would exercise it for now and 
possible deal with it on the papers or if it becomes 
necessary but uh, certainly it should not occupy us now 
because it is a completely separate matter.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, that is fine.  But the suspension 
that you are referring to here, is that the suspension 
10 
separate from... ja, it would be separate from the other one 
because the other one was during Montana’s time. 
MS NGOYE:  Montana’s time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was there a second, third, fourth 
suspension or what? 
MS NGOYE:  [laughs]  Chair, it was my fifth but I lost count 
of how many suspensions I had.  Probably it was the... it is 
the probably the second, third one...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  ...suspension because remember, I was 
dismissed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  I was dismissed.  I was suspended. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 160 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  This time it was... there were threats of 
suspension by the... by the chairperson.  She... she left 
before having done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And then here uh, I was placed on suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  It was... it was special leave.  It was not called 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  It was called special leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MS NGOYE:  Whatever that meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that give you any comfort? 
MS NGOYE:  No, it did not Chairperson.  [laughs]  Because 
bottom line is that my name was out there tainted under the 
guys that I was corrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  You know, that was the... the... the... the 
message that was sent out there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So this is the suspension with which 
you have not dealt in evidence, oral evidence? 
MS NGOYE:  I have not dealt with suspension in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And we will deal with it some other 
time. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 161 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right. 
ADV SONI SC:  It just...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the reason why you cannot deal with it 
now because there is a response from somebody or...? 
ADV SONI SC:  From Ms ...[indistinct 01:06:38] to... to... it... 
because the suspension...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But she was the chairperson of the board 
at the time? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh. 
ADV SONI SC:  And it appears to be somewhat related to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SONI SC:  The suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that suspension is related to the 
development then? 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  Chair, you know, I... I think it... you know, 
one can... it... all these things happened roundabout the 
20 
same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  You know, this... this one happened in May.  
The development of bank issues happened in May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 162 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  I mean, I raised these issues in this meeting 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  ...towards the end of April.  So, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but.. but I guess that the reason why 
you cannot deal with it is because uh, she... she must still 
look at um, Ms Ngoye’s latest affidavit. 
MS NGOYE:  [Indistinct 01:07:24] 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And deal with it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  All right. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is... it is a long, long... a hundred pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  And... and... and in part, that... 
that deals with her special leave or not? 
ADV SONI SC:  I do not think it deals with the special leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, because I am... I am trying to see why 
we cannot deal with the suspension part.  Uh... 
ADV SONI SC:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or... or the suspension...[intervenes]  
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
Chairperson, 
when... 
when 
this 
affidavit...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That everyone be complete. 
ADV SONI SC:  When this affidavit was being settled with 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 163 of 203 
 
Ms Ngoye...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...we understood it... it related to that 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  Is that...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  And that is why we... we just exercised it 
from this part of the...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  But is that still the same 
understanding now because I am trying to see whether... 
because if it is not really related, I would like us to finish the 
10 
suspension uh, and so on.   
If it means that uh, if there was not preparation to 
deal with it, that... that is fine but maybe she can come back 
later this week.  I just do not know how... how involved it 
would be so that we try and finish with that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just keen to finish with that. 
ADV SONI SC:  I... I must confess Chairperson uh, it has 
been a busy period...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  ...because we have been getting lots of dots.  
So I have not considered...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...whether I should deal with the suspension 
separately from that. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 164 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I look at it and come back to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  Uh, uh, that is tomorrow or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Maybe tomorrow you can let me know? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If... if... if necessary uh, depending on how 
much uh, Ms Ngoye will have to say on the suspension 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...that maybe later in the week, she can 
come back and...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...complete it.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, indeed she can.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  All right. 
MS NGOYE:  That is in order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do see that the affidavit it... the 
20 
suspension is already dealt with in an affidavit that you 
already have, hey? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is... that is... 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is...[intervenes]  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 165 of 203 
 
ADV SONI SC:  [Indistinct 01:09:33] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is with the Commission? 
MS NGOYE:  That is right Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So... so the affidavit is there.  It is a 
question of going through it and reflecting uh, the other.  It is 
not like a statement must still be taken. 
ADV SONI SC:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  H’m.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh, so possible uh, let us continue.  Uh, 
reflect on it.  If possible, even tomorrow uh, she... she could 
come in.  I know we have a number of witnesses but 
those...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  It will be short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...are supposed to be very short. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there... there will be time. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Depending what... but later in the week is 
another possibility as well. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 166 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, you say that another meeting was to be 
held.  Was there another meeting? 
MS NGOYE:  It was never held Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...although you were... you were on 
suspension, do you know what happened to this initiative, 
10 
initiative to settle Siyaya and the Siyangena matters? 
MS NGOYE:  Well, I do not think any... anything happened 
Chairperson because uh, the one thing that I must state is 
that the Group CFO, the acting Group CFO at the time, after 
the meeting came to my office and said, “listen, I was very 
uncomfortable to deal with these matters because I do not 
favour them and unless you as the Group executive of Legal 
are involved in all these matters, I am not, you know, to 
continue with these matters”. 
 
As far as I know Chairperson um, these matters 
20 
really effectively died an assured death and... and um, for as 
long uh-uh-uh that... the Group CEO, acting Group CEO was 
around at the time.  So I do not think anything happened of 
it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then coming back to what the acting DG 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 167 of 203 
 
said at the meeting. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  He says that there were complaints even 
amongst PRASA staff members ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...about how legal function together with a 
particular law firm was treating employees.  Was he talking 
about from a resources point of view or was he talking about 
the fact that you would advise that this ought not to be done 
and you could not proceed with this contract and so on? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson, a... as the legal function, we have 
been under siege ever since uh-uh Dr Pop Molefe initiated 
the... the investigation process and PRASA.   
And unfortunately, the role that we played within the 
organisation, I guess everybody assumed that we were the 
enemy, you know, in dealing with the matters. 
 
Our role was to deal with the matters as... as... as 
they happened and uh, obviously, we were not necessarily 
involved in the investigations per se because they were run 
by the board. 
20 
 
But when it came to litigation and in disciplinary 
matters, the legal function was quite involved.  And... and if 
you... if you recall Chairperson, the second affidavit of 
Siyangena was deposed to by me. 
 
Now, I... I... I am a colleague and... and... and, you 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 168 of 203 
 
know, I sit with these colleagues within... within exco and uh, 
clearly people complaint about me uh, and they took it that I 
did what I did in my capacity as Martha Ngoye and not in my 
capacity as the Group Executive Legal, Risk and Compliance 
on behalf of PRASA. 
 
So a lot of people because they found themselves to 
be found wanting as a result of these uh-uh investigations 
and the outcome thereof.  They took issue with me 
personally and reported me, you know. 
 
At one instance, two of my colleagues reported me to 
10 
the chairperson to the... uh-uh, to the... to the Judge 
Makhubele... uh, Chairperson Makhubele. 
 
And that too became such an issue within the 
organisation that I did not even have authority, you know, to 
deal with these matters on behalf of PRASA.   
So, you know, all these investigation and all these 
litigations that required us as a legal function to deal with 
uh, stood us in negative effect with the organisation. 
 
And I guess uh, the powers that be also, you know, 
would use this when they found us being a nuisance of some 
20 
sort to relation to matters which they wanted to do with.   
 
So they would bring it back, you know uh, ever so 
often as to how, you know, the legal function has conducted 
itself.  And I guess for me Chairperson, the law firm that... 
that... that was referred to uh, by... by... by Dr Sishi there.  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 169 of 203 
 
For me it could only be one law firm and that was the 
Werksmans Law Firm, you know. 
 
I mean, I... I think I have been accused of many 
things as far as the Werksmans Law Firm is concerned.  And 
when I stepped back and think about it, I think [laugh] when 
the board decided to... to appointed the... the... the law firm, 
I was not even there. 
 
I was on suspension but they forget about that.  But 
because it had to deal with the legal uh-uh, firm, Martha 
Ngoye is involved and... and therefore... 
10 
 
So I... I mean, I must say, I... I guess I was state 
enemy number one in... in... in PRASA as far as these 
matters were concerned and that is why I think he felt bold 
to bring this up because I guess he... he just also probably 
felt that uh, these matters needed to be dealt with in a 
particular way and we were being difficult.  This the Group 
CEO at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you know uh, the evidence of how 
the legal department at PRASA was being dealt with, the 
evidence you are giving and the evidence you gave last time 
20 
as to how the legal department was being treated, yourself 
and miss and so on and so on, you know uh, resonates in 
some way and also how, according to Mr Molefe, how he and 
his board were treated. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 170 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Resonates in some way with how uh, 
Minister Nene and Minister Gordan, Pravin Gordan in... as 
Ministers of Finance at different times and how Mr Fuzile as 
DG of Treasury, how they testified as to how National 
Treasury ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  Was dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...was being attacked. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even by the executive at cabinet level uh, 
for standing for what is right and making sure that things are 
10 
done properly. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So... so... so when I listen to the evidence 
you are giving... giving and having heard that evidence uh, I 
have to remember ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m.  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...what they were saying about how, on 
their 
evidence, 
National 
Treasury 
was 
being 
dealt 
with...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...and they were being attacked um, even 
by members within the cabinet. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think they said even the former 
president 
was 
uh, 
um, 
hostile 
to 
the 
National 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 171 of 203 
 
Treasury...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...at a certain time. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh, of course, I have had evidence also of 
what happened according to certain senior officials, how Mr 
McBride, Mr Koven, Mr Seshego, how they said, while they 
were standing for what is right and refusing to do wrong, how 
they were suspended...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...and subjected to disciplinary actions.  
They had to go to court. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They had to go to arbitrations and uh, so 
when I listen to all of this evidence, I have to remember what 
I have also heard from other departments...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  From other... 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...which 
have 
got 
nothing 
to 
do 
with...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...PRASA but similar things happened 
there.  Um, and of course, I have to also remember evidence 
that 
we 
have 
heard 
of 
um, 
senior 
officials 
at 
SAA...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 172 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...uh, Dr Dowa, I think is one of the... Ms 
Moshe was one of them and um, there was uh, miss if I am 
not mistaken.  They also have stories that they have told 
before 
this 
Commission 
of 
how 
they 
were 
treated...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...when they sought to stand for what was 
right. 
MS NGOYE:  What was right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And refused to do what was wrong. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how some of them were... were 
suspended for long periods...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...without any disciplinary hearing. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And uh, ultimately, they were forced into a 
situation where they had to settle because they did not have 
enough money to pay lawyers to fight for their rights. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of these things uh, they seem to create 
a pattern ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...of what was happening.  And... and it is 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 173 of 203 
 
all roundabout the same years. 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  Even with SAA, you are looking 
at around 2015, you know uh, 2016/2017 but other things 
happening earlier on.  You go to IPAD, McBride... Mr 
McBride’s challenges.  Mr Koven.  So the years seems to, 
more or less, be the same years ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...when these things seemed... seemed to 
have been happening. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  But also Chair, I think what... what comes 
to my mind and... and what... what is troubling is the fact 
that in almost all instances the people that behave in this 
manner are the people that say they are fighting corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And... and fighting corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  We can unpack that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  To say, “what is that you are fighting?” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  You are removing the people that you know are 
a nuisance...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...and will stop you from doing what you want 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 174 of 203 
 
to do under the guys that you are fighting corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  As I say and I am... I am happy to deal with 
my... my special leave Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  I was painted and tainted as this corrupt 
official. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Only to be brought back...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  ...to PRASA without even being charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But when you go to Google...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...you will not find Martha Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  The first thing you will find under Google is.. is 
corruption and... and so on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Allegations which were never proven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Now as an employee, I do not have the powers 
to go after the... you know...[intervenes]  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 175 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...to go to the media and say the Board of 
PRASA together with the Group CFO of PRASA have tainted 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  You know, I fought internally and nothing gets 
done.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  In fact, they just disregard the issues that I 
raised. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Even referring to the policies within the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  It has been a nightmare Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  If one must say.  Um, but the reality is, I 
guess, if you believe in what you are doing...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...you will continue to do so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But um, it... it is not fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And... and I must state it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 176 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  ...that the manner in which some of this has 
been conducted...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...has really caused um, us um, a lot of 
funeral... heartache. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But we are there.  And I guess for me, it is 
always been about the... the... the... commuter Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And I always ask myself “why are you still at 
10 
PRASA?” 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And when I think about the plight of our people 
out there...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...is to say somewhere somehow maybe, you 
know, some of us will remain to... to get this organisation 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  For the sake of our people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Because nobody speaks for them.  They are 
not an ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I mean...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  You know, it is just... it is just for me.  It... it... 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 177 of 203 
 
it... it is one of those things Chairperson that... that really 
has... it... it lives with me on a daily basis.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  To say, I do not know what it is that I am doing 
wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Or that people detest me in the manner that 
they do...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...to have me be subjected to what I have been 
10 
subjected to within the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But be that as it may Chairperson.  I mean, you 
know, I believe in what I believe in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Well uh, of course, I should not have 
uh, 
not 
mentioned 
Themba 
Maseko. 
 
I 
should 
have 
mentioned Themba Maseko as well. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  Because his evidence was uh, 
one of the first stories that the Commission heard uh, of how 
20 
he 
was 
transferred 
from 
GCIS 
to 
another 
department...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...uh, because, on his evidence, he had 
refused to cooperate with the... with... with the Guptas. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 178 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  [throat clearing] 
MS NGOYE:  Sorry, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  I just want to get back to a point.  When you 
say when Dr Sishi says that employees complained, is it that 
you 
were 
challenged 
the 
validity 
of 
contracts 
they 
concluded? 
MS NGOYE:  H’m. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Or is it that you took disciplinary steps? 
MS NGOYE:  Well, Chairperson, you know, it just did not 
make sense for me, actually, what he meant because 
especially in relation to these matters, Siyaya. 
I had dealt with the executives um you know, 
responsible for... for those specific areas where Siyaya was 
owing all the money.  And those executives were right here.   
They say, “we do not own Siyaya money”.  I... so I did 
not know what he was talking about to uh, as far as that was 
concerned.   
20 
And I was very clear in my mind to say, at the end of 
the day, as the legal function, we do not also just attend to 
matters where we do not have uh, where our prospects of 
success are not... are not there Chairperson. 
 
We engage with the business quite extensively.  The 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 179 of 203 
 
only understanding that I had where he speaks about 
employees not being happy, for me were those matters were 
those 
employees 
who 
were 
found 
wanting 
within 
the 
organisation, were being dealt with. 
 
And what was interesting Chairperson was that in 
those matters and Mr Dingiswayo can speak to this, he was 
the... the... the witness of PRASA who managed to have 
those employees, you know, being dismissed but obviously, 
that is not been spoken about.   
It is always, you know, the powers that be that... that 
10 
are fighting corruption.  So the work that the legal function 
did was never recognised as far as these work... this work 
was concerned. 
But those people that felt that they needed to 
complain about us, you know, would use that opportunity 
when they realised that uh, under the powers that be, also 
did not necessarily support the work that we were doing. 
So if you unpack it Chair, I just listened and I thought 
“okay, it is just one of those again but be it as it may”.   
ADV SONI SC:  In your evidence on the previous occasion 
20 
you were here, you made the point that if you look at the 
Siyangena contract, many of the matters could not have 
been taken place if people have behaved properly. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  I mean, you take Dr Pongola...[intervenes]  
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 180 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Gansho. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And... and a number of them whom you 
named on the advocation.   
MS NGOYE:  Ja.. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now clearly, as I understood your evidence 
on the previous occasion, they seem to have an investment 
in the contract itself. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  I mean, I have just 
10 
proven.  Mr Gansho is out of the organisation today because 
it was found that in the Siyangena matter he benefited with 
the property in Durban.   
You know, I was not there, you know, when these 
things were happening but I mean, the fact that now it was 
the legal function that was running with this matter, just it 
was the legal function that... that had a vendetta against Mr 
Gansho.  It is always absurd things. 
ADV SONI SC:  So if... if there were legitimate... well, not 
legitimate but if there were complaints that were made, it 
20 
would have been employees of that elk if I can put it that 
way. 
MS NGOYE:  It would.  And also those Chair, those that were 
still around whose matters had not been finalised because 
obviously, some of the matters are still happening even now, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 181 of 203 
 
you know.  Um, so they had not been finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess that uh, if an associate thought 
there were proper grounds or any complaints by employees 
of PRASA against you in that you have done something 
wrong, he would have had all the power to take action 
against you, would he not? 
MS NGOYE:  He would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Or to report you to the board or 
whatever. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did he ever do that? 
MS NGOYE:  Well, he... he... he... no, he had not done that 
Chair...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, he attempted or what? 
MS NGOYE:  No, not actually that he attempted to... to do it 
but... but uh, the CEO before him uh, mister uh...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]  
MS NGOYE:  Mr Sithole. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MS NGOYE:  Sithole.  Uh, Chair, I... I... I have been taken to 
20 
the cops.  I have been, you know, subjected to arrests. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Because of the work that I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And as the CEO at the time, he believed that it 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 182 of 203 
 
was necessary for the board to deal with me in a particular 
way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Let me say, I stood my ground Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And... and nothing came of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Because, once again, you know, I had 
identified an area within the organisation.  This is not part of 
my evidence Chair but I am just saying. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  I had identified an area within the organisation  
MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION:  [01:27:54]  
MS NGOYE:  ...organisation where there was corruption of 
the highest note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Uh, in relation to us dealing with um, 
components...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...within the organisation.  At the time, I was 
20 
the acting CEO of PRASA Rail Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  And this issue had come to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  Then I was accused of assaulting an employee. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 183 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  One of the things that I said to the board 
Chairperson, I said, “Chairperson, if I in my capacity as the 
Group CFO of... of... of... I mean, C... the acting CEO of 
PRASA Rail and the legal person for them, had done so, I 
would have handed in my resignation”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  I would not even, you know, uh-uh-uh oppose 
to this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  I had the cops come to fetch me there at 
PRASA...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...because of this allegation.  The Group CEO 
was pursuing this issue with a particular employee that was 
there...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  ...that had alleged that I assaulted her in a 
meeting filled with eight people Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Who came back and said there was no such 
assault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But he believed that I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 184 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:  Because I had clearly pinned something that he 
possible was involved in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But because I had found that, I... I was really a 
nuisance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  So all these... all these things Chairperson 
come and... and I reported these things to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  I... I made reference to these things to the 
10 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  In fact, the person that was prosecuted was me 
and not necessarily the person that I had indicated to have 
possible been involved in the corruption in relation to those 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  To that person, that nothing was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MS NGOYE:  But I was somebody who was vilified within the 
20 
organisation and... and... and treated as though as I am the 
one that is causing problems within the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.   
ADV SONI SC:  Ja, Ms Ngoye...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
when 
you 
met 
them, 
causing 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 185 of 203 
 
problems by identifying all these areas of corruption. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct, Chair.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ms Ngoye, when... right at the outset of 
your affidavit one of the things you pointed out was that 
there were certain people who exercised undue influence 
at PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
MR SONI SC:   Now you in your affidavit in your conclusion 
with the same theme and can I just ask you to summarise 
10 
what you say or what you said in the conclusion as 
contained in the affidavit? 
MS NGOYE:   Can  read it, I think it is – let me read it, 
there is so much.  Under paragraph 58 I say: 
“I submit that the a foregoing matters prompt the 
following concern.  PRASA concludes contracts with 
service providers running into ten so hundreds of 
millions of Rands.  As I have pointed out, some 
contractors have undue influence with persons in 
key positions at PRASA.  When disputes arise, 
20 
usually about payment, often legitimate questions 
are raised about the validity of the award of the 
tender or the terms and scope of the contract.  
Given that these are often constitutional issues 
involving 
Section 
217 
of 
the 
Constitution 
and 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 186 of 203 
 
administrative actions, such dispute ought to be 
properly decided by the courts.” 
I most cases you find that the tender processes were not 
followed, Chair, we have given that evidence here where, 
you know, and then you say was the process fair?  Section 
217 of the Constitution requires as a state of organ to 
behave in a particular way.  That was the approach that 
was adopted by the legal function because we are trying to 
protect the interest of PRASA, Chair, and to do what is 
right.   
10 
However, what I have described above demonstrate 
that that approach is often undermined by senior persons 
at PRASA.  Settlements are concluded and when the legal 
function attempts to act in PRASA’s best interests, steps 
are taken against us.  Should I continue, Chair? 
MR SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
MS NGOYE:   “This cannot be in the best interest of  
PRASA, for our experience is that the settlement 
route is adopted not only when influential persons 
are involved but is extended to others as well, to 
20 
PRASA’s grave prejudice.  Allied to this is the 
pattern of appointing people in acting capacities 
and such persons are easily manipulated.” 
People get scared, Chair, and we have seen it.  You know, 
I mean, when Mr Montana fired me he appointed a guy who 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 187 of 203 
 
did not have a legal experience to head up the legal 
function. 
MR SONI SC:   Say that again please? 
MS NGOYE:   When I was fired in 2015 by Mr Montana, the 
person who acted in my stead was actually a gentleman 
who reported to me and had no legal background.  He was 
petrified.   He was petrified.  I mean, because immediately 
after that what he was required to do was to sign invoices 
of law firms that they knew, Mr Montana knew, were not 
agreed to sign.  So the unfortunate, you know, gentleman, 
10 
was subjected to that and found himself signing, but 
petrified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not cover that last time, did 
you? 
MS NGOYE:   No, I did not, I am just saying, you know, as 
just as an example of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You just remember that? 
MS 
NGOYE: 
 
 
Ja, 
of 
this 
thing, 
you 
know, 
and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were there no legal people in your 
20 
department, legally qualified people [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MS NGOYE:   There were, Chairperson, but he went and 
got somebody who was not a lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 188 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:   To come and head up the legal function. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was that? 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Thokolo Mohlake.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is he still there? 
MS NGOYE:   He is still there.  He reports to me.  He is 
the general manager responsible for insurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think it would be important to get 
a statement from him. 
MS NGOYE:   At the time, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to how it came about. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
How 
he 
was 
approached 
and 
how…[intervenes] 
MS NGOYE:   How he felt and that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he dealt with matters when he had 
no legal qualification and so on. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes.  And the type of pressure that had 
been put on hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The type of pressure that he may have 
got. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He might be prepared to speak now. 
MS NGOYE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And then I say, Chair: 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 189 of 203 
 
“The same I submit applies to appointing interim 
boards.” 
That was the position at PRASA for nearly 30 months.  Now 
it is obviously more.  However, at present, PRASA does not 
even have an interim board, it is someone called an 
administrator.  That is a position that is not provided for in 
law that applies to PRASA who, in effect, is PRASA’s 
accounting authority and Group CEO all at the same time.  
I do not believe that this is lawful and I provided an 
attached opinion to that effect, Chairperson. 
10 
MR SONI SC:   Now concerning that, I just want to 
conclude it with that, Chairperson, because there has been 
– well, perhaps not a development but I should place this 
on record.  You know #UniteBehind have challenged the 
validity of the appointment of an administrator, is that 
correct? 
MS NGOYE:   They have, Chairperson, the matter is in the 
Cape Division and it is before Judge Erasmus. 
MR SONI SC:   And what is the position at the moment? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, they are waiting for judgment, 
20 
Chairperson, my understanding is that we are waiting for 
judgment. 
MR SONI SC:   The matter has been argued, though? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, that matter has been argued.  In fact, 
the judge had requested the parties to go and settle the 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 190 of 203 
 
matter but I understand that there was no settlement 
reached, so one does not know where it is now. 
MR SONI SC:   Mr Chairman,  have no further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier on when Mr Molefe was giving 
evidence, one of the matters he talked about was the fact 
that it would appear – and, of course, he is outside of 
PRASA so his knowledge might be limited – it would 
appears that notwithstanding the fact that the contract 
between PRASA and Swifambo was declared invalid, not 
much seems to have been done since then to try and 
10 
recover about R2,6 billion that had been paid.  Do you 
know anything about what is happening or whether there 
have 
been 
any 
steps 
that 
have 
been 
taken 
in 
the 
meantime? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair.  In fact, we are currently dealing 
with that matter.  Mr 
Mashaba brought obviously a 
liquidation application to have Swifambo Leasing and some 
of its companies …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Liquidated. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, liquidated.  He wanted it to be a 
20 
voluntary liquidation.  So we joined as PRASA and said no, 
it cannot be voluntary, it needs to be compulsory. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   So we intervened there and the liquidator 
was appointed.  So the liquidator is in the process of 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 191 of 203 
 
dealing with getting monies back for PRASA.  In fact what 
has happened is that about six, seven locomotives were 
sold as part of the liquidation process but obviously, Chair, 
if you look at the amount of money that was paid by 
PRASA, 2.6 billion, what the liquidator has in his account 
right now is only R65 million in relation to the six 
locomotives that he has sold.   
There are others obviously that are still in Spain 
that did not come through because we only received 13 of 
the locomotives.  So there are seven that is here, that 
10 
must still be dealt with and there was one that was 
involved in an accident. 
 
What is actually interesting with that matter, Chair, 
as we speak, is that we still have attorneys on board that 
are representing PRASA on that and obviously we cannot 
let that matter go, Chairperson.   
 
What we are dealing with currently is the fact that 
Mr Mashaba – this is also a Mashaba – is busy bringing 
application after application to try and prevent this matter 
from – the liquidators from actually, you know, carrying out 
20 
their function. 
 
The latest is that initially obviously our claim, he 
opposed the fact that we, as PRASA, were entitled to bring 
a claim.  We are the biggest creditor, Chairperson, you 
know, for that amount of money.  We had to fight that and 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 192 of 203 
 
so we are in the process of dealing with those matters and 
it is preventing obviously the liquidators from continuing 
with their work in relation to dealing with that and coming – 
and finalising it because they have to deal with all these 
various applications that Mr Mashaba keeps bringing. 
 
In fact, right now one of the matters that we are 
dealing with is him challenging the appointment of the 
liquidators themselves.  It is very convoluted.  You know, 
one minute he is challenging the appointment of the 
liquidators, the next minute he is saying to PRASA you are 
10 
supposed to join forcefully in the proceedings and so it is 
so – it is a delaying tactic that is there but I think from a 
PRASA perspective, Chairperson, we have not let that 
matter go, we are dealing with trying to get our monies 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When was this Swifambo judgment, SCA 
judgment out?  When did it come out? 
MS NGOYE:   SCA was 20… 
CHAIRPERSON:   ’17? 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   ‘17/’18, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   2017? 
MS NGOYE:   ’18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2018? 
MS NGOYE:   Ja, 2018, I think.  Ja, ’18, I think, Chair.  So 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 193 of 203 
 
there has been those delaying tactics. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because, I mean, people who have 
received money, who claim that they received that money 
lawfully, they will do …[intervenes] 
MS NGOYE:   Whatever it takes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever to – so PRASA has to really 
adopt a strategy that will match those delaying tactics. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because otherwise if it does not adopt a 
strategy that will be up to those challenges, it will find 
10 
after some time that anyway, there is no money. 
MS NGOYE:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – and time is of the essence. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I just hope that – because that is a 
lot of money. 
MS NGOYE:   It is, Chair.  You know, we have had a 
challenge, Chair, and I am sure you would have known 
where our lawyers withdrew for non-payment issues and it 
is a known fact that PRASA has struggled with finances 
20 
and one of the law – the law firm that is dealing with this 
matter pulled out because their fees were not paid.  But we 
have since managed to sort those issues out and, you 
know, we have made it clear that these are the matters that 
we cannot afford not to deal with, within PRASA. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 194 of 203 
 
 
So there is a cage management process that has 
been dealt with also by our senior counsel, you know, with 
the liquidators to ensure that all these, you know, little 
matters that are brought by Mashaba can be dealt with in 
one so that we do not have to waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but – ja, I guess, you know, you 
legal team I am sure with apply their minds also. 
MS NGOYE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the question of to what extent must 
PRASA be confined to getting – recovering these monies 
10 
from Swifambo which is being liquidated. 
MS NGOYE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As opposed to also looking at certain 
persons who may have been responsible in a criminal way. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For PRASA losing this money or taking 
this money. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because otherwise you will have a 
strategy where people will establish a company, a legal 
20 
entity, to use it to do business, do crime and then when 
they get found out they say do not touch me, go only to the 
company.  Then they liquidate the company.  But they have 
benefited from the money. 
MS NGOYE:   That is right, Chair.  Ja. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 195 of 203 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you never get the money back all the 
time because you limit yourself to the entity, so I am sure 
that they must look at all of those things. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This a lot of money from the taxpayers. 
MS NGOYE:   Sure.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS 
NGOYE: 
 
 
And 
we 
have 
pushing 
the 
Hawks, 
Chairperson, to do their work as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Because it has been frustrating for so long 
where the evidence has been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is holding back, as you 
understand the position now?  That was the other matter I 
was going to find out. 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson, you know, it has been so 
frustrating dealing with the Hawks because they come back 
with the same issues all the time and you just do not 
understand what they want.  For me the experience has 
been, you know – and it is with the greatest respect that 
20 
one has, that we have in certain instances been given 
people where you can see this …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are not up to the job. 
MS NGOYE:   No, they are not up to it, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to the challenge, ja. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 196 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:    We have given information and they come 
back and they say we have not given information.  But, you 
see, the other issue that we found at least as a legal 
function to be problematic is that since the Chairperson, 
Popo Molefe’s board left, everybody that has subsequently 
come in has come in and they have excluded the legal 
function when they deal with these matters. 
 
We were the ones that would go to the Hawks and 
we would know what documentation was given to the 
Hawks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So naturally when we are not there they will 
tell whoever they tell, who is meeting with them, what they 
want and they would not be, you know, countered on the 
information that they are given.  So those delays have 
been there within the organisation and they have been 
frustrated to say we are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean even during Ms Kweyama’s 
board …[intervenes] 
MS NGOYE:   Even during Ms Kweyama’s board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The legal department was excluded? 
MS NGOYE:   They want to meet the Hawks to the 
exclusion of the legal function, I mean – and when we met 
with the head, Hermione, and told her what she know, she 
was astounded because she said in a meeting that she had 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 197 of 203 
 
with the board, it is like they did not know what they were 
talking about.  You see, they would not have known 
because they were not there.  We do not understand why 
they left us out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the board consulted with you before 
going there? 
MS NGOYE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say tell us what is the story? 
MS NGOYE:   No, Chairperson.  What we offered in all 
respects, if anything, was to say to the board these were 
10 
the investigations that were done.  We would then invite 
the law firm, Werksmans, to come and give the board a 
summary of what had transpired because obviously it has 
been a subject of a lot of interest to say what has 
happened but what you found, Chairperson, is that as they 
met with, you know, the senior people with the Hawks, you 
know, General Khana, I remember they met – they went to 
a meeting with General Khana and we have met so many 
times this General Khana and we know what information 
General Kana is saddled with but he in that meeting told 
20 
the Chairperson of the board that we had provided nothing, 
no information to them about the Swifambo and the 
Siyangena and they could not obviously countenance that 
because they were not there to say no, but that is not true, 
that is not what we know.

So when you find that these things are happening 
what do you do, Chairperson, you know, you just suppose, 
leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So at this stage the PRASA is under an 
administrator.  Instead of a CEO there is an administrator.  
Are you able to communicate directly with the Hawks? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the highest level and say we are 
frustrated because we give information and then the next 
time people in the Hawks say we did not give them the 
10 
information, this thing has been going on for a long time.  
Do you have that freedom to communicate directly? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, in fact, Chair, I have insisted that I be 
allowed to do that because it has been frustrating and the 
administrator has arranged a process internally that he has 
given the head of the human capital, the executive 
responsible for HR within the organisation to be the person 
that deals directly with the Hawks.  So if the Hawks want to 
talk to any of us they would via through them. 
 
So I made it very clear that I am not meeting with 
20 
these people, I want the senior people within the Hawks 
because I have been here before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And I met not so long ago, about last month, 
I think, Chairperson, I met with the Brigadier General, 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 199 of 203 
 
Makinyana(?) who we had met with then when Dr Popo 
Molefe was the Chairperson.  I said to him, I said but Tata 
Makinyana you cannot come to me now but what I found 
interesting, Chairperson, was the fact that when the State 
Capture sat and they heard the evidence that I had given 
around Siyangena, they came back full force to say no, 
Martha, we want to give – we want to meet with you, we 
want to – we heard your evidence at the State Capture.  
And I was saying guys, this is not acceptable, you have 
had this information, what has happened?  Why have you 
10 
not dealt with these matters? 
 
I mean even last week Friday I had a meeting with 
Colonel Trollip and I said to Colonel, Colonel, I am here to 
help, you know, I know the information, should you need 
anything, let us talk, these things have been outstanding 
for a while.  He has given one assurance that, you know, 
something will be done but one must see it happening, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, Mr Soni, I need to have 
evidence from the Hawks with special reference to the 
20 
PRASA cases, what they have been doing.  I need to hear 
evidence.  I need to hear what is going on.  There is a lot 
of money for taxpayers that is involved the complaints of 
crime that have been – that I have been told about.  It 
should be in their own interest to come and – I know they 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 200 of 203 
 
are going to come at some stage to talk about a lot of 
things but I want to hear about the PRASA cases between 
you and Mr Harley(?) but I think with regard to the PRASA 
ones you can deal with them because that is PRASA but 
you can talk to him in terms of whatever background might 
be happening.   
I need to hear – I need this whole thing to be 
cleared as to what is it that over the years they have done 
and what is it that they have not done and why have they 
not done what they need to do?  If they make out a proper 
10 
case, if there are some things that must not be heard 
publicly because they might interfere with investigation or 
whatever, then appropriate measures should be taken but I 
want to know exactly what has been done all along about 
it. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and Ms Ngoye obviously is a 
source of a lot of information because she will be able to 
tell you, to give all the information about what has been 
done. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think that what should happen is 
there should be an affidavit, if there is not one already, 
which just talks about this is when we laid the complaints 
with the SAPS. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 201 of 203 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is when the complaints were 
transferred to the Hawks, this is when we had contact with 
the Hawks for the first time.  This is how many times we 
have met with them and gave them briefings. 
MS NGOYE:   We can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Here is everything that they have asked 
for and we have given them everything that they have ever 
asked for.  Here is when they asked us again for something 
that we had given the previous year.  Here are the people 
10 
who have been involved, we would be dealing with one 
person and then they get changed and then we are dealing 
with another person who then asked us for the same thing.  
Let me get all of that. 
MS NGOYE:   Will do that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   Will assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us get all of that because as the 
delays continue cases get weakened. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, they …[intervenes] 
MR SONI SC:   Then money dissipates, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and money dissipates, ja.  Okay, 
alright, so I will get a report back at some stage on that. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227 
 
Page 202 of 203 
 
MR SONI SC:   Yes.  Chairperson, may I just place on 
record that the Swifambo judgment in the SCA was handed 
down on the 30 November 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2018? 
MS NGOYE:   2018, yes. 
MR SONI SC:   2018, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS NGOYE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  No, I think that is the 
question that I – those are the questions I wanted to ask, 
10 
otherwise you have got nothing further? 
MR SONI SC:   I have got nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you very much, Ms Ngoye, 
we appreciate that you came. 
MS NGOYE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might or might not come back but 
you will continue to work with the Commission. 
MS NGOYE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to all investigations. 
MR SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much. 
MS NGOYE:   Will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn then and we will start at ten 
tomorrow. 
MR SONI SC:   As you please. 
30 JUNE 2020 – DAY 227
