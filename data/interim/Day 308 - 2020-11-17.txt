PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 17 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yesterday I hear argument on the 
recusal application and I indicated that I was hoping to 
give judgment this morning.  I am not going to give a ruling 
or judgment this morning because I must – I am still 
working on it.  I have got quite some documentation to go 
through carefully.  I am going to use today to work on that 
10 
judgment.   
So we are going to adjourn and resume tomorrow at 
ten by which time I hope to be ready to deliver my 
ruling/judgment on the recusal application.  So we are 
going to adjourn and then we must resume tomorrow at ten.  
If for 
some 
reason 
I 
am 
not 
ready 
at 
ten 
o’clock 
communication will be sent to all concerned.   
It might be eleven or twelve but I am going to aim 
for 
ten 
o’clock 
tomorrow. 
 
Okay. 
 
I 
have 
already 
communicated this to counsel on both sides so they are 
20 
aware of it.  Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.    I think Mr Sikhakhane 
would like to say something.  Somebody must just sanitise 
first.

ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair thank you, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   We – I have indicated yesterday that 
we were to look at the statement that you read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  In which I in jest said you have made 
yourself a witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   We have consulted briefly with client 
and our instructions are to put on record a statement that 
10 
deals with your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And may or may not put in dispute 
some of the things you have stated so I thought  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  It is convenient that it will happen – the 
judgment will happen to – the ruling will happen tomorrow 
which we hope we shall have given you the version of the 
relationship of yours with the former President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Secondly he requests that he has an 
emergency and if he – with the leave of the Chairperson he 
is not here tomorrow it is not any disrespect he would like 
me to ask the Chair to excuse him – he has a funeral to 
attend – something has just happened he has to go there

ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then he would be – depending on 
the outcome tomorrow he would be back on Thursday? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Depending on the outcome tomorrow so 
we will have – we will communicate  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  The situation because he is going there 
for a funeral.  I do not know whether the funeral – it cannot 
10 
be during the week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  But a death has happened in the family 
and so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  But he is going to – whatever the Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Tells us to do but we will also try and 
give the Chair the version of the relationship the two of you 
had from his perspective.  And Chair may I say right here 
20 
because it is because there may be things that he may have 
thought are not relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  But he will place them in – on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
17 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307

the funeral tomorrow and on the understanding that if on
