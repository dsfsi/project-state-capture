Page 4 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please administer the oath. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or oath ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Welcome back Mr Molefe.  Just switch on

REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MOLEFE:   Brian Molefe. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR MOLEFE:  I have no objections. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; 
if so please raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm. 
MR MOLEFE:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, you may be seated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
Mr Molefe’s affidavits is found in Eskom Bundle 17 – 
Eskom Bundle 17 and it has been marked as Exhibit U38.1 
on page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Molefe you will have the same 
bundle in front of you which contains your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you can keep your microphone on at 
all times Mr Molefe.  For the benefit of the public Mr 
Seleka you might wish to just re-orientate the public in 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 5 of 299 
 
terms of … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Where 
we 
were 
with 
Mr 
Molefe’s 
evidence when we had to adjourn last time and what you 
have dealt with or are still busy dealing with and what 
topics he will cover for today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  Now on 
the previous occasion when Mr Molefe appeared we dealt 
with matters relating to his background, employment at 
Eskom, relationships with the Gupta’s and whether or not 
10 
there was also a relationship with Mr Salim Essa and Mr 
Molefe elaborated on ques... – on – in his answers to those 
questions and his secondment was also touched upon to 
some extent to the extent that he had knowledge of it.  
What we will mainly be focussing on this time around 
Chairperson 
is 
on 
the 
– 
what 
we 
refer 
to 
as 
the 
transactions.   
Mr Molefe deals with that in his affidavit.  A pre-
payment of R1.6 billion which is converted into a guarantee 
in December 2015.  The pre-payment of R659 million in 
20 
April 2016 to Tegeta and we will touch a little bit before the 
McKinsey matter the penalty as well.   
So the R2.17 billion penalty that Eskom sought to 
impose against OCM.  We will refer to the cooperation 
agreement Mr Molefe that Eskom and OCM had and the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 6 of 299 
 
termination thereof that led to the arbitration.  So those 
are the aspects that we intend touching on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Another issue which 
you should look at or maybe your junior would be looking 
into is that I remember that when Mr Molefe was here last 
time in the statement that he made before he started his 
evidence he had complained about the commission in 
respect of certain things.   
I do not remember all of them but I do remember 
that one of the things he had said was that he had written 
10 
to the commission I do not know whether in December and 
– or earlier where he had made it clear that he was very 
keen to come and give evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the commission and he was 
wondering why he had – why the commission had to issue 
summons against him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my recollection is that neither you nor 
I dealt with some of those issues and I think it is important 
20 
that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least some of them should be dealt 
with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 7 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that your team might not 
have looked into them.   They need to be looked into so 
that at some stage they can be dealt with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it does not have to – they do not 
have to be dealt with now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe your junior can go back to the 
statements and then look at the issues that were not 
responded. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – the summons one Chair I think 
we did explain it in either in a letter or in an email – I think 
it is a letter that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is important that – because he 
made his complaints public. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the explanation should be public as 
well. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I say it does not have to be done now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ye. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 8 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it has got to be done I think at some 
stage today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes no that is alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I explain the one of the summons 
though Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you –  
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is a simple one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are able to that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  It is a simple one.  We did explain 
10 
to Mr Molefe that a summons is a formal notification that is 
given to every witness who comes to appear.  It is not that 
it is issued because the witness is resisting to come and 
appear it is just that we ensure formally that the date and 
time for witness has been communicated and the witness 
will do an appearance on that day.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it is not because you are resisting to 
appear I know he said he would have come willingly even a 
letter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or a telephone.  So I think we did 
explain that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well maybe I can add this.  When the 
commission started in 2018 and in 2019 our attitude was 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 9 of 299 
 
that somebody who is cooperating with the commission who 
is willing to appear should not have a summons issued 
against them.   
We should only reserve that for somebody who was 
not cooperating or – and so on.  And many people who 
came to give evidence in 2018/2019 did so without actually 
being issued with summonses but there came a time 
because of the un-constraints left and the time left for the 
commission to finish its work when the attitude was 
sometimes somebody might not be somebody who is not 
10 
cooperating but might be putting certain priorities ahead of 
the commission in terms of dates to say well no, no I am 
not available on that date I am available on another date 
and negotiating that is just not the kind of thing that we 
would 
do 
because 
then 
if 
we 
do 
that 
it 
becomes 
problematic.   
So we then said well if we want you to come to the 
commission on short notice we will negotiate dates.  But if 
we are going to give you what we regard as reasonable 
notice we will not negotiate we will say that is the date.  
20 
So – but part of the reason of the change of attitude 
was to try and make sure that we can – we are guaranteed 
that the person will appear if they were issued a summons 
because if we have not issued a summons if something 
comes up the person phones and says, can we change the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 10 of 299 
 
dates and so on and we – there are problems with that.  So 
Mr Seleka is not – is right to say just because a summons 
is issued against you it does not necessarily mean you are 
not trusted to cooperate.   
So – so we have issued more summonses as we 
approach the end of the work of the commission than we 
did when we still had quite a lot of time.  Okay alright.  
Other issues you will deal with later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Molefe ja last time you 
just remember will be leading your evidence and I am not 
your opponent.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am not his opponent.  So last time you 
even as I put people’s versions to you it is merely to get 
your response like we did Mr Hein Bester who testified 
here previously.   
20 
So we will carry on along the same lines.  Just to 
recap you testified about your relationship with the Gupta 
brothers; I think it is – is it all of them; your visits to their 
place and the intention with them – is it with them to form 
a bank – to establish a bank?  And that is way before you 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 11 of 299 
 
came to Eskom from your explanation.  
So – and then we also mentioned to you the 
evidence of Mr Hein Bester prior to your secondment to 
Transnet – to Eskom how Mr Salim Essa said to him that 
we will show you how powerful we are that we have already 
decided who is going to be the boss at Eskom.  And that 
we were in that regard trying to show you that your 
secondment to Eskom seemed to have been pre-planned.  
Pre-planned not just by – oh let me just say pre-planned by 
third parties outside of government.   
10 
You have made your comments on that.  And then it 
was the announcement about the Minister, Minister Lynn 
Brown at the time on the 17 t h of April 2015 just over a 
month after Mr Matona was suspended that you will be 
seconded to Eskom.  That is on the 17 t h of April 2016/15 – 
I beg your pardon.   
 
There was a meeting on the 23 r d of April 2015 which 
took place in Cape Town – the meeting of the board.  I 
believe you attended that meeting.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes that is correct but before we proceed 
20 
Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Just as we are recapping I just want to 
remind the commission that I did make a statement which I 
made a substantive allegations to the extent that I felt that 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 12 of 299 
 
the – Glencore had been trying to export 8 billion orders 
and that the President had been made a – well the current 
President had been made a shareholding in one of – in 
Optimum 
actually 
– 
company 
that 
is 
the 
centre 
of 
everything that has happened here.  I am saying this now 
because the fact that while we were recapping that was not 
mentioned.  I hope that it is not being swept under the 
carpet and being forgotten conveniently.  Just to make sure 
Chairperson that it did register. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  And that it has – that there is a certain 
amount of weight that will be attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To what I said.  Because it is at the same 
time Glencore and Optimum are at the centre of all these 
files that are behind me now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Molefe I am surprised that you 
would think that it is being swept under the carpet – or the 
carpet because you said it publicly and you – you know 
from your own experience that when a witness says 
20 
something that implicates somebody it terms of the Rules 
of the Commission that person is given a copy of that 
statement so that they have a chance to respond.  So I did 
not expect you to think that it would be swept under the 
carpet. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 13 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know some media said you – your 
evidence was stopped because you made allegations 
against the President so the commission. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I was just concerned that it is not being 
mentioned as a 00:16:36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no we did not mention everything.  I 
am sure – certainly I do not think we mentioned everything.  
The only thing I wanted to mention was something that was 
not responded to which you said.  That is what I wanted to 
10 
raise. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do know – I have been told that 
your statement that you made on that day which you 
handed up was sent to people who were implicated in it.  
So there is nothing that is being swept under the carpet. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes I was at the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  We did exchange that 
20 
Chairperson.  Yes in that meeting Mr Molefe there was the 
issue of the cooperation agreement between Eskom and 
OCM.  That cooperation agreement dated back to March or 
May 2014 in terms of which – and it was the culmination of 
negotiations between the parties about coal qualities, 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 14 of 299 
 
amount of coal to be supplied and it culminated into that 
agreement which was intended to ultimately amend the 
existing coal supply agreement between Eskom and OCM. 
 
The item was on the agenda at the board meeting of 
the 23 r d having it been referred to the board by the BTC 
that sat on the 15 t h of April 2015.   
 
When you look at the minutes of the meeting it says 
that the item had to be removed – should be removed from 
the agenda and the board members have come here and 
said that item was referred to you with certain instructions.  
10 
Can you give the Chairperson your recollection of what 
transpired in that meeting in respect of that item of the 
cooperation agreement and the intended fourth addendum 
to the agreement between OCM and Eskom? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson the – that agreement was 
referred to me (not audible). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry. 
MR MOLEFE:  It was referred to me as you correctly point 
out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh okay.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think you may have to be specific 
Mr Seleka if you want certain specific information.  Do you 
want to find out why it was referred to him? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or … 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 15 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes then I will follow up Chair.  If he 
says yes it was in fact then I can follow up Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Yes Mr Molefe do – can you recall 
why it was referred to you? 
MR MOLEFE:  I would imagine because I was the acting 
Group Chief Executive and the board felt it appropriate 
that I should deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm. 
ADV MASUKU:  Sorry Chair I – I am sorry to interject.  I 
10 
am not sure whether it is – the acoustic are a bit bad.  We 
– I am struggling to hear.  I am struggling to hear actually 
all of you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think… 
ADV MASUKU:  I am struggling to hear all of you – I am 
not sure whether it is – there is a volume somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you cannot hear us. 
ADV MASUKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh even with me with my voice? 
ADV MASUKU:  No – well I do not have a problem with 
20 
your voice I actually like it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  But I might have to raise it 
because there have been times when people say they 
cannot hear me so I always assumed I have got a loud 
voice so – but Mr Seleka I have to remind him now and 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 16 of 299 
 
again. 
ADV MASUKU:  But it is especially Mr Seleka yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MASUKU:  He spoke very softly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have to remind him to speak up 
because he has a very soft voice.  So let us try and if the 
problem persists just alert me again.  So let – if there is 
anything that the technicians can do to assist they must do 
that as well.  Okay and you will try and speak up Mr 
Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Chair I think it was the sound 
system this time around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I must say also I think you should 
try the same Mr Molefe.  You also – should also try and 
speak up a bit. 
MR MOLEFE:  I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Molefe I will refer to documents 
insofar as you need me to or where it is necessary.  So 
that meeting what the board members have said the matter 
20 
was referred to you with the instruction that you will get 
information and come back to – to report back.  They say 
and from the evidence that we see is that in June 2015 you 
terminated the cooperation agreement and the negotiation 
process and they were not aware that the termination had 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 17 of 299 
 
taken place.  You did not come back to them prior to you 
doing the termination.  And that is why I was asking you 
can you tell the Chairperson your recollection of why the 
matter came to you and now can you comment on what the 
board members have said here about … 
MR MOLEFE:  Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You had – you having been given 
explicit instructions to come back, get information come 
back but they say you went ahead and terminated without 
them knowing. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Chair you know a lot has been said about 
the fact that I refused to negotiate.  That is not true.  We 
negotiated.  We spoke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that. 
MR MOLEFE:  A lot has been said about the fact that we 
refused to negotiate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  We did not refuse to negotiate; we 
negotiated.  There is evidence of the negotiation.  I think 
even in Mr Bester ’s affidavit he says that… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Molefe  Maybe just so that 
we follow the sequence let us start with is it true that when 
the board referred that matter or that proposed agreement 
or – to you they asked you to come back to them and got 
back – let us start with that.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 18 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  My – my 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then later on. 
MR MOLEFE:  My understanding at the time Chair was that 
I should deal with the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you saw fit. 
MR MOLEFE:  As I saw fit and then report to the board 
about how it was dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the progress or whatever. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes about whatever is happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  That was my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  It was not just a matter of going to find out 
what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because that would have taken a day or two 
to find out what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So it was not just an instruction of go and 
familiarise yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  It was deal with the matter and report back 
to us about how you have dealt with it. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 19 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay then I think you can deal 
with the question of negotiations because I think you were 
introducing that in the context of what Mr Seleka says has 
been said by board members namely that you terminated 
the agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without coming back to them and I think 
you 
want 
to 
you 
before 
you 
terminated 
there 
were 
10 
negotiations or whatever. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deal with – deal with that. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I am going to read from the 
minutes in the light of that explanation Mr Molefe which is 
– the minute is in – you get EB – Eskom Bundle 18. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is Eskom Bundle 18(A) page 416.29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think go ahead and read because 
20 
we might be – we might be able to manage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without checking but Mr Molefe must feel 
free to – to check. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  This – the – in regard to this item 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 20 of 299 
 
they say it was requested that the submission should be 
taken off the agenda and submitted to the acting CE before 
being tabled for approval.  And then the resolution says:   
“Resolved that the referral from the BTC for 
approval to me of the mandate to conclude 
negotiations with Optimum Coal Mine for 
coal supply to Hendrina Power Station is 
not approved and  
2. The mandate should be referred to the 
acting Chief Executive before being tabled 
10 
at board for approval.”   
So the mandate specifically related to the negotiations with 
OCM, you recall that? 
MR MOLEFE:  The mandate was to deal with the fact that 
OCM 
wanted an increase from R150 to 
R530 as I 
(inaudible).   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so the team – the mandate to the 
team was to negotiate with OCM and then come back. 
MR MOLEFE:  Did it say negotiating that in the minute.  I 
was not able to get to the page. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In – Oh ja it is… 
MR MOLEFE:  But – but I mean you have also referred to 
an agreement that was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes the cooperation agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:  So I do not know what the understanding is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 21 of 299 
 
in terms was it negotiate the agreement or what was it 
about? 
 
I 
mean 
in 
your 
understanding 
because 
my 
understanding was that I should go and deal with the 
matter – a substantive matter of what was being sought by 
OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja what had happened here is that the 
BTC had taken a decision for Eskom team to negotiate with 
OCM the possible terms for the amendment of the then 
existing coal supply agreement.  So pursuant to those 
negotiations there was a cooperation agreement and this is 
10 
just for the parties to cooperate with each other, negotiate 
in pursuance to the amendment of the CSA – the Coal 
Supply Agreement.  That mandate produced a report to the 
BTC that – which is what we are talking about these are 
the proposed terms to increase the price from 150 to 442 – 
R442.00.   
 
BTC did not approve the mandate it referred it or 
the submission – it referred it the board.  The board then 
here on the 23 r d of April 2015 says: 
“The mandate is referred to you before it 
20 
being tabled at board for approval.” 
So when you read the minute the board envisages that that 
mandate will come back to it for approval and I want you to 
explain what the – the apparent – you can see the 
apparent inconsistency or discrepancy between the minute 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 22 of 299 
 
and your explanation about your understanding of how the 
matter was given. 
MR MOLEFE:   He was saying that the board was referring 
the matter to me.  You just rubberstamp it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know.  The board said 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   And endorse what in your opinion was an 
outcome that had already been predetermined but the price 
would be increase. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   It was not my understanding.  My 
understanding was not – was that I was not – I was not 
being instructed to rubberstamp anything.  In fact, because 
I was the new CEO ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I say something? 
MR MOLEFE:   ...I cast a new eye to the whole matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I something before you proceed? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I say something before you 
proceed? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am not saying anything.  I have no 
opinion on it.  All I am conveying to you is the evidence of 
the board members.  Mr Pamensky came here and said so.  
Ms Viroshini Naidoo came here and said so.  Mr Venete 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 23 of 299 
 
Klein said so.  That this matter was given to you to get 
information because they could not get answers from the 
team that was handling the matter.  And they gave it to 
you, get feedback and come back to them.  It is not me.   
MR MOLEFE:   No, and I am saying to you Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   That the mandate was not to get it back.  
The mandate was to deal with the matter.  I mean, getting 
feedback, as an instruction from the board, the CEO:  Just 
go and get feedback.  I mean, that is an administrative 
10 
function to get feedback.  I was Group Chief Executive.  I 
had to look at the matter and deal with it decisive, which is 
what I did.  But to add Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tell the Chair. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 The 
agreement, 
Chairperson. 
 The 
agreement that you refer to, I subsequently discovered.  
Having find by an official who did not have authority to do 
so, in the first place.  We do not know if who that official 
was working for but had agreed to this proposal being 
brought to where it was.  We did not have – we did not 
20 
know 
who 
the 
official 
had 
been 
working 
for. 
 
The 
agreement had never been to the board before it was 
signed.  The implication, the financial implications were 
such that the size of the transaction that was being 
proposed to be done was so big that that official did not 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 24 of 299 
 
have authority.  If you question Mr Koko, the official that 
signed the agreement reported to Mr Koko.  Mr Koko was 
not even aware at the time that the agreement was been 
signed.  So I even suspected that I may have been...  That 
it is an agreement that was not supposed to have gone to 
the board in the first place.  So the way that I dealt with it.  
I looked at it objectively and I found it to be preposterous 
and unacceptable.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if we take it step-by-step.  What did 
you say about the minute, as we call it here, that the 
10 
mandate is referred to you before being tabled at board for 
approval?  Because purely then the minute contemplated 
that the matter would come back to the board for its 
approval.   
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson what I am trying to say is.  My 
understanding, as the Group Chief Executive, was the 
board was ultra vires.  I do not know how – well, the 
minute maybe 
have been 
withered away...  But my 
understanding was that it was a substantive instruction to 
deal with the matter, irrespective of how the minute is 
20 
minuted.  My understanding was the board would not come 
to me and say:  Go and find out what happened here and 
come back and report back.  The mandate was – so the 
dynamic interpretation, not the literal interpretation of 
those 
words 
that 
are 
in 
the 
minute, 
the 
dynamic 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 25 of 299 
 
interpretation that I gave to the minute was deal with the 
matter as the Chief Executive Officer in the interest of 
Eskom which is what I did.  Which is what was the subject, 
actually, of my entire statement when I came here for the 
first time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So we are to understand you to 
be saying, the minute is what it is but your understanding 
was different? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, my understanding is, dynamic, it is not 
literal. 
 
And 
there 
is 
a 
big 
difference 
between 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Mr Molefe, you and Mr Seleka 
agree.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying you are disputing 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what is written in the minutes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You just say you have your own 
20 
interpretation of what the minutes mean. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So that – you are all – there is no 
dispute about that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 26 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a dispute – there may be a 
dispute in terms of the board – the board members’ 
understanding of what was decided.  Their understanding 
and his understanding.  But as I understand it he certainly 
is not disputing that that is what the minutes are saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says, his understanding was that 
he was to deal with the matter as he so see fit as Group 
CEO.  That is...  And to report simply what he had done to 
deal with it.  Mr Molefe, is that correct? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is what he is saying.  It may be 
that the board or the relevant members of the board’s 
version might be different from his understanding but that 
is what he says his understanding was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Yes.  So with that understanding, 
before you made any final decision, you did not take the 
matter back to the board for its approval. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, I did not make any final decision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is the termination of the Corporation 
20 
Agreement a negotiation process? 
MR MOLEFE:   As I said, I even suspected that the 
Corporation Agreement was ultra vires.  Secondly, there 
was nothing to negotiate.  What Optimum was putting on 
the table was preposterous and illegal. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 27 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because we had an existing agreement that 
they would pay us R 150.00 per coal until 2018. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   To very that to the disadvantage of Eskom 
would have required me to break the provisions of the 
PMFA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but I am asking a simple question 
which is, even as you perceived of those factors and you 
decided that I am not proceeding on the basis of these 
10 
proposed terms, these are preposterous and you bring that 
to an end.  When you make that decision – prior to making 
that decision, did you take the matter back to the board for 
approval?  You did not take the matter back to the board 
for approval.  That is all I want to know. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chair there is no recorded decision that 
I made, terminate discussions or to stop negotiations.  
There is no recorded decision like that that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there an unrecorded decision? 
MR MOLEFE:   There is also no unrecorded decision. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   [laughs]  What ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
the 
negotiations 
ended 
by 
themselves? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, they did not end. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 28 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  They went on?  [laughs]   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  The process of negotiation, Chair, is 
ongoing and people employ different negotiating tactics.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But you cannot negotiate forever. 
MR MOLEFE:   You cannot negotiate forever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So somewhere - you can use different 
strategies to bring finality but in the end, there must be 
some finality. 
MR MOLEFE:   There must be some finality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   In this instance, the finality of the 
negotiations were continuing forever to the disadvantage of 
Optimum, they had the option of taking it to arbitration.  
That is what they were supposed to do.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, when you take..  When, 
between the two parties, one of the parties took an issue 
that was the subject of negotiations for some time, took it 
to arbitration, that would mean the negotiations end. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because now you go to a compulsory 
20 
route. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To fight it out. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 29 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   So it was not for me to take an issue on 
arbitration because I had a contract ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...for R 150.00 until 2018.  I had no 
disputes.  So Optimum would have gone to arbitration.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   By the way Chairperson.  A date for 
arbitration had been set.  They actually - i do not know 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not pursue it? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not pursue arbitration? 
MR MOLEFE:   They did not pursue it.  Before the date 
arrived, they then went for business rescue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MOLEFE:   So the date in Mr Ephron’s... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Affidavit. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...affidavit, he refers to the fact that there 
was a – that had been sent for arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said earlier on to change the 
20 
agreement would have been illegal and you referred to the 
PFMA. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would it have been illegal for two 
parties to an agreement if they were satisfied that they 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 30 of 299 
 
should amend or more of the clauses in the agreement for 
them to agree, we agree to amend this?  Why would that 
have been illegal? 
MR MOLEFE:   If both parties were satisfied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, obviously, you can only amend an 
agreement if both parties agree. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot amend it unilaterally.  
Nobody can do that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, only one party was satisfied, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  What I am saying is.  You had 
OCM ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that wanted the ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, increase.  And you had Eskom who 
were happy with the status quo ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in terms of the price, the agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And OCM initiated, as I understand 
it, discussions and negotiations to say:  Could we relook at 
the price and make whatever demands it made?  So the 
point I am making is.  They were seeking an amendment of 
the agreement. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 31 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And amendment can only happen if both 
parties agree. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I was just saying.  Why would it be 
illegal if both parties agree?  Or that is not what you 
meant? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, the same, that I did not agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Both parties were not in agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but if the ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   The other issue Chairperson is the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hold on a second.  Just so that we 
finalise this.  If Eskom was persuaded to increase the price 
by whatever it was in the agreement, there would be 
nothing illegal, as far as you know? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 Yes. 
 
If 
both 
parties 
had 
agreed 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...to amend that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...I would have been. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 32 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   However, Chairperson, here motive and 
bona fides.  The Optimum were in the position that they 
were in because in 2012 when they bought the company, 
they did not do due diligence.  My feeling was, here we are 
via Eskom.  We are in financial difficulties.  We are load-
shedding.  The company is literally collapsing because 
when I arrived at Eskom, there was talk that we will not be 
able to pay salaries in three months.  We are literally 
collapsing.  His people made the mistake or five years ago.  
10 
Perhaps it was not a mistake and that was the whole point 
of my statement.  Perhaps it was not a mistake.  Perhaps 
they had banked on something that is contrary to good 
morals to get them this agreement.  The fact that there are 
people 
inside 
Eskom 
that 
had 
find 
that 
agreement 
ostensible without authority, also made me suspicious that 
there are people Eskom that are pursuing a particular 
agenda to satisfy these people.  I was just uncomfortable 
with it.  Chairperson, I have a feeling that if I had signed 
an agreement or agreed to OCM’s request, we would be 
20 
sitting in this Commission or a similar Commission where 
you would be asking me:  But Mr Molefe, if you had an 
agreement for R 150.00, what was it that drove you to 
increase agreed with this particular increase that has now 
collapsed Eskom?  So I had to do Chairperson what I 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 33 of 299 
 
believe was correct.  And the background information that I 
knew, it also did not smell good which is why I was at 
pains to make the statement that I did when I came here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you were speaking earlier of things 
being covered(?) and I said to you that people implicated 
in your statement, as far as I know, have been given your 
statement so that they respond.  One of them is Mr Ephron, 
I think, and he, as far as I know, he has filed an affidavit in 
response to your statement.  So the Commission has been 
looking at that and I think probably Mr Ephron might come 
10 
back and deal with certain matters.  So just remember that 
Mr Ephron has actually filed an affidavit in response to 
your statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR MOLEFE:   But Chairperson, this strategy had gone 
beyond Mr Ephron.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Ivan Glasenberg came to see me for 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   And it was Mr Ivan Glasenberg that had 
very good relationship with the chairperson of Optimum 
before he came the...  So Mr Ephron will come and give 
you technical answer but my feeling was that, at the very 
high 
level, 
the 
level 
of 
a 
chairperson 
of 
the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 34 of 299 
 
chairpersonship.  Mr Ephron was a CEO of Optimum.  He 
was in the greatest to most things in what I suspect was 
happening a little less significant than the people at the 
top.  Perhaps what you need to do Chairperson is to ask 
Mr Ivan Glasenberg is he has any comment.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the Legal Team may look at that 
but I am aware that the Commission had been in touch with 
Mr Glasenberg’s attorneys at some stage for him to provide 
a certain affidavit which he provided but because he lives 
abroad, there may have been challenges at the time about 
10 
him coming here.  But the Legal Team will look at those 
matters and take it from there.  But Mr Ephron certainly 
filed an affidavit in response to yours. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To your statement.  And he might well be 
recalled.  We do have some constraints. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he may be called.  And if you have 
not been given that affidavit, it should be send to you for 
you to see what he says. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, can I add something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   If I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   It may be a longwinded story I give? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 35 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   It may be a longwinded story again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us hope not. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct] [Speaker ’s microphone not 
switched on.] 
MR MOLEFE:   When I was at Transnet Chairperson when 
we bought the 100 locomotives ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you...? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
We 
bought 
the 
100 
locomotives 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was because Transnet have not been 
given a good service to the coal industry to transport their 
coal to Richardsbay.  So we went and we decided that we 
are going to end their pay(?) but buying locomotives 
because the locomotives on that line very old, 40-year-old 
locomotives and they were breaking and unreliable.  So by 
then, we then said to the coal industry we will buy the 
locomotives at the expense to Transnet but you guys must 
20 
agree that you will sign Take or Pay Agreement.  When the 
Take or Pay Agreement is signed, it means that when the 
locomotive arrives at your mine, you cannot tell us that you 
do not have coal that needs to go to Richardsbay.  If you 
do not have the coal go to Richardsbay, you will pay for 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 36 of 299 
 
that locomotive because we need to pay back the money 
that we are going to buy the locomotives.  The entire 
industry agreed except one company, Optimum, in 2014.  
They refused to sign the Take or Pay Agreement until one 
day when I got a report from Mr Gama that Optimum is the 
only one is refusing to sign the Take or Pay Agreement.  I 
said to Mr Gama:  Please call Mr Ephron and tell him that 
we are coming to his office now.  He said it is not 
convenient.  I said it is fine.  We are okay with it.  And we 
went to his office there and there.  And I arrived there and 
10 
I told him:  Mr Ephron, but Mr Ephron if you do not sign 
this Take or Pay Agreement where the entire industry has 
signed the Take or Pay Agreement, we will not give you 
trains.  As simple as that.  Mr Ephron’s response was:  No, 
Mr Molefe, we are waiting on Eskom to sign certain 
agreements with us.  When those agreements are signed, 
we will be happy to sign your Take or Pay Agreement.  
Chairperson, I said to him I am not interested in Eskom – I 
am not interested in – the fact of the matter is that, if you 
do not sigh in the next 24-hours, you will not get trains 
20 
from us because the whole industry has signed.  Mr Ephron 
reluctantly 
signed 
within 
24-months(sic). 
 
That 
was 
March 2015 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean within 24-hours. 
MR MOLEFE:   Of our meeting. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 37 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I thought you said within 24-months 
but maybe ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   24-hours.  Ja.  To sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   To sign the agreement.  That was 
March 2015.  Guess what Chairperson?  Unbeknown to him 
and to myself, I am the seconded to go and become Group 
Chief Executive to Eskom a month later, literally.  And 
when I arrived there, here is Mr Ephron with the agreement 
that he is waiting for.  And that agreement is basically 
10 
exporting.  And I felt that:  You know, Optimum said to us 
they will not sign the Take or Pay Agreement because they 
are waiting for an agreement.  In the meantime, this is the 
agreement that they are waiting for.  So that is a bit of 
background Chairperson to explain my frame of mind when 
I dealt with the Optimum matter.  It is because perhaps I 
knew too much.  I knew on the other side they were trying 
to play us, using Eskom’s name.  Perhaps at Eskom they 
were also playing Eskom using Transnet’s name but 
unfortunately I crossed the line and I saw both sides of the 
20 
coin and I did not like it Chairperson.  And I felt that 
Optimum 
could 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
behave 
like 
that 
especially because they probably feel that they have a very 
good relationship with the then Deputy President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the...? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 38 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   With the then Deputy President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   That is the background Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I guess at the time you asked...  Oh, 
he was Deputy President at the time. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was 2018.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I...  I am contemplating 
Mr Molefe, approaching the matter differently.  I will need 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like us to move us with some 
speed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because so far, we have only dealt with 
what the instruction of the board was to Mr Molefe on the 
23 r d of April 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think we have got to try and move 
with some speed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that there is probably no single 
person who is holding us back. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 39 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   But can I ask you to move with some 
speed? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Molefe, let me do this.  Let me 
paint the picture here from what sees from the evidence.  
Please have Eskom Bundle 18 in front of you.  It is 18(A). 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   18(A).  Please turn to page 383 and I 
10 
am referring to the black pagination from the top left-hand 
corner.  Page 383, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what we see from the evidence.  
Firstly, this is a submission document to the Board Tender 
Committee.  It is firstly to Eskom Procurement Sub-
Committee, 25 March 2015 and then the Board Tender 
Committee, 15 April 2015.  And the title of this submission 
is:   
“Mandate 
to 
conclude 
negotiations 
with 
20 
Optimum 
Coal 
Mine 
for 
Coal 
Supply 
to 
Hendrina

The 
resolution 
required 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
Standard 
Committee 
Resource 
that 
Primary 
Energy 
Division is mandated to conclude negotiations 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 40 of 299 
 
with Optimum 
Coal to ensure security 
of 
supply 
for 
Hendrina 
Power 
Station 
at 
R 442.00.  February 2015 money vents(?) for a 
CV...” 
 
And it goes on.  2.2 says:   
“PED, which is Primary Energy, is mandated to 
negotiate and conclude the termination of the 
Optimum hardship claim in the overwriting of 
penalties that have been suspended against 
Optimum...” 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   So that was a request? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, this is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...from the BTC to the board? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, yes.  Then you go to 
page 390.   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a document entitled:  Approval of 
a Negotiated Outcome compiled by Mr Johan Bester, 
Primary Energy.  And then again:  Serving before the 
Eskom Procurement Sub-Committee, 25 March 2015.  The 
20 
BTC, 15 April 2015.  And the description is:  Mandate to 
conclude negotiations with Optimum Coal Mine for Coal 
Supply to Hendrina Power Station.   
 
Then you see paragraph – under introduction, 
paragraph – the first paragraph under introduction says: 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 41 of 299 
 
“Optimum Coal Mine is currently losing money 
on every ton of coal it sells to Eskom as well 
as to export market. 
Optimum 
have, 
therefore, 
already 
initiated 
Section 189 process to retrench 1 300 miners 
and 
to 
close 
the 
export 
business 
by 
31 March 2015. 
Optimum have agreed to continue to supply 
Eskom on the condition that Eskom agrees to 
pay a higher price from 1 April 2015, which as 
10 
a minimum will cover the current cost to 
produce coal for Eskom. 
Alternatively, 
Optimum 
wants 
to 
play 
bankruptcy, stop supply to Eskom and will 
close the mine in a matter of months...” 
The next paragraph, and I will read that only: 
“In accordance with the mandate approved by the 
Board 
of 
Directors, 
Standard 
Committee, 
BTC 
meeting, 12 August 2014 negotiate but not conclude 
coal supply agreements for up to 24 years to ensure 
20 
the security of coal supply to Hendrina power 
station.  This report reflects the progress to date 
thereof and requests noting of the feedback and a 
mandate to conclude negotiations with optimum to 
ensure 
security 
of 
supply 
for 
Hendrina 
is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 42 of 299 
 
requested.” 
So that gives you the background to what was happening in 
regard to the cooperation agreement.  The cooperation 
agreement itself, which I think you need to clarify to the 
Chairperson because when he was asking about which 
agreement is – you said is ultra vires which is signed by a 
person who does not have the authority to do so, I think 
you were referring to the cooperation agreement as 
opposed to the coal supply agreement, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Yes, that is correct but before you 
10 
proceed, who signed this document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who signed? 
MR MOLEFE:   Who compiled this document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The compiler – let us see the first one I 
referred to.  The submission document itself, I do not know 
whether you can recognise the signatures there on page 
387, that is Group Executive Acting Group Technology and 
Commercial – I think that is Mr Edwin Mabelane. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was compiled by Mr Bester. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   At the top the signature looks like Mr 
Bester ’s. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Certainly the approval of a 
negotiated outcome the compiler is identified as Mr Johan 
Bester and it was signed on page 401 by Mr Johan Bester, 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 43 of 299 
 
Mr Vusi Mboweni and Mr Edwin Mabelane, the Group 
Executive Acting Group Technology and Commercial.   
The cooperation agreement is on page 377 of the 
same bundle and it runs up to page 382.  It was signed on 
the 23 May 2014 and on behalf of Eskom the name there 
appears to be – is Kiren Maharaj. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Divisional executive. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, 23 May 2014. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the intention was a new agreement 
would then be negotiated and concluded by the beginning 
of 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Now that is the background, this is 
the Hendrina power station.  What that document will show 
in approval of a negotiated outcome is that Eskom had 
engaged the services of experts, they engaged Nedbank 
and Basis Points to do an assessment of OCM’s financial 
20 
position and the proposed amount of R442 came about as a 
result of that expert assessment and that was contained in 
this report of April 2015.   
I should also add this, by the way, that when you 
read the affidavit of CDH, the attorneys for Eskom at the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 44 of 299 
 
time, CDH says it was briefed by Eskom to assist in the 
conclusion of the cooperation agreement.  So Eskom had 
lawyers 
assisting 
it 
to 
conclude 
that 
cooperation 
agreement of the 23 May 2015.  The parties are negotiating 
as a result of it, the proposed increases are made based 
on expert assessment by Nedbank and Basis Points. 
You come in - and negotiations are not completed.  
You come in in April 2015.  You continue with the 
negotiations, they are trying to meet with you, you know Mr 
Marsden and Mr Ephron had said it was difficult at first and 
10 
they ultimately get – they meet with you and that you 
played – you took a hard stance in regard to negotiations.   
Ultimately you decide to sign a letter which is dated 
the 10 June 2015 terminating the negotiation process.  
That letter was apparently only transmitted to OCM on the 
20 June 2015.  So the process is terminated to negotiate.  
You have this report from experts who are supporting the 
increase of R442 because Optimum is running at a loss. 
In August 2015 you get a letter – now OCM is under 
business rescue.  You get a letter from business rescue 
20 
practitioners 20 August.  They say we are stopping the 
obligation to supply Eskom with coal but they also make an 
offer for an interim arrangement to supply coal to Eskom.  
The response to that offer was a meeting, amongst other 
things, was a meeting on that 3 September 2015 between 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 45 of 299 
 
you and Mr Ephron.  You and Mr Koko on the one and Mr 
Ephron on the other.   
In that meeting the interim arrangement is agreed 
upon, 3 September 2015, that OCM will continue to supply 
coal to Eskom.  That interim arrangement subsisted until 
29 July 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are going to ask him to comment 
on all of these things that you have been mentioning, I 
10 
suspect he might have forgotten some of them by the time 
you give him the opportunity to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think you might have to ask him 
some questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if he wants to dispute some of the 
things you have said, by the time you give him a change he 
might not recall what you said seven minutes ago. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think if you want him to confirm 
anything you need to say what you understand it to be, ask 
him to confirm and move on to the next one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he has a chance to dispute it while 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 46 of 299 
 
he remembers if he disputes it or if he confirms he 
confirms. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you may ask him – Mr Molefe, you 
have listened to Mr Seleka up to now, is there anything you 
dispute in terms of what he has said? 
MR MOLEFE:   I must thank Mr Seleka for his lecture. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   For his lecture.  On what transpired here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I just want to know whether 
there is – if you say look, there is anything of importance 
that I dispute, then we will know. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Seleka’s reality is very different to mine 
and 
although 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
the 
same 
fact 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The same? 
MR MOLEFE:   The interpretation of what was happening is 
very different. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, it is fine because and I am going 
20 
to give you a chance. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes because you are taking these facts and 
driving a particular narrative ignoring what I have already 
put forward in the Commission that what was in fact 
happening was something else.  For example, you go on 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 47 of 299 
 
about the fact that Optimum was in financial difficulty.  The 
biggest problem that I had with Mr Bester and his memos is 
that they went on about Optimum and not Eskom.  My 
fiduciary duty was not to Optimum.   
I had no responsibility to keep Optimum out of 
bankruptcy and in the process get Eskom into bankruptcy, 
a company that I had primary responsibility for.  I think 
your analysis ignores that.  Had you been in my position, 
Mr Seleka, you might have appreciated the fact that if you 
do what these memos from Mr Bester and company as 
10 
saying we should do, we would have bankrupted Eskom, it 
is as simple as that.  We might have saved Optimum but 
we would have bankrupted Eskom.   
 
The reason people felt that it was okay to bankrupt 
Eskom was because they thought that Eskom will get 
money from the fiscus.  The debate on these matters was 
bankrupt Eskom or Optimum …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but when …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   And they were saying that well, we, as the 
parent 
company 
of 
Optimum, 
cannot 
afford 
to 
keep 
20 
subsidising 
implying 
that 
our 
parent 
company, 
which 
Republic of South Africa, could afford continuing subsidise 
Eskom.  Which I disagreed with.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   I have been a treasury official and I know 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 48 of 299 
 
that the fiscus could not afford continuing subsidise Eskom 
because of mistakes, because of people who did not do 
due diligence when they bought a company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   So Mr Bester goes on and on and on and 
on about Optimum’s difficulty, it does not talk about our 
own difficulty, it does not talk about the difficulties of the 
company that worked and that we could not afford all of 
this.  Basis Points on that point said that they did an 
affordability test.  Did they do an affordability test for 
10 
Eskom?  No.  Why? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, can I say something. 
MR MOLEFE:   Who were they working for? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me just say something because 
what I am trying to do is not express my view or try to 
postulate a particular narrative, what I am trying to do for 
the purposes of the evidence and for the purposes of the 
Chairperson is to look at the sequence of events prior to 
giving you the opportunity to then express your comment 
on the underlying issues.  So it is really just to get a 
20 
sequence of events so that we can see what happened 
from this date to the next date and the last date, then you 
can say exactly what you are saying or this was my attitude 
in regard to these facts. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes but I have said …[intervenes] 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 49 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, that is where I was saying 
take them in small bits and pieces. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree that on such and such a date 
there was a meeting between so and so and so where the 
following was decided, you agree that the next thing that 
happened, that was the following, then let him go with you 
where he does not have to [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are entitled the validity of his 
10 
propositions.   You are entitled to test the soundness of his 
approach so it must not be like you are not going to test 
that, just like you should test the propositions of Glencore, 
Ephron if and when he comes here.  So that should remain. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where you feel this needs to be tested 
you must test it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Molefe, it is not as if he ignores 
what you have said, you were saying that he is following a 
20 
certain approach ignoring what you have already said, he 
is not necessarily ignoring that because his job entails 
looking at exactly what happened and why difficulty role-
players acted in a certain way and at the end of the day 
then we look at everything and make a finding.  So he is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 50 of 299 
 
not ignoring it, just that for now, he may be looking at a 
certain issue.  Okay, alright, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Can we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see have gone past the tea 
break.  You wanted to say something, Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was saying that for example this 
agreement …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The cooperation? 
MR MOLEFE:   The cooperation agreement.  If we look at it 
10 
objectively, Chairperson, as a person who was in my 
position at the time, first question is, is it to Eskom’s 
advantage? 
 
Second 
question 
is, 
who 
signed 
this 
agreement?  Did they have authority to sign it?  Why did 
they sign?  Why did they sign?  The answers to those four 
questions were not satisfactory to me as a Chief Executive.  
The answer to those questions did not convince me that we 
are acting in Eskom’s interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  You have to put 
your version and your perspective on the issues as you see 
20 
them and do not necessarily expect that you will leave the 
room knowing whether we agree with you or not, you just 
put your version, your perspectives and the question of 
ultimately what is true and what is well-grounded will come 
later but from your side just make sure that you put your 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 51 of 299 
 
version to share with me how you saw things and why you 
did what you did and if you think when you look at my 
faces, like I do not accept what you are saying, do not be 
concerned about it.  Or if you think I am accepting it, as 
long as you put your side of the story because ultimately I 
will look at everything when everybody has testified so but 
I think we must take the tea break and when we come back 
we will resume and let us try and move with speed.  Ja.  
Okay, we will adjourn.  It is twenty five to twelve, we will 
resume at ten to twelve. (sic)  We adjourn. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:   Try and allocate some time to each topic so 
that we try and finish each topic within the time allocated, 
obviously as you do so we must make sure that we 
nevertheless do justice to the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, thank you Chair, I was speaking 
to Mr Molefe and his legal representatives, we were trying 
20 
to see how we can expedite this.  Mr Molefe and I know the 
facts more or less but beyond us nobody might know the 
facts, 
so 
one 
is 
caught 
between 
but 
let 
us 
see...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can confirm the facts by putting to 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 52 of 299 
 
him what the facts are and he will say if he agrees or does 
not agree, but you would know from his affidavit also what 
he has no issues with. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you Chair.  Mr Molefe just the 
sequence of events again.  I mean, I have gone through, 
you’re coming at Eskom, the termination that takes place 
on the 20, or the letter is communicated on the 20 t h of 
June 2015.  Just on the sequence, not your perspective on 
10 
things, because I want us to deal with the sequence agree 
on it and then we can deal with your perspective, your 
reasons why you did what you did.  Does that bring back 
memories to you of how things happened chronologically.  
So the 20 t h is the termination 20 t h of June 2015 is the 
termination of the negotiation process by letter from CDH.  
Do you agree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, do you have a copy of the 
letter? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I have, you will find it in…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    While you may want to look at the letter 
for maybe purposes of the content.  Does the date more or 
less appear to be the date for the termination to you? 
MR MOLEFE:   My recollection Chairperson is that what 
was happening is that Optimum was employing negotiation 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 53 of 299 
 
tactics, they were very tactical.  They were driving the fear 
of God into us and soon we went to load shed you are 
going to have a disaster.  There was a negotiation tactic, 
we in turn then employed negotiation tactics.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:   I mean, what do you see as something 
happening, it does not necessarily mean that - what you 
see is not what you actually see, there was a lot of 
meaning behind everything that was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:    While you look for the letter, Mr Seleka 
10 
but I think you may have to factor if that is what you want 
to do Mr Molefe’s evidence about the approach is because 
he said also earlier on that, in terms of facts there might 
not be much in dispute in terms of what you said but it is 
the perspectives or the interpretation of those facts to say, 
what do they mean. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:    He has a certain interpretation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you might have to just tackle them 
20 
head on.  You know, that I said, I had found it strange that 
Glencore had signed or taken over an agreement with a 
price that was not going to change for so long, you know, 
that is a due diligence issue.  
And I know that Mr Molefe does deal with it in his 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 54 of 299 
 
affidavit but he is saying I was given the instructions to 
deal with this, I looked at this agreement, I took the view 
that it was in the best interest of Eskom that there should 
be no amendment of the agreement in terms of increasing 
the price.  
He gave the reasons last time he repeated some of 
the reasons why he took that view and we know that 
Glencore or OCM had taken the view that there was a 
hardship clause, and that they should invoke that if 
negotiations did not succeed.  And his right in saying in 
10 
terms of that route they were free to go to arbitration and 
there was a reference of the matter to arbitration and a 
date was set that is what he said, but Glencore/OCM 
decided not to pursue that, why did they not pursue that if 
they thought that they had a case?  He did not say so but 
he implies that, why did they not pursue it because that 
was a compulsory process. 
Eskom would have been forced to take part whether 
they liked it or not, in that process, and if OCM won they 
would be bound by that outcome.  But I know that last time 
20 
he told me about what he has little of his case, ag his 
sleep.  I think it was Mr Molefe, I hope I am not wrong. 
MR MOLEFE:    No it was not me I heard that.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh you did hear it; it was somebody 
else. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 55 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Somebody said that we would not have 
honoured it or something. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was not me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, it was somebody else. 
MR MOLEFE:   I think it was Dr Naidoo or somebody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, I am sorry to attribute that to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No it was him. [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:    But basically those…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, we have never discussed this before. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    He did say. [laughing] Well Mr Molefe 
you are under oath.  So I think you might need to take him 
on, on whether his approach was the correct approach or 
was sound or what. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  So Mr Molefe then well, let us 
go to this fact, because ultimately, all said and done the 
proposal was that we move the price from R150,00 to 
R242,00 per ton and Eskom rejected.  Is it Eskom or you 
who rejected that proposal? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was Eskom Chairperson; I was just a 
20 
functionary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You were just a functionary but Eskom 
had 
engaged 
the 
experts 
as 
I 
said, 
they 
did 
the 
assessment in April, Nedbank and Basis Points.  CDH itself 
was also instructed to engage experts in September 2015 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 56 of 299 
 
to 
again 
do 
another 
assessment 
of 
OCM’s 
financial 
position, when they engage CDH itself was involved.   
Meridian 
Economics 
was 
involved 
and 
SRK 
Consulting were involved they gave you a report in 
November.  They also said you need to financially assist 
OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:    Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    And what was your view on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I had no obligation to agree with them you 
see that opinions where professional opinions, they lacked 
10 
one simple thing which drives any CEO, the interest of 
Eskom they were absent in all of those things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Then you have Eskom having 
rejected…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, maybe Mr Seleka Let us come to 
what was the basis of bases or basis upon which those 
experts said Eskom should help OCM because Mr Molefe 
says I have a basis or the attitude I took, my basis was the 
interests of Eskom.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    So, in what way did those experts say it 
would be in the interest of Eskom for Eskom to help OCM, 
then let us take it from there.  Let us hear what Mr Molefe 
has to say about those reasons that they may be given, if 
they gave any. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 57 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Mr Molefe you will recall that the 
expert opinions look at both parties, the position of both 
parties.  One, was whether OCM was running the mine at a 
loss.  The flip side of that was that if indeed it was running 
the mine at a loss, it was then impacting on the ability to 
supply coal to Eskom.  
So, coal supply to Eskom was a consideration 
relative to Eskom.  But they had that in mind as well, which 
was reflected in the opinion or the memo that was given to 
Eskom.   
10 
So, on the face of it, it seems that Eskom position 
was 
also 
taken 
into 
account 
to 
require 
what 
they 
considered to be a reasonable amount in the increase of 
the purchase price, which was, as I learned from you even 
less than the market related amount the R442,00.  So, 
Eskom’s position was also looked at, your comment on that 
one? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, you must understand this 
OCM, Optimum, was at…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was at? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   A cost plus mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, do not be too far from the mic so 
that I can hear you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, so it had been built with Eskom’s 
capital. 
It 
had 
been 
built 
with 
Eskom’s 
capital 
to 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 58 of 299 
 
supply…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just go back in one or two sentences to 
remind us the importance of a cost plus mine.  I know, it 
has been explained to me, I just wanted to refresh my 
memory because you have just made mention there. 
MR MOLEFE:   I think Chairperson cost plus mines were 
the biggest, was the biggest robbery that has happened 
here.  Those cost plus mines operated like medieval 
robbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Like? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Medieval robbers because what happened 
is, you as Mr Zondo, Eskom the coal is discovered in 
Hendrina, Eskom gives you the money the shaft, to mine 
the coal and then you get given a 40-year contract to 
supply Eskom with coal in the power station that is built 
next door  
You do not put in capital, you just get the contract 
and to operate the mine and give Eskom the coal for 40 
years.  So the proviso in the original agreement was that 
the coal will be Eskom’s coal and nobody else’s and then, 
20 
sometime in the middle of the agreement, in the case of 
Optimum, they turned around and said may we please 
export some of the coal, the better quality coal may we 
please export it, Eskom agreed. 
And they exported the coal and they made a lot of 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 59 of 299 
 
money from exporting the coal.  The problem arose when 
the international price of coal fell, they then said they are 
no longer profitable.  But the exporting of coal was 
something that was additional to the original agreement in 
the first place, that had nothing to do with the original 
intention of the cost plus mines suppliers of coal and not 
the international market.  
Those cost plus mines were not built for the 
international market. They were built for Eskom that was 
the original intention.  So now Mr Seleka, Chairperson 
10 
what you are saying is, or what I am putting to you is the 
hardship that Optimum was experiencing was because of 
the fall in the international market of the price of coal and 
what they were asking was for us to take the knock on the 
international price of coal.  
Something that they had not hedged, they should 
have hedged it, number one, number two, they should have 
done due diligence and after due diligence they would have 
discovered that there is an exposure to the international 
price of coal.  They did not take these two decisions and 
20 
were now demanding that, because they are suffering 
hardship, because of these factors, we must pay for it.  It 
was unfair Chairperson, it was unfair.  
This hardship was self-imposed. What I asked 
myself, how could these people that are so knowledgeable, 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 60 of 299 
 
whose parent company is listed in Switzerland.  Who are 
operating a global leader in the coal industry.  How could 
they take such a simplistic decision, I put myself in your 
shoes and said, at the time when I bought the mine, we 
would have done due diligence and the due diligence would 
have told us that we have an open position and an 
exposure to the coal price.  
They continued with that situation, despite the fact 
that they should have known a reasonable person in their 
position would have known that you cannot continue being 
10 
exposed to the price of coal because your profits no longer 
come from your operation.  They come from speculating on 
the price of coal.  So they had speculated on the price of 
coal, and they now expecting us to pay for it.  
Alternatively, Chairperson, they knew that they 
could speculate and make money and if they lose, they will 
be able to negotiate.  But to negotiate, what was their key 
negotiating point, how would they negotiate a this.  They 
knew and in my statement, I say that is why this all affects 
Mr. Ramaphosa, in case they need to do this negotiating.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think part of the point of Mr Seleka’s 
question, I think was aimed at that I want you to just 
complete that, was to say that the experts that he referred 
to. 
And may be for OCM were saying it is not in 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 61 of 299 
 
Eskom’s interests for Eskom not to give us an increase on 
the price, maybe not as high as we are demanding but it is 
not in Eskom’s interest to have us operating under this 
type of hardship because it may lead to us either - it may 
have a result where the security of coal will be threatened 
or where we cannot supply coal, or whatever.  
I think that is part of what was being said and I 
think this, this is the chance for you to say yes, I 
understand that, or no, I do not understand that or that has 
no validity because of A, B, C, D deal with that upfront. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I think the reasoning was flawed.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because it looked at the problem at that 
point.  It looked at the problem at that point and not the 
genesis of the problem.  So, I had by that time, I had a full 
picture of what was happening.  As I said earlier, I had 
even been to the other side in Transnet and I have seen 
what, how Optimum operated and they have a flaw in the, 
they have a flaw in their conclusion was genesis, but it was 
not, it would not have been – you see Chairperson if we 
20 
would have done that we would be encouraging very badly.  
If we had let Optimum get away with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, no, but I do not think that your 
response in saying flaw at the point or that proposition was 
with the genesis of the problem because you could have a 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 62 of 299 
 
genesis of the problem where you could put them at fault, 
to say they did not do due diligence, or they miscalculated 
by doing A, B, C or not doing A, B, C, D.  
But you might be faced with a certain reality at a 
certain stage, and I think the question is, what do you say 
about 
whether, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
genesis, 
whether 
continuing to insist on the price that was in the agreement, 
would lead to a situation where the security of coal was 
threatened because I would imagine that if you were 
persuaded that Eskom’s interest would be jeopardised by 
10 
insisting on the price that was in the agreement.  
Even if you said they were at fault for not doing due 
diligence in the first place, you would say, look, let us look 
at the reality as it is now.  How do we protect Eskom’s 
interests and maybe you would conclude, we protect 
Eskom’s interest by not agreeing to 400 or whatever, but 
maybe to a little more.  So that is what I want you to 
address to say, was it true that insisting on this price that 
was on the on the agreement could pose a threat to coal 
security for Eskom? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, South Africa has 400 years 
coal in the country.  There is no shortage of coal what they 
may be a shortage of, is human being extracted coal and 
feed as of supplier ’s coal.  There is actually not even a 
reason why coal should be expensive for Eskom.  We just 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 63 of 299 
 
have a lot of coal that God has given us, God given coal 
“mahala” that is underground.  
Now what is happening is that people instil fear into 
Eskom especially with load shedding, and so on and say, 
we do not have enough coal, there is going to be a coal 
lift, the shortage of coal.  If you do not do this, you are 
going to have dire consequences.  
What was happening at the time, at the same time 
as this was happening, and Mr Bester mentions it but 
mentions it in a very wrong way and misquotes it.  At the 
10 
same time, as we were having this problem in Medupi, 
Eskom at the beginning of the building Medupi type of pay 
agreements and those type of pay agreements were 
supposed to commence, I cannot remember if it was 2014 
or 2015 and Medupi was delayed.  
There were penalties in the billions that were 
supposed to be paid.  Now, in that instance, Eskom could 
not afford those penalties.  Nobody was coming, was 
saying those people were not prepared to negotiate and 
say, guys, we have a delay in the delivery of Medupi, 
20 
please relax the penalties.  They were not even prepared 
to negotiate.  
They were playing hardball in Medupi, what I then 
said at the time was can we investigate.  If it is possible 
for us to pay the penalties, or to pay for the coal at Medupi 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 64 of 299 
 
and get it delivered because I think Exxaro, I may have the 
parties wrong but the parties that were involved in this 
were banking on the fact that they were going to get the 
penalties for free because they do not have too mine, they 
do not have to they just get paid because they have a 
contract there. 
Let them deliver the coal, let us investigate if it will 
be possible for the coal to be railed on there, somewhere 
near Hendrina and be dumped there and then we can carry 
it into Hendrina by a truck or whatever, but let it be railed 
10 
from there and be taken to Hendrina if these people are 
threatening to close down Optimum mine. 
What Mr Bester says I said they must build a 
railway line, I did not I said, let us investigate the possible, 
transport that coal that we are going to pay for without 
using.  So the investigation that involves taking the quality 
of the coal to see if it was possible to use it but I was quite 
prepared Chairperson, to look at options, alternative 
options to just simply increasing the price for people that 
had not done due diligence that had relied on political 
20 
influence to make sure that that agreement eventually goes 
fine.  It was principle, Chairperson it was a matter of 
principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I do not - what comes across from what 
you are saying may not be what you intend to come across, 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 65 of 299 
 
that because of the genesis of the problem you might have 
even that may be more weight than the question of okay, is 
there a threat to coal supply security for Eskom if we 
continue to insist on the price that is in agreement.  
Because as I said, my own understanding, and you 
must tell me if yours is different is that if what was driving, 
and if what was paramount to you was the interests of 
Eskom.  Then even if they were 100% to blame for the 
genesis of the problem, if insisting on the price that was in 
the agreement would pose a serious threat to coal security 
10 
for Eskom. 
What would be called for, would be for you to adopt 
an approach to this issue that could see some increase, 
maybe not necessarily the one they wanted, but some 
increase in order to mitigate the threat to coal security 
because in the end, your primary concern is the interests 
of Eskom.  What do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:    A threat? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, in other words, I want to establish 
whether insisting on this price that was in the agreement 
20 
could lead to a situation where there was a threat to coal 
security for Eskom, or what was in place to deal with such 
a threat if it arose? 
MR MOLEFE:   The threat of coal supply security 
Chairperson was the Boogey Man. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 66 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was the? 
MR MOLEFE:   The Boogey Man it was something that I 
used to put fear into us.  It was a cheap negotiating 
strategy that you will not get coal.  As I said, when I 
opened, when I started talking now, I said, we have 400 
years of coal in the ground.  We do not have a coal supply 
security problem. 
In fact, the problem has been that we have allowed, the 
legislative framework has allowed a few white companies 
to exploit our coal and have excluded the majority of South 
10 
Africans in that invest.  That is coal that is under the 
ground that was put by God, so we have coal so that was 
always my point of departure.  Anybody who says coal 
supply security, I say we have 400 years of coal.  The 
question is how do we get to Hendrina?  So it is not like 
there is a shortage of coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:  No Chairperson if you said to me that if these 
guys do not give us coal there would be no coal then I would 
be afraid.  But if Hendrina closes down the whole of South 
20 
Africa has coal.  We would make a plan.  We would have to 
make a plan and if we cannot make plan we are stupid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no you see I think you starting to 
address for me what is quite an important issue.  You have 
400 years of coal underground but how quickly could coal 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 67 of 299 
 
start to be delivered if OCM stopped?  I think that – how 
much time would – would lapse without you getting coal to 
replace what OCM was giving Eskom if the situation ended 
up in them not being able to deliver coal? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson as the CEO of Eskom allowing 
yourself to be manipulated by the threat of supply of coal is 
the same that drives an energy cost up in Eskom and leads 
to high electricity prices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  You must never allow that threat or you must 
10 
never adhere to be phased by that threat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr – Mr Ephron Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ephron 
MR MOLEFE:  No his boss.  Mr… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Glasenberg. 
MR MOLEFE:  Glasenberg came to Eskom and said to me Mr 
Molefe we do not agree to this agreement.  There will be no 
supply of coal and you will have more load shedding.  I said 
20 
to him, Mr Glasenberg if you are putting a gun to my head I 
am going to ask you to shoot me.  And that meeting ended 
on that note.   
 
And a few weeks later I do not know if it was 
coincidence or what it was Mr Ramatlhodi suspended their 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 68 of 299 
 
licence.  He suspended their licence meaning they will not 
supply us with coal.   
 
When I put one plus one together I thought how can 
Mr Ramatlhodi suspend their licence after they have just 
threatened me that they will stop the supply of coal. 
 
Anyway we went to talk to him, he put it back and 
they continued operating.  And then they put the company in 
business rescue.   
 
Now the thing about business rescue is that all 
agreements can be suspended.  That is the first thing that 
10 
the business rescue practitioners that they appointed did 
within 24 hours they told us that if we do not agree to the 
agreement because their business rescue plan is increasing 
the price.  If we do not agree to the agreement that the – the 
price will increase they will have to stop supply to Hendrina.  
And they did.  And we did not back off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did stop. 
MR MOLEFE:  We did not back off… - sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – are you saying they did stop 
supplying? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  The did stop supply of coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  They did stop the supply of coal for a month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  We scavenged for coal.  We found coal.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 69 of 299 
 
Hendrina Power Station did not close down.  It happened just 
after we had stopped load shedding on the 8t h of August 
2015 just after – we – here we are celebrating that we now 
have the operations right and then they stopped the supply 
of coal to Hendrina – the business rescue practitioners. 
 
What were we supposed to do panic – what we 
supposed to do have more load shedding as Glasenberg had 
threatened me.  But we did not.  We made a plan. 
 
For a month we supplied Hendrina with coal from 
other small mainly BEE miners around the area until in 
10 
September Mr Ephron called and said Mr Molefe can we talk 
again? 
 
I said yes we can talk.  He said I have just spoken to 
my superiors we are prepared to resume supplying you at 
R150.00. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At 150. 
CHAIRPERSON: What was the contractual price again –
R100 or R150? 
MR MOLEFE:  150. 
CHAIRPERSON:  150 so –  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  About 150. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  154. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja 153/154. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 70 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So he was saying they were prepared 
to resume supplying coal at the contractual price? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  At the contractual price – they did.  They were 
prepared to supply us at the contractual price except 
Chairperson now they threw a curve ball.  They say they are 
selling the mine to the Gupta’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They? 
MR MOLEFE:  We are selling the mine to the Gupta’s. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They tell you that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well they announced that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were … 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja they… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They announced publicly? 
MR MOLEFE:  They were engaged in negotiations they 
talked to the Gupta’s and they sold the mine to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  And this I said in November 2015 that – that 
was a master stroke. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was? 
MR MOLEFE:  A master stroke because they were so angry 
with us they were now going to have a campaign to taint us 
as Gupta people – to taint us as Gupta people.  00:06:11 the 
Public Protector came up with the report. She did not 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 71 of 299 
 
interview us.  She interviewed Mr Ephron.  Even Mr Ephron 
went to him – to her to complain about us and she instituted 
that report. 
 
There was a media campaign. Chairperson you will 
surprised what a R1 billion can do.  A media campaign of 
note to rubbish us as people who are controlled by the 
Gupta’s. 
 
Any scrap of evidence that you were next to the 
Gupta’s at any point because I see in this – in this 
commission as well there is an allegation that I was in an 
10 
aeroplane that had the Gupta’s in there that was flying to – I 
was on my way to the BICS meetings and they happened to 
be in the same aeroplane. 
 
Now things like that emerged ja plus now you are in 
the aeroplane with them and so on.  Now you are forced us 
to send the mine to the Gupta’s.  That is what happened 
Chair.  That is why you and I are here today because I 
refused to sign that 4 – R150 agreement.  I refused to be – 
to be bullied into acting against the interests of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so… 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So they sold – they sold the mine to the 
Gupta’s.  We did not – I did not make them sell the mine – 
they sold the mine to the Gupta’s of their own accord. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
are 
you 
saying 
you 
saw 
their 
statements that they would stop supplying coal to Eskom if 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 72 of 299 
 
you did not increase the price and that therefore Eskom 
would suffer because there would be no coal. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You saw it as a negotiating tactic to try 
and put pressure. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were prepared to see whether they 
would carry out their plans. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to the extent that they carried out for 
a month or so. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made alternative plans. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To get coal. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until they came back to you. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And said they were prepared to resume 
supplying coal. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the contractual price. 
MR MOLEFE:  Until they came back with their tail between 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 73 of 299 
 
their legs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because Chairperson that month and I knew 
that was a critical – critical month in the negotiations.  
Whoever – whoever battered an eyelid first – it was like 
poker – whoever battered the eyelid first loses.  So if I had 
gone back to them and said sorry guys we really need the 
coal we would have paid even more.  Out of interest 
Chairperson Eskom is paying about R900.00 from that 
R150.00.  How did that happen? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  In respect of which mine? 
MR MOLEFE:  It is paying Glencore R900.00 for coal on 
average. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On other mines? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja other mines – I am not sure if – I am not 
sure what is happening to Hendrina I have not followed it up.  
But I was reading somewhere that the – the – things we left 
at the cost of primary energy has gone through the roof.  
They have gone through the roof Chairperson – they are 
unsustainable.  Costs of primary energy before I arrived at 
20 
Eskom were about 17% per annum increase on average for 
about ten years.  During the two years that I was there the 
increase in the primary energy costs was 3%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was? 
MR MOLEFE:  3% below inflation.  It is because we did not 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 74 of 299 
 
agree to agreements like this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are saying they threatened us with 
stopping the supply of coal. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to try and push us to agree to this 
high increase. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We were not prepared – we refused and we 
were prepared – we had a plan what we would do if they 
carried out their threats. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 And 
they 
did 
carry 
it 
out 
and 
we 
implemented our plan for that month. 
MR MOLEFE:  And we did not have load shedding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we are not the ones who went to them 
to say please can you stop your strike as it were. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are the ones who came back to us 
and said we are prepared to resume on the old terms of the 
agreement. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  The phone call came to me as I was boarding 
an aeroplane to Cape Town at about 5 or 6 in the evening. 
The phone rang and it was Mr Ephron and he said he would 
like to talk about the – the price and the resumption of the 
coal supply.  And I said to him Mr Ephron I am getting into a 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 75 of 299 
 
plane in fact the hostess was telling me to stop 00:12:14.  
But there is nothing to talk to until we start resuming 
operations tomorrow morning – by tomorrow morning eight 
o’clock.  If you resume operations tomorrow morning by eight 
o’clock at R150.00 maybe we can talk. 
 
And then when I got to the other side or maybe the 
following morning he called and he said Mr Molefe I am sorry 
to disappoint you we will not resume operations by eight 
o’clock but give us another 24 hours and we will have 
resumed operations.  I said that is fine at R150.00 – at 
10 
R150.00 fine then we can talk there. 
 
That was negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  A couple of things Mr 
Molefe to – to place before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so just before I just go back to this.  
Part you are saying is in negotiations you have your own – 
each party has got its own tact. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How to handle negotiations and some of 
20 
them might look like you are taking too much of a risk. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is a judgment call that you have to 
make. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 76 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you take risks and you have an 
appropriate plan what you will do if the risk materialises. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it is okay and that is what you say 
you did. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  In the literature Chairperson when I was 
trained in negotiations it is called BATNA – Best Alternative 
to a Negotiated Agreement and so when you are in 
negotiations what you assess is that if we do not come to an 
agreement what will happen?  Will it be worst for the 
10 
opponent or worse for me?  We have to assess that and see 
that if your BATNA alternative to a negotiated agreement is 
better than your opponents outcome then you can go all the 
way because they cannot afford to negotiate the absence of 
an agreement.  Ja there is a tactic to arrive but hopefully you 
arrive at the middle ground before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  But to be threatened by something that does 
not exist you cannot threaten us with coal supply with 400 
years of coal underground.  You cannot do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  A couple of things to put before – to you 
Mr Molefe.  In regard to the stoppage of coal supply I have 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 77 of 299 
 
got a number of them – I am not taking them in any 
particular order.  In order to the stoppage of coal supply. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The coal supply was stopped on the 20t h 
of August 2015 – 20 August 2015 that is when you got a 
letter from the business rescue practitioners and they said 
they cannot supply anymore and they gave you a proposal 
for an interim arrangement.  That coal supply only lived for 
thirteen days because the meeting you had with them was on 
the 3rd of September 2015.  So it was not for a month – their 
10 
stoppage was not for a month.  And they saying Mr Ephron in 
his affidavit the meeting was actually requested by Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:  By? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  By Eskom and then he took the offer 
called Mr Molefe, Mr Koko, Mr Molefe that the two of you met 
with them.  But you actually wanted to meet him with the 
business rescue practitioners but when the business rescue 
practitioners were there you told them not to be part of the 
meeting you will only speak to Mr Ephron.  So I am just 
putting to you Mr Ephron’s version.   
20 
 
So the stoppage was thirteen days not a month and 
the standard stock days at Hendrina was 35 days.  So you 
could operate within thirteen days with a stock pile of 35 
days because then supply was reinstated on the 3rd of 
September after the meeting where you agreed to an interim 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 78 of 299 
 
arrangement.  Your comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson my recollection is not that we 
asked for a meeting.  Mr Ephron did call [?] they are 
prepared to resume operations the following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR MOLEFE:  At R150.00 and I said to him eight o’clock the 
following morning and later on he said 24 hours.  It may well 
be maybe that there are officials that had been making 
contact panicking during this period and making contact with 
the – the business rescue practitioners and Optimum that I 
10 
did not know about.  But I was certainly not involved in going 
to cap in hand to Optimum to ask for coal – I did not do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then secondly is – I mean following that 
meeting according to Mr Ephron the interim arrangement is 
in place in terms of which OCM will supply coal to Eskom at 
the Hendrina Power Station. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is the interim arrangement I said 
lived until 29 July 2016.  But here on the hardship clause the 
hardship clause Mr Ephron says: 
20 
“In early 2014 Eskom approached OCM to 
see if it would agree to suspend the hardship 
arbitration.” 
So remember 2013 they invoked their hardship.  He says 
early 20 – 2013 invoke – 2014 you – Eskom come to them 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 79 of 299 
 
and say suspend a hardship arbitration because they have 
taken the matter to arbitration. 
MR MOLEFE:   2014? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2014 – Early 2014.   Allow for a period of 
negotiations regarding the hardship clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he was not there in 2014. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no I accept that.  I am just telling 
you because you were saying why did they not pursue the 
hardship clause and the answer seems to be here.  So 
10 
Eskom says suspend the hardship arbitration to allow for a 
period of negotiations regarding the hardship claim and other 
decisions.  OCM agreed and on 23 May 2014 they conclude 
their cooperation agreement which providing a process to 
further negotiate potential amendments and an extension of 
the CS – CSA as well as possible settlement of disputes in 
relation to hardship and penalties the hardship arbitration 
was suspended and certain interim arrangements were put in 
place to ameliorate the difficulties experienced by OCM. The 
parties also suspended the enforcement of their respective 
20 
rights on account of alleged breaches of the CSA.   
 
So we know that this is the cooperation agreement 
which ultimately is... 
MR MOLEFE:  In 2014? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja it is concluded 2014 suspends the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 80 of 299 
 
hardship. 
MR MOLEFE:  But the person – the person who signed the 
cooperation agreement Mr Seleka did he have authority to do 
so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will come to that – all I am saying to 
you is this is how the hardship clause was dealt with.  The 
parties agreed to suspend his enforcement entering into the 
cooperation agreement.  Number 3. 
MR MOLEFE:  If I –  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay yes please. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Alright the only way of dealing with the 
hardship clause would have been to go for arbitration. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is why I am reading to you what 
Mr Ephron is saying.  They had invoked that. 
MR MOLEFE:  What Mr Ephron said? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. They had invoked that and the 
parties agreed to suspend it entering into a cooperation 
agreement to – to negotiate a new agreement.  So they did 
not sit on their loins and let the situation just run its course.  
And with the affidavit that has been referred to by the 
20 
Chairperson of Mr Ephron he explains that the hardship is 
intended for the very purpose where circumstances change 
that a party can then invoke a hardship clause in a long term 
agreement to engage in negotiations for better or reasonable 
terms between the parties.  I am just giving you the version.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 81 of 299 
 
I am not saying this is what I am saying – my view.  Ja so 
you can invoke in the long term agreement because you do 
not know what is going to happen ten or twenty years down 
the line.  Circumstances change unforeseeable you invoke 
the hardship; you then start negotiations because that is 
what the hardship clause triggers.  It trigger negotiations to 
propose amendments to an existing agreement.  So that is 
the explanation.   
MR MOLEFE:  If I may comment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  It is the old story of the lion and the hunter.  
So it depends on who you believe about what happened at 
the hunt.  Do you believe the lion or do you believe the 
hunter?  That is his version (Adv Seleka speaking over Mr 
Molefe). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So which one is the lion? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know I am just making an example. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
MR MOLEFE:  That is his version and I have got my version 
and I will stick to my version. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Except that his version now I do not 
think it is a version as such as much as his a reference to 
the hardship clause to tell you when it gets to be triggered 
and what it triggers as a result of it being invoked.  The 
parties then start to negotiate and this is what you found 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 82 of 299 
 
happening at Eskom board when you arrived. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Mr Seleka in terms of the Coal Supply 
Agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  The only thing that the hardship triggered was 
arbitration not the fancy things that they started engaging in. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The negotiations? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe Mr Seleka I should say is – is 
Mr Ephron … 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Molefe needs to either pull the 
microphone closer to him. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the sound system does not pick 
him up. 
MR MOLEFE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think just speak closer to it. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is Mr Ephron referring to the hardship 
clause to explain why they did not do due diligence?  In 
20 
other words is he – is he saying that we did not do due 
diligence is not a problem because there is this clause?  We 
could always ask for negotiations and if we under – suffer 
hardship we could invoke this clause?  Is that in part at least 
what he is saying?  You are not sure? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 83 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I do not want to put it at that level 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I know from his affidavit the direct 
reasons specific to why they did not do due diligence are 
centred 
around 
what 
he 
says 
was 
publicly 
available 
information at the time and then not – or trying to avoid 
alerting third parties that they were about to take over OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja so publicly available information and 
10 
understood that it was competing with various other potential 
purchasers to acquire the control of OCH and therefore took 
the strategic decision to rely on that publicly available 
information 
and 
effect 
its 
acquisition 
to 
a 
series 
of 
transactions with OCH on the stock exchange without 
involvement of OCH.  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
I 
am 
trying 
to 
understand 
the 
significance of his point about the purpose of invoking the 
hardship. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The hardship. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The hardship clause particularly the clause 
as I understand the position.  On this particular occasion 
they did not pursue it up to the end namely arbitration.  As I 
understand the position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Chair just before you Mr Molefe.  As 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 84 of 299 
 
he explains in his affidavit and so it does not answer your 
main question but your ancillary question.  The pursuit of the 
hardship clause was made.  It was inter-routed by the parties 
agreeing amicably to suspend it and enter into a cooperation 
agreement.  Then this in May 2014.  By the time of the 
termination of the cooperation agreement in June 2015 there 
was only over a period of over a month before OCM went 
into 
business 
rescue. 
 
Then 
the 
business 
rescue 
practitioners take control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is when they start engaging with 
Eskom.  So what whether in that process they could as OCM 
still pursue the arbitration they would I think have had to 
seek the consent of the – well the business rescue 
practitioners could have had to run with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well so I am trying to understand the point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they are aggrieved by the fact 
that the price – they are aggrieved by the price that is in the 
contract.  They want it to be increased.  Eskom says no.  
20 
They have the option of pursuing arbitration under the 
hardship clause.  They initiated that.  Then on what you have 
told me by agreement between the parties this either 
terminated or suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Suspended. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 85 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pending the outcome of the efforts that 
would be made under the cooperation agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Eskom terminates the cooperation 
agreement obviously they must go back to using the 
hardship clause and pursuing arbitration if they still feel 
aggrieved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they feel they have a case to put 
before the arbitrator.  So – so that is what I am trying to 
10 
follow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
after 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
cooperation agreement they did not pursue the arbitration as 
I understand it  
ADV SELEKA SC:  My… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you say in two months’ time they 
wanted to (speaking over one another). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  My recon… - sorry Chair.  My recollection 
is that they did but I will have to check the specific 
20 
paragraphs that matters then went back to arbitration after 
the termination because then Eskom also referred to the 
penalty claim to arbitration.  I think the two were then 
consolidated.  Mr Molefe, you will remind us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But do they blame Eskom about anything 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 86 of 299 
 
concerning arbitration or arbitration not taking place?  So 
in other words, what is the importance, significance of 
whether they followed or did not follow or pursue up to the 
end the route of arbitration as far as they are concerned.   
 
Because as I understand it, nothing prevented 
them from pursuing arbitration even when there was an 
agreement to suspend, they did not have to agree to 
suspend the hardship clause or the route of arbitration if 
they did not want to and they wanted an arbitration award 
to be issued in their favour.   
10 
 
So I am trying to understand what their point is 
about the arbitration route. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, they dumped a portion in blame on 
Eskom in regard to what that – I do not want to say the 
apparent figure to pursue the hardship clause to the very 
end.  I think what, what one sees from the evidence Chair 
is, that the situation gets overtaken by events. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because this arbitration is ultimately 
pursued beyond 2015.  It is then 2016 and 2017 gets to the 
20 
settled on the penalties.  By that – by December 2015, 
there is an agreement to by chairs in OCH to take over 
OCH.   
 
But I will have to see the passage regarding 
what happens immediately after the termination letter from 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 87 of 299 
 
Mr Molefe which I have found otherwise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember the big picture. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you do that, the big picture is, I think 
they suggest in their evidence that Eskom was being, I 
think, unfair on them, to say the least, by insisting on this 
price that was in the contract. 
 
Mr Molefe has given reasons why they insisted 
on that contract price.  He said they made threat of 
stopping the supply of coal.  He had said that was 
10 
negotiated but he understood it.   
 
He put a plan in place.  He says, subject to what 
I think you said, it might not have been a month but he 
says 
he 
had 
a 
plan 
to 
deal 
with 
that 
threat 
if 
it 
materialised.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is important to keep the big picture 
in terms of what we are trying to establish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Molefe has been dying to say 
something ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, there is something that was 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 88 of 299 
 
mentioned by Mr Seleka that I think is quite fundamental 
and goes to the bona fides of Optimum.  He says that they 
did not do due diligence because they did not – they were 
afraid of the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Third parties... to know. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...confidentiality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   Now in due diligence, the first thing that 
10 
gets filed is a confidentiality agreement, a very strict 
confidentiality agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   The information gets put into what they call 
data rooms.  I have in my life, Chairperson, done a lot of 
transactions 
with 
very 
sensitive 
information.  
Confidentiality is not an excuse not to do... in the first 
place.   
 
Secondly, the two things that sunk them was the 
international coal price.  International coal price.  This has 
20 
got nothing to do with confidentiality.  They were open to 
international contract...  number one.   
 
Number two, it was R 150.00 that they know was 
in place.  It was not a secret.  It was in the CSA.  They 
could have told Eskom.  It would have told them that you 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 89 of 299 
 
have a price of R 150 until 2018.  They decided to pursue 
that transaction despite knowing that. 
 
And by the way Chairperson, the R 150 itself 
was the result of arbitration with the previous audit.  So 
Eskom 
had 
gone 
to 
arbitration 
before 
on 
this 
very 
agreement.  The reason ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   They were not going to arbitration.  It 
means that they were – their bet was on something 
extraordinary. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So part of the point you are making is 
that OCM should not have been crying, like they were 
crying about being treated unfairly by Eskom, because in 
terms of the coal supply agreement that was in place there 
was a hardship clause, which they could use if they felt 
that Eskom was treating them harshly. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they could take it up to arbitration 
and you say they had done so before and there was this 
150 was as a result of arbitration and they chose not to 
20 
pursue the arbitration clause to its end. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, to the point where I even felt like they 
were treating us like little boys that needed to be taught a 
lesson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 90 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   That would not follow through on our rights 
to the agreement, they had a sense of impediment 
Chairperson, they had a sense of impediment.   There was 
proper mechanisms to the agreement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, and you say if they felt that they 
had a good case to put before the arbitrator they had the 
opportunity to do so. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why didn’t they do that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the arbitrator would have had 
power to increase the price if they made a proper case. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, thank you.  We are two, three 
minutes before one o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let me deal with this one 
Chairperson.  Then the notices by the DMR, those notices 
were before OCM went into business rescue because OCM 
– well actually they coincide with the business rescue, on 
the 4 t h of August 2015, these are notices in regard to 
20 
OCM’s alleged failure to follow a proper retrenchment 
process.  These are different from notices of November 
2015, which we will come to later, because with the notices 
of August, 4 August 2015 Mr Ramatlhodi and Mr Ramoncha 
say you did not meet with them.  Those notices were then 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 91 of 299 
 
lifted on the 7 t h of August 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, there were two meetings, when those 
notices were given to OCM ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to come closer to the mic. 
MR MOLEFE:   When those notices were – those notices 
were given to OCM shortly after my meeting with Mr 
Glasenberg where I said he is putting it down to my ... and 
I remember distinctly Chairperson thinking how did they get 
to Mr Ramatlhodi who is now executing their plan to stop 
supply.   I did call Mr Ramatlhodi at a meeting and I 
10 
explained to him that please withdraw those notices 
because they are threatening the security of supply, we are 
in a very delicate position, and shortly thereafter they were 
withdrawn.   
 
I agree, there was another meeting later, there 
was another meeting later, but what is strange about the 
allegations of Mr Ramatlhodi was that we were saying in 
that meeting that he should withdraw Glencore’s license.   
We could not have said he must withdraw Glencore’s 
license, when he had already done so previously, he had 
20 
already done so previously of his own accord for different 
reasons, and I specifically persuaded  him don’t do this, 
because you are complicating everything, and immediately 
after, you can check the dates, immediately after those 
notices were withdrawn and OCM was prepared to – was 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 92 of 299 
 
allowed to operate again they then went into business 
rescue, and the day after business rescue was announced 
they stopped supply. 
 
Their objective was to stop the supply of coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Molefe to the extent that you are 
saying to me you suspected that there may have been 
collusion between Minister Ramatlhodi and OCM with 
regard to the issuing of those notices, why would OCM 
have needed to talk to him in order to stop the coal 
because they could stop coal without his assistance? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no, no Chairperson I am not saying that 
there was collusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are you saying? 
MR MOLEFE:   I am saying well it was coincidental, 
immediately after this threat was made the notices were 
issued by DMR.  What I am saying is that it did cross my 
mind 
that 
they 
might 
have 
made 
contact 
with 
Mr 
Ramatlhodi, I do not have evidence of that in fact.   In fact 
it could be purely coincidental.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But you accept ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  But it happened at a very interesting time, 
which is just after Mr Glasenberg had put the proverbial 
gun to my head and I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, but you accept that to stop coal 
they didn’t need his assistance, OCM? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 93 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no Chairperson, what happened is – no 
they needed – no they needed an excuse because when Mr 
Glasenberg said we will stop the supply of coal, CDH can 
tell you, I immediately gave them instructions to interdict 
the stoppage of the supply of coal, right, because we have 
a contractual agreement, they were obliged to continue 
supplying us at 150, so there had to be an extraordinary 
reason for the interdict not to succeed.   
 
So suddenly it is the DMR that says because of 
retrenchments we are taking your license away, so you 
10 
cannot interdict us, because they will say but it is not us, 
the DMR. 
 
Then that gets fixed and then coal supply is 
restored, then they go into business rescue and you cannot 
interdict business rescue, so the only thing legally that we 
could do when they stopped, if Mr Glasenberg was to carry 
out his threat of stopping supply for us to interdict, but 
business rescue and DMR could not be interdicted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But leaving out DMR and the issue of 
business rescue ordinarily if they wanted to stop supplying 
20 
coal they would not need anybody’s assistance, ordinarily 
is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, we would interdict them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no if you don’t interdict them, if 
they don’t go to anybody, if they want to stop they could 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 94 of 299 
 
just stop it. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, they could stop it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you would have your remedies. 
MR MOLEFE:   We would come running to the courts Chair 
to say we have an agreement with these people and we 
would sue t hem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja, but practically they could 
stop it and fight you in court if they want to. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, they could stop it and fight with us in 
court. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   But you see that is I was getting ready for 
that battle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, of interdicting them, but then they got 
business rescue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think they ...[indistinct] you [laughing] 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, it was hard Chairperson, it was very 
hard.   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright I think we must take the 
20 
lunch break, I think there was ...[intervenes]    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair can I clarify something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It goes on the facts here, on the facts 
Mr Molefe, the notices are – the August notices are issued 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 95 of 299 
 
on the 4 t h of August, by that time there is no stoppage of 
coal supply to Eskom, they had not stopped.  The DMR 
notices in regard to the retrenchment process are issued 
on the 4 t h and then lifted on the 7 t h of August.  The 
business rescue practitioners only notify you on the 20 t h of 
August that they are going to stop. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So their stoppage had nothing to – and 
even assisted by the DMR. 
MR MOLEFE:  The effect of the notices would eventually 
10 
lead to a ...[indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but supply didn’t stop. 
MR MOLEFE:   No it didn’t stop, I never said it stopped, 
but the conditions were created to stop it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think part of the point Mr Seleka is 
making is this, because I understood you to be saying in 
your evidence that notices came after Mr Glasenberg had 
spoken to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I seem to understand that he is saying 
no, no, no, the notices came first. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because – or at least the business 
practitioners only came much later. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 96 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair you may well be correct, Mr 
Molefe hasn’t given us a date when he has met with Mr 
Glasenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The meeting we have on record is of 
the 3 r d of September, that is way after those notices of 
August. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But then that is where they, the two 
parties 
capitulate 
and 
they 
agree 
to 
enter 
into 
an 
10 
agreement arrangement, from then going forward. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Glasenberg was not in the meeting of 
September. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am not saying he was, all I am 
saying is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   The meeting that Mr Glasenberg was in was 
before the DMR notices, before business rescue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember the date? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was sometime in July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sometime in July? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I can’t remember the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  There were people at that meeting, in fact 
Mr Ephron, in Mr Ephron’s affidavit he may refer to that 
meeting, I will find it during lunch time Chairperson.  Even 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 97 of 299 
 
my affidavit I may refer to the day on which Mr Glasenberg 
from Mr Ephron’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you – please do check during the 
lunch, the date during the lunch break. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you might not need to spend too 
much time on this issue, because you said you were not 
even suspecting but something crossed your mind about 
the two – the notices and the facts, so that ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   You must appreciate Chair that under the 
10 
circumstances you also become very paranoid, so when 
two things happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   You start joining dots that don’t exist, like 
people join dots. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja, no that is right, so when we 
come back maybe Mr Molefe can just indicate what date 
that meeting was but we don’t spend too much time on it, 
we move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we will move on Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright let us take the lunch break, 
it is now eight minutes past one, we will resume at ten past 
two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 98 of 299 
 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  We are ready 
to proceed.  Chair, we found two aspects which arose in 
our discussion prior to the adjournment.  One is the date of 
the meeting that Mr Molefe is referring to.  The other is 
what happened with the hardship arbitration after the 
termination.  So both of that are in Mr Molefe’s...  Let us 
10 
use your files Mr Molefe.  Which is Eskom Bundle 17 on 
page 134.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What are we going to get there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be – there are two aspects.  One 
is the date of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the other is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But just say what the date is.  Is it 
before or after the 4 t h of August? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The date is the 11 t h of June 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the meeting with Mr Glasenberg? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With Mr Glasenberg, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay the other aspect was what? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 99 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The other aspect is what happened to 
the hardship arbitration.  Mr Ephron says after the 
termination by Mr Molefe, the termination process, the 
hardship arbitration recommenced on 23 June 2015 and the 
hearing date was scheduled for 16 to 27 May 2016.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Molefe did say a date had been 
scheduled ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for hearing but I think the point was, 
the arbitration was not pursued to its conclusion. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that was the point I think he was 
seeking to make or making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Otherwise ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess the only thing is for 
Mr Molefe just to confirm whether he accepts that the date 
of his meeting, your meeting with Mr Glasenberg is the 
date that he gives. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, indeed Chair it was correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, it was before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before?  Way before? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, way, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 100 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that puts in place the sequence 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I – I hope ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe just for the sake of 
completion on the point Mr Molefe.  I would take it that in 
the light of that date, your thought about any connection 
10 
between Mr Glasenberg said to you and the notices on the 
4 t h of August falls away. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was just saying I did have it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was just a historical thing that happened 
at the time.  I am not saying I hold the view now.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  I accept. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to – that we be on the same 
20 
page. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  Proceed Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, no.  That changes the events 
quite significantly.  But Chair we also got the letter of 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 101 of 299 
 
Mr Molefe of the 10 t h of June 2015, terminating the 
Corporation Agreement and negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he has... to say it ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to say anything about it? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  I must confess that I had completely 
forgotten that I written or sent a letter like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because of the passage of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...on the 15 t h of...  Sorry, the 15 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   That I had written that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   But because of the passing of time, I had 
forgotten that I had written a letter like that.  But what this 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 102 of 299 
 
letter would have done in the way that it is structured, it 
has triggered the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I should know where the letter is 
in the bundle so I can have a look at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was not incorporated Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we...  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Registrar...  Well, if you 
10 
do not need it Mr Molefe...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I have a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I can have a look.  Oh, you have a 
copy? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, then let us have another copy so 
that Mr Molefe can keep that copy.  Was there to be any 
significance on the content of the letter other than that it 
was a termination of the Corporation Agreement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We only wanted to show the 
20 
termination Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think Mr Molefe thought it might 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I think the way that it is, it is sufficient 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 103 of 299 
 
to trigger the arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The arbitration? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   So this letter, the way it was written, would 
have triggered arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   And it did, because on the 21 s t, they 
applied for the arbitration date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say the 21 s t of which month? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Of June, I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you mean the ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, subsequent to this letter there was an 
application for arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja by OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   23 June. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, and then a date was set. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is how the ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The sequence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, this is how the whole thing should have 
unfolded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 104 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  No, that is fine.  Then I do 
not have to read the contents ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...if the only point was, this was the 
letter of termination? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that proves the termination.  
What I need to emphasise here Chair and Mr Molefe also, 
10 
is that this is far removed from the notices of the DMR 
which come in August, the 4 t h of August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he has conceded that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Chair, before I move on.  
May I draw one aspect to your attention unrelated to the 
matter?  I was approached during the lunch adjournment by 
the legal representatives for Mr Anoj Singh with an email 
that they have been asked by the secretariat to come 
20 
before you this afternoon.  Apparently, in order to argue 
the 
postponement 
or 
present 
the 
postponement 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you seen the note that they are 
talking about?  The secretariat would not do that. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 105 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What does it say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The emails says:   
“Dear 
Mr Mathopo... 
[which 
is 
Mr 
Singh’s 
attorney] ... our telecon this morning at 10:04 
refers. [This is 2 March 2021]   
As discussed in our telecon.  While the 
secretariat does not have formal instructions 
on this matter, we suggest that your counsel 
appears before the Chairperson at some stage 
10 
during 
the 
proceedings 
today 
in 
Braamfontein...” 
 
But I think the sentence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is nonsense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, they ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Since when do they have the power to 
able it to appear before the Commission who is not 
scheduled to appear? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but I think that sentence is clear 
Chair.  They do not have formal instructions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but why do they say that in the first 
place? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not their place.  Well, will you 
arrange for the secretary to talk to me about that letter? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 106 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is it signed by? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I mention it here Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, mention it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is Ms Shannon van Vuuren. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the secretary of the Commission? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is part of the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, she is not the secretary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, she is not.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will your junior please bring it to the 
10 
attention of the secretary of the Commission and ask him 
to investigate how the person who sent that letter came to 
sent that letter to the attorneys concerned and make those 
arrangements? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now he caused them to come all the way 
here for nothing.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is unacceptable.  If your junior could 
communicate 
with 
the 
secretary 
of 
the 
Commission, 
20 
Mr Masala, to investigate how this happened?  And to talk 
to me about it sometime after the hearing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Molefe? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 107 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us proceed.  Mr Molefe, the – let 
us put this to you so that you can respond to it.  While 
OCM was refused the price increase of R 154.00 to 
R 442.00, we see subsequent to this in January 2016, that 
Eskom was not only prepared but in fact did go to conclude 
short-term agreements with Tegeta for the supply of coal in 
terms of which Eskom paid more than R 442.00 per ton to 
Tegeta.   
 
The contract in January – for the contract in 
10 
January, Eskom paid Tegeta R 467.00 per ton.  For the 
contract in February 2016, Eskom paid Tegeta R 490.00 
per ton. 
 
But before I give you a chance, let me add, the 
coal that Tegeta was supplying to Eskom, it was obtaining 
it from OCM at a price higher than R 442.00.  On the first 
one, it is R 448.00.  So they are getting the R 448.00 from 
OCM selling it at R 467.00 to Eskom. 
 
The second contract, they get it at R 467.00 
from OCM and sells it to Eskom at R 490.00.  Why did 
20 
Eskom then take that approach? 
MR MOLEFE:   Which line was this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was Arnot.   
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Firstly 
Chairperson, 
on 
the 
1st of September, 
I 
underwent 
a 
procedure 
for 
my 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 108 of 299 
 
shoulder... and under general anaesthetic.  And during that 
procedure there was a problem, my lungs were flooded with 
water and they had to induce a coma about...   
 
And subsequent to that, I was not at work for the 
whole of December after I was released from hospital 
because my lungs were still quite weak.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Come closer to the mic. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh.  Subsequent to that, my lungs were still 
quite weak.  So I was not at work from the 1 s t of December 
until the middle of January.  So I was not part of these 
10 
negotiations for this...  But my understanding is that the 
Arnot contract which was in Exxaro – I think it was Exxaro. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...was at R 1 030,00 per ton and it was 
coming 
up. 
 
The 
40-years 
was 
expiring 
in 
December 2000(?)... [speaker ’s voice trails off at end of 
sentences – unclear.] 
 
This we had discussed even before I left.  And 
we were in negotiations with Exxaro to price negotiations 
for a new contract and we could not agree. 
20 
 
And I think Exxaro thought that we would 
eventually agree because of the shortage of coal.  That is 
exactly 
the 
same 
argument 
that: 
 
Where 
would 
we 
otherwise 
get 
the 
coal? 
 
And 
there 
demand 
was 
R 1 300,00(sic).   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 109 of 299 
 
 
They, in fact, wanted to increase the price.  We 
did not increase the price.  We did not increase the price.  
Instead, when the contract ended in December 2015, we 
got – I think it was six BEE companies to supply coal to 
Arnot on a short-term basis until we could either negotiate 
– finalise negotiations with Arnot or put in place another 
agreement, a long-term agreement. 
 
One of the six companies was Tegeta but there 
were five others.  Umzimbiti was one.  I just do not have 
the list here but there were six of them that we negotiated 
10 
with. 
 
So what you are saying Mr Seleka that we were 
buying coal at R 400,00 was actually better than the 
R 1 039,00 that we had been paying on the long-term 
contract.  So - and firstly. 
 
Secondly, it is not the same quality coal.  Arnot 
and Hendrina do not use the same quality coal.  So you 
cannot compare the price that was being paid at the 
Hendrina and the price that was being paid at Arnot.  So 
that is a completely different story. 
20 
 
And one cannot say:  Why would you take from 
Optimum at this much and then take it...  So each power 
station has in terms of its – the way it was built, the 
specifications, as specifications about the quality of coal 
that it takes and it is the quality of coal that determines the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 110 of 299 
 
price.   
 
But even at Arnot, R 1 039,00 per ton of coal 
was over the top and that is what we had been paying on a 
contract 
that 
terminated. 
 
Despite 
our 
hardship 
we 
continued to pay it until the contract came to an end and 
when it did, we got six BEE suppliers to supply us at about 
half of what we were getting the coal at. 
 
And did not... or agree with Exxaro.  They also 
used all sorts of negotiations... to get us to R 1 300,00 
which we resisted.  So it is something that was happening 
10 
as I was – just before I went to hospital and when I woke 
up there – I came back in January, I found out that they 
had six contractors that were supplying. 
 
I was not part of the actual mechanics of putting 
those six together and the agreeing to the price and 
deciding who they were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I am quite aware of what was 
happening to the coal supply contract at Arnot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Two things.  One is, on the 
20 
quality of coal.  I thought you were telling the Chairperson 
that this coal was being obtained from OCM.  OCM which 
was supplying to Hendrina Power Station and now Tegeta 
taking that coal from OCM and supplying it to Arnot.  So 
the quality was the same ...[intervenes]  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 111 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...insofar as the coal from a particular 
mine.  It did not come from another mine.  It came from 
OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   But Mr Seleka, if you remember that OCM 
was exporting coal from the Optimum Mine, the coal that 
was being exported was a different quality ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   ...to the coal ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct]  
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Address the Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh.  The coal that was being exported, was 
of a different quality to the quality that was been given to 
Eskom.  It was from the same mine but some of it had the 
export quality, some of it had no export quality.   
 
Now as I say, I was not there.  I was not – I am 
not in a position to comment about the qualities of the 
20 
coal.  What I am saying is that, it is possible that a 
different quality coal came out of the Hendrina Mine 
because they were exporting.  They had been exporting 
until they were stopped by the international price of coal. 
 
So.  Ja, that is – I am not a geologist or a mining 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 112 of 299 
 
engineer of coal, coal quality.  I do not have knowledge on 
coal quality but that is my understanding of what was 
happening.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then on the price.  Well, just 
before I move on.  The evidence is that because the coal at 
Hendrina – I mean at OCM, which was being supplied to 
Hendrina could also be used at Arnot, that is why they 
were able to also source from OCM the coal and supply to 
Hendrina.  To Arnot, I beg your pardon.  So that is what we 
see from the evidence. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I accept you saying you cannot go into 
the qualities ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No, but all I am saying is Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MR MOLEFE:   That the – it is possible that Hendrina had 
different qualities of coal because, as we know, they had 
been exporting high quality coal from the same mine and 
they were giving us low quality coal for purposes of 
burning at Hendrina.  So the fact that they could get 
20 
different quality coal from there is actually not a big 
scientific discovery.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but this is in December...  I mean, 
this is in January 2016.  They had closed their export in 
May 2015.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 113 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   They had closed their export in May 2015, 
not the mine.  So they could still get the coal.  I do not 
know.  Let me say ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   I was not there.  I did not know.  But just 
from thinking about it, I mean, the fact that they were not 
exporting does not mean they could not get the coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is the quality coal that they needed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The second thing on the price.  I 
10 
mean, you would have read the Parliamentary Portfolio 
Committee’s report.  That your figure of R 1 10,00 and 
thirty something was actually incorrect because Dentons 
came to a figure of R 646.00 per ton. 
MR MOLEFE:   For?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exxaro supplying coal to Arnot but the 
figure was not over one thousand one hundred. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, I understand under...  I remember it 
as 
actually 
specifically 
R 1 030,00 
but 
maybe 
the 
engineers – the Primary Energy people can explain it.  
20 
However, the principle is, even if it was at R 630.00 we 
were able to get it cheaper from the BEE supplier that were 
put together during December in... 
 
It may have been six hundred but I cannot 
remember but somebody like Mr Matshela Koko would have 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 114 of 299 
 
all those figures at his fingertips unlike me who was... who 
was firstly removed from the Primary Energy issues and in 
fact during that period was not even at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, and then talking of Exxaro.  Exxaro 
provided a submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio - 
provided an affidavit here in which they say that Eskom 
was engaging with them in negotiations with them to buy 
another piece of land from... 
 
Eskom had said to them:  Your contract at Arnot 
expires in 2023.  That was the position until in December 
10 
when Exxaro says Eskom suddenly says your contract is 
coming to an end by the end of December 2015. 
 
So the impression created is that, even this 
Exxaro like OCM, you yielded them out to create a space 
for Tegeta.  Can you comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, they wanted R 1 300,00.  The 
contract was coming to an end and in fact it did come to an 
end in December 2015.  If the contract was up to 2022, 
they should have enforced their rights.  They did not.  The 
contract came to an end. 
20 
 
And 
as 
far 
as 
I 
remember 
they 
wanted 
R 1 300,00.  It was unreasonable.  The fact that we could 
get the coal at R 400.00 from BEE suppliers around that 
area, that says a lot about exactly what was happening 
with Primary Energy at Eskom. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 115 of 299 
 
 
People were feeling entitled to have their 40-
year contract renewed at much higher prices than what we 
could get the coal for. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Tegeta was a cost ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So basically you are saying that once 
one accepts that you could get coal elsewhere for much 
less than what they wanted, there was no special reason 
why you should agree to a higher price? 
MR MOLEFE:   Exactly Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   In fact, my thinking about coal supply in 
South Africa to Eskom was that, there is 400-years of coal 
in the ground.  If you are allowed and gave Black Economic 
Empowerment companies, small companies the assistance 
to start mining the coal and you have a lot of them and you 
create a price tension through competition, you would 
actually reduce Eskom’s Primary Energy cost. 
 
But buying from a few big white companies that 
feel entitled and that controls supply just to squeeze you is 
not sustainable.  And unfortunately, as long as we are not 
20 
allowing the small BEE companies...   
 
As the small miners coming and having claims 
here and there and giving them supply to Eskom, you will 
see the price will come down because everybody wants to 
do the business and they will give you the right price which 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 116 of 299 
 
is why I was saying that... 
 
I said once and I was ridiculed for this, but what 
we need is the bread.  We do not want to own the bakery.  
So what Eskom was doing is that for it to get the bread, it 
was building bakeries for people through the... 
 
So they build a bakery for you and then they we 
will buy bread for you.  So I was saying, get out of the 
bakery.  Let these people have their own small bakeries 
and supply Eskom and you will see the price will come 
down. 
10 
 
This issue of Arnot demonstrates exactly what 
happened when you do now bow down to the pressure of – 
or the threat of the bogeyman of coal supply problems.   
 
Unfortunately, for them at the time...  I mean, the 
government had already given licenses.  There were quite 
a few BEE companies that are operating that were 
prepared and available to supply Eskom with coal at lower 
prices than the 40-year contract. I suspect the same thing 
would have happened at the Hendrina had we run into...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   As I understand it, the coal plus mine 
20 
does not provide coal at the said price per ton.  Instead, 
Eskom is responsible for paying operational and capital 
costs which were billed on a monthly basis and then the 
mine is paid a management fee to operate the mine.   
 
So I have asked Exxaro the question regarding 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 117 of 299 
 
your price per ton and the response is:  We do not know 
how Mr Molefe arrived at that price because that is not how 
the price is set.  Your response? 
MR MOLEFE:   Mister...  then again, you just said the price 
was R 600,00 ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry?  No, Dentons.  I said that was 
Dentons’ report. 
MR MOLEFE:   They said the price was R 600,00. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dentons’ report, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Says the price was R 600,00 per ton? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Dentons’ report, not Exxaro. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  So where did they get it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I would not know. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because Dentons was appointed by 
Eskom ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, Mr Seleka if you take a management 
fee – we can call it a management fee, right, of X amount 
20 
and divide it by the tons of coal that our supplier for that 
management fee, you come to the cost per ton.  You 
understand what I mean? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I hear what you are saying. 
MR MOLEFE:   If you charge a management fee of a 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 118 of 299 
 
thousand rands and you say supply one thousand tons of 
coal, it is one rand per ton.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MR MOLEFE:   So this financial gymnastics and changing 
of terminology and so on, does not mean anything.  The 
issue is substance.  The substance was, they are being 
paid for the coal and they are being paid for X amount of 
coal.  You can calculate what the cost per ton is.   
 
The... the monies... fee or the price or whatever.  
Which is why Dentons talks about R 600,00.  And in fact 
10 
Chairperson, as you will see, even on the...  there is issue 
of valuations.  There are no fines to valuations.  It depends 
on... on a particular day that they think the value of this 
thing is so much. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Tomorrow they have value of this thing and 
tomorrow call it the management fee and then the next day 
it is the price.  The next thing they give you this bottle for 
free, you are only buying the liquid inside or you are 
buying the liquid and the bottle is for free.  It is exactly – 
20 
so people do all sorts of machinations.  However, when you 
analyse these things you must cut out the frills and get to 
the heart.  The heart is what were we paying that time, 
even if the thing that you are paying is management fee or 
whatever. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 119 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Again on the price, I think I found 
the paragraph I want to read to you but what Exxaro is 
saying their cost of coal increased – I am saying this is 
what Exxaro says, increase because of Eskom, Eskom 
failing to get the other piece of land and therefore, the 
volumes of coal available at the mine they were occupying 
going down and, as a result, increasing the price.  So they 
put the blame solely on Eskom for the increase in the 
price.  I found the paragraph here, they says: 
“Exxaro calculated the cost of coal it supplied to be 
10 
783 per ton when the CSA was terminated in 2015.  
A cost plus mine unlike commercial does not 
provide coal at the said price per ton.” 
Which is what I had in mind but …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   So it went …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am saying it was you who was at fault. 
MR MOLEFE:   Was it me who was at fault? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not you personally. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh.  They had increased from 600, 700 and 
something. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, there is a distinction.  Exxaro has 
made that calculation itself so the figure I read to you is 
Exxaro’s figure.  686 is what Dentons found in their report 
or investigation to be the price per ton in April 2015, 
Exxaro’s price in April 2015. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 120 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Is that what Eskom was paying? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is what Dentons’ report says. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, Chairperson, just to tell you about price 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But sorry, Chair – Mr Molefe, sorry, but 
I think incorporating your answer the question which 
Exxaro says, Exxaro stays do not look at this price in 
isolation, look at the price based on our interaction with 
Eskom which was refusing to acquire another piece of land 
adjacent to the mine and, as a result, the volumes were 
10 
going down in the mine we occupied thereby resulting in 
higher prices.  So address it in that context and not in 
isolation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before he addresses that, what is the 
whole point about those figures and the price when we 
were discussing the price in the context of OCM and 
Eskom. 
 
I 
understood 
the 
context 
because 
of 
what 
Glencore, Mr Ephron said in his statement and his affidavit 
sometime back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the price with regard to Exxaro, what 
is the point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The way we came to this, Chair, is what 
I had put to Mr Molefe as the impression conveyed from 
Exxaro’s position which is that, Exxaro ultimately gets 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 121 of 299 
 
elbowed out in order to create a position for Tegeta.  So it 
is a further step on the OCM price as such. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exxaro being elbowed out allowed 
Tegeta in the context of the OCM transaction or separately 
is another issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is connected with OCM ultimately in 
the sense that Tegeta then gets the coal from OCM to 
supply the Arnot power station. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this is the picture, Chair.  You have 
10 
OCM on the one hand which according to the facts Eskom 
is unwilling to increase the price. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To accommodate, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, to accommodate.  The same 
situation seems to play itself out with Exxaro but at a 
different mine, the Arnot power station but in respect of 
both, Tegeta is the common factor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Tegeta ultimately comes into the picture 
to replace OCM and to replace Exxaro. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And supply – and to supply the two 
mines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and how does the Exxaro happens? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The replacement of Exxaro? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 122 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I do not remember that Mr [indistinct] 
06.03 had dealt with that, maybe he did, it is quite some 
time back.  How is it alleged that happened?  How does it 
come to the proposition I guess that they were being 
elbowed out?  They wanted a price increase as well? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Exxaro is a different entity, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I accept that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  They – no, their case is not that 
they wanted a price increase, Mr Molefe, their position is 
we wanted Eskom to acquire another piece of land where 
10 
we can mine, continue to mine because the volumes of the 
mine that we then currently occupied were going down, the 
volumes of coal.  As the volumes of coal go down, the 
price goes up.  So please acquire the land because this 
comes way back when you look at Exxaro’s affidavit.  
Acquire the land so we can keep supplying you the 
volumes that you want.  Eskom then took a different 
position.  Firstly they said your contract, according to 
Exxaro, your contract will expire in 2023.  However, in 
December 2015 Eskom said no, your contract is coming to 
20 
an end by the end of December because, according to 
Eskom, we could not agree and Mr Molefe will tell you, he 
says the price but from my reading is that they could not 
agree on the acquisition of another piece of land. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 123 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As a result, Exxaro is out by the end of 
December, there is a gap, then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they are out because their contract 
came to an end. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are out because the contract 
which Eskom – bear in mind that, Chair, which Eskom had 
said will come to an end 2023. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but when was it going to come to an 
end in terms of the contract? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was going to expire the 31 December 
10 
2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But they were in negotiations to have it 
extended.  Mr Molefe? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but if there was no agreement about 
the extending it would expire. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, then they were notified it will 
expire. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So they did not reach an agreement, 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I am just conveying to Mr Molefe 
that 
that 
is 
the 
version 
that 
Exxaro 
puts 
forward 
…[intervenes] 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 124 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why – what is their point?  Are they 
saying that Eskom treated them unfairly in order to make 
space for Tegeta and if so, in what way? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They trace it back to the time before 
2015 where the parties are discussing to acquire another 
piece of land.  I understand that they were supplying coal 
by conveyor belt to Arnot power station.  When the contract 
terminated, Chair, Tegeta had to source the coal by road 
transport.  So they allude to that, that Eskom failed to 
negotiate properly with us.  Instead it was willing to go to a 
10 
company like Tegeta which was supplying coal in a 
different way as opposed to conveniently by conveyor belt.  
I think the whole thing rests, if you read the affidavit, on 
the fact that there was no reasonable accommodation of 
Exxaro 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
negotiations 
to 
extent 
their 
agreement beyond December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, we have the OCM position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We know what they say because they 
have – it there from – put up in affidavits and testified.  Mr 
20 
Molefe says in effect I am bringing to the proposal to 
increase the price of [indistinct – dropping voice] OCM was 
not in the interest of Eskom and in any event if OCM 
thought that Eskom was being harsh on them in insisting 
on that contractual price the agreement had a way that 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 125 of 299 
 
would have given them relief from that harshness, that is 
invoking the [indistinct – dropping voice] clause, going to 
arbitration and if they won the arbitration then they would 
get relief.  They chose not to pursue arbitration to its final 
end or they did not for whatever reason but I think he 
implies the fact that they did not go up – pursue it up to 
the end, that is arbitration, was not Eskom’s fault, 
whatever reason there might be.  So I am not sure to what 
extent OCM responds effectively to that line of argument. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Exxaro says they wanted Eskom to 
acquire some land so that they would …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Increase the values. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and they had negotiations and 
negotiations did not produce the desired results and their 
contract was coming to an end.  Now it may be that there 
is some point but I am just saying I am not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but intervened when he was about 
to respond. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me allow him to respond. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I have not gone into the details of it 
but, Mr Molefe, you can respond – yes, in the context of 
them saying do not look at the price in isolation look at it 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 126 of 299 
 
in the context of Eskom’s delay in acquiring the piece of 
land then we can move on. 
MR MOLEFE:   My understanding was, as the contract was 
coming to an end, Exxaro, their price demand was 1 300 
and in addition they wanted us to buy land to give to them.  
That was a demand.  They are demanding that we should 
buy land and give it to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As a client. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As a cost plus mine. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, ja, must buy land and give it to them, 
10 
which is what I was uncomfortable with especially in the 
context of land redistribution and so on, why do you buy 
land and give it to these guys?  Now the specific price, 
there is no price unless there is a willing buyer and a 
willing seller.  So you cannot say that the price was this 
much if they had done this and this and that when nobody 
was prepared to pay that price.  The fact that somebody 
has demanded a price does not mean there is a  price, 
there is no price.  The price exists when there is a willing 
buyer, willing seller.  An indication of the market price at 
20 
that time for the coal that was going to Arnot was in fact 
the agreement that we had reached with the six small 
suppliers which was in the 400, around 400.  So that was – 
they were willing to supply us at 400, we were willing to 
pay 400.  They were not making demands to be given land 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 127 of 299 
 
and 1 300.  Why did we have to agree to their demands?  
Why did we have to renew that agreement?  If we had 
renewed that agreement – and unfortunately I was ill-
disposed and was not in a position to – but if we had 
renewed that agreement and bought them land and paid 
1 300 a ton when we could buy coal at 400 from BEE 
suppliers, I would still be sitting here, except that these 
would be criminal proceedings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, except also that the 1 100 is not 
common cause. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, but the 600 – we can take the 600, 
even that 600 it is still higher than – the point that I am 
making is that the price was higher than what we could get 
the coal for.  So, I mean, the 600, the 700, there is 1 100 
and I am saying that they wanted 1 300.  All of those 
things are not acceptable.  Even if it was 500 it would not 
be acceptable because you can get the coal at 400 or at 
450.  If you can get the coal at 450 why buy it at 500 just 
because it is Exxaro?  There is a man in Newcastle who 
asked Mr Cele the day [indistinct – African language] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can we go back to the matter? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, yes …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the point is how far do you want to 
take this issue? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 128 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I want to go back to OCM, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Let us go back to OCM particularly 
on the point the Chairperson was raising, that the hardship 
clause was not pursued because we know – you will recall 
the meeting of the 3 December has the parties again 
agreeing to supply, the parties again agree to supply.  So 
after 
the 
termination, 
which 
is 
in 
June, 
there 
is 
a 
resuscitation of the hardship application but in September 
the parties meet and there is an agreement for OCM to 
10 
supply coal with interim arrangements.  Do you recall that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, there was – as I said earlier, they 
agreed to continue supplying at 150. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And then …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   So, I mean, they chose not to pursue 
arbitration and instead they agreed to continue supplying 
at 150, we did not have a problem with that because we did 
not have a problem with them, we had a problem with the 
price. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   So 150 is willing buyer as far as we were 
concerned because 150 is what was contracted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, in terms of the contract. 
MR MOLEFE:   We were obliged to take the coal at 150. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  150, 154 the …[intervenes] 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 129 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   154, ja.  When you are talking thousands of 
tons I mean R4 is a… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then the termination of the cooperation 
agreement in June is followed by the letter of demand for 
penalties, Mr Molefe, 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The penalties for R2.17 billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   The penalties for? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Penalties for R2.17 billion against 
OCM. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now we have gone extensively or 
at least to some extent into that evidence in regard to how 
the penalty of 2.17 ultimately gets reduced into an amount 
of 255 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are talking about the settlement now 
with Tegeta? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The settlement with OCM, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With OCM under Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  OCM under Tegeta. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Who reached this thing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am asking you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the question is you remember that 
amount of penalties that was demanded from OCM when 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 130 of 299 
 
OCM was under Glencoe which was R2, something billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   2.17 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When OCM was under Glencore, that 
claim of Eskom was settled at a much lower amount namely 
R200 and something million, so the question is do you 
remember that and I think there will be a follow-up 
question. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Chairperson, that 2.17 billion had 
10 
been outstanding since 2013, long before I arrived.  That 
2.17 billion was not a figment of my imagination, it is a 
person who came here, just cannot remember his name, 
who testified that he actually calculated the 2.17 billion, it 
was correct, and from wherever it was calculated in Eskom 
it was brought to me as a legitimate claim that Eskom had.  
My job as a CEO was to ensure that money that is being 
owed 
to 
Eskom 
is 
collected. 
 That 
is 
why 
I 
gave 
instructions that if needs be, we must issue summons 
before the matter prescribes, before the 2.17 billion 
20 
prescribes.  In fact, the 2.17 billion was accumulated, if I 
am not wrong, while Mr Ramaphosa was Chairperson of the 
OCM.  So it was under his Chairmanship that the 2.17 
billion became due and not collected.  Before I arrived at 
Eskom there was not effort to collect the 2.17 billion, it is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 131 of 299 
 
only when I was there that I said but why are we not 
collecting what is due to us and I even said how can we go 
to Soweto and start collecting debt when we cannot collect 
from OCM debts that was accumulated eve when Mr 
Ramaphosa was Chairman.  So that was the 2.17 billion, 
when I left Eskom in 2016, that 2.17 billion was still 
outstanding.   
 
Subsequent to my departure, I was not part of this, 
I was not there, I am told the new owners, Tegeta, invoked 
the arbitration clause and the matter went to arbitration.  
10 
Guess who was leading Eskom’s negotiating team during 
the arbitration?  Ms Suzanne Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you proceed, you have 
linked the failure by Eskom to claim this R2,17 billion 
based on penalties from OCM, you have linked it to Mr 
Ramaphosa having been Chairman of OCM.  Are you just – 
are you making a connection?   
MR MOLEFE:   No …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you suggesting he did anything to 
make sure it was not claimed or what is the point? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   It is just a coincidence, Chairperson, 
perhaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A coincidence, okay.  I just want to make 
sure we know what you are saying. 
MR MOLEFE:   That while he was Chairperson. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 132 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   The claim of 2.17 billion arose and then 
there was an agreement.  In my opinion, a dubious 
agreement because, like I said, I was questioning the 
authority of the person who signed the agreement, an 
agreement that I am told had never served before the 
board prior to my arrival, prior to that meeting of April.  So, 
Chairperson, perhaps maybe I am being paranoid in linking 
all of these things up, in linking all of these things up, but 
there was a 2.17 billion for which I was persecuted for 
10 
trying to collect.  Subsequent to that, after I had left, there 
is a hardship clause and arbitration that gets activated by 
the new owners.  Perhaps even when Optimum had 
followed through on the arbitration, might have ended at 
200 million, like it actually ended up being but I was not 
there when the 200 million was negotiated, I do not know if 
I had led the negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But had you left Eskom or is it just that 
you were not part of the negotiations but you were still 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I had left Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had left Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   What year was it settled?  2017? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I left Eskom December 2016. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 133 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   So when I left what was due to Eskom was 
still 2.17 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand you to be saying with 
regard to your instruction that Eskom attorneys should 
demand payment from OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of that R2.17 billion.  I understand to be 
saying you were told by people within Eskom that Eskom 
was owed R2,17 billion in penalties by OCM. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the people who told you are the 
people who would have made calculations. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to who that amount was made up. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes and they even gave evidence here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And showed – I was watching, I did not 
even 
understand 
the 
calculations, 
they 
had 
detailed 
showing of how they calculated the 2.17 billion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  So the point you are making is 
you understood the claim to be legitimate. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you understood your job as Chief 
Executive Officer of Eskom to be to make sure that that 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 134 of 299 
 
amount, that claim did not prescribe and that you should 
recover whatever was owed to Eskom by OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if somebody says that claim was not 
properly – the amount was not properly or correctly arrived 
at, you cannot argue about that because you were not 
involved in how it was made up, is that what you are 
saying? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I would say that as far as I am 
concerned it was correct because the Primary Energy 
10 
people said it was correct.  They even gave evidence here 
under oath to say that it was correct.  I am not in a 
position to dispute that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes  No, what I am saying is, to say it is 
correct you rely on what they …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   What they said, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Not that you could yourself work it 
out. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was not in a position to work out 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not qualified to do that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Seleka? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 135 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  But also, Chairman, gets even more 
interesting.  Mr Koko has laid a complaint with the Public 
Protector that there is 1.7 billion in penalties …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you has or had? 
MR MOLEFE:   Has. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has recently. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am not sure where the complaint is now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   But he has laid a complaint there, as far as 
I know he has laid a complaint to the Public Protector to 
10 
say that there is R1.7 billion of penalties due by Optimum 
that has prescribed and that were never collected from that 
period of 2012 -2016.  There is another – the 1.7 billion 
can never be recovered because it prescribed and so he is 
asking 
the 
Public 
Protector 
to 
investigate 
who 
was 
responsible for collecting that debt and why did they not 
collect it?  I am surprised it has not been his evidence 
here up to now but that is what I was made to understand 
by him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before your coming there, Mr Molefe, 
there were at least two opinions presented by CDH to 
Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  One is an opinion of 23 October 2013. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 136 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   CDH again is?  Just indicate who they 
are? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr attorneys, thank 
you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They gave an opinion the 23 October 
2013 and the second opinion was on the 17 March 2015.  
That is a month just before you came there.  And then the 
third one was on the 2 December 2016.  I think you were 
still at Eskom that time.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  All I am asking you is were you 
not aware of these opinions which raised concerns about 
the merits of the claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then maybe what you should do, Mr 
Seleka, is to take us to each one and say this one had this 
to say about this claim, obviously just give the important 
things and if they raised concerns about the validity of the 
whole claim or whatever, you put that to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can refer him to the 11 t h page of 
your opinions and he can comment if he is able to in terms 
of whether he was aware of them or he had ...[indistinct – 
word cut off] but he has already said – he has already said 
in terms of how the claim or the amount was calculated he 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 137 of 299 
 
wasn’t qualified to deal with that but he ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...there are people at Eskom who were 
dealing with that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    He relied on that. 
MR MOLEFE:   But even before we go there CDH issued 
summons ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, I think, I think the point Mr 
Molefe would be if they raised concerns, it depends what 
the concerns are and so on and so on but attorneys and 
10 
lawyers advise and the client can still say, go ahead, 
although you advised me against it but do it, you know, and 
then they carry out instruction, despite the fact that they 
may have advised you not to proceed, it depends on a 
number of things.  They might say, chances of winning are 
not good, but you say, let’s take our chances okay, so. 
MR MOLEFE:   In the interest of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t know about in the interest of 
Eskom but that’s how lawyers work, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Eskom bundle 14, right, let’s see, 
20 
page 891. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m keeping two lever arch files here, Mr 
Seleka and I don’t have much space, I’ve got 18A and 
17…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    [Indistinct 2.05]. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 138 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   All of them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I think remove all of them because 
this exercise is bound to take a while, we’ll stick to this 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you involved in giving instructions 
to CDH about the claim, while you were there? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, it was in fact, legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   The person who would have been involved, 
as far as I know, would have been Ms Suzanne Daniels 
10 
and/or the legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, did they, at any stage, that is the 
legal department, come to you while CDH was dealing with 
the matter, come to you and indicate what challenges or 
advices CDH may have raised and with a view to getting – 
briefing you on whether to pursue it or not to pursue it? 
MR MOLEFE:   Not that I can remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t remember them doing that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I don’t remember anyone at Eskom saying 
to me that you cannot or should not pursue the R2.1billion 
20 
claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Apart from the people at Eskom who, you 
say, brought the claim to your attention and maybe told you 
how it was made up, the amount, apart from those people 
did you, thereafter at any stage get consulted by anybody, 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 139 of 299 
 
whether from within Eskom or CDH people, to discuss the 
merits of pursuing the claim or not against OCM?  
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, when we said we’re issuing summons 
and they agreed to issue summons…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this CDH? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, summons had to be accompanied by 
particulars of claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
I 
would 
have 
imagined 
that 
those 
particulars of claim would have set out our case succinctly 
10 
in a manner that, as far – with the information that we have 
in our hands, would make us win the case.  Now, I’m not 
aware that there was a – their reply to the summons. I’m 
not aware that the optimum offered an alternative view 
formally in the …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In response to the claim, in response to 
the summons. 
MR MOLEFE:   In response to the summons, which is what 
was supposed to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Which is what – their response would have 
been the basis of the argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but remember, my question was, 
irrespective what OCM may or may not have said in 
response, 
the 
question 
was 
whether 
you 
were 
ever 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 140 of 299 
 
involved in a discussion whether with people within Eskom 
or with people from CDH where the merits of the claim – of 
pursuing the claim in terms of litigation were discussed to 
say, do we have a strong case, how is our case? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, as far as I remember Chair, I mean, I 
can’t – it’s a long time ago, I can’t recall the specific – if 
there was, specifically discussions like that but what I do 
recall is that the feeling, certainly from the Primary Energy 
people and from the legal people, was that this was a 
legitimate claim and, in fact, I was quite happy to say that 
10 
– to render my support through the process of – because I 
was not going to litigate myself, to render my support 
through the process of the litigation if that is a legitimate 
claim.  It is what an Accounting Officer is expected to do, 
and my feeling was, if there are any – if it is not correct 
then OCM will say so in the process and that we will lose 
the case but the impression that I had at the time was that, 
if we pursued this in Court, we would not lose the case 
because the R2.1billion claim was legitimate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, well you see the lawyers, Mr 
Molefe, were involved and steeped in the matter, so the 
first opinion – the reference to the first opinion, you see is 
in the affidavit of Mr Rishaban Moodley of CDH. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh Rishaban Moodley? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 141 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Page 891. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Eskom Bundle 14 C. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And there he refers to – on paragraph 
22, he refers to the opinion given, so he says, 
“During October 2013, CDH provided the legal 
opinion to Eskom relating to the potential penalty 
10 
claim on the sizing quality of parameters under the 
CSA and addenda thereto, including our preliminary 
concerns relating to the evidence which would be 
necessary for such a claim to succeed”. 
 
 
Now, I accept, you are not there but the question is 
going to be whether you were given this…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was not aware of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, they raise preliminary concerns 
already in October 2013…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   But with whom did they raise the 
20 
preliminary – I mean who was that opinion addressed to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, on page 984 of the same bundle, 
it’s primary…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    My bundle ends at 950, A and B – the 
bundle I’ve been given ends at 950. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 142 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It’s a C Chair, which I have, 14 C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve been given 14 B. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I think it’s that overflow again of 
the affidavit in one – so the affidavit has to be there, ja 
Chair, sorry…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just asked her to ask you if you didn’t 
hear the page number or the bundle number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It’s page 984 Chair. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I’ve got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I was saying, the Chairperson should 
10 
have the file with the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is B? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That is – ja it seems in your case, 
Chair, it’s the end of B.  So, what I’m saying, Chair, she 
shouldn’t take it away from you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, page 984, Mr Molefe the – your 
opinion, it’s in a memorandum  it’s addressed to Mr Johan 
Bester, Divisional Executive Primary Energy…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, Mr Seleka, this opinion is 
20 
dated 20 October 2013. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess more than a year or a year and a 
half before Mr Molefe came to Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 143 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you want to ask him about its 
contents, especially when he says, nobody, as he can 
recall, ever discussed merits and demerits of the claim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, it wasn’t my intention Chair, but 
at the Chairperson’s request, that I take him through, I was 
going to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was if it was important, so I just see 
the gate now, so I’m not sure, he wasn’t at Eskom at that 
time, how is it going to assist us?  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, we don’t have to go into the 
10 
details of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but what is – do you have to refer to 
it at all? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Not in relation to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In relation to him because he wasn’t 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, I think Mr Molefe, when he 
arrives, the question is, were these concerns, expressed in 
this opinion, drawn to his attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that can be asked. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Mr Molefe I have asked that 
question…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell him what the concerns were, I think 
I interrupted you when you were putting that to him, just 
refresh his memory in terms of what the opinions said were 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 144 of 299 
 
the concerns and ask him whether these opinions or the 
concerns were…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Were drawn to his attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Drawn to his attention. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank  you Chair.  Mr Molefe three – 
concerns were raised in three broad categories. One is the 
quality of coal, the other is the sizing specification and 
lastly was the quantity.  On the quality specifications, the 
concerns were that Eskom had failed to invoke its rights in 
terms of the agreement to notify OCH that OCM had failed  
10 
to comply as and when coal was delivered.  You have 
touched on that, I don’t know how did you know about it. 
MR MOLEFE:   About? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That Eskom failed to invoke its rights 
in terms of the CSA. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, I said, Mr Koko has made something to 
the Public Protector that Eskom has allowed penalties of 
R1.7billion to prescribe, I don’t know if it’s the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let’s ask this question this way.  
After you had joined Eskom, between that time and the 
20 
time when you left Eskom, did anybody bring any legal 
opinions to your attention from CDH that dealt with the 
merits and demerits of the claim for penalties against 
OCM? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chairperson I can’t recall that. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 145 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t recall that? 
MR MOLEFE:   But having said that, I’ve just been reading 
the 
conclusion 
of 
this 
legal 
opinion 
very 
quickly,  
paragraph 11, it does not forbid us from pursing the claim 
it says, however, 
“Should Eskom be of the view that taking into 
account the risk identified, it wants to proceed with 
a claim against OCM at this stage as a result of the 
continued failure by OCM to comply with the size 
and specification we advise them it should not be 
10 
done as a set off against the purchase price”, 
 
So, it was not – from my reading of this, even now, 
I’m seeing it for the first time but even now, it’s not an 
opinion that says, you don’t have a claim.  It says that 
there are some risks but if you want to pursue it, which 
means that there is some merit in pursuing it, don’t set it 
off against purchase price.  So, it’s not like it’s forbidding 
Eskom, or it is advising against…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe, I don’t know if you want to 
go to the point of saying, advising against, when you have 
20 
not read the whole of it but…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps, maybe, I should just read it 
Chairperson because I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no I don’t think you should try 
and read it for present purposes, I think you have made the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 146 of 299 
 
point that the last paragraph leaves room for Eskom to 
pursue the claim which may well be in line with what I said 
to you earlier on in terms of how lawyers work but may well 
be that, in the body of the document, it might be raising 
certain issues. 
MR MOLEFE:   But the point that I’m making, Chair, is that, 
that little hole, you’re required by the PFMA or …[indistinct 
– dropping voice]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I don’t know if the PFMA goes that 
far other than that, it only expects you to pursue a claim if 
10 
there are reasonable grounds of believing that you will be 
successful but we don’t know, Mr Seleka how much you 
want us – ja but I don’t know Mr Seleka how much you 
want to ask Mr Molefe about the contents of this in the 
light of his evidence that he has no recollection of this 
being brought to his attention but it may well be that the 
people to whom these opinions were directed, particularly 
the legal department. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are the people who should answer but 
20 
I’m just mentioning, you might have a point that you want 
to raise with him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, a couple of things, Mr Molefe, 
CDH, the attorneys, identify Mr Koko as one of the persons 
they were working with. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 147 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I’ll show you but that paragraph you 
were reading, paragraph 11 of this document, starts with 
the word “however”.  You know when the word “however” 
follows, there’s something that I’ve said before and it is in 
paragraph 10, just of the purposes of what you were 
mentioning now, I’m reading this, not to take it anymore 
than this, it says, 
“In light of the risks identified in Eskom, applying a 
payment reduction for OCM’s failure to comply with 
10 
the sizing specification at this stage, we advise that 
it will be prudent to first address all the concerns in 
order to ensure that Eskom will be in a better 
position to impose the payment reduction and 
subsequently enforce any claim for the reduction of 
the purchase price. Due to OCM’s failure to comply 
with the quality or quantity specification”. 
So, they’re telling you it is prudent to first address 
the concerns, then they say, however, should Eskom be of 
the view that taking into account, the risk identified it 
20 
wants to proceed with the claim against OCM.  So, despite 
the risk, you nonetheless want to proceed…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   But paragraph 10 acknowledges OCM’s 
failure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, it does but…[intervenes]. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 148 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:   And it’s those failures there must be 
penalties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    But let me…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I was not there…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there is no disagreement between 
the two of you we can move on.  Mr Molefe accepts that 
the opinion may have raised some issues about the merits 
of the claim in regard to some aspects he has not read the 
whole opinion, but he accepts that he may have done so.  
All he was saying was there is that window that they 
10 
opened at the end and Eskom wanted to pursue that, he 
says so I think – I’m not sure that – but I think it was fine 
to just emphasise that, however, came after they had 
expressed some concerns about some claims, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Pursuing the claim without first 
addressing the concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And – in fact, that paragraph, Chair, it 
says, 
it 
advises 
you 
not 
to 
set 
off, 
you 
saw 
that 
11.1…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to settle or not to…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Not to set off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, not to set off? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, ja, so one has to read it very 
carefully.  It tells you not to do something as opposed to 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 149 of 299 
 
doing something.  Anyway, but I wanted to read to you, 
because – let me just finish off then on these penalties.  
The penalty starts off at that high amount and CDH, the 
attorneys have given advice to Eskom and I accept you are 
not Eskom, you were the Chief Executive at Eskom.  It will 
be unthinkable that this opinion didn’t come to your 
attention when the penalty itself comes to your attention 
but the merits or demerits of it doesn’t come to your 
attention.  That there are concerns, CDH points out that 
even 
the 
finance 
department 
didn’t 
know 
how 
the 
10 
methodology and the formula for the figures applied.  This 
amount of R2.1million is ultimately, on the basis of this 
opinion from CDH, based on information received from 
Eskom, wiggled down to that R255million.  They say 577 – 
you see 577 is misleading in the sense that it incorporates 
R158million which is a double charge, a double payment 
because then that amount gets to be reduced, deducted, 
then you see a R419million, then there’s further two 
deductions it ends up at R255million but this is done way 
after Glencore is out of the picture, Tegeta is in the picture 
20 
and Eskom – the advice given in 2013 and repeatedly until 
2017 is now being acted upon to do the reductions when it 
is Tegeta in the picture and the question is, why, why did 
Optimum not raise it? 
MR MOLEFE:   It does not raise – all that you’re telling me 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 150 of 299 
 
was not raised by Optimum while I was there.  When we 
issued the summons, they should have replied to our 
summons and said exactly what you’re seeing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then perhaps we would have settled 
out of Court, perhaps we would have gone to arbitration, 
but it was not for me to go and look for their defence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, give me a chance, give me a 
chance.  That’s -your response is too quick because CDH 
does give Eskom the defences – various defences raised 
10 
by OCH in the subsequent opinions, it gives you various 
defences raised by – and some of them are exactly what 
we are pointing out there, the sizing specifications and 
your sampling tool which was faulty the hammer sampling 
tool which was not – was malfunctioning and that you had 
failed to notify them of the breach as and when it occurred.  
So, OCM had raised those defences, may I add this, Mr 
Molefe, two processes had started…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry did you say OCM had raised those 
defences? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Had raised those defences. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Expressed by your attorneys, in the 
opinions, you’re saying that didn’t come to your attention, 
those opinions, I just want a yes or no because I don’t 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 151 of 299 
 
want to forget my next question. 
MR MOLEFE:   I can’t remember that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    The next thing is, you will recall that, 
when you pursued the claim, CDH, again, the attorneys, 
advised you let’s issue summons because that will interrupt 
prescription because a referral to arbitration will only stop 
it for one year, so they pursued two processes.  OCM filed 
a notice to defend in the summons in respect of the 
summons and they filed their plea to the arbitration, 
referral to arbitration or statement of defence but the 
10 
parties, from what it appears, decided to pursue the 
arbitration which ultimately brought about a negotiated 
settlement. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Which 
party, 
you 
mean 
eventually 
after…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Eventually yes. 
MR MOLEFE:    Yes, no I can’t comment on that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, so it’s not as if they didn’t defend 
your matter, they did…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it would be helpful if you were to 
20 
tell me where in the bundle, I can find OCM’s response or 
the document where they raised the defences because I 
was under the impression that they didn’t. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Chairperson, that you find in Mr 
Moodley’s 
affidavit 
again, 
because 
he 
deals 
with 
it 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 152 of 299 
 
extensively in the opinions that he gives to Eskom, let me 
find one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if your junior can find it while you 
continue and let you know once she has found it, that will 
be fine.  Looks like your junior thinks you are looking at 
the wrong bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, she’s saying that you are looking 
for the pleading, but you can turn to page 918, Chairperson 
of Mr Moodley’s bundle, Eskom Bundle 14 (C), now that’s 
that other file, you have it in front of you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja it’s (B) in this case, page 918. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Page 918, Chairperson, under the 
heading, “OCM potential defence to the Eskom claim”, and 
he refers to a letter which OCM had addressed to Eskom.  
So, he’s reproducing here, the contents of his opinion of 2 
December 2016 which, Chair you will find on page 1042. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine.  I don’t think that – 
I wanted to see where they are to be found, you can move 
20 
on, I think what may be important, just for the record 
purposes is for you to articulate what their defences were.  
Mr Molefe might have no comment but just so that it’s 
known what their defences were so that when you come to 
the – when you refer to the defences raised or issued 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 153 of 299 
 
raised by CDH, one can see whether they are the same but 
– so that’s just for the record.  It may well be that there are 
other people who really need to be questioned about why 
they may seem to have found these defences unattractive 
when they were raised by OCM but suddenly attractive 
when they were raised by – whether it’s CDH or Tegeta.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, was the Chairperson asking me to 
read them into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I’m saying if you can articulate 
them, if you articulate them without reading them it’s fine, 
10 
if you want to read them it’s okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, well there’s a couple of them, 
let’s 
see, 
maybe 
I 
can 
summarise 
them. 
 
The 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the ones that are the same as the 
ones that seem to have been relied upon to reduce the 
claim via Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, the failure by Eskom to notify as 
and when there was a breech, if ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When the quality of the coal was below 
20 
the agreed ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Standard. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So  I think that clause was, that clause 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 154 of 299 
 
was to the effect that if OCM delivered coal that was below 
the agreed quality level, then Eskom was required to send 
a notice to OCM within a certain period.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it did not send such a notice, then 
the quality of the coal would be taken to have been in 
accordance with the agreed standards. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  And they had indicated 
10 
that Eskom had not done so.  Let me see.  I think I need to 
go to the opinion itself.  10.42 Because in the affidavit he 
summarizes and I think he skipped some of the issues.  I 
will be brief in running through them.  This then is the 
opinion of the 2 n d of December 2016.  And from Tyrrell 
Thompson, well Cliff Decker, Hoffmeyr to Eskom.  The one 
is: 
“There is no reasonable basis to justify a penalty of 
this amount 2,2 billion having regard to the history 
and 
background 
circumstances 
surrounding 
the 
20 
imposition of penalties arising out of CSA.  And 
Eskom has no reasonable prospect of recovering 
this amount in an arbitration.” 
And I am trying to scheme through.  Then in regard 
to the sampling process: 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 155 of 299 
 
“The parties were in negotiations to renegotiate the 
clause.” 
And Mr Moodley then says this: 
“The CSA includes a renegotiation clause in terms 
of which if at any time either parties are of the view 
that the specification in the CSA are no longer 
properly and are realistically representative of the 
coal which OCM could reasonably expect to produce 
from its resource, it could request a renegotiation of 
the specification.” 
10 
And 
at 
that 
stage 
the 
parties 
were 
in 
that 
renegotiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when was this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is in December now 20 – did I say 
15?  Ja, 15.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Even if you do not cover all of them 
… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you would cover all of them if 
necessary when you ask people who were involved. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In making the decision to … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct) the amount that they ...  
(indistinct). 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 156 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  There’s an important 
one Mr Molefe.  He says during this renegotiation: 
“During 
the 
settlement 
discussions 
there 
were 
extensive negotiations on the specifications, with 
Primary Energy and the Hendrina Power Station.  
And 
ultimately 
a 
specification 
was 
agreed 
in 
relation to sizing which matches that which OCM 
delivered during the period from 2012 to 2015.” 
 
If this is a specification that the power station was 
capable of accepting, OCM is arguing, then clearly the 
10 
delivery of coal, meeting that sizing specification during 
most 
of 
2012 
to 
2015 
could 
not 
have 
caused 
any 
meaningful damage to the power station.   
 
And by the way, the claim from 2012 to, to I think it 
is May 2014 was completely abandoned. 
MR MOLEFE:  Are you asking me to comment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am telling you, yes can you – do you 
know of that?  
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not know that, but from what you 
are saying, you are saying that there was a specification 
20 
that was specified in the ...  (indistinct). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Precisely. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, in the sizing.  In the coal supply 
agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 157 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  That specification was not ...  (indistinct). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Right, however in the renegotiation the SCA 
was changed.  Or … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The specification was changed. 
MR MOLEFE:  The specification in the SCE was changed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes and Eskom agreed. 
MR MOLEFE:  Agreed, right.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  To a specification that matches … 
MR MOLEFE:  At the time of imposing the penalties, OCM 
10 
did not meet the specification that had been specified in 
the agreement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Look this side Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot hear. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of? 
MR MOLEFE:  At the time when OCM delivered the coal, 
they did not meet the specification.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  And are therefore liable to the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  The fact that later on when the engineers 
met they decided to change the specification.  That does 
not mean that – I do not know, it does not mean that they 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 158 of 299 
 
have the meeting it was wrong to impose the penalty, 
because the penalty was imposed on the basis of the 
specification that had been in the agreement.  Not what 
was consequently modified.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  But there is just one concern, because 
the other concerns is that Eskom had already failed to 
invoke the notice clause.  It had then failed to invoke the 
notice clause. 
MR MOLEFE:  When did Eskom fail to do so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From 2012 … 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Precisely my problem. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To 2014. 
MR MOLEFE:  That was precisely my problem with the 
whole thing.  The fact that Mr Koko is saying there is, there 
is penalties of 1,7 billion that had not been collected.  I, I 
was not prepared Chairperson to be part of the people that 
had not pursued Eskom’s legitimate claims for the penalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are talking of cross-purposes.  
Mr Seleka’s reference to that clause and the failure of 
Eskom to invoke that clause is important.  He has meant to 
20 
say to you, because in terms of the contract, the CSA … 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Eskom had with OCM whenever 
OCM delivered coal of a substandard coal … 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 159 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the agreement, Eskom was 
obliged if it wanted to impose penalties. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To send OCM a written notice. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Telling then that you have supplied us 
with substandard coal and so that then they can impose 
the penalties. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of the contract if Eskom 
10 
failed to send such a notice, the contract said, the coal, 
the substandard coal would be taken to have been of an 
acceptable standard.  And therefore Eskom could not 
thereafter impose penalties.  So he is saying, OC – one of 
the points raised by OCM was Eskom can’t pursue this 
claim against us or at least part of it, because they did not 
send us the notices required by the agreement and effect 
of not sending us those notices, is that the coal is taken to 
have been of the right standard.  That is what he is talking 
about here. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  And what I was saying Chair, that it means 
there are employees at Eskom that did not invoke the 
penalty as they were required by the contract.  Right.  
Those employees misbehaved.  And well maybe we cannot 
recover 
those 
penalties 
because 
they 
have 
already 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 160 of 299 
 
misbehaved, but there was a discipline problem at Eskom 
when it came to Optimum.  But things were not being 
followed to the letter.  And all I was saying was, I was not 
prepared to be part of those people that were turning a 
blind eye.  So what, what we are being told now is that 
there are people at Eskom that turned a blind eye, that 
OCM was not complying.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are not being told that they 
turned a blind eye.  You are being told notices were not 
sent.  Why they were not sent might be another reason.  
10 
Maybe they turned a blind eye, maybe it was negligence.  
We don’t know.  But the point Mr Seleka was making is, 
that was a defence that was raised and indeed if Eskom 
did not dispute the allegation that it did not send those 
notices, then it had no claim or part of the claim would not 
be sustained.  You might say, look I do not know about 
whether notices were sent or not sent.  If they were not 
sent it means that OCM may have had a point.  But you, 
you don’t know whether they were sent or they were not 
sent.  I assume. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  I don’t know whether or not the notices were 
not sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 161 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  If I had known that the notices were not 
sent, I would have all those people in front of a disciplinary 
hearing.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also if you had known that those 
notices were not sent, would you have pursued the claim? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well I would have taken legal advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Legal advice, ja.  Okay, no that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja which … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And CDH would have given legal advice.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which was being given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because it was in existence already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see what I find difficult is this 
Molefe … 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Richard Moodley is not a ...  (indistinct) 
like you.  So I would have asked for legal advice from 
senior, with the amount of money involved.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  It will come from your bank.  Anyway … 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  You will find that if we instructed you Mr 
Seleka, you would have defended it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  But Mr Molefe remember what I told, 
lawyers work on the basis that they can advise you that 
your prospects of winning are not reasonable. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 162 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you insist I can ...  (indistinct).  
Okay.  Yes, or there could be a situation where they say, 
look okay this is just not on.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they can say, look we do not think we 
will win but let us take our chances.  So maybe you would 
have said, let us take our – if you want to take your 
chances I will represent you. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the fact of the matter is, he wasn’t, 
he was not, he is not aware whether the notices were sent 
or were not sent.  And obviously there are people who 
ought to know why, what the actual position was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they were, if they were aware that 
they were not sent, were they just taking chances to see 
whether OCM would take the point or not.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Let me get your response to this 
Molefe, because I find it hard as the Chief Executive that 
20 
you know about the penalties.  You insist on these 
penalties being claimed.  Or enforced and pursued.  So you 
must have spoken to some people within Eskom.  This 
people were there before you.  These people have been 
provided with this opinions by CDH.  CDH mentions the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 163 of 299 
 
names of these people in their affidavit.  People from legal.  
Ms 
Daniels. 
 
Mr 
Johan 
Bester. 
 
Mr 
Koko. 
 
Ayan 
Danthetha(?).  Neo Silanku(?).  Mentions their names in 
their affidavit, that we were given these people to work 
with.  That you could have know about, the existence of the 
penalties.  But not known about the concerns pertaining to 
the merits of that, those penalties, is at least for me 
inconceivable.  And I want you to comment on that.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that, so that – you see the 
10 
statement you are making is, well I didn’t want to be part 
of those people who failed to do this, but the point is by 
the time you come in, those people have been advised that 
there are problems.  So for you to pursue claim which is 
riddled with difficulties against a company, against which 
and I am going to say to you, Eskom knows we have a 
difficult pursuing or succeeding against.  It seems not right 
when you know the weaknesses.  And one of it is that there 
was double penalty of R158 000 000,00.  Which reduces 
the amount even further.  So but comment on … 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Would you like my comment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson, I was brought up in the 
National Treasury.  At the time when the PFMA was written 
up, I was in fact in the team that drafted the PFMA.  My – 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 164 of 299 
 
the view from the National Treasury has always been that 
government does not pursue its legitimate claims. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, does not pursue?   
MR MOLEFE:  Its legitimate claims.  And that government 
is very lax at negotiating.  And let’s people get away with 
murder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  People owe it for electricity and they 
don’t collect? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Legitimate? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And that this was also rife in the parastatal.  
The clause that I was referring to earlier that there is that 
accounting officers must collect what is due.  Perhaps my 
interpretation of that clause is considered here.  But do not 
leave a claim if there is a chance of collecting it.  That is 
supposed to come to the fiscus.  My attitude in this whole 
matter was that there was a claim, Eskom had a claim 
since 2013 and it had not been collected.  The fact that 
20 
there were defences and so on and so forth, I was quite 
prepared to leave that to the legal people.  But from where 
I was sitting to be able to show that as an accounting 
officer I did take reasonable steps to collect.  And that the 
collection became difficult.  So I do not think that with my 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 165 of 299 
 
frame of mind, especially with my background on the 
National Treasury, and my knowledge of the, well limited 
knowledge of the PSMA, that I would have taken the risk 
that somebody would have turned around one day and said, 
why did you not collect what was legitimately owed to 
Eskom.  There is, there is a guy who came here who 
calculated these penalties and said they were legitimate.  I 
mean I do not have to go and say, Mr Seleka here are the 
measurements 
of 
the 
coal 
and 
these 
were 
the 
specifications.  There is a guy who did that and said, as a 
10 
result of these measurements these people owe us money.  
For me that was enough.  But we must pursue it.  And the 
legal people must sort it out.  As far as I am concerned, all 
the people that Mr Seleka is mentioning and CDA, should 
then have come with a definite recommendation that we 
cannot pursue this claim.  That did not come to me.  As far 
as I am concerned, there was even, even this legal opinion 
from 2018 leaves a possibility of claiming.  I did not want 
that I would be the one that turned a blind eye when there 
was a legitimate claim on the table.  So that was my frame 
20 
of mind at the time.  So the, the other thing is that as a 
Group Chief Executive, I did not really, really sit down with 
the legal team and debate legal merits, because I am not a 
lawyer.  I was quite prepared to receive from them a 
consensus view from them that there is this claim, they can 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 166 of 299 
 
definitely not pursue.  And this claim we can pursue.  
Eskom had 100s of legal matters that were outstanding, 
some of them prescribing and so on and so forth for which 
I was prepared to take advice.  And this was one of them, 
but this one was peculiar.  Number one, it is a very large 
amount.  And number two, I know the parties involved.  And 
suspected that there was something amiss.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I did, I think Mr Seleka’s proposition 
was simply that he found it difficult to accept that all of 
these people who are mentioned, I think in their opinion is 
10 
Ms Daniels, Mr Koko and … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct), and whoever who I think Mr 
Seleka implies knew about the issues that CDH had raised 
about this claim.  He was saying he was finding it difficult 
that despite the fact that they must have all known, nobody 
told you about this reservations that the lawyers had 
raised.  So I think that is the … 
MR MOLEFE:  But, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the question you were supposed 
20 
to answer.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  But when they were here at the 
Commission, what did they say about why this penalty was 
being collected? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have not completed their evidence.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 167 of 299 
 
We only started with one of these cases. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh no, then I will watch on TV.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But, but, but … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, he is still not answering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you, you are saying, are you saying 
definitely none of those people brought to your attention 
the reservations or whatever the challenges are, that were 
articulated by CDH in regard to the, to the claim? 
MR MOLEFE:  I am saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you are saying you cannot remember? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  I am saying that I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  That anyone came to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And said, definitely we cannot collect this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja but you were, Mr Seleka is not 
going that far.  He is simply saying to say there are 
challenges about pursuing it, but you, if you want you may 
pursue it provided you don’t set off … 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  So if, if there is no one who said, we 
20 
cannot definitely pursue this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would pursue. 
MR MOLEFE:  I suspect that my attitude would have been, 
let’s pursue because as I say, my interpretation of collect 
what is due, is very concerning.  Yes, that do not leave 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 168 of 299 
 
anything on the table, for the fiscus.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but I am sure after today you will 
have a different view about it. 
MR MOLEFE:  I had a lesson ja, Chairperson, fortunately I 
am no longer in the field. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because if the concerns date back to 
2013 and you terminate to 2013, 2014, 2015 you put a 
letter of demand in 2015.  And you are still there at 
10 
December 2015.  Another opinion comes in.  The question 
is, why at that time does not Eskom, the entity Eskom with 
its officials, do the exercise to come to the right amount, 
which is the amount they ultimately settled on with Tegeta 
in 2017?  Far less than the 3.1 billion which had by the 
way a double penalty which had to be deducted.  Why did 
they not do the recalculation to come to that right amount 
of 255, before Tegeta comes into the picture? 
MR MOLEFE:  Why did the legal department not do it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, the Eskom. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Mister, the gentleman who calculated the 
penalties? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The entire Eskom team that was 
involved there. 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know Mr Seleka.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 169 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  There was a man who came here who said 
he is convinced that the 2.17 billion is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who is this man? 
MR MOLEFE:  I will find out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said he can’t remember the name.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  He showed the workings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I, I can’t remember but there are so 
many witnesses. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  But you do not recall Chairperson somebody 
here saying, no this is the right amount and this is how we 
work it out, and I was responsible for calculating the 2.17 
billion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t … 
MR MOLEFE:  (Indistinct) I insist that … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
It 
is 
possible, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
somebody did come but I cannot immediately remember.  
He is younger than me.  He should remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I should be able to.  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I know that people came.   
MR MOLEFE:  Look I remember when that guy gave 
evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 170 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  I remember thinking, you know what? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  When this matter comes up … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I’ll refer to him. 
MR MOLEFE:  I won’t have to say anything … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because he has already calculated it and 
shown it to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  That it was the right amount. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And I think that at the time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your junior does not remember Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He’s given me various name Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she did give you some names? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She’s given me various names but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It means she thinks that there is 
somebody who came. 
MR MOLEFE:  But there was something like that.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is somebody who came.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I am not sure whether she ...  
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not.  I think she seems to know it. 
MR MOLEFE:  Gert Opperman, ja.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 171 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, she is, she is younger than us. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but Gert Opperman had concerns 
himself.  CDH says he had concerns about how the figure 
was arrived at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Gert Opperman.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mister? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Gert Opperman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  I can’t remember who it was, but there was 
10 
somebody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you can find out and when you get 
home maybe … 
MR MOLEFE:  You will let me know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will let your counsel know and then 
they can pass on the name.  From what Mr Seleka says 
and my … 
MR MOLEFE:  Actually the name ...  (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems that his junior might be 
remembering.  But I want us to take an adjournment now.  
20 
It is just after 16:00. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would like counsel to see me in 
Chambers to report back on the lunch issues, so that when 
we come back then I will know. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 172 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the position is.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let’s adjourn now.  You can look ...  
(indistinct) during … 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson if you give me three minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, we will come back.  We are not 
adjourning for the day. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, we just adjourn for 10 minutes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is 10 past, we will resume at 20 past, 
but if I can see counsel in Chambers.   
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Molefe yes you wanted 
to. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chair on the matter that we were talking 
20 
about before.  In my affidavit paragraph 70. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph? 
MR MOLEFE:  70 page 022 I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Black numbers.  Black numbers on the left

Page 173 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Eskom Bundle 17 page I think 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 70? 
MR MOLEFE:  Paragraph 70. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  When I arrived at Eskom I discovered that 
Glencore was owing Eskom an amount in excess of R2 
billion in penalties in terms of the Coal Supply Agreement.  
Furthermore Eskom was not taking adequate steps to 
10 
recover the money.  It is not clear to me why there was a 
reluctance from Eskom to recover the money that was 
legitimately due to Eskom.  And then I put in a footnote 43 
this was in the evidence of Mr Snehal Nagar paragraph 7.3 
of his affidavit here at the commission and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you mention somebody’s name just 
now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Snehal. 
MR MOLEFE:  Snehal Nagar – N-a-g-a-r. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph is that? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So page 23 sorry Mr… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am at page 23. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Footnote 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in the footnote ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  In the footnote at the bottom. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 174 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am looking – I was looking in the text. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  So the footnote states exactly where I got the 
fact that it was in fact R2.1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And my learned friend here was able to find 
that specific paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh now that she was nodding to say there 
was somebody who made calculations here she is your 
10 
learned friend. 
MR MOLEFE:  She is my senior Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  And she did find the paragraph 7.3 and 
in it is Snehal Nagar actually shows calculations in his 
affidavit of how the money was – how that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In whose affidavit?  In your affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:  No in his affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No Mr Snehal.  He says Mr Nagar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – Mr Nagar’s affidavit? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose affidavit is that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Nagar. – Snehal Nagar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say in the calculations of how the 
claims… 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 175 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were made up are in his affidavit. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that is what he is saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh has he given evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He did give evidence in phase 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in phase 1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes not during – 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was a long time ago. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And that is where the detail calculations come 
from in this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is where the detailed calculations come 
from in the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Which is why I never went back to it because 
I thought… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  He is 00:03:15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because I think he is one of the officials 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 176 of 299 
 
CDH men – Mr Moodley mentions as having dealt with. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And all these concerns having been 
raised.  Mr Molefe you were saying you knew who you  were 
dealing with in terms of OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Based on your experience from Transnet 
and now at Eskom.  Could that have influenced how you 
dealt with them your past experience at Transnet with them? 
MR MOLEFE:  I mean not just my past experience.  
10 
Glencore’s application is there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In general. 
MR MOLEFE:  In general they are known to be sharks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are known to? 
MR MOLEFE:  To be sharks.  They are very shrewd. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be shy? 
MR MOLEFE:  To be sharks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh sharks. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja they are known – ja they are known to be 
CHAIRPERSON:  Known to be sharks. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes I mean there is a media articles all over 
that refer to how especially under the leadership of Mr 
Glasenberg they have been very robust in – in their dealings.  
They do not leave anything on the table.  They do not have 
sympathies when they are in the right.  So that is – I mean it 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 177 of 299 
 
is extensively covered in the media.  They have several 
investigations and guilty verdicts in several territories of 
wrongdoing in the financial markets.  So I – I had a feeling 
that – and I had had an experience with them refusing to 
sign the type of year agreement.  And this – this whole thing 
did not sound right to me from thereon. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you – is it right or fair to say you had 
a particular view about it and if it were according to you you 
would not deal with them based on… 
MR MOLEFE:  I would deal with them.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not deal in that sense.  You would not do 
business with them. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes that is what I mean.  I would – I would – I 
was prepared to do a deal with them whereby we stuck to the 
agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Whereby? 
MR MOLEFE:  We stuck to the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think you may be talking at cross-
purposes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Seleka is – is asking you Mr 
Molefe whether because of the view you had of them you 
would have preferred to have no business interactions with 
them. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 178 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it were up to you. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I would have business interactions with 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  There is no one that I would not have 
business interactions with except that in their case it would 
have been not with a pinch of salt but perhaps a tablespoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So I guess what you are saying is you 
– you would have business interactions with them but you… 
MR MOLEFE:  I would be very careful. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be careful. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because you know what – what the 
comments you have made about their political connection to 
Mr Ramaphosa and the issues you have just now mentioned, 
things reported in the media about them leaves one with the 
impression that this is a company that you were not going to 
easily accommodate. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja easily being the operative word.  I could 
20 
accommodate them but it would not come easy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Having mentioned Mr Ramaphosa a 
couple of times I think it will be fitting to say – to read to you 
what Mr Ephron says about him. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 179 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In his affidavit and it is under the 
heading Involvement of Mr Ramaphosa in the business of 
OCH and OCM in the period 2012 / 2014.  So the affidavit is 
found in Eskom Bundle 18(B) I will read it to the record – 
page 1266.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Will I still need 14(B)? – Bundle 14(B) 
today? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  Page 12… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the other 14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not that one too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1266 paragraph 8 he writes – this is the 
affidavit of Mr Ephron dated 11 February 2021 and he writes: 
“Mr Ramaphosa had not direct involvement in 
the day to day operations of OCH or OCM in 
the period 2012 to 2014.  Mr Ramaphosa was 
never appointed Chairman of OCH or OCM.  
Mr 
Ramaphosa 
nominated 
various 
20 
professionals from Shanduka Resources to 
represent him on the OCH board. I never 
asked Mr Ramaphosa to intervene on behalf 
of OCH or OCM in any matters relating to 
Eskom or the CSA and to the best of my 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 180 of 299 
 
knowledge and recollection he never did so.” 
Are you looking for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you want him to comment on that – 
you want to get to the page Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he is telling you what Mr Ephron says in 
his affidavit about Mr Ramaphosa and OCM in response to 
your statement last time.  He wants you to comment on that 
response if you are able to. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the things that he – Mr Seleka 
reads is that he says that is Mr Ephron says Mr Ramaphosa 
was never appointed Chairman of OCH – OCM.  OCH was 
the holding company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  OCH or OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja or both. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or both yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want Mr Seleka to help you to find 
whatever you are looking for? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell him – if you tell him what you are 
looking for he might be able to tell you what page you will 
find it in. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh.  Chairperson in paragraph 80 of my 
affidavit. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 181 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Page 025. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  I say: 
“Mr Ramaphosa was Chairman of Optimum at 
the time of the initiation of the hardship 
claim.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of the initiation of? 
MR MOLEFE:  Of the hardship claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes which was what 2014/2015? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  13 – 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  And then there I have made a footnote I 
think it is number 48 – number 48 there is a reference to a I 
think an article from a – I think it was a magazine but one of 
these mining magazines and it was written by Imaralu D on 
the 25t h of June 2012 and that is where Ramaphosa is 
mentioned as Chairman of Optimum.  So if you go to that link 
that is on my footnote… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  You will find that article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – so you rely on that article. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For your statement you made that he was 
Chairman. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 182 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  That he was Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if that article was wrong then that is it 
but that is where you base your statement on. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  From what you read Mr Seleka Mr 
Ephron is categorical to say Mr Ramaphosa was never 
appointed as Chairperson of either OCM or OCDH is that 
right? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson and he uses the 
word never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The heading – the title of the article Mr 
Molefe is referring to reads: 
“Glencore Ramaphosa acquires 70% stake of 
Optimum Coal.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  That is the title but in the body of the 
article. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  It refers – it quotes somebody as saying that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will your junior check unless you have 
already checked where that is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She is doing exactly that. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 183 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us – let us deal – let us deal with 
the substance.  Last time when you appeared and you made 
the statements you made relating to Mr Ramaphosa we – we 
adjourned in the manner that we did.  But let – I just want to 
get what precisely you say it was that he may have done 
wrong if that is what you are saying or whether you are 
saying – you are not saying that he did anything wrong 
himself but you are saying maybe Glencore – maybe other 
people OCM or OCH were hoping to use his presence or his 
connection with OCM or OCH to their advantage; to their 
10 
benefit in terms of their interactions; in terms of business 
with Eskom.  So I just want to know whether you are 
accusing him of having done something wrong or whether 
you are simply saying other people were hoping to use their 
association with him wrongly. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson what I said was it was very 
strange that they did not do due diligence and that the – I do 
not take the excuse that they were concerned about those 
things.  What they did do is that they sold a stake of this 
company that they had bought to Mr Ramaphosa exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come closer to the microphone. 
MR MOLEFE:  They sold the stake of this company that they 
have bought to Mr Ramaphosa as their BEE partner and the 
only way that they could get out of the pickle that they 
subsequently found themselves because they had not done 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 184 of 299 
 
due diligence was through negotiation.  And my postulation 
was that they were hoping to use Mr Ramaphosa’s influence 
to help them negotiate part of that thing.  I think – I do not 
know who – I think Glencore issued a statement after my 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja there was a public statement and they said 
that Mr Ramaphosa – his – was acting – was not acting in 
our interests.  I cannot believe that Chairperson.  He was a 
shareholder.  He had an interest in the matter.  He had an 
10 
interest in the matter.  If – if the penalties was to be settled 
because there are roles while he was still shareholder he 
would have financial benefit.  He would have an interest in 
the settlement of the penalties.  So I am not saying that I 
definitely 
know 
that 
he 
pedalled 
influence 
but 
the 
circumstances are such that the situation was likely to arise. 
Also there is a lot of unexplained things at Eskom.  Why 
were the – why were the penalties not pursued?  Why were 
people so lackadaisical in pursuing Eskom’s interest?  The 
settlement agreement was done in 2014. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you  - you would accept would you not 
Mr Molefe that when it comes to that it is more speculation. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of trying to say the reason why 
they might not have pursued the claim might be because Mr 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 185 of 299 
 
Ramaphosa was part of OCM or OCH. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be speculation. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I understand what you are saying and 
you must tell me if I misunderstand.  You are saying – you 
are not accusing him of having done anything wrong but you 
are saying Glencore – OCM or some people in Glencore – 
OCM as you see things it seems to you that the reason why 
they may not have – they might not have done due diligence 
10 
is that they hoped that they would use their association with 
him to their benefit in terms of their interactions with Eskom.  
Am I correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  But you are not ascribing any 
arrangement to that end on the part of the President. 
MR MOLEFE:  No except to know it that when he left 
Glencore just know he went to become Deputy President and 
then Chairman of the War Room which I described in my 
20 
statement as defunct to Chairman of Eskom because of the 
way that the War Room was operating.  Ja.  That was also 
strange.  That was also peculiar.  Without saying that the 
War Room discussed old contracts I am not aware that they 
did but it would appear from even the evidence that was 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 186 of 299 
 
given here the level of detail that the War Room was 
prepared to go into while he was Chairman was strange 
because it was things that were supposed to be dealt with by 
the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you may or may not have a point.  My 
understanding was that the – the people involved in the so 
called War Room were an extraordinary measure that was 
resorted to by the then President Mr Zuma to try and say it 
looks like existing structures are failing to find a solution to 
the Eskom problems of load shedding.  Please try and assist 
10 
the country to find the solutions and therefore it may well be 
that to find a solution might need more details than normal.  
That is my thinking but you may well have a point.  I am just 
saying this. 
MR MOLEFE:  I agree with you Chairperson and for 
whatever reason then put him in this unenvious situation 
where normally in the corporate world you would have to wait 
to cool off before you go into that level of detail with the 
company that was in a R2 billion and a R8 billion basically 
dispute to take over charge on behalf of the government.  
20 
They would – there needed to be a cooling off period.  He 
had to be separated.  I also make the point that when Mr 
Cyril Ramaphosa was Chairman of the War Room the 
transaction had not been completed.  It was only approved 
by the Competition Commission in August 2015.  Now 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 187 of 299 
 
Competition Commission is typically a condition precedent to 
the finalisation of a contract.  So technically while he was 
Chairman of the War Room he was in fact strictly speaking 
the shareholder.  For if the Competition Commission had not 
approved that transaction – any financial benefit derived 
would have accrued to him because the transaction had not 
been consummated by fulfilling the conditions precedent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is a very strange situation for me.  I 
think he should have recused himself if he knew that the – 
10 
he has just come out of this company that is having these 
difficult discussions with Eskom.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Have we received Mr Seleka any response 
from the President to the Rule 3.3 Notice entailing Mr 
Molefe’s statement of last time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am not aware of a response yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But the statement – the Rule 3.3 
Notice was sent? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That was long sent to the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so as I understand it in regard 
to the earlier point you do not accuse him of anything but 
you 
say 
other 
people 
may have 
hoped to 
use their 
association with him to their benefit. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 188 of 299 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in regard to the War Room you – you 
say you think he should have recused himself because he – 
he had – there has been no cooling off period? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes and I am not saying he did anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you are not saying… 
MR MOLEFE:  While he was at the War Room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  But I am just saying that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just that situation. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  It was peculiar that situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  That we find ourselves in.  here we are – 
because Chairperson when I say we are not agreeing with 
Glencore – when I say that we are not agreeing with 
Glencore and we will not entertain their request for an 
increase it could sound like I am actually not agreeing to 
doing a deal that Mr Ramaphosa is involved in for a person 
like myself.  Perhaps I have the personality to say that it is 
not correct to do this transaction.  I do not know if Eskom 
20 
officials who were in a position to oppose this thing and 
knew that Mr Ramaphosa was involved would have had the 
courage knowing that look this thing the Deputy President is 
involved in this thing – if we touch this thing you know my 
career could be finished. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 189 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  If we do something about this my career could 
be finished.  Or the close association that he had with 
Glencore could mean that you actually against him in a 
sense.  It could be read like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Molefe I was trying to follow you.  I 
lost you on two aspects.  One is the War Room and the other 
is Mr Ramaphosa’s involvement with Glencore.  Coming at 
10 
established the War Room Mr Ramaphosa was the Deputy 
President; he was made a chairperson – the Chairperson of 
the War Room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The then President established it as I 
understand it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes we will come to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and appointed him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And appointed him as the Chairman of 
this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
20 
ADV MASUKU:  Sorry can I just – because I am getting a 
little concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MASUKU:  About this evidence that is coming from 
both the evidence leader and the Chair about how the War 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 190 of 299 
 
Room was established and why it was established and who 
was establishing it.  I do not recall a document of evidence 
given to this commission on those facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MASUKU:  Where is that information coming from – 
this evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I think – I think we… 
ADV MASUKU:  Sorry Chair the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MASUKU:  The second one Mr Molefe gave his 
10 
evidence last time to my recollection what it is was to give 
facts.  It is up to the commission to investigate based on 
the facts that he gave the questions you are asking him 
about whether he is accusing anybody of anything.  I think 
it is unfair to – to ask him to – to ask him on the question 
of whether or not he is accusing anybody when he has 
given you facts.   
 
The first obviously important point is to determine 
whether or not the facts he has given you are correct.  If 
they are correct it is up to you Chair to decide whether 
20 
there is a conflict of interest that can be read into it and 
that really takes the other side being given a hearing on 
whether the evidence that has been provided by Mr Molefe 
does create a conflict of interest. 
 
We talking about the President here we are not 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 191 of 299 
 
talking about anybody who is not – who is a – we are 
talking somebody very important to this country place my 
client in a position where – and he is courageous enough 
to say what he wants to say but I – I do want to caution the 
questions that are being asked here are questions I am not 
familiar that there has been evidence that has been given 
which allow – I mean on which – on which one can say well 
this is why the War Room was established.  This is who 
established it and this is – who – these are the facts 
surrounding its purpose.  Those facts are – I am sure they 
10 
are somewhere in the government archives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no let me say this. 
1. With regard to every witness who gives evidence if 
there is something that needs to be clarified in his 
evidence including whether he is making or she is 
making a certain allegations implicating somebody in 
wrongdoing that can be asked to get to clarify and 
actually asking that question helps so that when any 
investigation is done it is done on the understanding 
whether there is an allegation that somebody has 
20 
done something wrong and if it is clarified to say no I 
am not saying that somebody has done anything 
wrong that might save time in whatever investigation 
is done as opposed to understanding a witness to be 
making an allegation of wrongdoing against somebody 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 192 of 299 
 
and investigating an allegation of wrongdoing that 
actually the witness made or never intended to make. 
So that clarification is important. 
2. I said the President appointed the Deputy President 
because my recollection is that that was in the public 
domain.  Obviously if Mr Molefe has a different 
understanding 
or 
if 
anybody 
has 
a 
different 
understanding they might say I – we are not sure 
about that maybe that must be looked into and it can 
be looked into.  But obviously raising some of these 
10 
things might help narrow whatever investigation might 
need to be done.  So that is the – that is the context. 
Okay alright. 
ADV MASUKU:  Chair can I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MASUKU:  And I do not mean to engage in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MASUKU:  And you know it is not my style. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MASUKU:  But – but it is very important that – and I 
20 
am glad you have explained why you want to know the – 
his attitude whether or not he is accusing anybody.  That 
should never be the basis on which you conduct an 
investigation.  You have been given facts, this is what 
happened.  So and so owns shares; so and so is the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 193 of 299 
 
chairperson of the commission and there are transactions 
that are now involved which engage the – Eskom.  Those 
are facts I think it is really – really just trying to – to get us 
into your point where we careful about putting people in an 
un-envisage positions of having to say things they have not 
thought about.  My recollection is that the most important 
thing for this commission to do is to investigate the facts 
that you have been given.  On that you can then – because 
he can – the point of the matter is you do not have to – he 
does not have to say that – that – he does not have to 
10 
accuse anybody for the commission to conduct its own 
investigation.  He might say I am not accusing anybody but 
in your investigation you might find that there is some 
wrongdoing and it is – I just worry about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MASUKU:  His question – line of questioning that 
seems to suggest that you do want – because – this 
question you have asked – can you show you the front 
page tomorrow and his answer that he has given.  And – 
but it is not safe to do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no  
ADV MASUKU:  To some of our clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look the position is that whether a 
witness is – who gives evidence and the commission wants 
to investigate certain matters arising from that evidence 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 194 of 299 
 
whether he is asked or she is asked here at the hearing by 
the evidence leader or by me certain issues that may need 
to be asked or whether he is asked by the investigators 
outside of the hearing after he has given evidence there 
will be an opportunity to ask questions and that is 
important because that is part of investigating to say 
exactly what do you know about this?  Is your knowledge 
such that there may be some wrongdoing that we must 
pursue here or is your knowledge that you do not know if 
there is wrongdoing but this is what you know.  So this is 
10 
aimed to – to look at that.  But also we have a limited 
amount of time as the commission so it is unlike 2019 when 
we might have had a lot of time and we have limited 
resources.  Whatever we can get at the earliest opportunity 
we should try and get. 
ADV MASUKU:  Thank you Chair for clarifying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you.  Mr Seleka.  Oh we are 
at one minute to five already.  I am not sure that there is – 
or there – was there a question you had asked and that 
has not been answered? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes there was a question I wanted to 
ask but I also wanted to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say something. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To say something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 195 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the evidence on the War Room 
its establishment and running and information given to it 
was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was given already. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was part – was part of the evidence we 
led under the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we have the documentation relating 
to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But we were not going to ask Mr Molefe 
about that until he mentions the War Room and the Deputy 
President as the Chairperson of the War Room.  As a result 
of that questions of clarity arise and they will inherently 
arise because we need to clarify certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But part of the point you making is that 
indeed there was evidence that has been led under the 
suspension of executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to the War Room. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And its appointment and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the executives partly were 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 196 of 299 
 
being accused of not giving information to the War Room or 
incorrect information (talking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or conflicting information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we had to go into that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I remember that ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  We had to go into that.  And then 
the issue of the interest the President has in Glencore.  
That comes from Mr Molefe and so we have gotten to give 
10 
his affidavit to those he has implicated and to get their 
response.  And I wanted to read – well I was going to raise 
two points with you Mr Molefe in regard to what you have 
been explaining to the Chairperson.  So I can do that now 
or I can do that tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you can do it tomorrow then that 
would be – then we will do it tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will adjourn now.  The position is 
that we will continue tomorrow I thank everybody for their 
20 
cooperation for making it possible for us to continue 
tomorrow.  We are meant to have Mr Anoj Singh tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your estimate is that we should finish 
before lunch with Mr Molefe’s evidence. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 197 of 299 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Mr Anoj Singh can then come in 
at that stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – ja okay.  So we – we will adjourn 
and we will start at ten tomorrow – tomorrow as normal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will just for the public I will come back 
10 
there will be an evening session so I am adjourning so that 
another work stream can come in and then I will hear 
evidence from another work stream.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Hulley.  Good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Good afternoon Mr Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Nicholson from the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the Commission? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 198 of 299 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He is from the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.  I was 
wondering because there should not be anybody other than 
somebody that has just been approved. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...by the Commission. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Joubert. 
MR JOUBERT:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good.  Do we have the legal team for 
10 
Colonel Mhlongo around?  Are they available?  Have they 
been connected? 
COUNSEL:   Yes, good afternoon Chair.  We have been 
able to successfully connect and we are on(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Good afternoon.  Thank you 
very much.  Thank you. 
COUNSEL:   Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Please administer the oath 
to Mr Joubert and then we can start.

MR JOUBERT:   Yes? 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record.

02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 199 of 299 
 
WITNESS:   No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
TERRENCE JOHN JOUBERT:  (d.s.s.) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My recollection is such that we should 
not be too long with Mr Joubert.  Is that so? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is so Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Just to fill it in Mr Chair what has 
transpired since the last occasion since we convened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You will recall that you have directed 
20 
Colonel Mhlongo to file an affidavit dealing with his 
challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   With his evidence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On the merits. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 200 of 299 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And what – he has in fact done so.  
That now forms part of the LEA-10 Bundle and it appears 
at page 210.27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   210. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us start with the bundle.  What 
bundle are we using? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We are using Bundle LEA-10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and to find Colonel Mhlongo’s 
affidavit, I must go to what page? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, it is at page 210. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2010? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   2010.  I am sorry 210.  Not 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   210, not 2010. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   H’m.   
CHAIRPERSON:   210. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   210.27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. Nobody has drawn to my 
attention that he has filed.  So I have not had a chance to 
read it but it seems to be a short affidavit. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is a 13-page affidavit, if you exclude 
the first and the last page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is then 11 pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 201 of 299 
 
EXAMINATION BY ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  
Now for the benefit of Mr Joubert, there – an affidavit, a 
new affidavit has in fact come in from Colonel Mhlongo in 
which it deals with the allegations that you have advanced 
and that particular affidavit appears at page 210, the 
Bundle LEA-10 that you have got in front of you which 
should include pages 210.27.   
MR JOUBERT:   210.27... [Distortion present – speaker 
inaudible.] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Have you got it, sir? 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now just – and I am not going 
to take you through specific passages, except to give you 
the gist of the content.  But according to Mr Mhlongo...  
Sorry, Colonel Mhlongo.  What he says is that the two of 
you had been very close friends when you first joined the 
DSO in 2004.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, that is not correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now let us just break it up into two 
different sections.  When did you in fact join the DSO? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just repeat the question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   When did Mr Joubert, in fact, join the 
DSO? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Ja? 
MR 
JOUBERT: 
 
 
Ja, 
I 
got 
transferred 
on 
the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 202 of 299 
 
1 s t of January 2004 to the DSO.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   And that was down in KwaZulu-Natal? 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja, I was based in East London and I only 
came across to Durban the 20 t h of January of the same 
year. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And was that when you met mister or 
Colonel Mhlongo for the first time? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And was he also a member of the DSO 
at the time? 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you say you disagree with his 
statement and there are two aspects to the statement.  The 
first is that, is that you became friends when you first 
joined the DSO in 2004.  Are you disagreeing with the fact 
that you became friends or which aspect of your statement 
are you disagreeing with? 
MR JOUBERT:   I am disagreeing with the fact that we 
became friends.  We were colleagues, sitting on the same 
floor.  That is about it.  He belonged to the Guangzhou 
20 
Group and which I was not part of. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now he goes on to say.  Sorry, and if I 
could just cover an aspect.  The DSO, eventually, was 
disbanded and a new organisation the DPCI, the Directive 
for Priority Crimes Investigation was established in 2008.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 203 of 299 
 
Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now some people were required to go 
over to or had to choose whether they are going to stay 
with the National Prosecuting Authority under which the old 
DSO have been and others had to choose whether they are 
going to go over join the SAPS in which event they would 
go with the DPCI.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And what did you choose? 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   Well, I chose to stay on and form a risk 
management within the NPA.  I did not go across to the 
police. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And Colonel Mhlongo, what did he 
...[intervenes]  
MR JOUBERT:   He went back – he went across to the 
police. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now he says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Hulley.  Maybe you should have 
started off by recapping what evidence he had given up to 
20 
last time and then – so that the public can also follow. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, where we are with his evidence.  I 
know that he had not finished.  So.  But I cannot remember 
where he was. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 204 of 299 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair that is in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is right.  And it may well be that 
you lead him to complete his evidence and then maybe you 
then raise Mr Mhlongo’s version in regards to certain 
aspects. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, Mr Joubert, 
on the last occasion you had testified about a certain 
statement that you had made some time in 2013.  Do you 
10 
recall that?  I am just going to give you ...[intervenes]  
MR JOUBERT:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am just going to summarise some of 
the evidence that you would have given, A, for your 
benefit, for the benefit of the Chairperson and of course for 
the benefit of the public.  Now you had deposed to an 
affidavit in 2013.  To be precise, the 24 t h of November 
2013.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And in that statement or affidavit that 
20 
you gave, you spoke about a conversation.  In fact, two 
conversations that you have had with Colonel Mhlongo.  Is 
that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now in respect of the one conversation 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 205 of 299 
 
that you spoke of you testified that what had transpired is 
that he had come into your office to discuss a certain 
matter and while he was – while he came – or while he was 
in your office, he received a telephone call.   
 
During the course of that conversation with the – 
with whomever was on the other end of the telephone, you 
realised that he was speaking about certain very sensitive 
matters relating to the new National Director of Public 
Prosecutions, Mr Nxasana.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That at some point, you commenced to 
record what he was saying in that conversation.   
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you testified that a transcript had 
been produced relating to what had transpired or what he 
had said in the course of that conversation. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And I have directed your attention 
through the transcript in the bundle of documents that is 
before you.  Do you recall that? 
20 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you have taken us through the 
contents of that transcript and you had explained to the 
Commission certain aspects that you have dealt with in the 
recording or which was captured on the recording and 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 206 of 299 
 
certain aspects which had preceded the recording.  Do you 
recall that? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now in essence what had transpired in 
the discussion that you had with Colonel Mhlongo was that 
he had advised you that he had been mandated by 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba to find information that would 
place Mr Nxasana in a bad light.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And in the course of that conversation, 
10 
there were a number of aspects which arose during the 
course of the conversation.  You mentioned some four 
aspects but the two pertinent aspects that arose what that 
you – he mentioned that Mr Nxasana had apparently been 
charged at some stage with the murder of a particular 
person and that they were investigating to try and locate 
information relating to that murder charge. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the second pertinent aspect was 
that 
he 
had 
indicated 
to 
you 
that 
they 
had 
found 
20 
information relating to fraud charges for fraud allegation in 
respect of the Road Accident Fund. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And he wanted your assistance, that is 
now Colonel Mhlongo wanted your assistance in trying to 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 207 of 299 
 
speak to somebody within the Road Accident Fund who 
might be able to assist them or providing with further 
information 
or 
documentation 
relating 
to 
that 
Road 
Accident Fund allegations. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you had indicated that you would 
put him in touch with a person within the Road Accident 
Fund but you had – but in truth, you were simply leading 
them on or leading Colonel Mhlongo on because you 
actually did not know anybody within the Road Accident 
10 
Fund. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now...  So Mr Chair, that would be a 
summary of what had transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I would like to do is, is to move 
on 
to 
- 
because 
it 
seems 
that 
the 
affidavit 
of 
Colonel Mhlongo has to a large extent narrowed the issues 
down in certain respects.  I would like to get into the 
substance of the affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, if we can 
just back to the statement of Colonel Mhlongo.  We have 
spoken about the fact that according to him the two of you 
were fairly – it appears – and he does not use this 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 208 of 299 
 
language per se but the substance of what he is saying is 
that the two of you were close friends.  And you came 
down and joined the DSO in KwaZulu-Natal in Durban.  
Now you disagree with that?   
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, I definitely disagree with that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now after the DSO had in fact been 
disbanded, the – we got to the point where you had made 
the election to say with the NPA and he had made the 
election to take employment with the DPCI which now 
resided under the SAPS, South African Police Service. 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now physically, where were you 
located then?  And if I say you, I mean you personally.  
Where were you located in terms of which building were 
you at after the split? 
MR JOUBERT:   We basically just moved floors from the 
6 t h floor to the 3 r d floor on the same building, Southern 
Light Building and the police, obviously, had to leave to the 
various units whichever one they applied to and were 
transferred to. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And in the case of Colonel Mhlongo, he 
had obviously taken up employment with the DPCI which is 
commonly known as the Hawks.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct.  So he obviously moved 
with the rest of the clang when they were moved. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 209 of 299 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now at some stage he returned from 
the evidence that you have given on the previous occasion 
and from his affidavit, he returned to the building.  This 
time to take up a position – he was seconded to come and 
assist in the Missing Persons Unit. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair.  He was seconded 
to this PRC and he moved to our building, back into our 
building. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now according to him, he says that the 
relationship between the two of you deteriorated after the 
10 
statement or your affidavit on the 25 t h of November of 2013 
came to light.  He became aware of it and the relationship 
between the two of you became frosty after that.  What is 
your response to that? 
MR JOUBERT:   Chair, the words that I would use is, there 
was never a relationship per se.  It was merely – he was 
merely my colleague at the time of the DSO.  Now he 
became an acquaintance.  Somebody I knew.  We had 
space on our floor.  They needed space.  So I actually 
asked the office manager to move him from wherever they 
20 
were sitting to my floor which was on the 3 r d floor.  And 
that was it.  To say that we were friends based on that I 
would not agree. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now in relation to the 
conversation that you recorded and he confirms from his 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 210 of 299 
 
affidavit that there was in fact a recording.  He confirms 
that he subsequently became aware of the recording.  So 
that does not seem to be a bone of contention or an area 
of dispute. 
 
But what he says about that conversation is 
essentially that you were the person that initiated the 
conversation.  You were the person that had raised 
concerns about the appointment or rather about certain 
investigations that Mr Nxasana was intending to institute 
against people within the NPA of which you were one. 
10 
 
What do you say about that. 
MR JOUBERT:   I would say that is a bunch of lies for a 
lack of a better expression because remember Mr Nxasana 
was about to start work at my...  My battery is flat.  Sorry, 
just two seconds. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR JOUBERT:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   Just to recap again.  I had no dealings – I 
did not even know Mr Nxasana.  I knew his right-hand man 
20 
who was Advocate Duma.  This guy was going to – was 
carrying on for himself with regards to investigations that 
he is undertaking against this new guy. 
 
I saw it fit to record this guy for two reasons.  
One 
is, 
there 
was 
somebody 
that 
is 
going 
to 
be 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 211 of 299 
 
investigated 
without 
his 
knowledge. 
 
This 
guy 
was 
appointed on the 30 t h of August.   
 
I just saw it fit to record what this guy was 
saying, 
giving 
it 
to 
Duma 
who 
was 
the 
advisor 
to 
Mr Nxasana 
for 
him 
to 
know 
that 
there 
was 
this 
investigation and I was merely doing my job. 
 
As to his claims of me having – being worried of 
cases opened against me by Mr Nxasana that is a lot of 
lies.  That is one thing I can tell you.  That is so far from 
the truth.   
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay let us just chat about those 
cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley, I am sorry.  Has Mr Joubert 
been given Colonel Mhlongo’s affidavit, latest affidavit and 
asked to respond to it? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We did provide it to him and asked him 
to respond.  Unfortunately, he did not have sufficient time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We thought it would just make sense if 
I led him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Maybe...  It may or may 
not 
be 
necessary 
after 
he 
has 
finished 
for 
him 
to 
nevertheless provide and affidavit, just so that there is a 
response in writing.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, Chair. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 212 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   When one looks at Colonel Mhlongo’s 
affidavit, one can have regard to his responses as well 
apart from the fact that he is responding now. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Ja, we will attend to that off the air. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now what he 
says is to be specific.  He says that you mentioned to him 
that there were in fact two cases that you had that were 
10 
old cases against you and if you...  In fact, to be precise, I 
think turn to page 210.33 at paragraph 17.7. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now at 17.7 he says that he, that is 
nor referring now to you, specifically mentioned the case 
the you had to with the tender – with a tender for the 
procurement of security services in respect of which he 
had been suspended at some point and the case involving 
the unlawful use of an official firearm. 
 
Now let us just break this up into parts.  Firstly, 
20 
were you ever suspended in respect of any cases? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
MR JOUBERT:   I was suspended from the NPA four times 
to be exact.  I will give you the sequence.  The first time I 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 213 of 299 
 
suspended for an assault that never took place.  I was then 
reinstated.  The second time was for some gun-running 
that was found to be false.   
 
The third time for the security tender thing that I 
was arrested for.  I just need to also mention that I blame 
the state for and...   
 
And the fourth time was for having R 30 100,00 
in my car which they subsequently now want to return to 
me.  So those are the four times that I was suspended from 
the NPA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to give years, even if it is 
not the exact dates, which years you were suspended 
those four times? 
MR JOUBERT:   Not exact but I remember 2011 was the 
year that I was suspended for this tender thing.  I think 
2010/2009 for assault.  I am speaking under correction 
Chair.  And roughly, I think roundabout 2017/2018 for this 
gun-running thing.  And 2019 for this R 30 100,00 that it 
had in my car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So are you with regard to the 
20 
allegations 
of 
assault 
for 
which 
you 
say 
you 
were 
suspended, was there a disciplinary inquiry that followed 
that which ...[intervenes]  
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...found 
you 
not 
guilty 
or 
what 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 214 of 299 
 
happened?  Did they found you not guilty? 
MR JOUBERT:   For each of these suspensions, I went 
through the disciplinary process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Disciplinary process, yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   I actually went to court first.  I was found 
not guilty on this charge, on the assault.  And then I was 
reinstated.  With the gun-running thing, it never reached 
court.  It was a suspension, a very... suspension, by the 
way.  But be that as it may.  I was then reinstated. 
 
With the tender – the security tender.  Just to 
10 
give you a background.  I was running the KZN office.  
There was a security tender that came out that was 
handled in Pretoria.  My duty was to stamp the forms of 
each and every company that came to do inspection of the 
sites which I did.   
 
And for that I was part and parcel arrested with 
the rest of the clang from head office which I had no 
dealings with. But that was just to give you a background 
of what happened to me.   
 
I got arrested, I spent five days in custody and 
20 
for that the case was – or the second appearance it was 
thrown out of court.  It never went back.  We then lodged a 
civil claim against all the necessary individuals involved in 
this and we are still waiting for that thing to be concluded.   
 
As for the fourth one which is the latest one.  In 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 215 of 299 
 
2019, on the 12 t h of October, for some reason the police at 
McDonald’s stopped my car, searched my car.  I had my 
firearm with me.  They were not interested in that.  They 
found R 30 100,00 in my car.  And they said:  No, I am 
corrupt.  I must have collected or whatever the case might 
be.   
 
But that case is also has run its course because 
I have got a copy here that I was about to send where the 
NPA said there is no – they are not going to take this 
matter any further and I could collect my money from the 
10 
relevant police station. 
 
But all of this Chair, I have seen it as people – 
there were people behind this but I do not want to mention 
names now on national television.  I will deal with it at the 
right time. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I want to deal, if I might.  It was just 
the two matters ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to one, I think it is the 
20 
occasion when you say the police found you are in 
possession of about R 30 000 and you were arrested and 
spent five days in police custody.  Were you ever charged?   
MR JOUBERT:   No.  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not about that one. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 216 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   For the security tender I was arrested and 
I spent five days in custody in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, for the …[intervenes] 
MR JOUBERT:   For this one they just took my money and 
put it in the 13 and was investigating the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR JOUBERT:   Up to now that I have been given 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How long ago was it when they took your 
money? 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   It happed on the 12 October 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Have they not told you anything 
about what is happening? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, no, as I said, I am sitting here with a 
document that I would forward to Adv Hulley in due course 
in the course of business tonight, just for him to have a 
look at this document to show that these guys have now 
opted to give me my money back after arresting me for 
having R30 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying the police have written to 
20 
you wanting to make arrangements to give the money back 
to you? 
MR JOUBERT:   The NPA, the person that was dealing with 
this matter was A Waters from the NPA, the Captain B E 
Ndwada(?) was the IO, the case number is a Durban North 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 217 of 299 
 
CAS 135/10/2019.  They basically just informed my lawyer 
that I can now – there is no – there is nothing that came, 
there is no evidence to prove anything that was suggested 
against Mr Joubert and therefore he can – he has declined 
to prosecute and cash monies can now be retrieved from 
this Durban North SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  So in respect 
of none of these allegations that have been made against 
you have you been formally charged at any stage? 
MR JOUBERT:   The only one that I was formally charged 
10 
for was the security tender one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   And that is the one that was thrown out of 
court on the 28 May 2012.  This case was thrown out of 
court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that after some oral evidence had 
been led in court or was that before any witnesses gave 
evidence? 
MR JOUBERT:   Before any witnesses testified this case 
was thrown out. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Hulley? 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now that is the one 
matter that he mentions and according to you that the 
charges had been withdrawn or the case had been thrown 
out of court on the 28 May of 2012. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 218 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And then he mentions a second matter 
and that is the case involving an unlawful use of an official 
firearm.  Was there in fact such a case against you? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, there was such a case against me 
and then that case never saw light of day in court because 
it never – I was never charged, officially charged for it.  
We were on duty, we were doing duty in Kimberley during 
the John Block trial, each one of us were issued with 
firearms.  There was nothing untoward in any of my 
10 
actions, I was given a firearm, I signed for it and then 
when I came back I gave it back, there was nothing 
whatsoever in my actions that suggested that I had done 
anything wrong with firearms or unlawful possession or 
whatever of firearms as Colonel Mhlongo has suggested 
here. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now that particular aspect or that 
particular case, did it ever result in charges being brought 
against you? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Chair, that case also died a natural 
20 
death and nothing happened with that case.  I gave my 
version and that was it.  
MR HULLEY SC:   So there was some concerns that had 
been raised, is that correct, about your possession of the 
firearm? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 219 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, this was during the time of Menzi 
Simelane. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And when did that issue – you say that 
nothing further came of it, when did you last hear about 
that case? 
MR JOUBERT:   The last time I heard of the case was 
somewhere in – I think Menzi left in 2011, somewhere in 
2011, that was the last time I heard of that case. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now when Mr Nxasana came into office, 
he would come into office on the 1 October 2013, is that 
10 
correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, he was – ja, I think 2013 
October was his first day, to be his first day. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Did you received any indication from Mr 
Nxasana or anybody else telling you about the intentions of 
Mr Nxasana, that it was his intention to “resuscitate” those 
cases? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Chair, nothing whatsoever. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now he also says in paragraph 17.8 of 
the same affidavit on page 210.33, he says that: 
20 
“As I sympathise with him he complained about Mr 
Nxasana targeting people with previous cases when 
he himself had previous cases, he mentioned to me 
that he had come across a murder case against Mr 
Nxasana in the course of vetting him, that is Mr 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 220 of 299 
 
Nxasana’s employment, in the risk and security unit 
but he was unable to obtain greater detail on the 
case.” 
Now the first question is, did you in fact conduct the 
vetting of Mr Nxasana? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Chair.  Mr Nxasana was a political 
appointee, one.  And the people that deals with political 
appointees’ vetting at the time was NIA, the National 
Intelligence Agencies, we had nothing to do with vetting of 
Mr Nxasana, so that is a lie. 
10 
MR HULLEY SC:   Very well and insofar as you had 
acquired knowledge of any murder case that Mr Nxasana 
was involved in, how would acquire knowledge of that fact? 
MR JOUBERT:   The only time I got to hear of a murder 
case that Mr Nxasana was involved in was from Colonel 
Mhlongo himself.  I never know who Nxasana was, I never 
knew he had a case let alone a murder case for that matter.  
How would I have known of this?  I definitely did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley… 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   While listening to Mr Joubert’s evidence 
I have been trying to familiarise myself with Colonel 
Mhlongo’s affidavit. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which I have just finished.  It would 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 221 of 299 
 
appear to me – and I want to confirm whether that is your 
understanding as well, that Colonel Mhlongo does not deny 
the content of the recorded conversation but he says that 
was not the first conversation that he and Mr Joubert had 
about Mr Nxasana’s appointment. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they had had previous conversations 
or a previous conversation and he then says in effect it was 
Mr Joubert who initiated the discussion between the two of 
them about Mr Nxasana’s appointment and that he wanted 
10 
to do certain things in order to have Mr Nxasana not to 
resuscitate disciplinary proceedings against him.  I do not 
know whether some criminal proceedings as well, but he did 
not want that to happen but – and then he attacks his 
credibility and reliability on the basis of various matters that 
he raises.  Am I correct? 
MR HULLEY SC:   You are absolutely correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Perhaps if I can start here, Mr Joubert, 
what Colonel Mhlongo says is that this conversation where 
20 
you recorded the two of you engaged in a discussion, he is 
saying that was in fact not the first time that the two of you 
had in fact engaged in a conversation relating to Mr 
Nxasana. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is definitely not true, Chair.  Me and 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 222 of 299 
 
Colonel Mhlongo, the only time we spoke about the 
appointment of Mr Nxasana was the day I recorded this 
matter. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now he also says that the very first time 
the two of you had a discussion, he says at paragraph 17.1 
that he had expressed dismay at the appointment of Mr 
Nxasana because he firstly knew Mr Nxasana, he had had 
previous dealings with him and the dealings that he had had 
with him was not pleasant dealings.  Now that was the first, 
the very first occasion that the two of you had had a 
10 
discussion. 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Mr Chair.  As I said earlier on, I only 
had one discussion with Colonel Mhlongo and the recording 
speaks for itself.  You know, I never had any other 
discussions or meetings with Colonel Mhlongo about Mr 
Nxasana and his appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did he ever say to you that Mr 
Nxasana had previously treated him badly and that for that 
reason he did not like because that is part of what he says 
he shared with you? 
20 
MR JOUBERT:   Chair, to be honest with you, I cannot 
recall him making that statement to me.  I really and truly 
cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that is fine.  Mr Hulley you may 
proceed.  I just realised I did not switch off my phone. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 223 of 299 
 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And then the  - according to him the 
conversation that you recorded took place on the 24 
November of 2013, would that be correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   Mr Chair, what I can remember is that the 
recording took place on the 18 September as per my 
affidavit.  The affidavit that I had given was given on the 25 
November. 
MR 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Was 
there 
any 
conversation 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MR JOUBERT:   Because I remember giving the recording 
to Advocate Duma and he later on requested that I 
substantiate my recording with an affidavit, which I did. 
MR HULLEY SC:    Now according to him, he says that the 
conversation itself took place on the 25 November.  Was 
there 
any 
conversation 
that 
took 
place 
on 
the 
25 
November?  You say that the conversation where you 
recorded him took place on the 18 September, he says it 
took 
place 
on 
the 
25 
November. 
 
Was 
there 
any 
20 
conversation between the two of you on the 25 November 
relating to Mr Nxasana? 
MR JOUBERT:   The answer to that, Chair, is no because 
after the recording Colonel Mhlongo was evicted from our 
building and I have never seen him after that.  So the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 224 of 299 
 
answer to your question is no, we never had a conversation 
after the recording. 
MR HULLEY SC:   When you say that after the recording he 
was evicted from the building, just explain how that 
happened, how did he go from the recording to the eviction, 
just explain the process? 
MR JOUBERT:   After the guys had head office heard of 
Colonel Mhlongo’s shenanigans via the recording they 
then wrote to the person that he works with an requested 
he leaves the building with immediate effect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   How soon after the day of the recording 
was it that he was – that he left the building, if you are 
able to remember?  A week, a month, two months? 
MR JOUBERT:   I think about a week, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JOUBERT:   I stand corrected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JOUBERT:   But I think around about a week or so 
after the recording he got his marching orders. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now the recording, obviously you said 
that you had sent it to Mr Duma, is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   Just repeat that please? 
MR HULLEY SC:   If I recall correctly, your testimony was 
that you had sent or you had provided Mr Duma with the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 225 of 299 
 
recording, is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And the affidavit we know was provided 
on the 25 November of 2013.  
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now when you speak about Colonel 
Mhlongo being evicted from the building, was it pursuant 
to the provision of the affidavit or pursuant to the 
provision of the recording or both? 
MR JOUBERT:   As I have said, I think it was shortly after 
10 
the recording, after they listened to the recording that he 
was evicted. 
MR HULLEY SC:   So that would have been sometime in 
September then of …[intervenes] 
MR JOUBERT:   The correct date thereof I am not in a 
position to tell you, Chair, on which date he was evicted 
but it was shortly after the recording. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now if I could just ask you to turn with 
me in the bundle – sorry, in EXHIBIT Y11 at page 326. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a different bundle than the one 
20 
that I have? 
MR HULLEY SC:   It is not a different bundle, it is still part 
of the LEA bundle 10, it is just under EXHIBIT Y11, Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is EXHIBIT Y11? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 226 of 299 
 
MR HULLEY SC:   We are looking, to be specific, page 
326.1. 
MR JOUBERT:   326 or 236? 
CHAIRPERSON:   326. 
MR HULLEY SC:   326. 
MR JOUBERT:   326, Y11. 
MR HULLEY SC:   That is correct. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now this is a letter which is from the 
SAPS 
specifically 
from 
the 
Provincial 
Commissioner 
10 
Lieutenant General B M Ngubeni and it is addressed to the 
Director of Public Prosecution of Kwazulu-Natal who we 
know at the time was Advocate Ngoko and it says, 
paragraph 1: 
“Attached herewith find a communicae received from 
of the office of Priority Crimes Litigation Unit.  
Kindly ensure that the members are informed and to 
report to their original posts with immediate effect.  I 
trust that you will find this in order.” 
And the heading of the letter: 
20 
“Request for immediate termination of secondment 
of Colonel S W Mhlongo, Sergeant J D Radebe and 
WO I Q Shando to the Missing Persons Task Team.” 
Do you see that? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 227 of 299 
 
MR HULLEY SC:   And if you go over to the following page, 
a letter that has been referred to by Lieutenant General 
Ngubene is that which appears at page 326.2, it is dated 
the 2 December of 2013 and it is in fact addressed to 
Lieutenant General Ngubene.  And if you go to the last page 
you will see that it is from Advocate S K Abrahams, 
Advocate Shaun Abrahams and the essence of it, and I do 
not wish to take you through it, but the essence of it is to 
complain 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
Colonel 
Mhlongo 
was 
apparently responsible for conducting an investigation 
10 
against Mr Nxasana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, are you saying that is in the 
letters? 
MR HULLEY SC:   If you look at – if you will see it says: 
“The 
request 
for 
immediate 
termination 
of 
secondment of Colonel S W Mhlongo, Sergeant J D 
Radebe and WO I Q Shando to the Missing Persons 
Task Unit.” 
It says: 
1. Colonel Mhlongo has been seconded by one of 
20 
your predecessors to assist the Missing Persons 
Task Team in the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit in 
the office of the NDPP in the execution of its 
mandate in tracing and identifying the remains of 
persons who disappeared during the struggle for 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 228 of 299 
 
liberation 
from 
apartheid 
during 
the 
period 
covered 
by 
the 
Truth 
and 
Reconciliation 
Commission.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what I wanted to ask was, I assume 
that 
the 
only 
reason 
you 
were 
referring 
to 
that 
correspondence is to ask Mr Joubert whether he might not 
be mistaken …[intervenes] 
MR HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he says that Colonel Mhlongo was 
evicted or left the building within about a week after the 
10 
recording because this suggests it might have been much 
later in the year. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise the contents do not seem to 
be of much relevance. 
MR HULLEY SC:   The contents is just to withdraw or to 
recall the secondment, that is the purpose of the letter, but 
it is dated the 2 December of 2013.  In other words, it is 
shortly after 25 November 2013 but several months after 
the 18 September of 2013. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could you be mistaken? 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja, I do not have this …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Correspondence. 
MR JOUBERT:   Things that you are talking about so could 
we ask Adv Nicholson to assist me maybe with this 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 229 of 299 
 
document that you are referring to because it is not part of 
my bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got a bundle that is marked 
bundle LEA10 on the spine of the lever arch file? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct.  Yes, I do have that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JOUBERT:   And now I see Adv Nicholson has brought 
to my attention the page in question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, yes, I see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those letters, I think there are two.  
There are two letters, they are both written in December 
2013, the heading suggests that – and the contents seem 
to say the secondment of Colonel Mhlongo to the NPA was 
being terminated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, I see that it was dated the 5 
December, yes, 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Could it be that you are mistaken 
about – you were mistaken when you said Colonel Mhlongo 
20 
you thought left about a week or so after the recording? 
MR JOUBERT:   A week or so, ja.  Yes, Chair, I could 
have been mistaken about the dates because it happened 
quite some time back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 230 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   But ja, I see it happened in December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR JOUBERT:   To be exact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And just for the benefit, Mr Chair, just 
to be precise, I had indicated that the letter in fact 
indicated that there had been an investigation conducted 
by Colonel Mhlongo against Mr Nxasana, the letter in fact 
does not say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja. 
10 
MR HULLEY SC:   The letter simply says that a 
secondment …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I also wondered because I thought 
I had read it, ja. 
MR HULLEY SC:   I have put two different things together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, no, that is alright.  I do not 
think much turns on the date. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  We have got the 
two affidavits that you had deposed to previously one of 
which was dated the 25 November that we have already 
20 
spoken about, there was a second affidavit which was 
dated the 1 February of 2016.  In the second affidavit you 
– and you have testified about that on a previous occasion 
in July of 2020 before the Commission.  You have 
acknowledged that both affidavits are in fact yours. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 231 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now in the second affidavit that was 
dated 2016, the 1 February 2016, you distanced yourself 
as it were from the first affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Hulley, I thought you 
wanted to first finish putting to him Mr Mhlongo’s version 
as to why Mr Mhlongo says his evidence or he is 
unreliable and dishonest and we get that out of the way. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Thank you, Mr Chair, would be 
perhaps …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because there are still quite a few 
things to put to him. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   While you are looking can I then just 
ask him.  Mr Joubert… 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Colonel Mhlongo says in his affidavit: 
“Soon after the announcement of Mr Nxasana’s 
appointment, Advocate Jiba is scheduled to meet 
Mr Nxasana in Kwazulu-Natal.” 
20 
And you were tasked with transporting Advocate Jiba 
during her visit to the province to meet Mr Nxasana but 
that you asked if he had assisted Adv Jiba before and he 
confirmed that he had previously transported her and you 
asked him to take over from you and transport Adv Jiba 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 232 of 299 
 
for the meeting with Mr Nxasana and he agreed.  Is that 
factually correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, no, Chair, that is definitely incorrect.  
I was supposed to pick Adv Jiba up on that given day for a 
meeting but then I was notified by Jiba’s PA for me not to 
worry, the DPP at the time in KZN Ngoko(?) had asked 
Colonel Mhlongo to pick Jiba up from the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   So… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know why Colonel Mhlongo 
10 
would say such a discussion took place between the two 
of you if it did not take place? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, I have got no idea why he would say 
that, Chair.  
Colonel Mhlongo used to pick up his 
executives for – I do not know.  Ja, from the airport.  He, 
whilst he was in the DSO he would from time to time – I 
would – when Mpshe was the Acting NDPP, he would 
request this WS to go and pick him up and as much as it 
was perceived to be a risk management thing, I hated this 
with a passion because it was not on my job description. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean driving them around? 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja, fetching his people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fetching them, ja.  He also says after Mr 
Nxasana had commenced working as NDPP you informed 
him, that is Colonel Mhlongo, that you had heard that Mr 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 233 of 299 
 
Nxasana was going to resuscitate some cases against 
you.  Did you say that to Colonel Mhlongo? 
MR JOUBERT:   Chair, that is so far from the truth.  I 
never discussed anything like that with Mr Mhlongo.  In 
actual fact I did not know whether Mr Nxasana or whoever 
else had any intentions to resuscitate any case against 
me or against anybody for that matter that I know.  So that 
one is a lie, it is definitely a lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know or to the extent that Mr 
Mhlongo may be talking about the cases that you have told 
10 
me about, in terms of which you were suspended, I think 
you said there were four.  To the extent that he may be 
talking about those, that those are the cases you had 
heard that Mr Nxasana was going to resuscitate against 
you.    
 
Your position is that they had all resulted in an 
outcome in your favour before? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair, that is correct 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Had anybody ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR JOUBERT:   And if they wanted to resuscitate it by all 
means.  I always say you know even if that was the case, I 
would not have done as this guy has suggested to discuss 
it with him.   
No, I would let them continue with the investigation 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 234 of 299 
 
waiting for them to come to me, and then deal with the 
matter as I have been doing all along with these four 
matters that came my way and I doubt whether I would be 
discussing anything like that with a guy like Colonel 
Mhlongo to be honest with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Had you ever met Mr Nxasana in 
person, either socially or in a work related environment? 
MR JOUBERT:   The only time I met Mr Nxasana was 
during the meet and greet that he came to the Durban 
office, to be introduced to all of us.  I do not and oh, ja he 
10 
came for a prize giving.  Those are the two occasions that I 
saw Mr Nxasana, I do not know Mr Nxasana, I never knew 
Mr Nxasana. The only person that I knew was the guy that 
was his advisor, who used to work with me, play soccer 
with me, which is Advocate Duma. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now, at the time of your discussion with 
Mr Mhlongo, whether it was in September 2013, or 
whatever month, was that before the meet and greet that 
on which you say you met Mr Nxasana? 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    It was before? 
MR JOUBERT:   That was definitely before the meet and 
greet. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So at the time of the discussion, had 
you never met, Mr Nxasana? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 235 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   Never, never met him, never seen him, 
only saw this guy, the new NDPP on the TV and then I saw 
him subsequently when he came to - for those two, on 
those two occasions to our offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Had you spoken to him on the phone? 
MR JOUBERT:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:    At that time.  
MR JOUBERT:   The person that I spoke to was Duma, 
even with this affidavit that I that I did, that went to him, it 
was from the request made to me by Duma, and not 
10 
Nxasana. 
Yes, Colonel Mhlongo says that you complained about Mr 
Nxasana targeting people with previous cases, when he 
himself had previous cases.  She says you mentioned to 
him that you had come across a murder case against Mr 
Nxasana in the course of vetting his employment in the risk 
and security units, but you were unable to obtain greater 
detail on the case.  What do you say about that? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is a definite lie, his just trying to 
mislead the Commission, for lack of a better statement 
20 
because really, I never, as I said, I never knew Nxasana, I 
never met Nxasana, I never had any investigation or 
vetting to do with Nxasana.  So that is misleading, that 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I do not know if you might have covered 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 236 of 299 
 
the question that I have just asked you maybe I have just 
misinterpreted, you want to take it from there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Thank you Mr Chair.  He go on to say 
in paragraph 17.6, that you had asked him to register an 
inquiry with the SAPS, as he was still within the SAPS and 
the inquiry is referring to is an inquiry relating to the 
murder investigation, of the murder case that Mr Nxasana 
was apparently involved in.  Did you ever ask him to 
register an inquiry relating to a murder case that Mr 
Nxasana was involved in or to any other case that Mr 
10 
Nxasana was involved in? 
MR JOUBERT:   Mr Chair, I have never asked this guy to 
register anything with regards to Mr Nxasana. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now he goes on to say that Mr Joubert 
also mentioned having come across something that had to 
do with the defrauding of the RAF, the Road Accident Fund.  
He indicated to me that he wanted to use the information 
against Mr Nxasana, in the event that he, that is Mr 
Nxasana 
were 
to 
commence 
disciplinary 
proceedings 
against him.  What do you say to that? 
20 
MR JOUBERT:   Yet again, I did not know that Mr Nxasana 
was doing work for RAF.  The requests that Colonel 
Mhlongo made, was due to the fact that Mr Nxasana’s wife 
works at RAF.  Do I know anybody that could verify as to 
whether Mr Nxasana did some work or got some work or 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 237 of 299 
 
more work than he should have gotten from the RAF and to 
which I said, yes I will assist, I will just bring A to B.  
Meaning I would introduce him to the people that I 
know at RAF and I would want nothing to do with it.  But on 
the same, in the same breath, I would like to say, I do not 
know anybody at RAF.  So I was merely saying this to 
Colonel Mhlongo to understand, where is he coming from, 
what does he want, but I do not know, I was not going to 
help him in any event. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now, he also says that, when the two 
10 
of you had the conversation, which was recorded, he puts 
that conversation as we have indicated on the 25 t h of 
November, you put it a little bit earlier than that on the 18 t h 
of September, but whatever the date might be, he says 
when that conversation took place, it commenced from the 
premise of Mr Joubert having undertaken to arrange 
concrete proof of the allegations against Mr Nxasana. 
MR JOUBERT:   Now, yet again, Colonel Mhlongo is trying 
his level best to mislead the Commission because there is 
no way that I was going to get any concrete whatever 
20 
against Mr Nxasana, I did not know any concrete proof, I 
did not have any concrete proof, so that is a lie. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    If you turn over to the following page, 
at page 210.35.  He attacks your reliability and credibility 
as a witness.  I want you to turn to paragraph 21 of that, 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 238 of 299 
 
he says: 
“That you are currently on suspension because you 
were caught in an operation Umhlanga for soliciting 
a bribe and taking R38 000,00 from an accused 
person.  You also passed yourself off - he says, as 
a Colonel Joubert to the officials that arrested him 
during the operation.” 
What do you say to that? 
MR JOUBERT:   I will say the following, Chair firstly, I 
never took a bribe from anybody.  That is the same R30 
10 
100,00 that I spoke about earlier on that maybe this 
Colonel Mhlongo was misinformed by whoever told him 
this.  
 
Secondly, these guys that were dealing with the 
R30 100,00 knew that I was an employee of the NPA 
because they saw my appointment card.  One I do not know 
where does this Colonel Joubert things comes from but I 
had never and I will never portray myself to it because it is 
an offence to impersonate a Police Officer and I know 
better. 
20 
The R30 100,00 that I am an accused person for is 
exactly this that I now have to go fetch from the Police 
Station, I was not charged for this particular case and I do 
not know what else to say about it, because…[intervene] 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Sorry, as you correctly point out, it is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 239 of 299 
 
in fact a criminal offence to pass yourself off as a Police 
Officer.  The charges that have been referred to over here 
that you say was the R30 100,00 that was confiscated from 
you, at the time or taken from you at the time, and where 
allegations of corruption were levelled against you.  
On that particular occasion were allegations of 
impersonating a Police Officer also levelled against you 
during the same or relating to the same incident? 
MR JOUBERT:   Chair, no other case, no case was brought 
against me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, you said you were not charged in 
regard to the four matters that you have mentioned and 
they include the matter relating to the R30 000,00, is that 
right? You have said you were never charged, or you were 
charged in regard to one, but that did not result in any 
conviction? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now the question that I am asking 
clearly it is not about whether you were charged, but 
20 
whether 
the 
allegations 
because 
they 
were 
clearly 
allegations relating to corruption relating to the R30 100,00 
but those allegations also include the allegation that you 
had impersonated a Police Officer. 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Chair I was not charged for 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 240 of 299 
 
impersonating a police officer.  That is why I said maybe 
Colonel Mhlongo the information that he was given by 
whoever gave him the wrong information. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now, he says here that you had also 
in paragraph 22, he says: 
“Mr Joubert Bay was engaged as part of the 
investigation teams, assisting the Commission in 
the Free State.” 
And by the Commission, I imagine his referring to the State 
Capture Commission, the present Commission.  Is that 
10 
correct, were you in fact, to assist the State Capture 
Commission in the Free State? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Maybe let us put the whole thing, Mr 
Hulley.  In addition to that, he says you were removed from 
the team for corruption offenses and he says when you 
were appointed by the Commission, you did not even 
mention that you were on suspension for corruption 
offenses.  What do you say to that? 
MR JOUBERT:   I was part of the AFU’s State Capture 
team that work under, AFU in Pretoria at VGM and we add 
20 
quite a few cases.  I was - part of the cases took us to 
Free State, the Free State dairy farm.  I was part and 
parcel of that investigation under the AFU banner.  
CHAIRPERSON:    But start from saying whether it is true 
or not that you were engaged as part of the investigation 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 241 of 299 
 
team, oh he says I thought he was saying you were 
appointed by the Commission.  But he says you were part, 
you were engaged, he does not say by whom but as part of 
the investigation teams that were assisting the State 
Capture Commission in the Free State.  
So first of all, you were not appointed by the 
Commission, were you? 
MR 
JOUBERT: 
 
 
No, 
no 
I 
was 
merely 
appointed…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just hold one second, you were part of 
10 
the asset forfeiture unit in Pretoria. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct and under that we did 
State Capture investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:    State Capture related investigations in 
the Free State. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   Part of that investigation included the 
Free State dairy farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, he actually does say in the last 
20 
sentence of paragraph 22 that when you were appointed by 
the Commission, you did not even mentioned that you were 
on suspension for corruption offenses.  Were you ever 
appointed by the Commission? 
MR JOUBERT:   Now I am getting there Chair.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 242 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR JOUBERT:   I am getting there, firstly you cannot be 
on suspension for corruption and be part of the State 
Capture team that is utter nonsense for lack of a better 
word, one. 
Two, all of these allegations that were brought 
against me way back then was dealt with, you know, as I 
said to you earlier on, I was never convicted or I was 
suspended yes, but I was then reinstated, I had to work.  
So I think that this also is being misinformed or 
10 
trying to attack my credibility without the necessary 
information, because this is - I almost said rubbish, but 
this is wrong, this is totally wrong.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Well he says you were - in February 
because his affidavit is dated 22 February 2021.  As at the 
time when he deposed to this affidavit, he said, you were 
on suspension, because you had caught in an operation in 
Umhlanga Rocks for soliciting a bribe and taking R38 
000,00, and then that comes in the passing of a Colonel 
Joubert.  This aspect of being on suspension as at the date 
20 
when he deposed to this affidavit 22 February 2021.  Is 
that true? 
MR JOUBERT:   That 21 of his…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    It is 22 February 2021, last week, I 
think it would have been or the other week.  He says, when 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 243 of 299 
 
he was signing this affidavit on the 22 n d of February 20, no 
there are two dates here.  Well, it must be 22 February 
2021.  
 
I just realised that on the Commissioner of Oaths 
certificate, the typed one it is written that this affidavit was 
deposed on the 22 n d day of February 2020 but the Police 
stamp is 22 February 2021.  So I do not know what is going 
on there but I assume that…[intervene] 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Mr Chair, to be fair I think that was a 
typographical error, presumably by the attorneys, but the 
10 
correct address is 22 February 2021. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, I assume that is the correct one but 
I do not know why people do not pay attention to, not to 
cause this confusion because this is not the first affidavit, 
which comes before the Commission where Commissioners 
of Oaths particularly those who are at Police Stations, 
police officers have got two dates, probably it is the third if 
not the fourth. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    People do not check that portion of 
the affidavit.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, and yet they are certifying in terms 
of that, but he says as of that date, you were on 
suspension, namely, credit 22 February 2021, is that 
correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   Chair, just to give you again, a highlight 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 244 of 299 
 
of my - I said I was suspended for four issues.  The latest 
issue was the one of 2019, the 14 t h of October, where they 
found R30 100,00 in my vehicle.  I also said that I am told 
now to go fetch my money but as I am sitting here in front 
of you Chair, I am still on suspension for this particular 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So what he says in insofar as he says 
as on 22 February 2021 you were still on suspension in 
connection with - he says allegations of soliciting a bribe 
that you were on suspension at that time is correct 
10 
because you are still on suspension even now.  
And it is correct that that suspension is connected 
with the Police finding R30 000,00 in your car, in your 
possession.  But you say you have been on suspension for 
some time, but you have received a letter from the NPA, 
which, in effect, says you, you may now come and collect 
that money that they took from you. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is the position that they would say that 
if they are not going to charge you or could they say you 
20 
may come and take the money if they were going to charge 
you or do you not know? 
MR JOUBERT:   Chair, I think that the NPA would never 
give you your money back if they…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Are going to charge you. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 245 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:   If it was soliciting for a bribe of some sort. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but you have never been called to 
appear in court in connection with this money? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you have never been served with a 
charge, with a summons or anything like that? 
MR JOUBERT:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Were you asked to make a statement 
about how you came to be in possession of the money? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    And that was in 2019 or when? 
MR JOUBERT:   In 2019, the 14 t h October. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, and where did you say you got the 
R30 000,00 from?  What was your explanation for having 
the money in your possession of that amount? 
MR JOUBERT:   I would, I would say the following Chair, 
that - let me read the letter first, and then I will answer 
that question for you.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja, the bottom line, let me start this thing 
20 
was Director of Public Prosecutions Kwazulu Natal was 
written for attention, Captain VE Nwada[?] who is the 
Durban case, Durban North case 135 of 10/2019.   
“The

MR JOUBERT:   …mentioned as for being forwarded to the

CHAIRPERSON:    Hang on Mr Joubert you froze for some 
time, you will have to go back to the sentence that starts 
with something like consequently, I have…[intervene] 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Accordingly I declined. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh accordingly I declined to prosecute, 
start from there. 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja, okay: 
“Accordingly, I have declined to prosecute Mr 
Terence Joubert in connection with the receipt of

Page 247 of 299

Case, Durban North case 135 of 10/2019. 
“The Police docket here in has been forwarded to 
the National Office of the National Prosecuting 
Authority.” 
And signed by whoever that is. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So who is it signed by do you - what 
name appears at the bottom and the police rank that they 
10 
hold? 
MR JOUBERT:   I do not know who signed it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, is there a position that they hold 
that is specified? 
MR JOUBERT:   There is a person for inquiries is A 
Walters on top with a reference number and it is dated the 
10 t h of February 2021? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, but at the bottom there should be the 
position occupied by the author is it not – or does it simply 
say for the provincial director or something like that? 
20 
MR JOUBERT:   No, it says for the director public 
prosecution Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, no that is fine.  So they have the 
NPA has declined to prosecute? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes.  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 248 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Which may suggest that they were 
satisfied with your explanation or whatever the position is, 
they did not think that there was enough evidence to 
prosecute here. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright, Mr Hulley, you want to 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you, Mr Chair and what if you 
continue with his narrative and page 210.35.  He goes on 
to say that when you, he says that you were appointed by 
10 
the Commission.  Now you saying that is not correct.  You 
were appointed by the AFU to investigate State Capture 
matters in the Free State. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now, he says that when you were 
appointed, presumably by the AFU, then he gets that 
wrong, but you say it was the AFU.  He says that you did 
not mention that you were in fact on suspension for 
corruption cases. 
MR JOUBERT:   Because when I was appointed, I had no 
20 
corruption cases against me.  This R30 000,00 thing is 
something that happened on the 12 t h of October 2019 and I 
was subsequently suspended after this before this, I was 
working like everybody else.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Your association with the asset 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 249 of 299 
 
forfeiture unit, when did it start? 
MR JOUBERT:   It started in 2017, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    2017? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The asset forfeiture unit or is part of 
the NPA, is it not?  
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So when you go to the - when you went 
to the AFU did you need a specific appointment, or you 
were just asked to go and assist in the AFU, do you need a 
10 
specific appointment? 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja, no, I took a cross transfer, a transfer 
from where I was working risk management to Asset 
forfeiture…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now that was in 2017. 
MR 
JOUBERT: 
 
 
Because 
my 
qualifications 
is 
in 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And that was in 2017? 
MR JOUBERT:   So I could then assist in the investigations 
on that side. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   The State Capture came later on, whereby 
they formed the team to deal specifically with State 
Capture investigations.  
CHAIRPERSON:    When did your suspension in relation to 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 250 of 299 
 
- so your suspension in relation to the R30 000,00 would 
have happened in 2019 because that is when the Police 
found it, and you were already with the asset forfeiture unit 
by then. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, you were then suspended after that 
while you were within the asset forfeiture unit. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you remain suspended at the 
moment. 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And maybe the suspension will be lifted 
now that you have got this letter from the NPA declining to 
prosecute.  
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But that is your expectation. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So, is the position that when you were 
transferred to the asset forfeiture unit, you were not on 
suspension, and therefore, you did not have to tell the 
20 
asset forfeiture unit that you were on suspension? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It is taking long, much longer than I 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 251 of 299 
 
thought it would.  
ADV HULLEY SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let us try and wrap it up. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Thank you, Mr Chair.  What - can I 
perhaps in the interest of saving time, one of the things 
that he says in paragraph 27 of his - on page 210.36.  He 
says that in the ordinary course you ought to have reported 
to your immediate supervisor if an instance or if something 
that you along the lines of what you claim in fact happened – 
in other words the conversation between him and yourself.  If 
10 
it had in fact happened in the way that you allege then in the 
ordinary course you ought to have reported that to your 
direct supervisor.  Now who was your direct – firstly who was 
your direct supervisor at the time? 
MR JOUBERT:  At the time my direct supervisor was Mr 
Lucas Pieterse.  Something of this nature that involves the 
NDPP is sent to him and you obviously inform your 
immediate supervisor of what had happened so that they 
bear knowledge thereof and that is something I did.  I 
informed my immediate supervisor who was a Mr Lucas 
20 
Pieterse of the incident and that was that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now he says that you ought to have 
informed a Mr Ramana who would then be the person 
responsible for forwarding it to the National Director of 
Public Prosecutions.  Now who is Mr Ramana? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 252 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:  Mr Ramahana he is the head of security – of 
security and risk management but we work on protocols 
here.  I cannot skip my immediate supervisor and go to 
Ramahana without informing my immediate supervisor.  So it 
was 
the 
immediate 
supervisor’s 
duty 
to 
then 
inform 
Ramahana of what had happened not mine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now how did it come about that you 
ended up informing after you – oh sorry.  You say that you 
reported to your immediate supervisor Mr Pieterse and you 
also reported to Mr Duma – how did it come about that you 
10 
reported to Mr Duma? 
MR JOUBERT:  Mr Duma is the – the person that I knew in 
that – in the NDPP’s office.  Mr Duma is the person that I 
informed 
of 
the 
recording 
that 
I 
have 
made 
of 
my 
conversation with Colonel Mhlongo and that is why I – Mr 
Duma then requested that I bring him the recording and 
subsequently I obviously had to depose of an affidavit 
explaining the recording to him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No he says that… 
MR JOUBERT:  Which I did. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry – he says that your affidavit was in 
fact used before the commission of inquiry into the fitness of 
Advocate Jiba to – to practice as or to hold office within the 
NDPP that is the Mokgoro Commission of Inquiry.  Were you 
involved at all – did you testify before the Mokgoro 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 253 of 299 
 
Commission of Inquiry; did you provide an affidavit for the 
Mokgoro Commission on Inquiry, were you approached by 
any of the evidence leaders in that Mokgoro Commission of 
Inquiry? 
MR JOUBERT:  Mr Chair I – I was never involved with the 
Mokgoro Commission.  I was never – I never testified in the 
Mokgoro Commission.  Yes my affidavit was used in – at the 
Mokgoro Commission and I bear no knowledge as to how I 
would think that before anybody could utilise or use your 
affidavit they would inform you of the intentions to use this 
10 
which never happened.  That is why I did not know.  I had no 
dealing with the Mokgoro Commission. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you also subsequently had a 
discussion – sorry you had a discussion with a certain Queen 
Mhlongo, is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that discussion related to the – the 
recording of Mr – that you had made of your conversation 
with Colonel Mhlongo, is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Could you just tell us briefly who Ms 
Queen Mhlongo or Advocate Queen Mhlongo is? 
MR JOUBERT:  Ms Queen Mhlongo is – is a colleague who 
worked at AFU.  At the time she worked at the AFU she is 
now also back working at the AFU and we had this 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 254 of 299 
 
discussion that she had in fact recorded Mr Mhlongo or 
Colonel Mhlongo during a visit to his office and I shared with 
her that I did the same. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So when you had a conversation with 
her she mentioned that she had recorded a conversation that 
she had with Colonel Mhlongo and you mentioned to her that 
you had also done the same to him? 
MR JOUBERT:  Exactly.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you recall when that conversation 
between – in other words the conversation between you and 
10 
Ms Mhlongo took place? 
MR JOUBERT:  Ja it took place shortly after her meeting 
with Mr Mhlongo or should I say after – just shortly after she 
recorded Colonel Mhlongo. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And she has deposed to an affidavit 
which appears at page 325 of the bundle before you. 
MR JOUBERT:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And she says here that: 
“On Friday the 15t h that is paragraph 2 of 
that affidavit – she says on Friday the 15t h of 
20 
November of 2013 during the day I went to 
the third floor of the Southern Life building to 
see Colonel Welcome Sithembiso Mhlongo as 
I usually do.  We sat – we sat and we started 
talking about the appointment of Mxolisi 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 255 of 299 
 
Nxasana as the new National Director of 
Public Prosecutions and how happy I was as 
someone who is from Durban who happens to 
be a close person to me.  I thought he was 
going to share the same sentiments as he 
knows Mxolisi as well.  However he started 
saying that he hopes that Mxolisi can let 
Richard Ndluli off the hook as he was – he 
has been appointed to lead the intelligence – 
sorry to lead the intelligence unit in the KZN 
10 
if Ndluli is not charged – recharged.  He also 
mentioned 
that 
the 
right 
candidate 
was 
Nomgcobo Jiba.  I then thought that the 
conversation was becoming serious and I 
decided I would record him and started a sort 
of interview to find out his true feelings.” 
She says in paragraph 3: 
“He started telling me that Mxolisi Nxasana 
was not a kind man as I thought and that he 
knew this from interviewing his relatives.  At 
20 
the time I did not understand what was going 
on.  He continued by telling me – by telling 
that he knows Mxolisi Nxasana from a long 
time ago where they had an altercation about 
a client of Nxasana whom he – that is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 256 of 299 
 
Mhlongo – had arrested.  He then continued 
to tell me that Nxasana was – has many 
properties around Durban and he mentioned 
Ntzuma, Umlazi, Pinetown and Kloof amongst 
others.” 
She then goes on to – to say on the following page: 
“That amongst the people who heard the 
recording” 
That is at paragraph 5. 
“Amongst the people who heard the recording 
10 
was Terence 
Joubert 
who 
works in the 
security and risk department and he told me 
that he had recorded Colonel Mhlongo as 
well and I listened to his recording.” 
Now did you – did that in fact take place?  The interaction 
between yourself and Queen Mhlongo? 
MR JOUBERT:  That is correct Chair that definitely did take 
place. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And did you have an opportunity to listen 
to her recording? She listened to yours did you have an 
20 
opportunity to listen to hers? 
MR JOUBERT:  Yes – yes Chair I had an opportunity to 
listen to her recording. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you recall what was – what was 
captured on that recording? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 257 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:  I remember hearing the part of RAF on her 
recording the fact that they are looking for information on the 
RAF whatever Nxasana did at RAF that is what I can 
remember of her recording.  And the fact that Jiba was the 
best candidate for the job and not Nxasana.  Those were the 
two things that I remember from her recording. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then just in the interest of saving 
time if we can turn to page 306 of the same bundle.   
MR JOUBERT:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you will recall I have referred you to 
10 
this affidavit previously.  This is the affidavit which is dated 
the 1s t of February of 2016 if you turn to page 308 you will 
see there at the foot of the page the date stamp that has 
been provided by the Commissioner of Oaths.  
MR JOUBERT:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in this affidavit it appears that – and 
I say appears because the affidavit is not very specific but it 
appears that you distanced yourself from the affidavit of the 
25t h of November of 2013.  Now we know that this affidavit 
which is 1 February of 2016 was in fact deposed to by you.  
20 
You have confirmed that already. 
MR JOUBERT:  Yes Chair this affidavit here to be honest 
with you I deposed of this affidavit merely to distance myself 
from ever having given Willie of my affidavit because the 
first affidavit I stand by it.  I still stand by it but that is the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 258 of 299 
 
correct one.  When I was asked as to did you give Willie 
Hofmeyer an affidavit this was my response and hence the 
fact that I distanced myself from that because I never gave 
any affidavit to Willie Hofmeyer and I still stand by that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now when you say you did not… 
MR JOUBERT:  So –  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry.   
MR JOUBERT:  So the – the affidavit that I made was merely 
to distance myself from – remember what distant to paint the 
picture what had happened is that I gave this affidavit the 
10 
first one to Duma with the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja hang on, hang on. 
MR JOUBERT:  While I waited for the next… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Joubert. 
MR JOUBERT:  The next thing that should have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Joubert. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Hold on for a moment Mr Joubert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Joubert.  I do not want us to 
waste time.  It is late.  You did not distance yourself from 
giving the affidavit to Mr Hofmeyer as I read your affidavit 
20 
unless I have missed something.  You distanced yourself 
from the contents of the affidavit.  You were simply saying 
that is not me saying those things that are in that affidavit, is 
that not true? 
MR JOUBERT:  Ja, no, no.  That is why I tried to explain.  I 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 259 of 299 
 
am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no,no.  Let us get that right first. 
MR JOUBERT:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that you were not distancing 
yourself simply from saying – you were not distancing 
yourself from having given Mr Hofmeyer that affidavit you 
were distancing yourself from the affidavit itself saying 
whatever is said in that affidavit it is not you saying those 
things.  Is that – do you accept that? 
MR JOUBERT:  Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR JOUBERT:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the question is why did you say that? 
MR JOUBERT:  Do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you knew that the contents of that 
affidavit were your contents? 
MR JOUBERT:  Okay I was busy explaining to you Chair as 
to how – why I did what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can explain. 
MR JOUBERT:  I merely – I am merely a small fry in this – in 
20 
this whole incident and what happened is that I became 
aware that my affidavit was used to – for a fight between 
executives.  That is now your Jiba and Mrwebi and Nxasana 
and Hofmeyer.  This thing was all over the newspapers.  My 
name was all over the newspapers and I saw this as me 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 260 of 299 
 
being used as a pawn within the – a fight between two 
elephants.  At that point in time I said I did not give this 
affidavit.  That is it in a nutshell because 
1. As I am saying to you now I stand by my first affidavit.  
The second affidavit was requested by some journalist 
that phoned on numerous occasions about me making 
the first affidavit and to him I said no I have no 
knowledge of the first one because the first affidavit 
was sent to Advocate Duma and Nxasana via email on 
the 25t h of November 2013. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
MR JOUBERT:  No one else should have gotten a copy of 
that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So am I right to… 
MR JOUBERT:  The people that should have – that should 
have called me were the people that were supposed to 
investigate the matter which is the IMU in the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me stop you there Mr Joubert.  Am I 
right to say you accept that it was factually not true and not 
correct for you to distance yourself from the contents of that 
20 
affidavit – the first affidavit?  Am I correct to say you accept 
that? 
MR JOUBERT:  Yes I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that it was not right to distance 
yourself? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 261 of 299 
 
MR JOUBERT:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that the explanation you are giving for 
doing that is that you are saying that you understood that 
your first affidavit was at the centre of what you considered 
to be a fight between some executives within the NPA. 
MR JOUBERT:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as you sit here you are able to take 
responsibility and say you should not have distanced 
yourself from that affidavit.  Is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  As a final question would it be fair then 
to say having regard to what you have testified to thus far 
would it be fair to say that the content of the second affidavit 
that is the affidavit of 1 February 2016 that the content of 
that affidavit is incorrect? 
MR JOUBERT:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And this affidavit the one of 1 February 
2016 to whom was that affidavit given? 
MR JOUBERT:  At this point in time Chair because I do not 
20 
have access to my emails I requested assistance from the 
Labour Advocate Chando when she refused me because now 
I cannot for the life of me remember who did I send this thing 
to.  I could only do that if I have access to my email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not send it to the journalist that 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 262 of 299 
 
you said had called enquiring whether you had deposed to 
the first affidavit?  Shall I repeat that? 
MR JOUBERT:  Just repeat that 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not send it to the journalist that 
you said called – called you to find out whether you had 
deposed to the first affidavit? 
MR JOUBERT:  I said that but in hindsight I remember – I 
cannot recall as to who I sent it to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR JOUBERT:  That was my – my response. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So are you saying you cannot recall 
whether you sent it to the journalist or you cannot recall the 
name of the person – the name of the journalist that you sent 
it to? 
MR JOUBERT:  I cannot recall who I sent it to meaning that I 
doubt whether I would ever send an affidavit to a journalist 
under any circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JOUBERT:  Because that would be asking for trouble.  
20 
But with all due respect to this – to this commission because 
of the fact that I do not know who I sent it to I am not in a 
position to verify because of the fact that I was told in no 
uncertain terms no I cannot so I will not be able to answer 
that one 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 263 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair I have got no further 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Joubert for 
availing yourself to us as the commission.  I will now release 
you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He would not be coming back for anything 
or would he at some stage?  There is nothing else that he 
was to testify about? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I do not believe there is any further 
evidence that he needs to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  You are now excused Mr 
Joubert.  Thank you very much. 
MR JOUBERT:  Thank you, thank you Chair.  Thank you Mr 
Hulley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Counsel for Colonel Mhlongo are you still 
there? 
20 
ADV MANALA:   Yes good evening Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes good evening again.  Is Colonel 
Mhlongo ready to give evidence? 
ADV MANALA:   I understand so yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Mhlongo can you hear me? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 264 of 299 
 
COL MHLONGO:  Yes Chair I can – good evening to you I 
can hear you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh good evening Colonel.  Thank you for – 
thank you for availing yourself to give evidence and to assist 
the commission. 
COL MHLONGO:  Thank you very much Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  The Registrar will administer 
the oath or affirmation to you and Mr Hulley will then lead 
your evidence and question you on your evidence.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Perhaps before we start that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I understand that Colonel Mhlongo has 
requested to testify through an interpreter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Once the 00:22:26 has been made 
available so perhaps … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is the interpreter? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I understand that he is in fact present. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has the necessary documentation been 
prepared? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am told that it has been prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I see it?  Can I see it?  And his CV 
and qualifications is everything there? 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 265 of 299 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I understand that it is all there.  I have 
only just been given it myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Nzotho come forward it does appear 
from the documents that you have given me that you have 
magistrates who say that you are proficient in the English 
and Isi-Zulu language and that you have satisfied them with 
your knowledge and proficiency in the two languages when 
you have interpreted in the cases in which they have 
presided.  Maybe – maybe you could sit that side if there is a 
microphone that works from that side so he can see the 
10 
witness because the witness will not appear there is it not?  
Or will he – will he appear there as well?  He will appear 
there – it is better here.  Okay no that is fine then.  Has he 
got these documents or the ones I have are the ones he 
should have?  Okay Registrar give him this – sanitise before 
you give it to him.  I think what you have prepared here 
today in terms of something to be signed by me is not the 
same thing that I have done before.  At least that is not my 
recollection.   
Okay have you sanitised it and given it to him?  Ja, well I 
20 
don’t know what they say but I have no recollection of this 
one.   Mr Mzombe(sic), write your full names where you are 
supposed to write them on the oath in front of you.  Just 
write.  Have you written your names? 
INTERPRETER:   [No audible reply]  
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 266 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not sign yet.  Take the oath first.  
Okay.  Will you read the oath aloud including your names? 
INTERPRETER:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Put on your mic. 
INTERPRETER:   I, the undersigned, Kulelane Dumelake 
Nzotho, hereby states under oath: 
1. I am proficient with English and isiZulu and 
am able to interpret and translate from English 
to isiZulu and vice versa. 
2. The code to translate or interpret from 
10 
isiZulu to English or form English to isiZulu. 
3. In 
proceedings 
of 
this 
Commission, 
I 
undertake to do so honestly and to the best of 
my knowledge and ability. 
 
So help me God. 
KULELANE DUMELAKE NZOTHO:  (d.s.s.)  (Interpreter) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you and then you may sign now. 
INTERPRETER:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And then that, you taking the oath 
goes into the record and the document here is signed, will 
20 
need to be taken and filed.  But tomorrow, Reverend 
Stimela, will you show me one that I have signed before 
because this looks unusual to me but if I see one that I 
have signed before then maybe I will sign it.  Okay.  You 
may be seated Mr Mzombe(sic). 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 267 of 299 
 
INTERPRETER:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Nzotho or Mzombe? 
INTERPRETER:   Nzotho. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nzotho? 
INTERPRETER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not related to the Mzombe’s, 
hey? 
INTERPRETER:   I am not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
INTERPRETER:   Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Of course, 
when 
there 
is 
the 
intervention 
of 
the 
interpreter, 
proceedings take longer than when there is no interpreter 
but let us try.  The interpreter has been sworn in now, 
Colonel Mhlongo.  So we will start.   
 
Mr Hulley, you can start leading your evidence 
and questioning him.  And I think Mr Hulley, as you do so, 
it is important to confirm with him right up front that he 
does not dispute what was recorded, if that is the case, 
because that is how I understand his affidavit because that 
20 
may affect a number of things.  But if there is anything he 
disputes, then he can specify. Okay.  So that might just 
help as we go along. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  We are speaking, 
of course, specifically about the recording. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 268 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The transcript of the recording. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Ja.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So I am saying.  It will be important, 
quite early, you do not have to start with it ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But quite early to get to that point 
because how much of the – of what he said to have been 
recorded he disputes, may be important.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Before we 
commence Mr Chair.  I am not sure if Colonel Mhlongo has 
10 
been sworn in yet.  I think I interrupted that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  You did, actually.  Let us...  
Thank you for reminding me.  The...  I think what – you will 
leave time for the interpreter to interpret whatever you say 
to the witness in terms of the oath.  Okay? 
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Go ahead. 
REGISTRAR:   Colonel Mhlongo, will you be taking the oath 
or affirmation? 
COL MHLONGO:   I will take the oath. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   My names are Welcome Sthembiso Mhlungo. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   I have no objection. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 269 of 299 
 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
WITNESS:   I do. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God.  
WELCOME STHEMBISO MHLUNGO:  (d.s.s.) (through 
interpreter) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to say Mr Nzotho that I have 
heard interpreters here and it did not take for me to be 
dissatisfied with their interpretation.  You are still to 
interpret further, but form the little that I have heard, you 
give me confidence that you know what you are doing. 
INTERPRETER:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
INTERPRETER:   I am quite humbled. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Please proceed Mr Hulley. 
EXAMINATION BY ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  
Colonel Mhlongo and for the benefit of the Chairperson, 
you ought to have a bundle which is marked LEA Bundle 
10.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 270 of 299 
 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct.  I do have it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now if you would not mind just turning 
with me to page 210.27.  Now just to assist you.  There are 
two sets of numbering systems on the documents.  There is 
one that is in red which is in the top right-hand corner and 
there is one which is in black which is in the top left-hand 
corner.  I want you to focus on the one which is in black at 
the top left-hand corner.   
COL MHLONGO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now if you could turn to me to page 
10 
210.27 in the top left-hand corner. 
COL MHLONGO:   I found it Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  And if you can keep 
...[intervenes]  
COL MHLONGO:   Is it the one between LEA and 210 and 
then there is a four?  Is that the one you are talking about? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   There is LEA 10-210.27.   
COL MHLONGO:   Is it a document with the recording that 
was made by Joubert? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, that is ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me assist him.  Colonel Mhlongo? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The lever arch file you have got, on the 
spine, is it written Bundle LEA-10? 
MR MHLONGO:   That is correct Chair. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 271 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Then what you need to do 
is.  Go to page 210 using the black numbers on the left – 
top left-hand corner.  Page 210 is the last page of a letter 
written by the acting Secretary of the Commission at the 
time, Ms K B Shabala.   
MR MHLONGO:   I apologise for delaying you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now, now that you have 
found page 210 ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Chair, sorry, if I could just interrupt 
you? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I have been asked to request 
Colonel Mhlongo to position himself in such a way that 
when he looks at the document he is, his face is not – does 
not go off the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
COL MHLONGO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now if you go to the next 
page, the page that comes after page 210, you will see 
20 
that that page is written 210.1.  Can you see that? 
MR MHLONGO:   Yes, I see that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now you must count and go to 
page 210.27.  And that page, namely 210.27, is the first 
page of your affidavit.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 272 of 299 
 
MR MHLONGO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to find it? 
MR MHLONGO:   I find the one that says 210.25.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Go two pages further.   
MR MHLONGO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the next page after page 
210.25? 
MR MHLONGO:   It is then 210.26. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then the next page is page 
210.27, is it not so? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Have you got ...[intervenes]  
MR MHLONGO:   ...Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Have you got a red number on 
the right-hand page at the top of the next page? 
MR MHLONGO:   [Speaker vernacular – no interpretation] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think there is a problem. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I can see what the problem is.  I think 
that his file probably has not been updated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Because 
his 
affidavit 
- 
20 
Colonel Mhlongo’s 
affidavit, 
obviously, 
it 
came 
in 
afterwards ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...since the bundle was originally sent 
to him.  There was an additional – some additional 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 273 of 299 
 
documents that were sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I assumed that he had that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But it seems that he does not have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would it be a matter of slotting in 
his affidavit in the right place and paginating it or would it 
involve more than that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It ought to be a simple matter of just 
slotting it in because there are 13-pages to his affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Have you got your latest 
affidavit in your possession? 
MR MHLONGO:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  That affidavit, the first 
page of that affidavit is supposed to be page 210.27.  You 
understand?   
MR MHLONGO:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What we are going to do.  We are going 
to – we are not going to use the page numbers or if we do 
use page numbers in regard to your affidavit, ignore the 
20 
page numbers when we mention page numbers but we will 
focus on the paragraph numbers of your affidavit when we 
refer to what you say in your affidavit. 
MR MHLONGO:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 274 of 299 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  What I will do for 
the benefit of our record Mr Chair is.  I will read our 
numbering into the record but I will advise Colonel Mhlongo 
on which page of his document it is. 
COL MHLONGO:   No, that is fine.  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Colonel Mhlongo, 
if you could keep that page open.  In other words, the first 
page of that affidavit and then turn with me to the last 
page.  For you, it will appear at the bottom right hand 
corner which will be page 13 of 13.  For the purpose of the 
10 
record, it will be page 210.39 Mr Chair. 
COL MHLONGO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   The signature at the top of that page, 
is that your signature sir? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, that is my signature. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you deposed to this before a 
commissioner of oaths according to the date stamp which 
says the 2 n d of February 2021.  Is that correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you.  And then if you look at the 
20 
certificate that has been provided by the commissioner of 
oaths.  It says there that it was: 
“This affidavit was signed and sworn to before 
me at...” 
 
And I cannot make out where it has been sworn 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 275 of 299 
 
to, on the 22 n d day of February.  It says 2020.  That is, in 
fact, incorrect.  It should be 2021.  Is that right? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, that is correct.  That is an error.  I 
confirm that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you confirm that this is the 
affidavit that you have provided to the Commission – to 
this Commission relating to your testimony regarding 
Mr Joubert’s affidavit.  Is that correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now before we get into the – into the 
10 
content of your affidavit and I will take you through that 
shortly.  As you know, a very material part of – a dispute 
between yourself and Mr Joubert relates to a conversation 
that the two of you have had. 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And that conversation was in fact 
recorded by Mr Joubert or at least a portion of the 
conversation was recorded by Mr Joubert.  And you have – 
you 
have 
been 
provided 
with 
the 
transcript 
of 
that 
recording.  Is that correct? 
20 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now if you would turn with me to page 
243 of the same bundle of documents that you have. 
COL MHLONGO:   243 on black or 243 in red? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Black.  We are only going to be 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 276 of 299 
 
speaking about the black.   
COL MHLONGO:   Chair, if I may ask because I do not 
seem to understand these documents that are in front of 
me.  Perhaps if you can indicate what that page relates to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, I think we might have to 
attend to making sure that he has exactly the same 
pagination and documents as everybody because I thought 
maybe insofar as it might be his affidavit only that was not 
properly paginated, we would be able to make do without 
him having to do that.  But if there are other documents 
10 
that would be referred to and he does not have the same 
pagination, we are going to have a problem. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   ...Chair but that ought not to be the 
case in relation to this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   There is potentially one other 
document that he might have a problem with but this 
document is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should not be a problem? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   This document, he should have had 
20 
three weeks ago when he first came to – when he was first 
available to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, tell...  Okay just tell him what it is 
and then see whether he has got the pagination or not.  
But if he does not have the pagination but the document 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 277 of 299 
 
has paragraphs then that will help.  But if he does not have 
paragraphs, then we will have... 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We might have a problem. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Colonel Mhlongo, this is the document 
which is a transcript of the recording of the conversation 
between yourself and Mr Joubert.  It should appear at page 
243 in the top left-hand corner.   
COL MHLONGO:   Chair, according to the documents 
before me, a document containing the transcripts of the 
10 
conversation between Mr Joubert and myself appears on 
page that is written LEA-10.135.    
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the page of the recording or the 
transcript of the recording that you have written video 
recording VN-2013/11/25? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  It looks like you have a 
pagination 
that 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
our 
respective 
paginations but you have the same document.  It will be 
20 
possible, I think Mr Hulley, to refer – to use the page 
numbers at the bottom of the particular document.  And for 
our purposes you can mention again the paginated page 
number. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 278 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the page number of the document as 
well and then you can always refer to the marginal 
numbers. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The Y numbers? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, can be 
able of assistance, actually, what Colonel Mhlongo is 
referring to is the identical document.  It is just an 
annexure to his bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am happy to refer to that document if 
that is what he has got.  For your benefit, Chair, it is page 
133 of the bundle that is in front of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   133? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay if we can use the one and the 
same document then we can do that.  Then that is going to 
be easier.  Okay alright.  So let us use that one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Before we do so.  Reverend 
20 
Stimela, we are at about quarter to eight.  IN terms of 
staff, are there people who might have transport problems 
if we go on to half-past eight? 
REV STIMELA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 279 of 299 
 
REV STIMELA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Hulley, 
before we start.  Let us take a short adjournment. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We are just going to adjourn for five to 
seven minutes and then we are going to adjourn.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
10 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Colonel Mhlongo, 
we were looking at page 133 of the bundle of documents.  
Now it does indeed start LEA10 in the top left hand corner, 
but for our purposes you can ignore the LEA10, I am just 
going to refer to the number that appears alongside that 
but in this case it is 133.  Those are your page numbers. 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please put on your mic, Mr Interpreter, 
put on your mic. 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, that is correct.  Thank you. 
20 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now from page 133 to 139 that is a 
transcript of that purports to be a transcript of the 
recording of a conversation or part of a conversation that 
took place between you and Mr Joubert.   
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 280 of 299 
 
MR HULLEY SC:   And you have in fact seen this document 
previously, is that correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, Chair, I have seen it. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And you have had an opportunity to 
consider the contents of this document, is that correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And would it be correct to say that – 
well, let me ask you, do you agree that this document 
accurately records or captures the conversation that took 
place between yourself and Mr Joubert? 
10 
COL MHLONGO:   I can confirm, Chair, although it has 
been quite some time since the conversation took place but 
I still remember portions of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to be fair to you, Colonel Mhlongo, 
there are spaces in the transcript that reflect that the 
person who typed or transcribed the conversation did not 
hear what was being said and wrote indistinct and so on 
but I think the question was meant to say to you in essence 
you accept that it captures important parts of your 
conversation with Mr Joubert. 
20 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Colonel Mhlongo.  Now I am 
going to deal with the background to the matter before we 
get into the conversations and so forth and I just want to 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 281 of 299 
 
get some information relating to your own background and 
how you became involved in this affair that we now have to 
lead evidence on.  If I understand from the affidavit that 
you have deposed to, you are currently a colonel in the 
Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation or what is 
commonly referred to as the Hawks, is that correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And the DPCI is the successor to the 
Directorate for Special Operations which is the DSO, is 
that correct? 
10 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And you had been employed within the 
DSO in 2004, is that right? 
COL MHLONGO:   Even though I do not remember the 
exact date but we were amongst the first to be employed 
by the DSO, it could have been around 2001. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure, Mr Hulley, will I need to 
go back, that far back his…? 
MR HULLEY SC:   It is not really relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR HULLEY SC:   I think it is relevant to Colonel 
Mhlongo’s urgent – of how we came to know Mr Joubert. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, is the fact not that there should be 
no dispute about how they came to know each other? 
MR HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 282 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of if there is, it should not matter to us. 
MR HULLEY SC:   There is not really much of a dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, I think you need to come closer 
to the day of the recording particularly because it does not 
dispute the correctness of the transcript and that is what 
this whole – is and Mr Joubert is really about. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Before we get into the transcript, now if 
I understand from your affidavit correctly, you testified – or 
10 
you have deposed to an affidavit in which you say that the 
two of you, that is you and Mr Joubert, were quite close, 
you were the first person to welcome him when he came to 
Kwazulu-Natal in 2004 and after that the two of you had a 
very close relationship. 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair, and I can explain 
how it all unfolded. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Well, for present purposes we do not 
need to get into that unless it becomes necessary at a 
later stage but your understanding or your appreciation of 
20 
the relationship that you had was that the two of you were 
close friends. 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair, we were close 
friends and when he came in some of the duties that he 
had to do are works that had previously been done by 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 283 of 299 
 
myself in the province of Kwazulu-Natal. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now if I understand correctly, the 
friendship persisted or continued until approximately the 
25 November or the 26 November 2013 shortly after you 
became aware of an affidavit or a statement that he had 
deposed to and made available to Mr Nxasana, is that 
correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   If you may repeat? 
MR HULLEY SC:   Do I understand correctly that the two of 
you, that is yourself and Mr Joubert had been close friends 
10 
until approximately the 25 of 26 November 2013? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair, our friendship 
continued and we remained close until I learnt that he had 
gone to or he had communicated to Mr Nxasana’s office 
that I was investigating Mr Nxasana.  It was from that 
stage that I started to have my reservations about him. 
MR HULLEY SC:   And how did you find out about the fact 
that he has gone to Mr Nxasana’s office to complain to him 
that you had been investigating Mr Nxasana? 
COL MHLONGO:  I was informed, Chair, by the lady that I 
20 
worked with, was from the NPA, I worked with in the office, 
who informed me that I had to vacate the offices, that an 
instruction has been given that I should leave the offices 
because information had come to the fore that I was 
investigating Mr Nxasana and she further informed me that 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 284 of 299 
 
on inquiring as to where did that information come from, 
that she then informed me that it was made to understand 
that it came from Terrence Joubert. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley, may I suggest that you 
question Colonel Mhlongo on the main features of their 
conversation as reflected in the transcript.  The reason 
why I would like you to do that because if indeed the 
position is, as I understand it, that there is nothing of any 
importance that differs from Mr Joubert’s version that 
Colonel Mhlongo advances it may well be that all these 
10 
things about whether they were friends or stopped to be 
friends, whether one is generally unreliable, they may be 
neither here nor there if there is no dispute between them 
of 
any 
significance 
on 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
conversation and there might be no need to really take too 
much time about all of those issues about who is telling the 
truth about this or that. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If what we are talking about there is no 
material dispute.  So far Colonel Mhlongo has said the 
20 
transcript correctly reflects the substance or gist of what 
they discussed.  So I think what may be important is to 
highlight certain features. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And question him on some of the issues 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 285 of 299 
 
that are important. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now if we can 
consider the transcript that I have referred you to a 
moment ago, Colonel Mhlongo, if you would turn with me to 
page 135.  Do you have it? 
COL MHLONGO:   I do. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now if you look in the left hand column 
you will see that there is a line numbering system, you will 
see the number 5, the number 10, the number 15 and the 
number 20, right at the bottom you will see a number 25, 
10 
do you see that? 
COL MHLONGO:   I do, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now at line 16, this is Mr Terrence 
Joubert speaking, he says: 
“Our thing here with the boss, these guys from RAF 
tomorrow morning, all I am going to do, I will link 
you up with them so that you can get all the 
documentation.  The thing that I do not want is not 
– I am just bringing A to B. 
Do you see that, sir? 
20 
COL MHLONGO:   I am just trying to find it, Chair, because 
the number is 5, L15, 20 and 25. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me explain it to you, Colonel 
Mhlongo. Where it says 5, can you see that? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 286 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you count upwards, the next line will 
be line 4.  If you count upwards, the next line will be line 
3, the next line will be line 2.  The first line will be line 1, 
but it is not written 1 next to it.  So when you count also 
from where it says 5, that 5 means that is line 5 on the 
page.  So if you go to the next line counting downwards, 
the next line will be line 6, the next one would be line 7 but 
it is not written, the next one will be line 8, the next one 
will be line 9, the next one it is line 10 and then it is 
written 10, so that is how it works.  So if you are referring 
10 
to line 7, you count from 5 two lines, then you are on line 
7.  If you are referred to line 12, you look at line 10 and 
count two lines, then you are on line 12.  That is how it 
works. 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, I understand, we were on page 35, 
right? 
MR HULLEY SC:   That is correct.  Now if you look at line 
15. 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes. 
MR HULLEY SC:   The 15 in the left column. 
20 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, I see it. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now that sentence begins: 
“No, I mean the whole – our whole point here is the 
collection – sorry, it is one collection, no, no, no.” 
And then the important part that I want you to look at is: 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 287 of 299 
 
“Our thing here comes here with the boss, these 
guys from RAF tomorrow morning, all I am going to 
do, I will link you up with them so that you can get 
all the documentation.  The thing that I do not want 
is not – I am just bringing A to B.” 
Do you see that sentence? 
COL MHLONGO:   I see that, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now this is Mr Terrence Joubert 
speaking and he is speaking to you, is that correct? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct. 
10 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now you in your response at line 19 you 
say yes. 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now when he speaks about our thing 
here with the boss, what was he in fact referring to? 
COL MHLONGO:   I would like to start by saying that this 
conversation, yes, it did happen but there is a portion that 
he did not record, that portion would indicate where this 
whole conversation originated from. 
MR HULLEY SC:   In other words, a portion that preceded 
20 
a point at which the recording commenced? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct, Chair. 
MR HULLEY SC:   So a portion that occurred during this 
very same conversation, not on a conversation on a 
previous day. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 288 of 299 
 
COL MHLONGO:   I am referring – Chair, I am referring to 
a conversation that took place the previous day on the 
recorded transcribed conversation, it is when he came the 
following day in the morning.  On reading this conversation 
it becomes apparent that there is a conversation that 
preceded this one. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Then you say that there was a 
conversation that preceded this one?  Are you saying that 
there was conversation that preceded this conversation?  
In other words, that took place either at an earlier time in 
10 
the day or on a previous day or are you saying that this 
recording is incomplete in respect of a conversation that 
took place on this day? 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes, that is correct.  Chairperson, when 
we heard the recorded and transcribed conversation it was 
a continuation of a conversation that had taken place the 
previous day.  So when he came and we had this recorded 
conversation it was a continuation of things he had spoken 
to me about the previous day. 
MR HULLEY SC:   Now you wanted to explain what had 
20 
happened on the preceding day. 
COL MHLONGO:   Thank you, Chairperson, thank you for 
the opportunity.  When Mr Joubert came to me, he came to 
me quite upset and said – and then he said and I quote, 
said to me, my friend, you know, that on a number of 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 289 of 299 
 
occasions I have been suspended and there has been 
cases against me, now I am deeply worried that this newly 
appointed man, Mr Nxasana, now wants to revive or 
resuscitate all those cases against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you also say Colonel that he said to 
you he had been suspended on a number of occasions and 
dismissed when you were speaking a few minutes? 
COL MHLONGO:   Chair it is just that we were told to just 
go into the transcripts so I thought I would give the 
background of where this all started, because it did not 
10 
record this location when he came to me, he only recorded 
the portion that is now transcribed, so I wanted to give the 
Commission a background of what had happened before 
this conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you misunderstood my question.  
About three minutes ago you were telling me what Mr 
Joubert said to you about Mr Nxasana, do you remember 
that?  When you spoke about him being suspended on a 
number of occasions, do you remember telling me that a 
few minutes ago? 
20 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My question is whether when you were 
saying that a few minutes ago you also said he said he had 
been suspended on a number of occasions and dismissed, 
so the question is whether you also included that he said 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 290 of 299 
 
he had been dismissed. 
COL MHLONGO:   Chair perhaps it is a choice of words 
that I have opted for, I did not mean dismissed as in the 
strict sense of the word, I meant she was suspended, in 
other words caused to refrain from his usual duties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you confirm that you did use – you 
did say he said he had been suspended on a number of 
occasions and dismissed? 
COL MHLONGO:   I confirm that I did use the word 
perhaps by mistake. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine, I just wanted to 
clarify that because your interpretation Mr Interpreter did 
not include that word. 
 
Alright, Mr Hulley 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now Colonel Mhlongo you were telling 
us about what would have happened on the day preceding 
the day on which you had the conversation that is recorded 
and transcribed, so we are talking now about on your 
version a conversation that took place on the 24 t h of 
November of 2013, is that correct?  
20 
COL MHLONGO:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV  HULLEY SC:   Now in this conversation you say that 
he had come to you and he had mentioned that as you 
know, which presumably he is saying you, Colonel Mhlongo 
know, I have been suspended on several occasions, you 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 291 of 299 
 
used the word also dismissed but for present purposes that 
is not relevant, he mentioned you know I have been 
suspended on a number of occasions and I am deeply 
concerned about the new National Director of Public 
Prosecutions, do I understand that part right? 
COL MHLONGO:   That is correct you had understood that 
well and then he continue, he then told me that he was 
concerned about the new NDPP in that he wanted to 
resuscitate those cases concerning to himself that being 
mentioned there and he also indicated that what also 
10 
bothered him is that he – that is Mr Joubert had 
information at his disposal concerning some cases that the 
newly appointed NDPP then had had in the past and then 
he said to me since I am a police officer I do have at my 
disposal the sources and the ability to commence inquiry 
into those cases that the newly appointed NDPP has had 
with the singular intention of discrediting or exposing the 
dirt on the newly appointed NDPP. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now when he spoke about the fact 
that he was concerned that the new National Director of 
20 
Public Prosecutions may resuscitate the cases against him, 
was he saying that the National Director or that somebody 
had said that to him that the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions intended to resuscitate the cases against 
him, or was he saying that the National Director of Public 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 292 of 299 
 
Prosecutions had told him that, or was he saying that – a 
third option – that he had just surmised that this is what 
was going on? 
COL MHLONGO:   He indicated Chair that he was 
definitely sure that Mr Nxasana was going to reopen those 
cases, resuscitate them as it were, and he had indicated 
that he has heard from people from the National Office in 
Pretoria that that is what Mr Nxasana was going to do. 
ADV  HULLEY SC:   Now what happened after that, so he 
mentioned to you that it was the intention – from the 
10 
information that he had it was the intention of Mr Nxasana 
to resuscitate the cases and he mentioned also that he had 
found – that he had found certain information or dirt on Mr 
Nxasana that he wanted you as a police officer to 
investigate. 
COL MHLONGO:   Chair he indicated to me that since he 
was working in the Risk and Security Unit they are the one 
that – the ones that were responsible for vetting of people 
prior to their appointment and that he had indicated to me 
further that he had gathered information in the capacity of 
20 
being in the risk and security to that.  There was a case of 
murder against the National Director of Public Prosecutions 
that he, the NDPP, had not disclosed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    And anything more relating to that 
conversation that took place on the 24 t h of March, ag, the 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 293 of 299 
 
24 t h of November that is relevant to the recording that you 
wanted to tell us about.    
COL MHLONGO:   Yes Chairperson he further indicated to 
me that Mr Nxasana whilst practicing as an attorney he had 
dealt with the Road Accident Fund claims and that there 
were occasions whereby when those claims were paid out 
by the Road Accident Fund and there were instances 
whereby Mr Nxasana did not pass those claims to his 
clients, the recipient of those claims, and then he indicated 
to me further that he had people that he had spoken to who 
10 
were going to be able to assist me in that regard and 
people would then be able to even identify those clients 
whose funds embezzled. 
ADV  HULLEY SC:   And was there anything else that took 
place, or anything else that is said in the course of that 
conversation that is relevant to the events of the 25 t h of 
November? 
COL MHLONGO:  Chair he was over and above this whole 
conversation 
insisting 
that 
I 
should 
move 
quickly 
in 
initiating this process before Mr Nxasana commences with 
20 
investigating him and thereby suspending him and to quote 
his exact words he was saying I must work or move sharp-
sharp.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this all took place of course on the 
24 t h of November?    
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 294 of 299 
 
COL MHLONGO:  Yes Chair I believe that the date, even 
though I cannot say with utmost certainty it is quite some 
time that has since lapsed.  
ADV  HULLEY SC:   Now you were going to deal with the 
content of the transcript, but before we deal with the 
content of the transcript is there anything else in respect 
of that previous conversation, in other words the one of the 
24 t h of November, that is relevant to explain what you want 
to explain in respect of the transfer of the 25 t h of 
November? 
10 
COL MHLONGO:   As I have indicated Chair that quite 
some time has lapsed since this incident occurred but 
perhaps as we go through the transcripts perhaps other 
things will then come back to me. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now I had asked you where he says, 
going back to page 135, when Mr Joubert says our thing 
here with the boss, this is line 16, what is “the thing with 
the boss” that he is referring to? 
COL MHLONGO:   He was referring to the thing that he 
had told me the previous day that there is someone that he 
20 
knows from RAF. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley I am not sure whether we 
should 
go 
into 
the 
transcript 
because 
of 
the 
time.   
Obviously it is taking longer than we thought it would – 
part of it must be because there is an interpreter, who is 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 295 of 299 
 
necessary in order to make sure that Colonel Mhlongo 
understands everything. 
 
I think that we must adjourn and arrange a date 
when we will then go into the transcript.  But I think – I 
have just been looking at the transcript again it may be 
that what may be necessary is to let Colonel Mhlongo tell 
his side of the story on what happened, insofar as he might 
not have completed doing so, as he had, and then put Mr 
Joubert’s version as contained in his affidavit rather than 
the transcript, because the indistinct and inaudible and the 
10 
gaps in the transcript might make it difficult but if we – 
Colonel Mhlongo has given us his full version and you have 
been able to put Mr Joubert’s version to him and he has 
dealt with that then when we go to the transcript we would 
be doing so with an understanding of the versions as we 
see them in the affidavits. 
 
If the transcript entail so many gaps it might have 
been easier the way I thought we would do it, so I am sorry 
that I may have taken you astray by suggesting what I 
thought would be a shortcut but I realise I think there are 
20 
too many gaps, because as I under Colonel Mhlongo’s 
version it is suggested that the person who wanted Mr 
Nxasana, who wanted investigations to be done into Mr 
Nxasana 
was 
Mr 
Joubert 
and 
not 
him, 
whereas 
Mr 
Joubert’s version is that Colonel Mhlongo told him that he 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 296 of 299 
 
was investigating in effect Mr Nxasana, he wanted to find 
dirt on him having been asked I think by Mr Joubert. 
 
So when you go into the transcript you might find a 
line that might indicate what was said, but you might find 
that it says well we were talking about this because this is 
what he had said before, which we can’t see because the 
transcript is not complete. 
 
So I am thinking that that might be better.  What do 
you think? 
ADV  HULLEY SC:    No, no I think there is merit in 
10 
dealing with the allegations that Mr – Colonel Mhlongo has 
given.  I am familiar with his affidavit, so I know what his 
version is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And I would imagine that he has 
listened to the testimony of Mr Joubert, so I understand 
where the areas of dispute are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I wanted to deal with previously 
was to get into the context because I understood that this 
20 
recording captures a portion of the conversation but not 
the entire conversation, and I want to get the context in 
which – whatever preceded it, whether it was preceded by 
– on the same day or be it on the previous day, whether 
that – what was that context that they had discussed. 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 297 of 299 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   I think perhaps we should get – 
because I understand what the version is and maybe when 
we reconvene we can actually get into that context again, 
because we understand where the areas of dispute are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay let me talk to Colonel 
Mhlongo’s counsel.  Can you hear me? 
ADV MANALA:   Yes we can hear you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am thinking that we should 
adjourn at this stage, it is taking longer than I may have 
10 
thought but maybe it is because we have to make room for 
the interpreter and that is fine, because that is important. 
 
So I am thinking that we should adjourn, maybe not 
to a specific date now because I am not sure what date I 
will give you, but another date be arranged soon, when we 
can continue and finish.  Is that fine with you? 
ADV MANALA:   Yes Chair we have no difficulty with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, we will adjourn and 
the – if we choose a date that is close then the legal team 
will discuss with you about your availability but if we 
20 
choose a date that we think gives you reasonable notice 
then we will just fix that date, probably it would be 
evening, but it might – ja probably it would be evening, and 
then we continue. 
ADV MANALA:   Yes but Chair you would have noted thus 
02 MARCH 2021 – DAY 353 
 
Page 298 of 299 
 
far that we have no difficult with doing the sessions, 
particularly where we also have been permitted to appear 
remotely, it makes it very easy in terms of planning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that is fine.  We would 
continue with the same arrangement next time. 
 
Okay alright then Mr Interpreter I assume that the 
legal team for Colonel Mhlongo will contact you once a 
date is known so you could make yourself available. 
Yes, no, no that is fine.  We would continue with the same 
arrangement next time. 
10 
 
Okay alright then Mr Interpreter I assume that the 
legal team for Colonel Mhlongo will contact you once a 
date is known so you could make yourself available. 
INTERPRETER:  Very well Chair, I will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow I will continue with Eskom related evidence.   
ADV HULLEY SC:    Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you to everybody for staying 
until this time so that we could continue with – or hear 
Colonel Mhlongo’s evidence. 
20 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 3 MARCH 2021
