PROCEEDINGS ON 27 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair we are ready to proceed.  Chair 
you will recall that earlier this year Mr Dukwana appeared before this 
commission; he adduced evidence; supplied this commission with 
documents and he also promised Mr Chair that he will be returning to 
this commission to submit further statement and to adduce further 
evidence before this commission.  Mr Dukwana as promised Mr Chair 
10 
he has now returned before this commission.  However Chair before 
leading his evidence permit us to deal with a number of preliminary 
issues in order to place this proceedings in their context.  Firstly let us 
do that by dealing with the documents which must be before you.  We 
have placed a file before you Chair.  You would recall that during the 
first appearance of Mr Dukwana reference was made to Exhibit X so we 
have prepared a file – you will see Mr Chair that the first folder 
contains Exhibit X which is Mr Dukwana’s previous statement and 
during the very same proceedings Mr Chair if you may turn to folder 
number 2 you will then find the supplementary affidavit which was also 
20 
handed in by Mr Dukwana during his previous appearance before this 
commission and it was through the leave of the Chair that it was 
marked Exhibit X1.  And Mr Chair there were also two further 
documents which we relied upon and referred during those proceedings 
and you will find them at Folder number 3 which is Exhibit X2 and the 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 3 of 134 
 
other document that follows immediately thereafter it is Exhibit X3 at 
Folder number 4 Mr Chair.  Those are the documents which served 
before this commission previously.  We thought that for completeness 
and to the extent that it may be necessary we should include them in 
this bundle so that if there is a need to refer to same at least we do 
have those documents handy before this commission.  Now Mr Chair 
you would also recall that we did make mention even though we did not 
– we did not submit that document formally before you we did make 
mention of an affidavit which was deposed to by Mr Iqbal Sharma but it 
was not in terms of any rules of this commission.  It was not a 3.4 
10 
Application and therefore it – we did not place it formally before you.  
However Mr Dukwana in his current statement deemed it necessary and 
prudent to deal with the averments that appears in that affidavit and for 
good order Mr Chair we thought that we should put it before you and 
you will see that if you turn to Folder number 5 and with your leave Mr 
Chair we propose that it should be referred to as Exhibit X4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It shall be so marked and so referred to. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And Mr Chair the last document 
which is relevant for todays’ proceedings you will find it in Folder 
number 6.  It is a further statement which was handed to the 
20 
commission by Mr Dukwana in order to deal with the further evidence 
and the further aspects arising from the different topics which he 
canvasses in the statement and with your leave Mr Chair we therefore 
propose that it should be marked as Exhibit X5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It shall be marked Exhibit X5 and shall be referred as 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 4 of 134 
 
such. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Chair I am told that there will 
be – there is a five page supplementary which is still being paginated 
properly by the – some of the members of the legal team.  When – 
when we have it at our disposal and then at an appropriate time we will 
then make it available to the Chair.  That is a supplementary simply 
annexing one or two annexures and correcting some of the things in the 
initial affidavit.  But for now we simply making the Chair aware of same.  
We are not going to deal with it for now Mr Chair.  Now evident Mr 
Chair that after having received this – the further supplementary 
10 
statement – the further statement of Dukwana in order to comply with 
the commission’s rules the 3.3 Notices were dispatched to various 
parties.  I must mention Mr Chair that in this statement not less than 30 
3.3 Notices were dispatched and for completeness Mr Chair we 
prepared a schedule that we will in due course hand it to the Chair 
indicating that on the 1 August which is 26 days before this hearing the 
Rule 3.3 Notices were dispatched successfully to the following people.  
Mr Elias Ace Magashule, Ms Sarah Matawane Mlamleli, Rev Daniel 
Motobela Kota, Mr Thabo Ntumetzi Moketsi [?] and Ms Qabathe.  And 
then the other 3.3 Notices Mr Chairman were dispatched on the 31 s t 
20 
July the one of Mr. Lydia – Ms Lydia Motsemme which it was dispatched 
27 days before this hearing.  And we have the one – the other ones that 
follows were dispatched on the 1 s t August giving the respective parties 
more than or approximately 26 days before this hearing and those were 
Morake,[?] Ipeleng, Octavia, Cholate [?], Ms Cholate, Ms Refiloe 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 5 of 134 
 
Mokoene, Mr Blake , Mr Kopung Frans Ralikontsane, Mr Iqbal Sharma, 
Mr Edwin Soddi,[?] Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, Mr Shadrack Ramate, Mr – 
Ms Hantsi Bhetilda Matseke Mayeza [?] and Mr Titus Mudowu 
Netchivozame [?] Mr Chair.  All those had the notices 26 days before 
this hearing and the remaining ones is where Mr – where – were 
dispatched on the 5 t h August that is the one of Ms Shirley Mazibuko and 
on the 21 s t August it was the one of – sorry – on the 5 t h August Mr 
Chair is the one of Shirley Mazibuko Mot – Rev Motobi, Ms Nangu, Ms 
Togis Alice Malembe and Mr Sithuma Solomon Ntzele and the ones that 
were dispatched on the 12 t h August still providing 14 days to the 
10 
parties was the one of Mr Silo Joseph Radebe, Ms Melanie Liz Mitchell.  
So all of the parties Mr Chair on our count it is almost thirty of the 
implicate – of the parties which were served with the Notices.  What 
has transpired Mr Chair in order to avoid any unfair criticisms there has 
always been a debate whether a party is being implicated or whether 
his name is merely mentioned.  In order to avoid that and to err on the 
side of caution every individual or person mentioned in the statement of 
Mr Dukwana was therefore favoured with a Rule 3.3 Notice for that 
party to make an informed decision whether or not to invoke any of the 
Rules of the commission so that we are not being criticised that names 
20 
of parties are mentioned for the first time during the oral evidence and 
parties claiming that they have not received the 3.3 Notices because 
sometimes we take that stand to say that by mere reading that 
statement the parties got implicated but somebody might say that well I 
was supposed to have been favoured with a 3.3 and to exercise that 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 6 of 134 
 
right.  But for this proceedings we have made sure that everybody 
mentioned must be favoured with that copy Mr Chair.  To the best of our 
knowledge and as far as we can ascertain Mr Chair we have not 
received a 3.4 Application in a [indistinct] of what is required in the rule 
of the commission.  However Mr Chair there has been serious reaction 
by different parties.  Others might have chosen to respond by mere 
letters.  Others simply put an affidavit and say that it is an affidavit in 
response of the allegations and we thought Mr Chair that for 
completeness we should nonetheless place that correspondence before 
the Chair so that we are not criticised for having left out any of what 
10 
might be material evidence or criticised for suppressing any of the 
documents which came at your disposal.  Allow us Mr Chair to do so 
with reference to a file that we have prepared and we have called it a 
Correspondence – a Rule 3.3 Correspondence Bundle and I think that is 
quite important that we should at least place some of the activities 
pursuant to the statement of Mr Dukwana and the 3.3 Notices having 
dispatched.  We have separated that Mr Chair with different folders.  
We will only refer you in order for the Chair to get the gist to the 
relevant pages and to – to the reaction to the letters received and the 
reaction thereto to those letters.  The first folder Mr Chair pertains to 
20 
Mr Ace Magashule but it only relates to his initial statement.  If we may 
refer the Chair to page 16 it will give the Chair a better understanding 
as to where we are heading with this correspondence.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At page – at page 16 – 16. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 7 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – I am sorry.  I have got page 16 but 
before you get into what the correspondence says should we not have 
all legal representatives who are representing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Various. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We can do… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Persons to place themselves on record. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We can do it now Chair but I thought that 
maybe I would afford them an opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  After I have placed this but we can do 
that now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair there are a number of parties.

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

 Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MJOKWENI:  I am Mr Njokweni instructed by Sethumontsela.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   Yes Mr Mokoena.  You had asked me to 
go to page 16, 16. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair.  I must commend that parties 
are well represented Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair if we take it from page 16.  You 
will see that from the date it is dated the 11 t h April 2019.  It was – and 
if you turn to page 17 this is the letter which is signed by Mr Elias 
Magashule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 11 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And in his letter if you may place it on 
record Mr Chair he says:   
“I refer to the above matter as well as my letter 
transmitted to you via email on the 2 n d April 2019.  I 
have noted that during Dukwana’s evidence …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one – Mr Mokoena.  Is everybody able to 
hear?  At the back – is everybody able to hear?  Well nobody says no 
so it must mean they are all able to hear you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Nonetheless I will try to raise the voice 
for the Chair’s sake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   
“I have noted that during Dukwana’s evidence that 
reference was made to a supplementary affidavit and 
he apparently submitted to the commission on the 5 t h 
April 2019.  Contrary to the two – contrary to 
previous two occasions I was neither notified nor 
provided with a copy of that affidavit.  I would 
20 
appreciate it if I could please be furnished with that 
supplementary affidavit which appears to have been 
marked Annexure X1 during Dukwana’s testimony in 
the commission.  This would assist me when I made 
my election as sought in the notice of – notice in 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 12 of 134 
 
terms of Rule 3.3 that was served on me.  I have 
also noted that Dukwana seems not to be done with 
his evidence.  If I am correct kindly advise me as to 
when the commission’s legal team is expected to 
finalise his testimony.  I am of the considered view 
that I am unable to make an informed election until 
Dukwana has finalised his testimony and I have been 
placed in possession of his supplementary affidavit.  
In the interim I elect to reserve my right.” 
Now Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If the Chair may turn to page 3.  You will 
find comfort in knowing Mr Chair that Mr Magashule was therefore 
placed in possession of Annexure X1 but there was a letter also 
reacting to it from the commission dated the 10 t h May 2019 where it 
reads as follows: 
“We refer to your letter – your letter of 11 t h April 
2019 and the evidence adduced by Mr Mxolisi 
Dukwana before the commission.  As you are aware 
Rule 3.3 of the Rules of the Commission provides 
20 
that:” 
Then it is set out in details Mr Chair.  I would not read it in order to 
save time and if you turn to page 4. 
“You are furnished with a Rule 3.3 Notice and the 
statement of said Dukwana to the extent that it 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 13 of 134 
 
implicated you.  As you are aware there are time 
periods 
prescribed 
within 
the 
Rules 
of 
the 
Commission.” 
Then reference is made to Rule 3.4 Mr Chair.  Then paragraph 5 
proceeds to state as follows: 
“To date we have not as yet received any application 
from you as contemplated in Rule 3.4 pertaining to 
the Rules – pertaining to the Rule 3.3 Notice which 
was dispatched to you containing the portions of the 
evidence of Mr Dukwana to the extent that his 
10 
evidence – to the extent that his evidence – that his 
witness statement implicated you.” 
6 Mr Chair. 
“Please 
find 
the 
supplementary 
affidavit 
with 
annexures to Mr Dukwana on the commission’s 
website.  Indeed Mr Dukwana has not finalised 
adducing evidence before the commission and we are 
still awaiting his further statement.  At this stage as 
the commission we are not in a position to indicate 
when – whether or not his further statement and or 
20 
testimony will or may implicate you.  We can only 
make that call once we are in possession of his 
further witness statement.” 
And 8 indicates the address Mr Chair.  As I have indicated that a Rule 
3.3 was also sent pertaining to this new statement of Mr Dukwana 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 14 of 134 
 
affording Mr Magashule 26 days upon which to react.  There has never 
been any correspondence in that regard.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair if we can move to Folder 
number 2. Folder number 2 it is correspondence from a law firm 
Shahied Dollie Incorporation.  You will see that the first letter it is 
dated the 3 r d April 2019 and they are representing Mr Iqbal Sharma.  
What they have now – what they have done Mr Chair they have 
submitted this correspondence and subsequently they then simply 
forwarded an affidavit.  The one which I have referred to as – as 
10 
Exhibit X4.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Mr Sharma’s affidavit? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Mr Sharma’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So what was then done Mr Chair if you 
can turn to page 26?  Then the commission also dispatched a letter to 
Mr Sharma’s legal team whereby it highlighted quite a number of 
issues.  At paragraph 1 it said: 
20 
“We refer to the evidence of Mr Dukwana which was 
adduced before the commission including the Rule 
3.3 Notices which was accordingly dispatched to you.  
As you are aware two days prior to Mr Dukwana’s 
adducing his evidence before the commission you 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 15 of 134 
 
dispatched a document and or affidavit styled – 
“statement in response to the allegations in the 
statement of Mxolisi Dukwana.”  Your affidavit was 
not an application as envisaged in Rule 3.4 of the 
Rules of the Commission and it was not apparent as 
to how it should be dealt with as it did not comply 
nor 
conform 
with 
any 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
the 
Commission.” 
Then 3 – Rule 3.3 it is rehashed there Mr Chair and if you turn to page 
27 at paragraph 5 it says: 
10 
“It is apparent from the affidavit that you had filed 
that it does not comply nor conform with Rule 3.3 
and it does not state whether or not you wish to 
exercise any of the rights provided for in the 
aforesaid rule as provided for in Rules 3.3.6.1 to 
3.3.6.3 which of course includes you testifying before 
the commission and to be cross-examined.” 
And Rule 3.4 Mr Chair it is indicated on paragraph 6 and it you turn to 
page 28 with me Mr Chair we will see that: 
“Your affidavit does not appear to be an application 
20 
as envisaged in Rule 3.4.  Could you please clarify 
why you had filed your affidavit and how it should be 
dealt 
with in the 
light of 
the 
Rules of the 
Commission?  This affidavit was formally – was not 
formally placed before the Chairperson as it was not 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 16 of 134 
 
put to Mr Dukwana in order to react to same as it is 
not conform nor comply with any Rules of the 
Commission and as such it was kept in abeyance in 
order for you to decide whether or not you wished to 
invoke any of the Rules of the Commission for it to 
be properly admitted in terms of the Rules of the 
Commission we await your response in this regard.” 
From that date Mr Chair up until now there was no further 
correspondence from Mr Iqbal Sharma pertaining to the evidence of Mr 
Dukwana as well as the 3.3 Notices and the correspondence that was 
10 
dispatched to him subsequently.  If you then – if we can then move Mr 
Chair to Folder number 3 importantly it is page 33 which is 
correspondence from M S Ramata CA [SA].  Also they acknowledge 
they say that if you will read paragraph number 1 it says: 
“I hereby acknowledge receipt of the commission’s 
correspondence dated the 2 n d August 2019 regarding 
Mr Mxolisi’s – Mxolisi Dukwana’s affidavit and 
intended appearance at the commission.  On the 3 r d 
August I requested additional information to allow me 
to make an informed decision on how to react to Mr 
20 
Mxolisi Dukwana’s claim as per paragraphs 107 and 
108 of his affidavit.  Because of the limited 
information at my disposal I am unable to decide on 
the best course of action.  I however deny that I was 
involved in any wrongdoing as alleged or inferred by 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 17 of 134 
 
Mr Mxolisi Dukwana.  I further specifically deny the 
following: 
That I have ever been appointed as an individual by 
Mr Magashule to sanitise any report that I have any 
personal 
knowledge 
to 
any 
entity 
called 
Ramate/FireVas being appointed by Mr Magashule to 
sanitise any report that I have ever sanitised any 
report or been party to sanitisation – to sanitising 
any report.   
That I have any knowledge of Mr FireVas [?] 
10 
sanitising or being party to the sanitisation to 
sanitising any of the report. 
That I have even had sight of any sanitised report or 
reports which Mr Mxolilsi Dukwana may be referring 
to. 
That I have ever had any fallout with Mr FireVas. 
That I have any knowledge of FireVas ever forming 
any entity called – sorry an entity called Open 
Waters.” 
The last paragraph says that: 
20 
“For the record I was at one stage a non-executive 
director of an entity called Ramate FireVas Forensic 
Investing – Investigation Accounting Services PTY 
LTD to which Mr Mxolisi Dukwana may be referring to 
in paragraphs 107 and 108 of his affidavit.” 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 18 of 134 
 
Mr Chair.  So this is the reaction but he was only referred to the 
paragraphs which implicates in the statement.  He thought that he was 
entitled to the entire statement and annexures but that was clarified to 
the Ramata CA.  Subsequent to that Mr Chair there was no – any 
correspondence that was received and we know that he was also 
favoured with a 3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do we know whether there might not be another 
Mr Ramatha that is – that was meant? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No Mr Chair because if you look at the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is not. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you look at the last paragraph it is 
quite revealing in a way to say that [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He admits that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There was that entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWAN:  He might only contest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The name … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In which it was placed in the statement 
… 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 19 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But at the end of the statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You find that he says that by the way … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There is this one which I think that 
Mr Dukwana might be referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Those will be dealt with accordingly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With Mr Dukwana. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair then if you go to folder number 
four it is with reference to a party referred to as Mosidi Motsemme who 
also reacted and he was (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You said (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Folder number four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is 36 a duplication of the earlier one or is it the 
one that we were looking at? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No.  We - we were looking at folder 
number three which is relevant to Ramate CA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I see 36 is also Ramate CA. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it (intervenes)? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes it is - it is duplicated.  It is the same 
thing. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 20 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is duplicated? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is the duplicate Mr Chair.  If you turn 
to folder number four … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA 
SC: 
 
And 
that 
is 
page 
43. 
 
It 
is 
correspondence dated 5 August 2019 which was received from the 
Attorneys - Victor Nkhwashu Attorneys who are acting on behalf of 
Ms Mosidi Lydia Motsemme and they record Mr Chair that: 
10 
“We refer to the above matter and advice that we 
act on behalf of Ms Mosidi Lydia Motsemme.  Our 
client has handed to us a notice in terms of 3.3 
wherein she was advised that Mr Dukwana will be 
presenting evidence which might implicate her.  We 
wish to place it on record that in order for our client 
to fully exercise her rights and to make a choice on 
what action to take she requires the full evidence of 
Mr Dukwana in order to give context.” 
Clearly Mr Chair they also wanted a full statement and 
20 
annexures.  So paragraph 4 it says that: 
“The statement our client has been furnished with 
contains at best an incomplete statement just by 
way of an example.  Paragraph 95 of the statement 
ends with an incomplete statement which starts with 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 21 of 134 
 
the words “I am not sure if Motsemme …”” 
And then paragraph 5: 
“Our client is therefore unable to exercise her rights 
without the full statement of Mr Dukwana.  Kindly 
furnish us with the full statement of evidence as a 
matter of urgency so that we can consult with our 
client and provide her with sufficient legal advice 
on this matter.  We trust that you will find the above 
in order.” 
That was reacted to by the Commission Mr Chair on page 46.  
10 
We will not read the contents.  It is simply we clarified the question that 
they are not entitled to the full statement but they were nonetheless 
given the full paragraphs of - the - the full paragraphs 92 to 95 of 
Mr Dukwana which was annexed to the letter. 
Subsequent to that correspondence Mr Chair there was never 
any other correspondence from the same attorney and we can only say 
this to the best of our knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there were two pages that were considered to 
implicate her? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those were provided? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  They were provided Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On 13 August? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Definitely and subsequent to that and 
they were given to the attorneys … 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 22 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In advance - long in advance so that 
they can react … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Or choose what caused the wish to 
adopt.  Mr Chair then you have folder number five and what is relevant 
Mr Chair is what appears from page 55 when the party wished to place 
a - an affidavit and it is Hantsi Bhetilda Matseke and in that statement 
Mr Chair she repeats the notice which was dispatched to her. 
She also on page 56 repeats the documents supplied to her 
10 
by the Commission and on paragraph 3 she then repeats the paragraph 
which is said to implicating her or may implicate her and she gives a 
history on page 57 about the VDC Chairmanship and related matters.  
Mr Chair I am doing this because I have read it. 
It is not relevant for - for what ought to be conversed but on 
page 58 she gives the construction of the company and the alleged 
conflict of interest in the Vrede 1000 Project and what appears to be 
paramount Mr Chair is on page 60 in relation to paragraph 7 where 
says that: 
“I have perused the NHBRC form in relation to the 
20 
entity known as Unitile (?) Holdings (Pty) Ltd in 
particular pages 213 to 216 of - of the annexures of 
Mr Dukwana’s statement which the Commission 
referred me to and I do not have any response as 
these documents have nothing to do with me or any 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 23 of 134 
 
of my entities.  I am also not related to persons 
mentioned in this document.” 
The next paragraph she says: 
“I have also perused the CIPC documents in 
relation to the entity known as Unitile Holdings 
(Pty) Ltd in particular pages 217 to 219 of - of the 
annexures of Mr Dukwana’s statement which the 
Commission referred me to and I do not have any 
response as these documents have nothing to do 
with me or any of my entities.  I am also not related 
10 
to persons mentioned in this document.” 
Next paragraph: 
“Since Mr Dukwana’s allegations against me are 
limited only to paragraph 75 of his statement I have 
therefore limited my response only to paragraph 75 
of Mr Dukwana’s statement.  Should Mr Dukwana 
give evidence which is not part of his statement 
under reply at the Commission and which evidence 
implicates me or has the potential to implicate me I 
reserve my right to proceed of course with leave 
20 
from the Chairperson of the Commission in terms of 
paragraph 5 of Rule 3.3 Notice read with Rule 3 of 
the Commission’s Rules.  Against the above 
background at this stage however I do not intend to 
proceed in terms of paragraph 5 of the Rule 3.3 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 24 of 134 
 
Notice.” 
Mr Chair that is the essence of what was conveyed to the 
Commission by that affidavit Mr Chair.  The next correspondence we 
find it on folder number six.  It appears from - it is - it was dispatched 
by Melanie David Incorporation and it is a simple statement that is 
being made on para - on page 78 Mr Chair. 
They are representing the Director of MasterTrade 232 (Pty) 
Ltd.  That is Mr Melanie David.  They say that: 
“I have received the notice but please note I am not 
the Director of MasterTrade 232 (Pty) Ltd.  This was 
10 
a shelf company that was formed by a company I 
worked for 20 years ago and I resigned when the 
company was sold to a client.  I have attached a 
current CIPC printout of the company (indistinct) 
dated - date as 26 October 1999.  I have no 
knowledge 
at 
all 
of 
this 
company. 
 
Kindly 
acknowledge receipt.” 
That is all that was conveyed and with reference to folder 
number seven Mr Chair it is a letter by Mr George Fivaz.  That letter 
Mr Chair it is - it starts from page 84.  It is dated 19 August 2019.  We 
20 
are not going to read that letter into the record.  It is a long letter but 
the reason also is that it implicates a number of individuals who were 
never favoured with any notice nor being made aware of the contents of 
this letter but the long and short of it Mr Chair is that Mr Fivaz alleges 
that he was aware at some point that his company was used in the Free 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 25 of 134 
 
State in order to fabricate some of the reports but he goes - he says so 
with 
reference 
to 
particular 
names 
of 
individuals 
who 
were 
unfortunately not favoured with 3.3 Notices but he has also extended 
an invitation to the Commission that he is prepared if you look at page 
89 Mr Chair.  He says that: 
“I am prepared to provide a sworn affidavit and 
verbal evidence under oath to the Commission to 
confirm the above stated facts.” 
That will also in due course be dealt with and properly be 
placed before you and a statement be - being obtained from him in that 
10 
regard.  So we simply do not wish to read that letter in order to avoid 
implicate - people that are implicated whom he raise serious objections 
to that and in all fairness within that it is a prudent way to deal with it. 
The correspondence Mr Chair is the one on folder number 
eight. 
 
The 
dates are 
quite important 
Mr Chair. 
 
It 
is 
the 
correspondence from Maharaj Attorneys who are representing as per 
the letter dated 20 August 2019 the implicated party Mr T W Zulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter starting at page what? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At page 106 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  106? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  106. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is the letter from Maharaj Attorneys 
dated 20 August 2019 which was dispatched to the Commission and for 
the attention of the Commission which we must bring to your attention 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 26 of 134 
 
Mr Chair.  It says re implicated person … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that …? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  T W … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one where preferably the name should not 
be mentioned at this stage - of the person? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is what Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Hellens refers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For - maybe for now let us do that and then when I 
have heard everything we can take it from there. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Well Mr Chair without mentioning the 
name … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The client of Mr Hellens … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And you will see that the first 
correspondence that was dispatched on 20 August 2019.  I am sure that 
I can mention the name of the attorneys - Maharaj Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Paragraph 1 says: 
20 
“Mr Chair I refer to the above matter and record 
that I have been consulted by …” 
I will not mention the name. 
“…an implicated person arising from the contents of 
the affidavit filed before the Commission by 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 27 of 134 
 
Mxolisi Dukwana.  I am awaiting receipt of further 
instructions from the client regarding his election 
under Rule 3.3.6 of the rules and we will - will 
revert in this regard imminently together with an 
application for condonation.” 
So this letter Mr Chair was sent as it is on 20 August 2019 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And on 23 August 2019 page 108 
Mr Chair - I do not want to lose you - and it says that paragraph 1.  It is 
from the same attorneys - Maharaj Attorneys dispatch to the 
10 
Commission. 
“We enclose herewith the response by our client …” 
And the name is mentioned. 
“…to the Rule 3.3 Notice.  Although the notice was 
served by email on the personal assistant of the 
client on 5 August 2019 the client was at the time 
on sick leave.  He only returned to work on 
12 August 2019.  Although in disposed to illness he 
made efforts to obtain regard representation.  The 
firm advised me that allegations were so serious 
20 
that he should take advice from senior counsel.” 
Four: 
“The firm accordingly engaged the services of 
Mr Michael Hellens SC and Mr Shane Dayal SC to 
advice client.  Obtaining legal representation also 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 28 of 134 
 
required Mr Zulu who is but - obtaining legal 
representation …” 
It is going to be difficult Mr Chair. 
“…also required client who is but an individual to 
raise 
sufficient 
funds 
to 
finance 
the 
legal 
representation necessary.  All of course client not 
to be able to respond within 14 days provided for a 
response which 14 days presuming would run from 
5 August 2019.  We hope that you will note that 
notwithstanding being ill he commenced efforts to 
10 
obtain legal representation and final date obtain 
legal representation having scrapped together the 
finances thereof.  This response which is in once 
sense late but in real sense a responsible response 
was made as soon as the circumstances allowed it.  
We trust that this late response will not be seen as 
a reason why the evidence proposed to be led and 
foreshadowed in the Rule 3.3 Notice will never - 
nevertheless be led notwithstanding the very clear 
evidence of the client contained in the affidavit 
20 
annexed hereto.  Senior counsel is able to engage 
the Commission on an urgent basis and in any 
event will attend to the - at the Commission on 
Tuesday and to make public comments of client to 
ensure that his reputation is not unnecessarily 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 29 of 134 
 
tarnished and is not defamed.  We trust that the 
Commission will take the contents of the client’s 
affidavit annexed hereto very seriously indeed the 
statement of our client.  For you to exercise the 
discretion that you have under the rules to 
postpone the proposed leading of his evidence 
pending a more responsible investigation by the 
Commission of the contents of the affidavit of the 
client.” 
And it was signed by Mr Maharaj Mr Chair and annexed to it 
10 
is the affidavit of the client.  Mr Chair starting from page 111 and the 
essence Mr Chair of the affidavit and I am sure that Mr Hellens will in 
much more able ways place it before you but the essence of it Mr Chair 
is that the name that is appearing in this spreadsheet annexed to 
Mr Dukwana’s statement with those initials do not refer to this client 
and therefore that this client did not take part or participate at all in the 
asbestos saga and he never even received any amounts in that regard. 
I am simply summarising and paraphrasing which I think is 
the highlight of the statement.  There might be other statements which 
depending as to how Mr Hellens deals with them which we may which to 
20 
respond to in due course but for now we will leave them and simply 
deal with these proceedings with the integrity that it deserves Mr Chair. 
The next point Mr Chair is folder number nine.  It was not 
properly you know put in a folder because this correspondence kept on 
coming in even today in the morning Mr Chair but we tried to do our 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 30 of 134 
 
best to collate all the documents and to make sure that we place 
whatever necessary information and those correspondence before the 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the divider marked N rather than nine? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mine is marked N not nine.  The next one after eight. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I know Chair and it is because it was 
simply dealt with within this hall … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And its correspondence was coming and 
10 
we also (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one - is that the one immediately after 
page 123. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to page 124.  Fortunately they 
are paginated Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is starts at page 124? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  124 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA 
SC: 
 And 
if 
one 
traces 
this 
is 
the 
correspondence in relation to I do not want to say it is Ms or Mrs and I 
20 
am wrong Mr Chairman but the surname I can see that is Mr I think 
Kopung Frans Ralikontsane and as you can see from the dates Mr Chair 
appearing at the bottom … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot see the name that you are mentioning. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I - I - if you go to page 124 Mr Chair. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 31 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at 124. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then you look at the second 
sentence. 
“This is an application for leave …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  “…to give evidence brought by 
…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So that is where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I thought that one should derive the 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair to the best of what one can 
ascertain despite the submission that we made that it was clearly a 
Rule 3.4 application and which was furnished in terms of the rules 
simply glancing at the date you will see Mr Chair that it was dispatched 
to the Commission if I am correct from what I am reading - is it on the 
23 r d? 
UNKNOWN PERSON:  On the 20 t h - on 23 r d yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On the 23 r d Mr Chair.  We may be 
corrected but that is what we have before us and if you go to page 124 
it simply between the - the lines.  It says that: 
“The statement in support of 3.3 for leave to give 
evidence disputing certain portions of the evidence 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 32 of 134 
 
of the witness Mr Mxolisi Dukwana to testify on the 
27 t h and 28 August 2019.” 
I do not wish to be technical to the extent that we are called upon to 
read this as a 3.4 Notice.  So Mr Chairman we will put before you as 
that (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that the document does not even have the 
date when it was signed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  It - it does not have what - what 
prayers one would seek you know lining them with the 3.3 or 3.4 but we 
do not want to be technical.  If you go … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To page 150 Mr Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he does say he seeks leave to - is it a he or a 
she? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He.  He seeks leave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He does say he seeks leave.  It is an application in 
terms of Rule 3.3 … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To give evidence disputing certain … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For leave to give evidence. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But it signed.  It appears that if you go 
to page 150 Mr Chair.  I think it was signed.  It says that that is signed 
at Bloemfontein 23 August 2019. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 33 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is at what page? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At page 150.  It appears to be signed on 
that day.  At least there is a date Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the end of the affidavit? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is 150. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Because at 151 you then find the 
signature of Mr Ralikontsane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  The affidavit. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  So it is signed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is it an affidavit or just a statement?  Looks like 
just a statement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was signed on 23 August. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is a statement.  That is why we are 
saying that we are not - we are not sure that it is an application … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As provided for in the Rules and we 
know what Rule 3.4 of the Commission requires the party to do 
Mr Chair… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that is the reason that we simply 
say that it was a statement in reacting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To the contents of the statement of 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 34 of 134 
 
Mr Dukwana rather than it being a Rule 3.4 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Application.  That is - we can leave it at 
there.  Mr Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We can also mention that a number of 
these documents and correspondence that we have actually put before 
the Commission we have not had time to even put them before 
Mr Dukwana and his legal team for them to according react but we just 
thought that in fairness to the parties that might have actually 
10 
endeavoured to place them before the Chair.  Let us do that. 
As to how we are going to deal with them in these 
proceedings that will be something to be directed by the Chair in due 
course having had submissions from different parties.  The last one 
Mr Chair that I also saw for the first … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that - well that - that one ending at the affidavit 
of or the statement of Mr Ralikontsane they should find it quite easy to 
convert it into an affidavit. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  The last one Mr Chair if I am 
correct to say that is the last one because documents kept on coming 
and there was a late reaction to the statement of Mr Dukwana.  It is to 
be found in the last folder.  I am even not confident enough to tell you 
whether it is folder number 10 or what folder it is because they were all 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 35 of 134 
 
prepared today … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But at least page 183 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Might give us guidance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A - a divider which his preceded by page 183. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not marked 10.  What it is marked is either zero 
or O one of the two.  If you put one it will be 10. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair it is page - if I may refer the 
10 
Chair to page 183 I hope that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It will accord with pagination that I am 
having. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  This is the correspondence which we 
received.  It contains the statement that is on page 187 Mr Chair.  That 
statement or it is an affidavit.  Let me just - it is a statement Mr Chair 
by Blackie Siwe (?) … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And it simply a reaction to Mr Dukwana’s 
statement pursuant to the party having been furnished with a Rule 3.3 
Notice and he simply furnishes his own version in that affidavit and 
attempts to also deal with the paragraphs that relate to him in the 
manner that he did from pages 191. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 36 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We have also not had the opportunity to 
properly apply our mind to these documents to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Place them properly before Mr Dukwana 
and his legal team for them to react. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As you know Mr Chair that we have no 
version as the Commission but the evidence that we lead is the one 
that is from the witnesses and those witnesses all of them are the 
10 
witnesses of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair those are the correspondence 
that we have received in reaction to Mr Dukwana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are ready to proceed giving that 
evidence but I am sure that before we do that there might be the 
parties as we have indicated and as you might have heard in chambers 
that who may wish to make certain submissions before we proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I - from what transpired in chambers I 
20 
understood Mr Hellens to be the one who may wish to raise some point 
and depending on what he has to say there maybe - there may be a 
need for responses.  If there is someone else who has another point 
that does not relate to the point that Mr Hellens wishes to raise.  Then I 
will - I will get to know after Mr Hellens and after we have dealt with 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 37 of 134 
 
the point that Mr Hellens wishes to raise.  Yes Mr Hellens. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:   Thank you Chair.  Chair you are aware of 
the client that I represent and the simple proposition that we place 
before you is this, we do not know whether you have had sight of the 
evidence that this witness intend to give and we do not officially know 
whether you have had sight of the response that our client has given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have had sight of the evidence that this 
evidence will give, I did not have sight of the statement from your client 
as yet until it was pointed out now. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    Let me break that up into two points which 
10 
are foundation for the address that I want to make, or perhaps three.  
Firstly it is incumbent upon this Commission given the sacred duty that 
it has to investigate responsibly, to present evidence which need not be 
cast iron in nature but must not be wantonly speculative.   
 
As I stand here, you and I are on National TV and the 
allegations about my client will be nationally publicised all over.  You 
as the guardian of the reasonable conduct of this Commission, solely 
responsible therefore have to ensure, in our submission, that wildly 
speculative evidence is not placed before this Commission even if my 
client were to be given the right of cross-examination and demonstrates 
20 
it to be untrue, the harm is done by leading speculative and 
unmeritorious evidence prima facie so.  
 
Now what we say the allegations with regard to our client – 
and let me make this point it is specifically the allegations made about 
our client not the general topic.  We had no objection to anything said 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 38 of 134 
 
by this witness on the general topic but when his statement focuses in 
at one moment – at one point on an allegation identifying our client as 
responsible it is blatantly speculative, it is unsupported by any 
documents and the document as a whole, by the way, but we are not 
concerned with the documents as a whole, is like a running scandal 
sheet of a person three times removed from the facts.  And whether you 
want to hear that evidence with regard to other people is up to 
you…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Hellens, I think it would be better that I 
read your client’s statement first. 
10 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    I was just going to get to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I think you might or might not need to 
persuade me much, depending on what I take of the matter but I will 
follow your argument much better if I’ve had a look at it. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    Let me just say what I expect that you will 
find, you will find that in concrete form my client denies any 
involvement, he tenders – he says,  
“no-one has asked me for a version before, no investigators 
have interrogated me, I tender my bank statements, I tender a 
complete 
investigation 
by 
the 
Commission 
with 
myself 
20 
personally in attendance and all I ask is that before you ruin 
my reputation and my career you postpone this evidence, not 
as a whole necessarily but with regard to me and investigate 
this case properly”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The identification? 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 39 of 134 
 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    Yes and we go on to say that it is 
recklessly gathered with regard to our client and I say this with the 
deepest humility with the utmost strength.  There are consequences to 
this Commission acting unlawfully and recklessly and we will – let me 
stop there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well as I say I have not read his statement but if it’s 
going to be of any help in how we handle – deal with the matter, I 
would be inclined, and I haven’t read the statement, I would be inclined 
to say to the Commission’s legal team and to Mr Dukwana’s legal team 
how much have we done to try and make sure that the identification is 
10 
reasonable, maybe that’s not the correct word but that’s the word that 
comes to my mind immediately…[intervenes]. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    The product of a reasonable…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s not – it might not be certain but that it’s 
reasonable and if the answer is, it might be better to get more time to 
do further efforts, my inclination would be to say, why don’t we allow 
those efforts to be made first and at the end of those efforts then we 
can hear whether the identification that was intended to be made will 
still be made and if it will still be made it may be that it should be 
allowed at that stage but in case the further efforts confirming the 
20 
identification reveal that it’s not correct, it might not be made. 
 
That would be my inclination but I say so – I say I make that 
inclination known without having read your client’s statement and 
without having compared it with what Mr Dukwana says.  I do – I did 
see your client’s name somewhere and I did see how it was – what was 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 40 of 134 
 
said about it.  So that’s my thinking maybe I should hear what Mr 
Mokoena has to say and what counsel for Mr Dukwana have to say and 
depending on what they have to say, I might – we might have to adjourn 
and let me read and then we come back. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    You have the essence of my submissions in 
the cup of your hand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you.  Who should come first, Mr Mokoena? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair there’s protocol at the bar.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Dukwana’s counsel will get a chance to stand 
[indistinct] in my response. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair we are inclined to follow the 
Chair’s approach and advice but let’s do so in a far much more 
responsible manner.  We are not doing this because of fear of any 
threats that might be levelled against this Commission or maybe being 
intimidated that when we lead evidence there may be consequences. 
We are simply doing that in [indistinct] the furtherance of the mandate 
of this Commission not because of any fear. 
 
We are called upon to deal with the evidence that’s received 
from any witness without fear, favour or prejudice and not to treat any 
of the evidences in any special manner but we are mindful that the 
20 
Chair might have not yet read the affidavit of the client of Mr Hellens 
and to that extent maybe it’s the responsible thing to afford you that 
opportunity to do so Mr Chair.  That’s all that I want to say for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your position that you would prefer that I read 
the statement/affidavit first before…[intervenes]. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 41 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes you may do that Mr Chair but that 
should not delay the leading of the evidence of this witness.  What we 
can do, while you’re still going to read, we can lead Mr Dukwana’s 
evidence and to the extent that we might become near that portion, 
maybe then the Chair might direct, so that we don’t waste any time 
unnecessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, when do you expect Mr Dukwana might come to 
that, so I mean, based on what you’re saying one possibility is that you 
would not – if he comes to the relevant part of his evidence we will skip 
that part which is a very limited part as I understand. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Very limited Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We would skip that part and if he skips that part it 
might – if it comes up today and he skips it, it might mean that 
tomorrow…[intervenes]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Tomorrow we might have to deal with it 
depending on how you deal – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then of course I would have read it by then, the only 
difficulty with that might mean that Mr Hellens client might have to 
bring back Mr Hellens and the legal team tomorrow when maybe we 
might have finalised everything today. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes Mr Chair, but I mean that we are 
doing in order to cater for his client’s interest and so we are doing so 
because we were prepared to lead evidence on all the issues and the 
topics but having listened to Mr Hellens and having listened to the 
Chair’s approach in this regard, it might be a sensible thing to do and 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 42 of 134 
 
I’m not…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I got the impression, when I had a look at the - at Mr 
Hellens client’s affidavit as you were speaking earlier it looked like it 
might be something like seven pages, is that more or less… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   It’s a very short affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it may be that if I were to take an extended tea 
break I might be able to…[intervenes]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes you might be able to read it then I 
might also have to lead Mr Dukwana without any interruptions but I’m 
sure that my learned colleague Mr Smanga might want to say something 
10 
on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let me hear. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:   Chair, we also want to place it on record 
that Mr Dukwana is here to advance the constitutional mandate of this 
Commission.  He’s here without fear or favour and under no 
circumstances should this Commission treat anybody with kid gloves.  
We are in [indistinct] with Mr Mokoena that the Chair shall be afforded 
an opportunity to go through the statement, after which the Chair will 
be in a position to listen to the submissions that will be advanced by Mr 
Hellens SC with Mr Dyle SC and then certainly we stand ready to give - 
20 
to make our submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:   And we do not want a situation where this 
Commission would hear the evidence of Mr Dukwana interrupted, we 
want the coherence in his statement to be what is captured in the 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 43 of 134 
 
statement and in that regard, an extended tea we are in consent with 
that but before that it appears that Mr Lebala SC wants to address you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I’m sorry is Mr Lebala coming on the same 
issue. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    Mr Chair may I just say that I agree that 
you should look at our statement, make a decision about that, and just 
to make a point, I may have already made, we’re not trying to stop the 
leading of this witness in total, it’s just if it’s considered that more 
research with regard to our alleged involvement is necessary he can be 
10 
led without that portion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you, Mr Lebala. 
ADV SIMMY LEBALA SC:   Esteemed Chair there’s an incremental 
issue coming out of what you’ve heard particularly from our learned 
friend Mr Mokoena.  We don’t want to deal with the [indistinct] of the 
rules Chair but the dire straits created by our statement which is 
standing before the Commission…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you’re talking about your statement we are 
still talking about Mr Hellens client’s statement. 
ADV SIMMY LEBALA SC:   Well accompanying that is the fact that the 
20 
Commission would be assisted if our statement is also given to the 
witness because our statement sheds light about the version of our 
client Chair and all inclusively I…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what has that got to do with the identification 
of Mr Hellens client, because that’s what I’m dealing with. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 44 of 134 
 
ADV SIMMY LEBALA SC:   It’s a separate issue Mr …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but I said let me finish the issue relating to Mr 
Hellens client. 
ADV SIMMY LEBALA SC:   Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, I think I will take an adjournment it is 
quarter past eleven, Mr Mokoena is there anything you want to say 
before we take the adjournment? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   No, no Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nothing, I’ll take the adjournment it will be longer 
than usual so that I can get the chance to read, I’m going to resume at 
10 
twenty to twelve, instead of half past eleven but if I haven’t finished I 
might resume a little – a few minutes later than that, we adjourn. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:   Sorry Chair, may I suggest that in the 
meantime perhaps it will be prudent that the Chair is favoured with our 
supplementary statement because that statement is going to give the 
context in…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the identification. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:    Yes in Mr Hellens statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay I think you mentioned that there was still 
some supplementary statement.  Does Mr Hellens have that because it 
20 
might put a different picture to…[intervenes]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair we’ll make sure that you 
receive it within the next five minutes, maybe if we could resume at 12 
o’ clock to allow that opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes maybe because Mr Hellens is – if he hadn’t 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 45 of 134 
 
received it he might want to have a look at it as well but, shall we make 
it – how long is this supplementary? 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:    Chairperson it is only four to five pages, it 
accompanies the very same email correspondences that are in issue 
which are the basis of the contention of Mr Hellens client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I think let me – Mr Hellens I see you 
want to say something. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    Mr Chairman we were given a Rule 3.3 
notice, we responded to it, we were told at the last minute that there’s 
supplementary evidence, we understand now it would be in response to 
10 
what we responded.  This is the first moment we hear of it, it’s 
untenable, it’s unacceptable, we cannot just be bulldozed into rolling 
over now with a surprise statement produced. 
 
What’s supposed to happen with a responsible investigating 
body is you interrogate people, maybe under summons, maybe under 
voluntary submission which we would have done. 
 
You develop a sober attitude towards one set of evidence as 
against another, you investigate it properly but you don’t on the day, 
allow a witness to do a supplementary statement in answer to a 
considered statement by us and then ask for a ruling on the day, we 
20 
need an opportunity to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no you will need to have a look but I think let 
the adjournment go up to twelve and then at twelve I’ll resume and then 
we’ll then see what we can do or how far we go. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS SC:    As it pleases the Chair. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 46 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we’ll adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have had the opportunity of reading Mr Hellens 
client’s affidavit as well as Mr Dukwana’s supplementary affidavit.  I 
was unable to find anything in Mr Dukwana’s supplementary affidavit 
that relates to the identification of Mr Hellens client and as I sit here 
my inclination is to say we continue to seek to strike a balance between 
ensuring fairness to implicated persons but also ensuring that as far as 
10 
possible we are not unduly hampered in the work that the commission 
has to do.  My inclination is that where we are dealing with a person 
who says before you mention my name publicly in regard to something 
like this I am here, I am cooperating, you have not spoken to me, come 
and speak to me and I will cooperate.  My inclination is to say if the 
commission has not done that as yet it should rather do that and if at 
the end of that exercise the position is still that the position does not 
change then one can take it from there.  But you might well find that 
the position changes in which case it could make a difference.  It does 
not appear to me that there would be much prejudice to the commission 
20 
if we were to go that route.  So I do not know if you want to say – that 
is – that is not a ruling yet that is an inclination.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if you want to say anything Mr 
Mokoena? 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 47 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair only if that invitation was made 
much more earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You have seen that – just made on 
Friday we – we are aware that paramount to this commission’s 
proceedings it is you know the concept of fairness and one would want 
to ensure that all the parties are afforded sufficient time to react to 
whatever statements that might be made you know against them or 
evidence that might be led which might implicate other people.  So we 
are much more inclined to adopt that approach subject obviously to 
10 
what Mr Smanga Sethene might want to say and or subject to what Mr 
Hellens might want to convey to the Chair.  We are – if the evidence 
was to be led it will be led if the – you have to apply cautious – to be 
cautious to it we will do that exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Council for Mr Dukwana. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  We – we believe the Chair has read the 
supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have yes. 
20 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  In the preparation with Mr – with client 
together with the legal team of the commission this issue of 
abbreviations of names was articulated by Mr Dukwana giving context 
to his contention in his statement saying why SS is Smanga Sethene 
and PM is Phillip Mokoena.  Besides Chair anyone who comes before 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 48 of 134 
 
this commission that SS shall not be stated and challenges the fact that 
SS means Smanga Sethene and the Chairperson finds that there are 
publications like this book where the very same or a similar contentions 
are advanced by the offer.  What Mr Dukwana is bringing to the 
commission is simply evidence.  To say there was this email 
correspondence between directors of companies who benefitted from 
asbestos heist as Mr Dukwana terms it.  And it is those emails that will 
put PM at the scene.  And what Mr Dukwana does not say in his 
statement he does not say definitively that PM certainly means Phillip 
Mokoena.  He says PM it is believed to be Phillip Mokoena who at the 
10 
time of this project was at the helm.  Now if Chair if I were to take 
Chair to this book right which was published if I am not mistaken last 
November and then PM is stated there and a reasonable reader comes 
to a conclusion that because PM was at the helm of a certain 
department at the time a reasonable person will come to a conclusion 
that indeed PM could be believed to be Phillip Mokoena.  That is the 
contention.  Now I do not see how this commission’s work is going to 
be hampered even if we were to go by the abbreviated version to say it 
is PM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I [intervention]. 
20 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  I [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I – I did not understand Mr Hellens to 
object to the mentioning of certain initials.  My understanding of his 
objection was anything to say those initials refer to his client.  I think 
that is my understanding. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 49 of 134 
 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not my understanding that your client should not 
say well this document refers to that but he – his concern is anything to 
suggest that those initials refer to his client. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  That is why Chair I am saying there is 
nothing wrong with this commission continuing with its work.  When it 
comes to Mr X it would say – it – let us call him Mr X throughout and 
then say why – Mr Dukwana will say why he believes indeed Mr X is at 
the scene of the asbestos heist as he puts it.  There is no – there is 
nothing wrong.  In various cases in high court and elsewhere where 
10 
persons’ name it is contended that he shall not be mentioned have 
been referred to as Mr X.  So that – that [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I [intervention]. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  So that is the contention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  But – but the Chair would understand – 
would note that the – the affidavit of Mr X – let us call him Mr X does 
admit that he was at some point at the helm of a specific national 
department.  It does not say whether Mr X is known to the late director 
of that – a certain company and to another implicated person.  Further 
20 
Mr X does not say in his statement whether whilst he was at the helm at 
no stage when he was chairing a meeting – let us call it a technical 
[indistinct] there was never a presentation relating to this – of this 
magnitude relating to asbestos in the Free State.  There is a context 
why Mr X according to Mr Dukwana is placed there and Mr Dukwana is 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 50 of 134 
 
going to elaborate that and Mr Mokoena would also attest to the fact 
that it was an issue even at the preparation of the statement to say why 
are saying this is Mr X and why are you saying this is Mr Z or Y and all 
of those names as articulated in the statement of Mr Dukwana are 
explained. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – it may be that some people who may be 
mentioned have not made the same offer that Mr Hellens client has 
made and I – and committed to cooperation and so on.  But it seems to 
me that further engagement with him including an interview of Mr 
Hellens’ client might well reveal – he might be asked were you at that 
10 
meeting?  You have just mentioned a certain meeting.  He might say 
yes I was at that meeting.  That may or may not fortify the belief that 
Mr Dukwana may be having that the person referred to by certain 
initials in the correspondence is Mr Hellens’ client.  So my inclination is 
there is no harm and there may be benefit in that further engagement 
and at a certain stage Mr Dukwana can come back and say well the 
further engagement and the further investigations have actually 
fortified me in my view and come back and say I can really support why 
I say this is Mr Hellens’ client.  Or he might say having been shown 
what has been unearthed in the further investigation or engagement I 
20 
do not persist in saying those initials refer to so and so.  So in other 
words if that part of identification is to be dealt with later the 
commission does not lose anything because it will still be dealt with.  
And it may be that the further engagement will confirm or confirm that 
he was right in his – he is right in his belief or it might show that maybe 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 51 of 134 
 
there are no proper grounds to give that identification.  That is my – 
that is my inclination. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  Chair if that is [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  If that is the Chairperson’s inclination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  Then I would propose that let it be extended 
to all persons who appear in the statement of Mr Dukwana in the 
abbreviated version.  Because some of them are here and they are not 
making any song about the abbreviated version.  All what they have – 
10 
they place themselves on the record to say we are for certain persons.  
So if that is the Chairperson’s inclination I will propose that it be 
extended to all person even if it means that those paragraphs where 
those abbreviated names appear are blacked out or for the – for the 
sake of fairness they are retracted so that they are to be placed at a 
later stage when Mr Dukwana comes – comes back.  I do not know if Mr 
Mokoena disagree or agrees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokoena you said Mr Dukwana you meant Mr 
Mokoena I think. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  No, no, no I know Mr [intervention]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You looked at Mr Mokoena and said Dukwana. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  It is a voice from behind in fact I am happy 
that Mr Hellens is very happy with my proposals and he is going to 
come and agree with everything that I have said.  Thank you 
Chairperson. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 52 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No before you sit no the – the position is that as – at 
least at this stage I have only been informed of Mr Hellens client’s 
objection.  No one else has expressed any objection.  Different people 
take different approaches to issues.  Another person might say look as 
long as I am going to end up getting a chance to cross-examine Mr 
Dukwana about what he wants to say about me I will – it is fine I will 
deal with him in that way.  Or I will give evidence and – and it is fine let 
us proceed you know but somebody else might say – might take the 
attitude that Mr Hellens has taken.  But having said that if Mr Dukwana 
feels that he would rather not proceed to mention certain names at this 
10 
stage because he feels there may be a need for further engagements in 
the same way as in regard to Mr Hellens’ client.  That is something that 
he might need to raise with Mr Mokoena and of course you – you would 
be there and then we take it from there.  But as I say some people 
would have different approaches to issues and just because I have a 
particular inclination in regard to Mr Hellens’ client does not 
necessarily mean it would be the same inclination to others.  But I do 
not know each one would need to be – I would need to be informed of 
how – I mean for example with regard to Mr Hellens client it is initials 
that are there and Mr Dukwana says in effect I believe those initials 
20 
represent so and so.  But I think I have seen if I am not mistaken some 
names that are given in full you know.  I may be mistaken.  So – so it 
may differ.  So – but – but I am sure – I am sure if they are here they 
would be able to speak for themselves but to the extent that you might 
say on behalf of Mr Dukwana you would prefer that he does not mention 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 53 of 134 
 
certain names I would allow you and Mr Mokoena to discuss that and 
then we take it from there. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  In that regard Chair I think we will have to 
take instructions also to Mr Dukwana – from Mr Dukwana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is in order. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  And it would – it would mean [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  A short adjournment would be fitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that would – that would be fine.   
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I think Mr – I do not know if I saw Mr 
Hellens wanting to stand up. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Just my learned friend has gone very far – 
sailed very close to the wind of revealing what he should not but having 
said that we are fully in accord with the inclination intimated by you Sir.  
I think PM he agrees.  We would just ask for formality sake and 
procedural sake if the supplementary affidavit is an affidavit that the 
commission wants to put to us under Rule 3.3 they must decide to do 
that and secondly if they want to see our client then we must just make 
an arrangement.  And then lastly in accordance with your – your 
20 
inclination it is obviously not only the name of my client but the 
designation which goes with it because that identifies him.  So I do not 
have to say do not say Zondo but you can say the Chairperson of the 
Zondo Commission well that would be defeating.  So it is five – 52.3.1 
it is that entire description but apart from that we are in accordance 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 54 of 134 
 
with your indication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair all this does violence to my 
preparation but it is fine we will adjust accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The only things that we should be 
cautious not to invite objections which were not there before.  The 
objections that we have formulated are the ones for the client of Mr 
Hellens and we have them on paper.  I do not have any other objections 
and we have indicated that the Rule 3.3 Notices. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Were dispatched timeously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And if there was any party that was 
wishing to react. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He could have done so [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would have done so. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So for now I am comfortable that we can 
lead the evidence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With simply without reference to Mr 
Hellens client’s name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Client yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Even if he may ventilate as to why he 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 55 of 134 
 
says there but we can definitely make sure that we do not say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mention the name and the designation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Chair there is just one more thing.  Perhaps if I 
did not make myself clear.  If you use the initials in the total context 
that might identify the person so it should be not the initials and not the 
name and not the designation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as I recall the document to which Mr Dukwana 
10 
refers bears certain initials. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now on the face of it I do not see anything wrong with 
– with Mr Dukwana saying that document in – on that part mentions 
these initials and stopping there. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Perhaps that is the only practical way of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – yes.  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  As the commission pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Thank you.  I think counsel for Mr Dukwana 
might be wishing to have some discussion with you Mr Mokoena. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To take instructions.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at twenty-two/twenty-three minutes past 
twelve.  Maybe you do not need more than five/ten minutes? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Or Chair we can do it the other way 
around.  We can take the early lunch adjournment and come back at 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 56 of 134 
 
half past twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I thought of that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Instead of [intervention] 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am thinking that you probably would not need 
more than ten minutes and then maybe – if we – if we take about ten 
minutes maybe then we could have about twenty/twenty-five minutes 
before the lunch and [intervention] 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And we can proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we could take Mr Dukwana through certain 
portion and then we take lunch at the normal time. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am at your hands Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay let us – let us – we will adjourn now and 
resume at twenty-five to one.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair maybe it will be opportune to 
afford my learned colleague to put the instructions of the client and we 
will in either way that they deem it necessary to proceed with the 
matter.  We are ready to do so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  We have consulted with Mr Dukwana.  He says 
we must place this on record that there are other witnesses who came 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 57 of 134 
 
before the Commission.  They - they mentioned certain names of 
persons who prior to come - to coming here to testify and he sees 
nothing really special about certain witnesses or a witness why they - 
why he should be treated differently. 
He makes reference of the fact that the former President was 
here.  He made mention that retired General Siphiwe Nyanda was a spy 
and that processes out there are ventilated in the courts.  Why this 
particular one - why this particular one should not be treated or be 
given the same attitude. 
In addition to that he says in any case there has been - the 
10 
list is out of persons implicated and all their names were read out and 
fortunate - unfortunately there has also been a slip of the tongue and 
we live in a technological world.  It now becomes mute.  The identity of 
Mr X becomes mute because it will be headline news in any case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang - hang on one second.  I note that as you place 
what you are placing on record Mr Hellens is no longer here. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Now it - it - we are in your hands Chair with 
regard to that.  Perhaps it is a discussion that we would have to have 
20 
with Mr Hellens together with the legal team of the Commission to say 
in the light of this what are we doing because I can tell you now 
Chairperson it maybe now trending on the social network as to who is 
this Mr X and why the identity of Mr X is being concealed by the 
Commission and it places the Commission in a serious predicament as 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 58 of 134 
 
to how is it going to deal with other witnesses moving forward because 
the inclination of the Chairperson certainly opens floodgates of other 
witnesses wanting to go the similar route that Mr Hellens client has - 
has advanced. 
This - I am not sure if the Commission as well is also inclined 
to hear evidence of Mr Dukwana in piecemeal fashion and I doubt that 
will be - I doubt it will be desirable that evidence of Mr Dukwana is - is 
heard on a peaceful - on a piecemeal basis.  Perhaps Chair it will be 
prudent as Mr Mokoena proposed earlier that let us take an extended 
lunch and then he Mr Mokoena would contact Mr Hellens to request him 
10 
to do a U-turn and failing which we may have to meet later with 
Mr Hellens and - and Mr Dayal to - to explore this matter because 
otherwise the Commission is going to be said to be a mommyish in a 
sense that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well let us - let us look at this.  Well one you 
say your client mentions the fact that the former President mentioned 
certain names. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the former President had not furnished the 
Commission’s legal team or the Commission with a statement 
20 
beforehand … 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To enable the Commission to know what he was going 
to say and then to make a decision as to what should be done and to 
have its or copies sent or notices sent to certain persons that he might 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 59 of 134 
 
have intended to mention.  That is the - the first point. 
The second point I think would be that generally speaking it 
would be reasonable to expect that where information that might assist 
the Commission is readily available that it be looked at so that it is 
taken into account before a witness’ statement is finalised or before a 
witness gives evidence. 
Of course it depends what the information is and one has got 
to bear in mind that a witness does not - the information that the 
witness has does not have to be 100 percent correct. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  We - but it would be important to see that 
where there was awareness that certain information could be checked 
with relative ease that - that that could be checked first.  Of course 
then there is the point which I made earlier on that different persons - 
different people take different - adopt different attitudes or approaches 
to different issues. 
A few weeks ago Mr or Ms Jiba’s counsel came here when 
Mr Nxasana was going to give evidence and I heard argument and as a 
result of the argument and my response to it certain arrangements were 
made and - and Mr Nxasana was able to continue with his evidence 
20 
without dealing with certain aspects of it and he subsequently came 
back I think last week or the week before and was able to continue with 
his evidence with no objection at all from Ms Jiba and without as I 
understand the position even an application from Ms Jiba for leave to 
cross-examine him. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 60 of 134 
 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the objection had fallen away.  Mr Nxasana is still 
going - has not finished.  Will - he will still come back and finish his 
evidence.  So as I say one keeps on trying to strike a balance.  One 
does not want a situation where just because somebody objects to 
something then everything stops but at the same time one does not 
want a situation where people believe that even if you have - you 
object you will just be dismissed because the Commission wants to 
continue. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One tries to strike a balance and - and one of the 
factors as I mentioned earlier on is to say okay if we allow the 
opportunity to have the investigators or the legal team of the 
Commission interview Mr X and he tenders certain information and his 
bank account and he is prepared to answer whatever questions he may 
be asked. 
That is what Mr Hellens said if I recall correctly.  If that 
process has been done we may still come back and be able to say no 
that is fine.  Let - let Mr Dukwana mention what he believes the initials 
represent and it maybe that at that stage they might say look we - we 
20 
have - we have been heard and we will still get a chance to challenge. 
That - that is fine.  So one tries to strike a balance.  Of 
course different people will strike a balance in different places. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that - that - so that is - that is - that is the - 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 61 of 134 
 
that is the at least one of the distinguishing factors relating to the 
former President is that we - we did not have his statement.  It was … 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All came as a surprise. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Chair I see that Mr X … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Counsel. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Counsel (intervenes)… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other than Mr Hellens. 
10 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Other than he - he is present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Certainly they were listening to the news and 
that is why they - they deem it fit to do a U-turn but Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Mr Dukwana tells us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  That Mr X actually in a newspaper edition last 
year he actually disputed that he is indeed Mr X.  So he says in any 
case - he says in any case even if he Mr X is referred to as Mr X a 
20 
context is still out there in the public domain but as proposed earlier 
Chairperson is now that Mr Hellens is here perhaps that extended lunch 
should be - should be - should be proposed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  And then we - we favour Mr Hellens and his - 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 62 of 134 
 
and the team of Mr X with what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not sure what Mr - what prejudice 
Mr Dukwana will suffer if we go along with my inclination because it is 
a question of if he does not mention today he might still be able to 
mention at a later stage what he believes those initials represent. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  But Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  It will be prudent that the - the legal team of 
Mr X is present so that in the event they wish to challenge his evidence 
… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  They do so because the issue of reputation we 
are told from Mr Hellens that it is at issue here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but they have no problem.  They are happy with 
my inclination.  Mr Mokoena accepts that inclination and as I 
understand the position you are not totally against it but you … 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - you have certain concerns. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So, so but I see that I think your instructing 
20 
attorney seems to want to say something. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got to bring this to a close. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Can - can I please take instructions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take instructions but I want to bring it to a close, ja. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 63 of 134 
 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Chair I understand that the client is 
amendable to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the inclination. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  To the inclination and we must proceed as - as 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As previously indicated. 
ADV SMANGA SITHINI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  I - I take it that Mr Hellens 
does not have to say anything in the light of that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair if you … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Grant Mr Hellens time we will leave here 
at 6 o’ clock.  I think he goes with the inclination Mr Chair.  I am sure 
of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I think Mr Hellens you do not have really to say 
anything because … 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  I missed some of it Chair but if it as was - if it 
as it was when I left … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  When you adjourned. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  Then I have nothing to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No. 
ADV MIKE HELLENS:  As shortly as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is as it was when we adjourned.  Okay.  Alright.  
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 64 of 134 
 
Thank you.  Thank you every - to everybody.  Okay.  Mr Mokoena 
should we get the witness …? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair may the witness be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To sworn in, ja.  Okay. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Mxolisi Dukwana. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
10 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I do not know.  It looks like the … 
REGISTRAR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is working now.  Okay.  I think you must give 
that answer - that last answer again. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear - do you consider the oath to be binding 
on your conscience? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
20 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So help me God. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 65 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Dukwana (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before Mr Mokoena.  Mr Dukwana thank you very 
much for coming back to continue to give evidence in the Commission. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  My pleasure sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you and Mr Mokoena you will obviously be 
alive to the relevant parts of - of his evidence and you will … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I - I have put red stickers where I am not 
supposed to go Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Dukwana we have placed a file 
before you and if you open that file you will see that it has been 
subdivided into six folders.  Do you have that file? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes I do. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja and if you go through - there is an 
index in front of it which will assist you to navigate you know through 
the file.  However for the purpose of your testimony today we will be 
going to folder number six and if I may request you to turn to page 1 of 
that document.  Could you please identify that document for us? 
20 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  The what? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Could you please identify - what is that 
document that you see on page 1?  The pages are numbered … 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Evidence of Mxolisi Dukwana. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  No but I think you are looking at 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 66 of 134 
 
the cover page.  Turn again, yes.  There is a document.  What is that 
document? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is I the undersigned Mxolisi Dukwana. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is - it is your statement. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is a statement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now let us go to page 34 of that 
document and could you please identify the signature appearing there? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is mine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And do you confirm that this statement it 
in a form of an affidavit? 
10 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I do. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and do you confirm the contents of 
that statement to be true and correct? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I do. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now in your preparation also you 
were 
presented 
with 
an 
affidavit 
that 
was 
deposed 
to 
by 
Mr Iqbal Sharma.  Am I correct? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then if you may turn please to folder 
number five would that be the statement of Mr Iqbal Sharma which you 
20 
had the opportunity to peruse? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes it is. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now let us go back then to your 
statement.  We will in due course come to that statement of Mr Sharma.  
If I may refer you to page 3. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 67 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mokoena.  I think - should - is there 
something you should tell me about pagination here?  Normally we - 
with these bundles the pagination is from beginning to end but I see 
that this may be different. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It - it is different Chair because the - the 
documents that you are having … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Which are at the beginning of the file … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Have already been you know admitted as 
10 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On - on a particular set of numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So we do not want to disturb that 
pagination that exists from his initial evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is why we kept it that as the way it 
is but if you go to EXHIBIT 5 we then created it as a separate bundle 
altogether which is on folder number six. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That is - that is what I want to understand. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. Folder number six Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So from folder number six it is a different pagination? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is a different pagination.  It goes with 
its own pagination. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 68 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it holds good for the balance of … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The pages? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So before folder six it is one pagination? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Definitely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And after folder six it is a different pagination? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Different pagination Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is - it is complete?  It is from beginning to end? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To end. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that section? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As we have also alluded to in our 
opening address … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When we are introducing the documents 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now Mr Dukwana I was just about to 
20 
refer you to page 3 of your statement.  Would I be correct that you 
know from that page and onwards you are then reacting to the 
averments and statements which are contained in the affidavit of 
Mr Iqbal Sharma? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is true sir. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 69 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now in paragraph 6 of that 
statement you give a background and in paragraph 7 you state to the 
Chair as follows: 
“Sharma’s statement was not intended to be an 
application to cross examine me but an attempt to 
respond to the allegation I made relating to him.  
Notwithstanding the status of Sharma’s statement at 
the Commission I am advised that I need to deal 
with 
the 
relevant 
matters 
conversed 
in 
his 
statement further in Sharma’s annexures.  There 
10 
are documents that I purportedly signed and I will 
demonstrate that the signature appended in those 
annexures have been forged.” 
And that is what you are conveying to the Chair.  Am I correct 
as a means of a background? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may you proceed in your own 
words and start dealing with Sharma’s affidavit from your own reaction 
with reference to paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mokoena.  We - we are at 1 o’ clock but 
20 
I was thinking maybe we could go up to quarter past and then take an 
adjournment but we may - we - we could adjourn and start and come 
back at two.  If we adjourn at quarter past we would come back at 
quarter past two. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair Mr Zutini (?) is very hungry.  He 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 70 of 134 
 
indicates to me and says now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He says adjourn now Mr Chair.  So I am 
normally a creature of instructions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair but we may adjourn now and come 
back at two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe we should adjourn and so that he can 
start properly after lunch.  Okay.  Let us - let us do that.  We - we try to 
start earlier.  It was not possible.  Okay.  We will adjourn and then we 
10 
will resume at two o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s proceed but before we do that let’s address the 
question of whether we will stop at four or later, seeing that we have 
lost quite some time this morning.  Mr Mokoena you are in a better 
position to assess the situation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair Mr Dukwana is set down to 
testify today and tomorrow, we also have a very short witness that it is 
20 
a corroboratory witness more than anything else, we can do either two 
things Chair, we can either adjourn at four o’clock today and maybe 
attempt to start early, at nine o’clock tomorrow, because at least I will 
be able to gauge at four o’clock as to how far we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay maybe we will hear what – maybe let us 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 71 of 134 
 
deal with it at four. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   At four o’clock yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we will see whether we add some time today 
or we start early tomorrow. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Tomorrow, that will assist ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Dukwana just before the lunch 
adjournment I have referred you to your statement where you begin to 
react to the averments which are contained in Mr Iqbal Sharma’s 
affidavit. You do so starting from paragraph eight on page three of your 
10 
witness statement, please take us through the contents of that 
paragraph and what you are conveying to the Chair. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Chair Mr Sharma, in his affidavit indicated 
that on paragraph 11 of that, that I requested him to draft letters for – I 
requested him to draft these letters for me and of course, it is not 
correct it is not true because the office also had legal advices, we’re 
capable of doing this type of work besides also that one being a 
teacher for a very long time and one could not ask a person to draft 
you any letter that you want to do especially with the expertise that  we 
had in the disposal in the office and the fact that we are not talking  
20 
about a person who is not knowledgeable especially about the running 
of – in the Public Sector he’s a former senior employee of a State 
owned company and he’s well clued with the Public Finance 
Management Act one of 1999 as amended and he…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you now talking about – who are you talking 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 72 of 134 
 
about when you say he’s well clued in whatever? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   I’m talking about the – on page four number 
nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   I’d indicated here – here the page eight I 
deny the fact that he said I asked him – I requested him to draft 
this…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you’re talking about Mr Sharma, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes Mr Sharma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay that’s fine, I thought I… 
10 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   And the fact that he was a very senior 
employee at one of the State owned companies, he’s knowledge in as 
far as the Act and the Regulation that pertain to the kind of work, he 
should have known, I mean he’s more clued up and he’s knowledge far 
exceeds mine.  But it does not explain, why, in his view given his 
prowess in the legislative from work, did he find it, you know a 
[indistinct] to deal with me as the MEC, instead of dealing with the 
Accounting Officer of the Department.  The question is, why would a 
person persist in dealing with a Politician when he knows that in terms 
of the administration the head of the department would be the one who 
20 
would deal with all these matters.  So  I think the only thing that  one 
could conclude is that it falls within the practice that has fallen – the 
Public Sector in the sense that you – once you get hold of the head, 
despite the fact that you would hear from time to time political heads or 
Executives will always be proud stating that they don’t sign anything 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 73 of 134 
 
the, you know and every time putting the officials under the bus but the 
fact of the matter is that once you have a MEC or these political heads 
it is easy – once you are finished with him, it is easy for  you to get 
what you want because…[intervenes]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   What do you mean when you say 
finished about him, I mean it …[intervenes]. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   I’ll make an example, I think what he was 
doing here, he believed it will be easy for him to get into the 
department and get what he wants, if he were to  convince me to do 
what they wanted me to do and once we have the hearing of a Politician 
10 
in this matter it will be easy to go to the officials and I would further, as 
we go, when we start with what we’re here for, I will demonstrate why I 
find it very, very disturbing every time that most capable officials have 
found themselves in a predicament where they are given instructions by 
their political heads and when it becomes hot they are just pushed 
under the bus and the Politicians will not take responsibility.  So I will 
demonstrate that but I’m just saying this was very simple that once he 
agrees it will be easy for him and it is for that reason that I think it was 
a clear instruction from Magashule as I say it was in furtherance of 
advancing the commercial interests of the Gupta’s at that time. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Are you now aligning what you’re saying 
with what you stated to the Chairperson in a previous testimony? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   When we – at the Gupta compound? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 74 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I wanted to say, you know when I asked you 
who you were talking about, when you talked about him having certain 
expertise you mentioned that it was Mr Sharma, it seemed a little odd 
to refer to he’s experience and expertise in circumstances where you 
were saying you wouldn’t have made it – him to do the letters for you, 
you understand.  What one would expect is something along the line 
that, look, I didn’t need him because I had this capacity, which you did 
say, the department had the capacity but maybe to compare and show 
that whatever experience or expertise he had really didn’t match that 
which you had therefore you would have no reason to need him to do 
10 
anything, I think that’s what kind of confused me. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Can I help the Chairperson from that 
confusion? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   The page eight, you know, the paragraph 
eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph eight ja. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Deals with the drafting of the letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   That is where I’m saying I had this skills in 
20 
the office so I did not need him to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the drafting. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   On the paragraph nine I’m not dealing with 
the drafting of the – I’m dealing with him knowing…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s a follow-up – it’s not a follow-up on earlier 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 75 of 134 
 
points. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   No it’s not a follow-up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s a different point. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes I’m saying I’m raising this matter that 
for him to be dealing with me he would have known that the best person 
you should go to would be the HOD not this, so I’m just stating that as 
a fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so effectively the point you make at paragraph 
nine is to say, I’ve dealt with the question of drafting and the capacity 
to draft, I say I had that the department had that I didn’t need him to 
10 
draft letters for me, that’s one point but then you say – in effect what 
you’re saying on his own version he sought to deal with me as MEC and 
yet because of his knowledge of the PFMA and the fact that he had 
been a senior employee of a State owned company, he should know 
that he should – I wasn’t the person he should have dealt with, maybe 
he should have dealt with the Head of Department, that’s the point 
you’re making, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes that’s the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you must say if I don’t understand the point 
you’re making, do I understand it correctly? 
20 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   You do, you do now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, thank you, okay let’s proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   May I now refer you to page – 
paragraph 10…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice has gone down Mr Mokoena at least from 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 76 of 134 
 
my side where I am. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair it might be the effects of 
lunch, if I may refer you to paragraph 10 Mr Dukwana where you are 
now referring to a document that was Annexed to Mr Sharma’s affidavit 
and you’re making certain remarks about that document. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   If you check this statement that was marked 
IS1, the copy of a tender or special development of the Machabeng 
local Municipality and what is very interesting here is, whatever was 
happening with the special planning framework, development framework 
of the Machabeng Local Municipality had nothing to do with the concept 
10 
of a new city.  So even when we were thinking about this and when I 
went to the Municipality to present the idea of building a new city, 
specially after the 1994 elections where we were saying, for us to be  - 
to do justice to the special setting we needed to build a city that would 
not have the hallmarks of the other cities that were built before 1994 
and I presented this, without the knowledge of the tender that they had 
issued out and for him to link this is actually not correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   So you are disputing what he’s saying in 
his answering affidavit in line with that document? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   I do. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes, now you make reference to one 
person called Tshepiso Magashule from paragraph 11, before we deal 
with those contents could you explain as to how do you know him and 
who is he? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Tshepiso Magashule is the son to the then 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 77 of 134 
 
Premier of the Free State, Ace Magashule, I know him as a 
businessman but also as a son to Ace…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you must just indicate that when you say 
businessman, you seem to put that in quotation marks with your hand, 
is that correct or am I misreading what you are doing with your hand? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Chairperson you see…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it something I should take note of or is it 
something I shouldn’t take note of? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   No, there aren’t many people you’d find 
outside who will you that they are business people, they are 
10 
businessmen but you will only see their lifestyles etcetera but you’re 
not linking with any business whatsoever and even if you were to 
check, you know, you won’t find him linked with any person, I’m not 
talking about him specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes just in general. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   I’m talking about people who go around, 
everybody whilst you get into a tender you just tender and you’re not 
doing the work that you are tendering for, you have no skills, you get 
the tender give it to somebody else you get the money, you call 
yourself a businessman.  So I’m using this term adversely that not 
20 
everybody who calls himself a businessman is a businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   So in this case he was referring to him as a 
businessman and that he knew him as a businessman that’s what, in his 
statement how he described him.  So I’m just saying, trying to indicate 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 78 of 134 
 
from his statement also he was being disingenuous in the sense that 
Tshepiso Magashule not only as a businessman, he knew him very well 
but to just put it – to create a situation that they’re only meeting as 
businessmen is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words you’re saying he knows much more 
about him than simply that he’s a businessman? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   He does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   He does. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Now let’s deal with the specifics of that 
10 
paragraph in order to place your evidence in its proper context.   
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   He believed that – he sent him an email 
trying to ask him to facilitate such a meeting and what I’m just saying is 
there was nothing wrong for him if he had a [indistinct] in the proposal 
to actually ask me to meet me and explain what he wanted to do.  
There was no need for them to go to him, if you check this – that’s why 
I used this, you know…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The quotation marks? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes just to demonstrate that here it was 
coming as a pressure, if you check what I said at paragraph nine and 
20 
this one, you would understand the content of what I raise in that, that 
in this case the intention is to, whilst – people believe whilst you have 
Tshepiso coming to me or Tshepiso arranges such a meeting I will then 
tremble and then grant them such.  So I’m just saying people who 
mention that he is the son to the Premier and all those things.  He was 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 79 of 134 
 
doing that deliberately hoping that it will influence me, but I’m just 
saying there was no need for such.  If he want to meet me, you can just 
arrange for such a meeting and do that, that’s what the contention of 
this paragraph is all about. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   You may then proceed to canvas 
paragraph 12 of your statement Mr Dukwana. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   For instance I would not have met a person 
to speak about the lapsed tender as they state here that our discussion 
was the idea that they had – and the way forward in relation to a new 
concept for the lapsed tender.  So I did not have any clue of any of the 
10 
tenders that the Municipality had issued and besides that, I’m staying 
in Welkom and people who were in that Municipality at the time, this 
was discussed, peopled I know very well and I would have been aware 
if there was something of this nature and as I say I don’t think here the 
person was telling the truth, he was very [indistinct] with the truth 
especially with regard to the statement he raised about the purpose of 
our meeting that he’s not telling the truth in that regard. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes you also reacted to Mr Sharma’s 
paragraph 10 and you dispute the assertions that are contained therein, 
you do so in paragraph 11, Mr Dukwana. 
20 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   This also, I’m going to put some context at a 
later stage but in this case the most important thing, Chairperson, is 
that when you get the kind of information for instance the desire was 
coming from us and we wanted to do that we wanted to build this, we 
were engaging people that we could have as partners.  It will be my 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 80 of 134 
 
responsibility as the MEC to engage with the HOD to really prepare a 
submission that will go to Exco but if they have unsolicited bids then 
they are free to approach the Premier or would come to the office and 
engage with the HOD who would then prepare these – this is a normal 
practice that will be there but in the Free State, I will come and explain 
that a new system and a new culture emerged.  So this paragraph, also 
that the – Mr Sharma refers to that I advised them to approach the 
Provincial Executive Committee.  Look at the logic of the whole 
statement, it is not them that is P3 and Yolane, that’s Mr Sharma and 
the other person, that were interested in the building.  It’s initiative 
10 
coming from us to say we want to do this and opening up and 
discussing with other people you will discuss with them and they came 
also to say, they are interested to do this.  So I would not logically I 
would not just – now that the idea is ours and then I turn to somebody 
and say go to – you advice you go to the – make a submission to the 
Provincial Executive Committee.  In any case the memo – I’m going to 
demonstrate why this is a problem because it happened in one 
Executive meeting, it’s part of the issues that I will raise, that an office 
that was not aligned department – line function department presented a 
memo in the Executive Council and there was a problem with the 
20 
consent MEC and in this case if you bring anything to the Executive 
Committee it has to go through the department making a submission, 
under normal circumstances that will be the fact but in any rate as 
you’ll see Chairperson, even when the matter was presented, I was not 
even in the Executive at that time, I did not even present the matter.  If 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 81 of 134 
 
it was so, why would the MEC who was acting on my behalf at that 
time, take the matter to Exco if the advice was for them to go to Exco, 
them to go to Exco. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes so you’re distancing yourself from 
what Mr Sharma is saying in his statement? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   In the statement, yes I do. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Now if you may summarise for us what 
you are dealing with from page six you dedicate part C of your 
statement to deal with the documents that were Annexed to Mr 
Sharma’s affidavit, if you can summarise those issues which you 
10 
believe are critical for you to outline to the Chair in relation to the 
documents. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Can I paint a picture, Chairperson, here we 
are sitting in a meeting, it’s myself, Mr Sharma and the other 
gentlemen, Mr Thomas for P3 and then a document is presented and 
then this document is going to create – help create a project that is 
worth billions of rands.  I’m sitting in the meeting with the gentlemen 
and to also give the background in what I’m going to say, I was the 
speaker of the legislature for a very long time and I got to understand a 
number of things and how to deal with these issues but sitting there, 
20 
here’s a witness, they sign, I sign as a HOD and I sign as a MEC.  The 
two gentlemen are sitting there looking at me signing as a HOD, signing 
as a MEC and then signing and they’re signing and we don’t have any 
witnesses and then they go out with the document which of course you 
will not find this document in the department except even when we were 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 82 of 134 
 
looking for information we could not find that but then the document 
surfaces and then they say, this is where I signed, I signed both as a 
HOD as well as a MEC.  Now if it does not sound strange that here I’m 
sitting with people, as I said earlier who’s knowledgeable, he’s looking 
at me signing and not even suggesting that, hey what are you doing, 
why are you signing but if you check the two signatures you will find 
that they are not identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to go to that document Mr Mokoena if you can 
tell me where it is? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes Chair I’m just about to go to it, the 
10 
document will be found at Mr Sharma’s [indistinct] statement Chair if I 
may go to it on page… 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am at page one of Mr Sharma’s statement or is it 
one of the Annexures? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   It’s page 36 and I think page 38, would 
that be the document Mr Dukwana? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes that is the document that the 
witness is referring to Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Now in line with that document, now 
that we have opened page 17 and 18 you can demonstrate the point to 
the Chair with reference to that document. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   If you check it says, the witness- the parties 
hereto have caused this argument to be executed by their respective 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 83 of 134 
 
duly authorised offices.  For the Provincial Government of the Free 
State acting through its Department of Economic Development, Tourism 
and Environmental Affairs there’s a signature and then it says Head of 
the Department, Provincial Government of the Free State and it’s 
written M A Dukwana 5 t h October and I’ve said this over and over 
Chairperson that despite the fact that when I write I write Dukwana as 
Dukwana, you have it again on page 18 and you have it there at page 
18.  So that is why I said if the Commission so wishes can take these 
two signatures because as I say I would not be that stupid to sign here 
and to sign also as a MEC.  In this I was representing the Provincial 
10 
Government as a member of the Executive Council and then doing this. 
When they did this with Mr – that is Mr Sharma and the other – Mr 
Thomas, now  and as you know Chairperson in every document that you 
sign there will be witnesses and this one also would not have been an 
exception so I would be signing a document and the document signed 
by me there would of course be a witness, in this case there’s none and 
here also he’s signing and if you check the witness 1, there is space for 
witness in the document but nobody signed in those gaps including the 
consortium itself of Yolane Management and P3 International.  It is with 
that in mind that I request the Commission do a thorough investigation 
20 
into the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I see that it looks like no date is reflected as to 
when – no date is reflected on the document as to when the signatures 
were appended is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   The date is there is the 5 t h of October 2011. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 84 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it’s – okay it’s written below the name- no thank 
you but I don’t know what – Mr Sharma has not had a chance to 
respond to your supplementary affidavit is that correct? So he doesn’t 
know what his response is to…[intervenes]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC: No he was responding to the initial 
statement of Mr Dukwana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So this is the response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what I am asking is whether [intervention]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Exhibit – yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is whether Mr Sharma is as – is aware of Mr 
Dukwana’s response to his statement? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Oh yes.  He was also [intervention]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was given. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We did furnish him with the 3.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the relevant portions of the 
statement definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there has been no reaction? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There has not been any reaction Mr 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well [intervention]. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You would recall Mr Chair that also in my 
– when we opened – in our opening remarks when we dealt with the 
different individuals. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 85 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We indicated that he was one of the 
persons that was favoured with the statement of Mr Dukwana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well – we will hear what he will come when he 
says here but it is quite strange because I guess you may have a 
situation where one signs the same document in two different places 
where Mr Dukwana signs for himself as MEC.  And then maybe he signs 
in the place of the Head of Department on behalf of the department PP.  
The Head of Department theoretically that could happen.  But maybe if 
you talking about the structure of a Provincial Government that the one 
10 
is a political head the other one is a civil servant it could make – it 
could cause problems even then.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I see that here it is not even PP   As I see it – it 
is seems that the person who signs in both places holds both positions 
as MEC and as Head of Department. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At the same – at the same time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and of course that is a legal impossibility.  So 
that is –  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That seems quite – really strange. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  But Mr Dukwana maybe to remind 
the Chair in your early testimony when you commenced with your 
evidence in April you indicated that your legal team did bring an 
application in the Free State court where certain documents were 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 86 of 134 
 
sought, am I correct? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  You are correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that there was an understanding 
that you were going to be favoured with certain documents.  Was this 
document ever produced officially by the government of Free State? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me go back to the question – to the issue on 
which I have just remarked.  You set out your – your history from 1994 
– your – the positions you have held in government in the Free State 
Province but you also set out your history to some extent as a member 
10 
of the ruling party and as an activist.  Have you ever known of anybody 
in any province who has held the position of MEC and Head of 
Department at the same time since 1994? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is not allowed.  It cannot happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It can happen.  It does not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have never heard of anybody who does that? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  No I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I have not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now if I may refer you to page 7 of your 
statement.  You make a further point on paragraph 22 and 23 as to why 
you are distancing yourself from the averments contained in Mr 
Sharma’s affidavit.  Please take us through what you have stated 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 87 of 134 
 
therein? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  The – the Premier I think we were also 
demonstrate issued a directive that [intervention]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Dukwana.  I do not know if it is me but 
both you and Mr Mokoena are – your voices are very soft this 
afternoon.  Please try and raise it if you can?  Last time I did not have 
any difficulty hearing you. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is food, it is food, it is food. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I am saying Chair that the most important 
10 
thing is that the – the then Director General issued a statement 
indicating that all contracts or any contract that is to entered into they 
should go to the state law advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the Director General of the Province? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Ja the then Director General of the Province 
Doctor Nohela [?] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Doctor Ngwenya. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Nohela.[?] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  The – that is something that I will also talk 
20 
to.  And in this – in this – and also the fact that in the department we 
have got legal people who would do the drafting of these documents. 
And at any rate once you have a document like this and you say it is 
legal this was the same document that Mr Sharma used at some stage 
when they wanted payment.  And if I had signed the document I will be 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 88 of 134 
 
the worried person who would want to see payment made but there 
were so many threats coming from him in relation to taking us to court 
about all these and making so many allegations.  But that – those 
threats never saw the day of light or the light of day.  And the – all I am 
trying to say is when people do these kinds of things and go out and 
threaten us that you have signed a document and therefore you must 
deliver on the document it was at that time because we – when we met 
with them we wanted – we were still getting information.  We only 
indicated to them – I personally said to them they should come in and 
we arranged for them to have a workshop with the staff.  And then we – 
10 
there they will understand because we had established a team.  So they 
will then get to understand what exactly we want.  But for them even 
before we had finalised that process they had issued – they wanted to 
be paid you know an amount that they requested at the time.  And if 
you recall in the previous submission that where we pointed out that 
they – they had indicated when we met with Pitri [?].  Pitri [?] was 
willing to help us in terms of the pilot project that we wanted to do first.  
They would get the information and then they will do it at their own 
expenses but at a later stage we were armed with this document.  
There was a request for payment and I declined such request because 
20 
it was not what we had agreed with these people.  You would – you will 
recall – you will remember also the fact that this thing happened and at 
a later stage there was a request to visit the Gupta’s compound.  If I 
had signed and agreed to this thing I do not think there would have 
been any need for me to go to the Gupta Compound.  So this is exactly 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 89 of 134 
 
what I am just stating as a fact that and giving that context that I am 
not just denying you know saying this and then it is not possible and 
that I did not do that.  I am just saying these things as they are 
presented here are not reflecting the truth of what exactly aspired – 
happened when we met.  And we were not meeting only them.  And the 
fact that they then wanted the project to be run by them we you needed 
to go out on a tender.  It is a huge amount of money.  It is a huge 
project.  It was going to be a huge project.  You would not just do a 
project like that without going to be a tender and allowing the 
processes to continue.  But they thought that it would be easy that is 
10 
why I was saying once they have the – the MEC they thought that it will 
be easy and then they can get whatever they wanted.  So when I 
refused this payment they went to the HOD and the HOD also did not 
want himself involved in this.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And then they threatened to go to court and 
up until I was fired in 2012 nothing happened to this. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can we now move to deal with something 
slightly different arising from your statement?  You are mentioning 
certain threats which were made by Mr Magashule pursuant to you 
20 
having testified in this commission.  You begin dealing with those from 
paragraph 27 on page 8 of your statement.  If you can explain to the 
Chair? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Chairperson I have – on the [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Dukwana I just want to say for the 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 90 of 134 
 
benefit of the technicians I think there is something they have done 
which has made both of you quite audible to me now.  I am saying it so 
that in future if I have complaints they can remember what they did.  
Whatever it is.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair we are told that – we are told that 
the [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the air conditioner. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The air conditioner is interfering with our 
voices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh okay.  Then next time they will know it is the 
10 
air conditioner.  Now I can hear both of you very well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  In this paragraph I stated the fact that on the 
5 t h April after my being here at the commission Mr Magashule was 
interviewed by Mr Samkele Maseko from ENCA and in that interview he 
intimated that he was going to take me to court.  And upon hearing that 
I without delay instructed my attorney to address a letter to him to 
receive any court documents pertaining to his legal threats. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words you wanted to make it easy for him 
20 
that if he wanted to sue you he knew where to take the papers to? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I know that because I was no longer in 
government.  It would be difficult for him to – because I do not think he 
knows [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe to find you? 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 91 of 134 
 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes I did not want to make it difficult for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So I then asked my lawyers to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not want him to say I have been looking for 
this man I cannot find him.  I want to serve him with court papers. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Exactly I was making it easier for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  May I refer you to page 35 and provide 
some [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 35 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  35? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  In order to provide context to what 
you have stated to the Chair and if you may identify that document for 
us? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is a document from Mashala Komani 
Masekela Attorneys. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And who are they? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  They are my attorneys. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now what does it say re – what is 
20 
the subject of this correspondence? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It was addressed to Mr Elias Sekgobela 
Magashule through Thuli House and the address is given and the date 
was on the 9 t h April.  And then it is service of court [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can read the letter. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 92 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes please read the letter. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   
“We act for and on behalf of Mr Mxolisi Dukwana our 
client who on the 5 t h April 2019 testified at the 
commission of state capture before Deputy Chief 
Justice Raymond Zondo.  Our client learnt through 
the media that you intend approaching the courts in 
relation to his testimony at the commission and 
instructs us to receive all the correspondence and or 
court papers on his behalf.  We urge you to direct 
10 
any 
correspondence 
and 
or 
serve 
any 
court 
documents to us. We trust that you will find the 
above in order” 
It is signed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And if you may turn to page 36.  36 
Chair.  And if you may also identify that correspondence for us who it 
was intended to and the contents of that email? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is a letter to Mr Magashule.  It is from the 
office I suppose.  ANC 1912 from Maseko, Pule Maseko.  It was signed 
on the 10 t h April and it says: 
20 
“Good morning Ma’am kindly take note that the office 
of ANC SG Comrade Ace Magashule has received 
your email on the 10 t h April 2019.  From Pule Maseko 
PA of the ANC SG” 
And the number is there. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 93 of 134 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So this confirms that it – this 
correspondence was indeed received by the office of Mr Magashule? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And from that date when he threatened 
legal action against you do you know if anything has happened? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  My legal team has not informed me of that 
therefore I take it; it has not come to – to pass. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May I then refer you back to your 
statement with particular reference to page 8 and you may proceed 
please dealing with the contents – the last paragraph just to put 
10 
context on paragraph 28? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Chair I am stating here that to date my 
attorneys have not received any correspondence such as a letter of 
demand for me to retract my submissions at the commission or legal 
documents from Mr Magashule.  I stand ready to face Mr Magashule at 
any court in the Republic. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  So you maintain your evidence 
which you have actually conveyed and stated or adduced before this 
commission before the Chair? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I do whole heartedly. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to paragraph – 
to page 9 where you are providing the Chair with the reasons as to why 
you deemed it necessary to provide evidence to this commission?  You 
may proceed to summarise paragraph 29 and 30 of your statement 
please. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 94 of 134 
 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  The – the ANC in its National Conference 
known – commonly known as the NASREC Conference in 2017.  One of 
the resolutions that they – that was accepted and came out of that 
conference was for – was encouraging members of the ANC. 
1. To fight corruption with everything that they have and where they 
know 
of 
any 
corrupt 
activities 
they 
should 
report 
that.  
Encouraging every member of the ANC to come to with evidence 
that they have at their disposal – at their disposal to come to the 
commission. 
And as you would know Chair there has been so much noise about 
10 
implementation of the – of the conference resolution.  And many people 
only think of those that relate to radical economic transformation.  
There are many.  Building the organisation etcetera, etcetera, etcetera 
including this one.  And – and as a member of the ANC, disciplined 
member of the ANC as I said earlier that there is an ANC that I know 
that I got to know very well when as an ex official member of the ANC 
back in 1991 when there were leaders at the time as I said where one 
got an opportunity to drink in the well of such greatness.  And 
understanding the ANC and not the – what we see happening now.  I 
then felt that as a disciplined member of the ANC I needed to respond 
20 
to this call.  And that is why despite the fact that there are risks 
involved appearing at the commission.  You know so one was 
responding to this call and notwithstanding the risk that is involved.  
But one thing that is driving one to come to the commission here is 
because we were left a legacy and by generations before us and it is 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 95 of 134 
 
important for us to leave a legacy for many generations.  I am not doing 
it for this generation here I raising this matter because once we allow 
corruption to be endemic as you would see when I deal with some of 
the issues on the side that once corruption becomes normal it becomes 
difficult for us as a nation to – to bring up responsible adults.  And you 
need people with ethics to be leaders in society.  But once you get – I 
will make an example.  In one ward when people were told that this 
Mayor is actually stealing the money from the Municipality and you are 
suffering.  Some in one ward were saying but at least he – he is giving 
us some.  So people do not care about the consequences of this as 
10 
long as they are getting something.  And I believe that it is our 
responsibility all of us that we should stand up if we truly love this 
country and deal with this – this thing that is destroying our country.  
And if you can get every member of our society especially in the ANC 
as the ruling party – if you can get them to detest corruption, fraud and 
everything I think it will help.  It will go a long way to deal with this.  
But also I am very mindful of the fact that you are not going to fight 
corruption by only raising these matters.  We have also set up a 
community you know forum and where we think we will use this to train, 
educate and empower our own citizens to be very active.  I was 
20 
encouraged Chair when especially when the reports – the newspaper 
were raising a matter about the funding of the campaign of now the 
President.  And that everything was put there.  It was encouraging to 
realise that there is so much excitement in terms of engaging from our 
own people to engage things that they say they do not like.  But at the 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 96 of 134 
 
same time I was disappointed that the Auditor General had raised so 
many other things especially in the Municipalities what has been 
happening.  Monies misappropriated etcetera.  And the same energy 
was not demonstrated by the – our public in terms of raising these 
issues.  The – all I am just saying not justifying some of the things 
because also at the time I was also responsible in the campaign and 
when people raise these matters one thing that people did not know 
that one participated in many campaigns starting from the campaign 
that was in Polokwane.  I think if people can be honest and understand 
what happened they will realise that these things started long time ago 
10 
in doing this.  And it was encouraging that people were starting to say 
it – it is wrong to do certain things and it affects the standing of any 
person if certain things are not done the proper way.  But people do not 
understand that at the time also some of us when we were saying in the 
commission but hey you guys want to go this way, you want us to sign 
things, you want us to – you have bank accounts, you do this.  It does 
not happen and people say no, no we want to make sure that whatever 
money we get we can account for that.  The only way we can account 
for this is to make sure that there are no plastic bags full of money 
going out.  And as I am sitting here I am very proud to have been a 
20 
member of that campaign and made sure even that when they were 
raising all these issues that I – we can actually say you can have a – 
still have some reports where I can show that this is where the money 
went.  But if you check nobody also cares to ask what happened to 
other campaigns?  If you remember Chairperson also that the – when 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 97 of 134 
 
the DA was in the campaign for leadership in 2015 the person who was 
contesting Musi Maimane.  I think it is Wilma James I think raised – 
challenged Musi Maimane to declare the source of the funding of his 
campaign and on the 29 t h April I think 2015 and the 30 t h there were 
some statements, some reports that were made where they indicated 
that it had nothing to do with the public but it was an internal matter of 
the party and the – and the fact that the donors or those who were 
giving out money had requested to remain anonymous they will defend 
that.  Even – so I am just saying that this matter was much bigger than 
all the people looking at the – at what happened at the CR17 campaign.  
10 
So I am raising this matter just to say as members who are disciplined 
there are things that we know sometimes we get off the road but when 
people raise these matters and started engaging and you see the sieve 
that people were raising about the possibility of being captured 
etcetera I also in some indi – in some cases I said the same precedent 
with this foundation raising money and going even in our province we 
became number 1 province in education.  Money – money that was 
spent in dealing with were coming from the Cyril Ramophosa 
Foundation and contributed immensely.  At the time nobody said 
because you are receiving money from those who are said to be our 
20 
white compatriots’ etcetera therefore nobody went to you and said we 
will not accept this money it comes from this white people, white 
business people.  But it helped and for one to suggest at any given 
time that if you are given an opportunity to contest and money spent 
and somebody spent money for you that automatically opens up you to 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 98 of 134 
 
being aboard etcetera, etcetera.  What happens to those who 
contributed money and they did not make it.  So I am – all I am trying 
to say is all of us have a responsibility as members of the society to 
make sure that when we see things that are not going according you 
know – some – what we expect as our values in society.  I have my 
value system but once I get into a group I get also to understand the 
value system of that or the culture of that group.  And if it does not all 
go well with my value system I walk away.  But if the – if the 
organisation then swallows your value system it leaves you shallow.  It 
leaves you inhuman.  You do not feel.  You will not live.  You will not 
10 
contribute.  So that why I am saying that [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess the point that you are – you are really making 
without going astray is simply that you feel that both as a citizen and 
as a member of the ANC having regard to the values of the ANC as you 
understand them.  Having regard to one of the resolutions that was 
passed by the ANC at conference in 2017 December you feel that you 
have an obligation because you know that certain things happened that 
fall within the terms of reference of this commission to come forward in 
response to that call made by the ANC through that resolution to come 
forward and share with the commission what you know. 
20 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  That is correct Chair. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 99 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I - I - you may have heard that I have said quite 
a few times that I believe that there must be many past and present 
Ministers, Deputy Ministers and Directors-General and other senior 
officials who - who know some things that happened that would fall 
within the terms of reference of this Commission over the years and 
that I still think that the number of Ministers, Deputy Ministers past and 
present and Directors-General who have come forward to this 
Commission to assist it is - is very - is a very small number compared 
to all those numbers and I do not know whether because when you talk 
about that - those categories of people most of them would - would be 
10 
people who are - who come from the ruling party. 
I do not know whether any of them who may be having 
knowledge of lots of matters relating to state capture and matters 
relating to corruption that fall within the terms of reference of the 
Commission are not coming forward because they think if they come 
forward and expose these - these things and tell the Commission and 
the nation what they know maybe they feel as if they will be putting 
their party in a bad light and that it will be - it may be construed as if 
they are not loyal but I do not know whether you can enhance the 
status of your organisation by sweeping corruption under the carpet 
20 
and things like that rather than coming forward but what you are saying 
is there is a specific resolution that encouraged all members who may 
have knowledge to come forward and to do something about these 
matters and you are responding to that call. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Chairperson somebody once said that for you 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 100 of 134 
 
to - sometimes you will need to go deeper - go down into the world for 
you to see the stars in daylight and sometimes you need to get to the 
bottom of things for you to be you know to - to see things clearly.  I do 
not think - in my view I do not think - you see there is a difference also 
that we need to look into what the ANC stands for and also people who 
come into the ANC. 
There are those who just joined the ANC because they think 
by associating with the ANC they will get certain things but there are 
those who are revolutionary who were activists at some stage when 
there was - there was nothing for them.  It was risky just to be involved 
10 
in these things with no rewards whatsoever.  I am talking to - to such 
individuals that who understand exactly whilst other people had 
sacrificed with their lives for us to be where we are and I do not think it 
puts the organisation in - in a bad light when we deal with these 
matters because the fact of the matter is you are not going to do 
anything drastic you know as you say radical economic transformation 
when there is so much corruption prevalent in society. 
Services are becoming expensive because you have leaders 
who are not dedicated in making sure that the laws the Acts everything 
that have been passed to make sure that we have got good governance 
20 
are implemented.  As leaders making sure that these things do happen 
and - and you find yourself entangled in that.  What suffers is then the 
implementation of some of these resolutions. 
So it is therefore very important that the work of the 
Commission should be enhanced and make sure that all those who 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 101 of 134 
 
know anything should come forward because once you do that you are 
able to cleanse even your organisation and clean society because what 
is happening in the ANC is a microcosm of our society you know.  It 
was not surprising at some stage when it was reported recently that in 
one school in KZN children were demanding that there should be an 
one hour smoke break you know and if - if you find such things 
happening as a parent as a citizen you should be worried. 
Where are we going?  You know.  So I am just saying this is a 
problem that we need to fix.  It is not only about economy, about this.  
You need also to look into your - your society and fix this what is 
10 
happening what is wrong in - in our society.  Once you have that you 
would have a better way of dealing with all the challenges that you 
have because you would have everybody understanding what is 
happening. 
If you go - if we - we leave this.  For instance you would have 
police you know sometimes I am asked in Welkom why are police not 
doing - why not - why are they not arresting these people are all over 
you know especially illegal miners etcetera.  I was shocked when one 
policeman said to me you know the problem is we arrest these people. 
When we get to the police station this person will then claim 
20 
that he had 100 000 in his pocket and you stole that money.  He wants 
it and then what is going to happen.  There is going to be a 
departmental investigation taken and sometimes these police go 
through these difficult things and because we are not dealing with this 
we are not dealing with corruption and uprooting it. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 102 of 134 
 
Some others now get involved and they see there is no value 
in arresting these people.  What do we do?  We get into this.  So there 
is that logic now coming in, in our society and the other fact 
Chairperson is that people are so tired of Commissions after 
Commissions after Commission.  People want to see these people 
getting arrested but once they do not see this thing happening people 
get discouraged. 
As I am sitting here and as I said earlier on the unfortunate 
thing that is happening is the thread to a breed of professionals in the - 
in the Public Sector and many have been destroyed.  You talk about 
10 
Brian Molefe very brilliant guy but because of these things you have 
lost such brilliance you know and there are many others that are out 
there.  Others are afraid Chair. 
There - if you check in our society now especially in the 
Public Administration if you can do you know research you will find 
many especially in the senior management position.  Many of them 
have one way or another admitted for - for depression because they are 
giving instructions that are very different.  They know I cannot do this 
but because they have seen that if you do not do this there are 
possibilities. 
20 
You are going to lose your job or you are not going to get any 
promotion and - and that is a problem.  So I am just saying for us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am interrupting you.  You see that - that 
is part of my problem because precisely what you say from what one 
has - has heard from people and read over the years one would have 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 103 of 134 
 
thought that there would be a number of people fall within the 
categories that I mentioned earlier whether it is a DG or a Deputy DG 
who says I was in charge of a department - of that department and this 
is what happened or I was a Deputy Minister. 
I became aware of this or I was a Minister.  I became aware 
of this and so on and to the extent that one is talking about DGs, 
Deputy DGs and maybe lower officials.  They are not coming forward to 
say well for example I was instructed to give this tender to so and so 
and yet there may well be many such cases and - and what part of what 
is worrying is why do we have so few people who are prepared to stand 
10 
for the truth and say this cannot be allowed to continue. 
You referred a few minutes ago to an era in our country 
where a lot of people were prepared to stand up for the truth and for 
justice when there was no reward or monetary reward or reward for 
them personally.  That would be there for standing for the truth.  Who 
were prepared to take risks, who were prepared to leave their families 
and go into exile, spend time in jail, be detained, be beaten up by the 
police - apartheid police - and stay true to the truth and where are 
those big numbers now. 
We knew that there were big numbers of people who were like 
20 
that and some many of them are around and - and - but people - the 
numbers of people who are coming forward who fall into the categories 
that I am talking about are very you know small.  I mean we - we 
appreciate and greatly appreciate those numbers those people who 
have come forward and we commend them. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 104 of 134 
 
It is good but one just feels that the numbers are small.  
There must be so many people in the provinces, in municipalities, in 
national departments who know a lot of things but who are keeping 
quiet who are not saying this is our country.  I owe loyalty to this 
country and I am going to go forward and tell the nation what I know.  
So that there is a chance that this country can change for the better. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Dukwana we have heard the Chair’s 
plea and I am sure that you have also tried to articulate the reasons 
why you thought it - you deemed it necessary to come before this 
Commission.  If you may now deal with … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Before that Mr Mokoena. Mr Dukwana do 
you want to say anything to that? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Chair there are many people out there who 
are willing to come to the Commission.  If Chair remembers the last 
time I was here I indicated that the fact that some people think that it is 
only English and I saw that there were people who had … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Translators. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  There were translations and many people are 
excited you now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I remember you said that. 
20 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  But also you have a challenge.  You see 
toxic leaders have a way of dealing with things.  They instil fear and - 
and many of these people are - are left vulnerable.  Let me make an 
example.  There is a vide now - a video clip doing rounds in - in my 
province of one Mayor - ex Mayor who was making threats about a 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 105 of 134 
 
person in the supply chain who was alleged to have given information 
either to the Public Protector or to the Hawks and these people were 
there and you know this Mayor was going on and on and on threatening 
them and know - we know you. 
We know your phones.  We have seen.  We know.  We can 
track your - your email.  You send this email and then you started using 
that and doing this and we are not going to be working with such people 
and we will take you - you will go home and you will stay home.  So if - 
if you have these kinds of things in the environment that we have many 
of these people some of them are still in the employ of Government and 
10 
this is the only way that they have now you know and if you get fired 
because there is only something that is happening. 
You have many offers as politicians or these people in 
Government.  There is an issue that if I - if you fight me you fighting 
the State.  The resources that I am using to fight that are not mine, are 
the State resources.  You as a person you are using your own 
resources.  So I will make sure I deplete your resources fighting you. 
So I will go to court you know remind this - cause all these 
things and you have got to go on paying these lawyers.  Ultimately 
these people are sitting with such huge bills and then to face this.  So 
20 
what option do you have in this case when people knowing exactly that 
they are in the wrong but go back and use State coffers, State money 
to defend themselves and make sure that these poor people are left 
outside there and they lose everything. 
So people - there are people who just as I am saying there 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 106 of 134 
 
are willing participants but there are those who are not willing at all 
who feel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Very bad about what is happening … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And the little that they do.  In some cases 
these are the same people who would say to you I have this 
information.  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They give you the information. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes and then and then they - they you know 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They say do not mention my name. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  As long as you are not mentioning them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  As long as you do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So they are helping us in that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  They are not coming up but as I am saying 
also as - as a societal problem … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Where you have workers.  I will make an 
example.  They do not work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
during the week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 107 of 134 
 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  They do not see that as corruption.  It is 
quite corruption.  They do not see it as corruption … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  But they get paid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And then come Sunday come Saturday it is 
overtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  In one municipality for instance we have a 
person who is in hospital - who was in hospital at the time … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  But get paid his - his overtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So you have these kinds of things happening 
in our society. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So people think that it is only by stealing or 
doing this but also it is by omission you are not doing certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  You have got leaders who are not brave 
20 
enough … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  But also the fact is what do you do as these 
political leaders.  You appoint people you know that they are 
compromised and this is the case in the province.  If I know you are 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 108 of 134 
 
compromised and I have something against you so it is easy to make 
your call.  You will do these things … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And then we continue … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And I will be sitting there and saying I am 
not signing anything … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And that is the problem because …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  They - they do not take responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So I am hoping that there are many of the 
colleagues also in the ANC who will stand up … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who will stand up (intervenes). 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And who will come to the Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And help the work of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh, huh-uh. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Not to help the Zondo Commission but to 
20 
help South Africa … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Cleanse itself of this sickness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  That we are seeing now. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 109 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  In our society that undermines development, 
growth and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And all other things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No, thank - thank you Mr Dukwana.  I - I 
particularly wanted to hear the perspectives that you have given me 
about challenges in people who should be coming forward who may be 
having knowledge of things that fall within the terms of reference but 
who are not coming forward.  I have asked other witnesses who - who 
10 
were in Government also to share with me their perspectives because it 
is something that is quite concerning to me.  Yes, you may proceed 
Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Dukwana from paragraph 31 you 
trace your history with Mr Magashule and the role that you played in his 
career.  Could you please deal with those aspects from paragraphs 31 
and 32? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What page are you now? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am on - I am on page 9 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Paragraph 31 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Leading to paragraph 32. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I served with - with Ace Magashule from 
1992/1993/1994.  You will remember Chair I indicated that I was the 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 110 of 134 
 
first Chairperson of the ANC in the region when the ANC was unbanned 
and later on Ace Magashule came in and we started working and I knew 
him at the time and many other comrades and I also - I am reminded 
also of what happened when I was fired. 
The then SG called me to his office and he indicated that you 
see we wanted to save you from this but you were there speaking this 
English and defending this thing.  Now it bites you.  So the - the issue 
what I am trying to say here is I am one of the - of - of the people who - 
who in the Free State at the time worked with Ace.  We protected him. 
We defended him and this was at the time when we were - 
10 
there was an arrangement - agreement that whoever becomes the 
Chairperson of the province would become the Premier.  So it was a 
position that was taken by all branches.  So we defended that collective 
decision that was taken and made sure that we will defend him.  We will 
make sure that he comes in and becomes the Premier. 
Unfortunately the then President the late President Mandela 
did not appoint him as a Premier and then later on Thabo Mbeki did not 
do that.  President Thabo Mbeki did not do that and then it was only 
2009 after the conference in 2007 that he found himself here.  I am the 
person that when we came back from Polokwane we went to sit together 
20 
just to demonstrate some of the - we went to sit together at - at a hotel 
south - at the - what is this street? 
In one of the hotels in Sandton, Katherine Street Southern 
Sun and because I saw that in the conference there were two people 
who were popular in the conference at the time.  You would hear when 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 111 of 134 
 
the then President Zuma was coming in.  It would be that noise Zuma, 
Zuma, Zuma, Zuma and when Ace came in it will go Ace.  So - and then 
I - I - when we were together I asked him - I even indicated to him you - 
is it not time that you have out grown the Free State politics and go to 
national and we could engage to that level and I - I as we were 
speaking I got the feeling that he - he was actually hearing me and 
understanding what I was saying because I was saying if you check in 
the Government at the time we only had Mbalula who were coming from 
the Free State etcetera but not necessarily throughout structures. 
Mbalula at the time was in the Youth League and he was so in 
10 
the national level.  So we were saying as the Free State we have not 
been able to contribute in terms of leadership especially even at the 
national level and - and also Cabinet.  So I felt that it was my duty as a 
friend or so to talk to him heart to heart and we had that discussion and 
he was feeling like agreeing up until some people came in who later 
became business people who actually influenced him otherwise and it 
was at that point when he felt that I was pushing him out because I 
wanted to be the - the Chairperson. 
That is what people were saying at the time and that was not 
the case because we understood processes.  We had at the time who 
20 
was Deputy.  We had Comrade (indistinct) who was fairly capable of 
leading us and we were not in a hurry to lead as Chairperson at the 
time.  So we had the discussion and I - I sincerely believe that my 
coming here it is - it is not because I hate the person or what. 
It is out of love for - for some of these people that you know 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 112 of 134 
 
we are mentioning them here because I believe some of them do not 
sleep Chairperson very well.  You know when you have done something 
wrong and you feel - some of them do not even enjoy the money that 
they are having.  So the issue here is just to say when even at the time 
when in 1996/1997/1998 when - I think it was 1996 before we were 
disbanded. 
There was a - a case where Mr Magashule was accused of 
corruption by (indistinct) and because we felt that (indistinct) could 
have come to the organisation and dealt with this matter but wanted to 
do that solo we then rallied around Ace and defended him.  There is 
10 
one poor comrade who was - when Ace was removed as MEC and this 
comrade was in QwaQwa. 
He had to come and fetch the car.  Go out as MEC but when 
he came back he was no longer MEC.  So he became an MEC for a 
short while and - and replacing Ace Magashule but because of our 
efforts and everything we were able to overturn that - that decision and 
Comrade Ace became an MEC again and continued but that led to us 
being disbanded in 1996 as the PEC. 
So I am just saying the - these things that we see that we are 
raising here are - are very worrisome because the kind of a person I 
20 
came to know at that time when we - we were still at Masada in Welkom 
was a very caring individual Chairperson.  In fact he would buy clothes 
etcetera and if he gets people he would give them.  He was a person 
who was giving out and showing that - that he cared a lot about people. 
I do not know what happened and there was a sudden change 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 113 of 134 
 
and one - even when I did not support him at Nasrec.  I went to his 
office while he was still the Premier and in our discussion together with 
him I indicated to him - I showed him why - I indicated to him you know 
I do not support you even when - even as I am seated now here.  I think 
that it was not a good position I said to him and he knows this. 
I said to him not anywhere and I said I am worried.  I wonder 
whether these people are going to get their minutes because you are 
not the person who writes and all those things and sometimes you are 
going to chase those minutes and he jokingly said to me I am not going 
to write minutes.  It is going to be Comrade Jessie Duarte who will 
10 
write minutes and etcetera. 
So I am just saying just to demonstrate this even after the 
Nasrec Conference.  So when we went and met and discussed with him 
in - in his office.  I indicated to him that look you are not in this 
position.  It is either you going to make it difficult for any person who 
comes from the Free State to actually be recognised at the national 
level or you are going to make it easier for us if you now move away 
from the Free State and become the SG of the ANC all of us and I think 
it will work and I thought he - we understood each other.  As I left I had 
the impression that because he said he is willing to do that.  He wants 
20 
to do that.  He wants to be this but I was shocked that two days later 
one of the MECs told me that when they were in Botshabelo he was - 
he was you know telling them how he managed myself and Thabo.  That 
when Thabo came through this door and then he - he fetched me 
through this door so that myself and Thabo should not meet and then 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 114 of 134 
 
he says he was managing us.  Then I felt that I do not think the person 
would actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is the person you are referring to? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I am talking about Ace - Ace Magashule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As Thabo. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Who is Thabo? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is the person you are referring to as Thabo? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Thabo Manyoni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes and at that meeting I found Thabo there 
but we were put in different offices.  It was clear that it was meant for 
us not to meet but unfortunately nature called and Thabo had to come 
and he found me at the reception and then - then I said I do not know 
that you are here.  So now that you are here let us go and meet him 
together and I do not what happened. 
I waited I waited and after that I saw I was fetched by then 
Premier Ace Magashule into his office only to understand that when he 
fetched me he allowed Thabo to go out the other way and I was put in - 
so I am just saying that disappointed me a lot to say here is a person 
20 
you are trying to help because this is what we had done all the time. 
Trying to help him.  You know sometimes when we work with 
people you would understand your weaknesses and you will understand 
his weaknesses and you will think that you are saying to a person you 
can do this and become a better person.  So - but then I realised that I 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 115 of 134 
 
was - I was wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   So the essence of paragraph 31 and 32 
is that you are here to testify on the issues that you are raising not of 
any ill feelings with anyone but to provide the facts that falls within 
your knowledge.   
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Chairperson the difficulty and the one 
painful thing that has actually been with me since I came here it is 
people that I am going to talk about here are people that I was, you 
know I happen to know them very well, and these are people that I 
10 
associated and worked with etcetera, but to see such a change in 
people and see people changing other things, actually was very hurtful 
to say the least, but it is what it is.  I am here not because that I want 
to pull any person down, but I just want to put these facts and the facts 
will talk for themselves, and I just hope that sometime, some day action 
or actions will be taken against some of these people who are doing all 
these things with impunity.  
 
People are even proud to tell others that – and they use – it is 
a Sotho word [African language] you know and people will be proud to 
say we will do this to you, we would – some people proudly in public 
20 
platforms would say we will deal with you, you will go ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And they do nothing about it. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   And then you would be out of work and you 
will be you know you will be poor.  In some instances (indistinct) and 
we will take your wife, and this is how serious ...(intervention)  
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 116 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They say they will take your wife? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Yes, and then they use – in fact I am just 
using a better word here Chairperson because I don’t want to use the 
very strong words but in fact we have seen these things happen.  In the 
Province I see these things and many people see these things.  As I am 
speaking to you Chairperson I strongly believe there are many people 
in the Free State who are really, really hurt and who feel that nothing is 
being done to deal with this matter, but I will come to this at a later 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Chair loosely translated [African 
language] I will make sure that you are poor, I can’t take it any better 
than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughing]  I hear you Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Dukwana on paragraph 34, 33 and 
34 you then demonstrate  how Mr Magashule would be able to dispense 
patronage and you gave some of the examples, could you please talk to 
those paragraphs. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Chairperson ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Dukwana, just to go back to what you 
20 
were saying earlier on, in effect what you were telling me is that the 
situation is so bad that some of the people who are engaged in wrong 
things, who are engaged in corruption they will tell people in public if 
you do A, B, C, D meaning things that somebody could do if they are 
fighting corruption if you do that we will see to it, we will deal with you, 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 117 of 134 
 
we will see to it that you will become nothing, that is the gist of what 
you are saying? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   It is Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Okay, I interrupted Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   No, that is fine, we are just about to 
deal with 33 and 34 of the statement from page 10 Chair. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   If you check that I was pointing, there were 
signs Chairperson, there were signs that were there for us, for all of 
us, and I think we did a disservice to the Free State people because 
being close to the man you could see the signs but instead we 
10 
protected this.  What I am trying to demonstrate here is if you go to any 
department that Ace served in you would have a person for instance if 
(indistinct) Kekama were to come to the Commission and testify about 
what he knows happened when Ace was in Agriculture, and what you 
know you have Ndegu Thuli who would be able to tell you what he 
knows when he became the Chief immediately after him and many other 
things.   
 
Just to make an example, when I was MEC of Transport and 
Security it was in 2008, at the time Ace was in Sports and you know 
things – there was a Head of Department who had come from 
20 
suspension and won the case, (indistinct) Klaas who became the HOD 
in the department.  Every time I went to a meeting I was told I must fire 
him, and the person who was pushing that, that I must fire him 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was head of ...(intervention)  
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 118 of 134 
 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Of the Department that I was political head, 
that is Transport and Security, now I will be told you must fire this 
person. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Who would tell you that? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   It would be Ace who would be telling me and 
then there will be meetings where it will be said we told you to fire this 
person, the question was what is it that he did, and nothing came to it, 
and as Gama will have it Ace then became MEC ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Magashule. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Oh, Mr Magashule then became MEC for – 
10 
in that department where this person, Mr Klaas, was now  HOD, and I 
watched deliberately if he was going to fire him, and when I realised 
that it was not happening I went to him and said why are you not firing 
him now.   And he said no, no, these things don’t happen just, you have 
got to follow processes, and at the time the Premier was Ma’am 
Beatrice Marshoff, and then he managed to make sure that Ma’am 
Beatrice Marshoff was able to take Mr Klaas to the office of the 
Premier, and he came to me excited to say you see I was able to deal 
with him, but I said but you did not do what you wanted me to do, you 
wanted me to do this in the wrong way but you do this.   
20 
 
So I am trying to figure that you have a person here in Mr 
Magashule who from time to time in corridors etcetera where we talk he 
was frustrated by  processes that these processes are taking too long, 
and if it were according to him these processes he would you know 
demonstrate it by the fact that in 1994 when he was MEC for Economic 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 119 of 134 
 
Development, when he submitted, and that is where people don’t also 
understand, he submitted bills to be discussed in the Executive Council 
for the establishment of these entities, it was the investment and also 
tourism and under his department, but they were delayed and every 
time he brought this submission it would not be discussed, so he felt 
that he can as well go without this legislation, so he went in and 
established 
the 
entities 
without 
a 
legislation 
regulating 
such 
establishment and also transferred money that is what they called fraud 
at the time and corruption, he then transferred money when there was 
no legislation governing that etcetera, into this entity, and it was that 
10 
when this report came out that (indistinct) Lekota ran around with it and 
that is what we were defending, and we defended that the money went 
but of course it did not go as it was supposed to go in terms of 
processes. 
 
So I am saying had we nicked that at that level also to say 
whilst we’re defending you but you were wrong in doing this, we did not 
do that, we failed dismally and I think if dawned to him that if I do 
things and then I have the support of the organisation I am protected 
and I can do this, and this developed into a cult in the Free State that 
everybody if you have something you would have somebody says I can 
20 
take you to him [African language] to ask for forgiveness and some 
people have gone and then once you are gone then things will change 
and many – I remember we went to a wedding and there was this 
person who had some businesses and it went bad, and he was not 
happy and he went to speak to Mr Magashule at that wedding and a few 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 120 of 134 
 
weeks after that I saw a drastic change in this person, in some 
instances he was driving an R8, when the person did not have money to 
pay a DSTV three weeks before the wedding. 
 
So I am just saying these are some of the things that you see 
happening and I think our failure to deal with this at the time when 
these things were happening created a problem and probably also it is 
what also motivated me to say I am not going to make the same 
mistake as I did you know before where I will protect people when I 
know that they are doing wrong, so it is with that in mind that I come to 
this Commission to say I am not going to sit down and keep quiet when 
10 
things are happening that are wrong, because – simply because the 
person that – people that I am going to talk to are people that I know, 
and in some instances some were going around and saying they have 
assisted me how can I suddenly deal with them in this – and I am 
surprised that there are these people who would go out and say this, so 
nevertheless what I am trying to say is I am here Chairperson to give 
you what I know and to the best of my ability in terms of raising issues 
that I know and issues that happened and some of the issues that you 
see happening.  As I am saying I feel you know we failed the people of 
the Free State when we did not act at the time when we were supposed 
20 
to have acted, and I have learnt my lesson that you don’t allow 
something small to fester and once it has grown you are not going to be 
able to deal with it and this is one lesson in life that I have learnt. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes, you sketch for the Chair the eight 
topics which you will be addressing in your statement and you do so on 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 121 of 134 
 
page 11 with reference to paragraph 36.  Could you please mention into 
the records those topics that you will be canvassing in this Commission 
during the session of your testimony.    
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   I am going to be dealing with the asbestos 
eradication audit which I referred to earlier as the asbestos heist.  The 
Department of Human Settlement which also as we said is a heist and 
the role of Ndableki Siwe[?] and the operation cluster medium 
communications procurement, the Executive Council meetings and 
sanitising forensic reports and the international scholarship program. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Okay now we turn to the first topic 
10 
which ...(intervention)  
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:   Sorry Mr – through you Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:  Sorry Mr Mokoena could you please perhaps 
take Mr Dukwana through paragraph 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  24? 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:   34, three four Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SMANGA SETHENE:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Mr Dukwana you mentioned to the 
patronage, do you want to mention specifics in relation to that 
paragraph 34? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Chairperson earlier on I mentioned that you 
know you have X, you have all these things that are meant to help us, 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 122 of 134 
 
you have the Constitution, we have the Public Finance Management 
Act, we have got everything that if we were to follow what is inside 
there we would actually be having departments that function properly, 
but a system, they say if you want to fight the system you don’t fight it, 
you create your own system that will render this one obsolete, and in 
the Free State ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am sorry, before you proceed Mr Dukwana I 
think that paragraph 33 leads nicely to 34, so I think before you go to 
34 you might wish to ...(intervention)  
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Deal with 33 as well? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay I interrupted you, but I just wanted to alert 
you to that.  You may continue. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   No that 33 Chairperson you see when you 
have a person like Mr Magashule we thought at the time that yo this 
man has brains, who could remember who is the supply chain manager 
in this office, who is in the municipal offices, who is the Speaker, who 
is the municipal manager, he would know these people by name, and 
because he would travel, he would go, he would visit, he will do – but 
what is very interesting also he would know that there is a vacancy of a 
clerk, a vacancy of of you know lower ranking officials. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Positions. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Positions and lower positions, he would 
know exactly in each municipality and even when we were sitting at the 
deployment committee sometimes we would look at this and names will 
come and you are hoping that let’s allow the processes and let’s get 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 123 of 134 
 
the person, then you will see that he knows this one, you know so at 
the time we were really impressed that we have got a person who has 
keen interest in knowing people he worked with. 
 
Little did we know that it was not intended in the way that we 
thought it was, and as one will demonstrate later that when I said a 
system was built in the Free State, a system of patronage, instilling 
fear, you know dispensing patronage instilling fear and to a large 
extent Chairperson that many structures were compromised.  You can 
go to the police in the Free State, many of them you know very much 
compromised, from the highest level to down. 
10 
 
You go to the Judiciary Chairperson, remember that I 
mentioned that, you go to the Judiciary and that is very interesting that 
I am making this just to demonstrate that there is also a case of 
defamation of character by one person who claimed that he wanted to 
build – establish this movement, ATM, and the fact that he is taking it 
to Bloemfontein I personally have said to other people there is a reason 
that he is taking it to Bloemfontein, because he knows in Bloemfontein 
he will not lose the case, and I am saying this ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry this is the case of who taking the 
defamation of character ...(intervention)  
20 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:   Mr Magashule, remember the ANC is 
investigating allegations that during the election there were people who 
actually contributed or worked in establishing a party, I think it is ATM, 
and then there was a person who came forward with information to say 
and started mentioning Mr Magashule and others and Mr Magashule 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 124 of 134 
 
ended up taking the person to court, demanding that you know this has 
actually besmirched his name and all those things, so – and when we 
realised that it was taken to the High Court you know in Bloemfontein, 
me personally and some of my friends and some people who know what 
is happening in that space we then said well he knows that he is going 
to get a verdict that will favour him and it will actually make it very 
difficult for that Commission to even start working.  He will get a verdict 
that will favour him. 
 
And we are saying this with utmost humility because we feel 
that once as activists, as members of the organisation in the Free State 
10 
it is actually he feeling that we share with many people, we have seen 
this in action, and there is actually one person who is involved in all 
this as a legal person, as an attorney, who will be there every time the 
ANC takes you to court, if you take the ANC to court whatever the 
attorney that would be that will be taking the matter will be this one, 
you know we know what is happening, and I cannot mention the person 
because this – we did not make him aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  But I am just saying there is this person who 
is an attorney in the Free State who facilitates some of these things 
20 
and then we know exactly what is happening, and some of the 
utterances of some of the people about when people are proudly 
indicating that if you have a case you can bring it to us, we will help 
you squash the case, so I am just saying there is that feeling 
(indistinct) is rife in the Free State, that some of our people who are 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 125 of 134 
 
serving in the Judiciary in the Free State are really compromised and 
some of them, some of them were also doing business at some stage 
with the Provincial Government.   
 
Some would have a ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that before they became Judges or what? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja, it was before they became judges 
and some will have their wives also working doing business with 
government, so we know what is happening in the Free State and as I 
say you have got a system running parallel to what you see, when 
things are wrong this system that you are supposed to be doing you 
10 
know people will only comply. 
 
An example when I mention all these things is the fact that you 
see also pastors, you’ve got so many pastors ...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you go to pastors you know you 
mentioned what you have mentioned in regard to what is happening in 
the Free State in relation to litigation that goes to I take it you are 
referring to the High Courts, I may be wrong but I don’t know whether I 
may have read anything along those lines, I happen to have been to 
have sat together with my colleagues in the Constitutional Court in the 
matter that was brought to the Constitutional Court before Mangaung 
20 
Conference in 2012, that matter as you should remember had started at 
the High Court in the Free State.  I don’t know, I seem to have the 
impression that maybe either something that may have been written in 
some affidavit or maybe something that some or other counsel might 
have mentioned during argument but I seem to remember that there 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 126 of 134 
 
was some statement that I heard that seems to be in line with a 
concern similar to the line that you are mentioning. 
 
Now I would like you and all those who have got information, 
evidence about that uneasiness, to come forward and give that 
information to the Commission, because of all the arms of the State the 
Judiciary is the one arm where people should feel comfortable that if 
they bring cases those cases will be dealt with impartially, without fear, 
favour or prejudice and it would be a matter of grave concern, even if 
there was just a perception so one would like to see whether there is a 
factual basis for the perception, so that if there is that can be dealt 
10 
with, but if there isn’t then the Nation can be told boldly that that 
perception has got no factual basis. 
 
So that is what I would like to happen, so that those concerns 
can be looked at and if there are facts to it, we can look at them.  So 
that’s what I would like you, I would like to say to you and to all those 
who many know what you are talking about and have got information.  
Okay is that right? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I think many of us will be prepared to do 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please, ja, it is not in the interest of the country 
20 
that there should be any such perception and it should not be resolved 
one way or another. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  We will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  So as I was saying with regard to this 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 127 of 134 
 
dispensing of patronage but for them to be doing some things, I am just 
making an example of some of things that have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR 
MXOLISI 
DUKWANA: 
 
And 
if 
you 
check 
here 
at 
34.1 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I interrupted you while you were going to the 
pastors. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And that is where I am heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that is where you are going. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is not food Chair.   You would have Chair 
10 
the – there is a pastor well known in the Free State Ntate Moruti Daniel 
Mothobi Lekota.  You would find that he was appointed as Deputy 
Director Research in the Department of Police Roads and Transport and 
he was born on the 31 s t of July 1948, and if you take, you look into the 
position when he took you know the position effectively it was the 1 s t of 
August 2015, and at the time he was at the age of 67.   
 
Now all I am raising is these things would only happen in 
Provinces where you have undermined systems.  This is the retirement 
age and there is no system that – in the Public Administration that will 
welcome, that will do this.  It happened also with ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean where somebody who has gone beyond 
retirement age would be appointed afresh?  
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I don’t know what happened because the 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 128 of 134 
 
system itself will reject that.  For instance we had an HOD, 
unfortunately he passed on, and when they could not renew his contract 
because of his age he was then taken to the Lindelani, we call that 
Lindelani the office of the Premier, if you are on your way out there’s a 
collection or area that will be the office of the Premier, you will stay 
there and then you still get the packs and all that and afterwards you 
either decide to leave because you are not doing anything, or you stay.  
So many other people who were HOD’s and at the end were demoted or 
whatever from the position, they will go to Lindelani, to the Office of 
the ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Lindelani? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Lindelani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course Lindelani means ...(intervention)  
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It’s taken from when people are being 
deported etcetera they would ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, where you wait. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Yes where you wait and then you will be 
deported, so we would use such words in reference to what was 
happening in the office at the time, that yes, if he is not comfortable 
with you as an HOD, if you are not removed you will end up at Lindelani 
20 
and then we know you’re moving, yes.   
 
There is an example of one person, he is actually good, he is a 
good HOD, he was an HOD and ended up becoming a CEO of an entity 
in the Free State, and now he is at Lindelani.  So it goes that way, if 
you are not wanted you go to Lindelani. 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 129 of 134 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean Lindelani is still there now, or you mean at 
that time? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Chairperson we are dealing with a system, it 
doesn’t mean, it does not matter whether the person is there or not, the 
system is still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you mean the system continued beyond the the 
time of the former Premier. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is continuing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  Until you deal with the system it is not going 
10 
to – as I say you can do whatever now, you can put any person you 
think is better would not be able to do anything meaningful in that 
Province up until you have dealt with the system that has been 
introduced in the Free State, where people would disregard processes 
and feel nothing has happened, and people will just play dumb, I saw 
one witness some time who was here and could not also, I mean this is 
a bright guy, he is bright, qualified, highly qualified person, some of the 
things that he was saying here you could the difficulty as a person 
accepting, he would just take responsibility and taking the fall for 
others, but when the person knows exactly what happened you know 
20 
and people will play stupid, but they are not stupid, they know what is 
happening and then you would have such characters in the Province 
who would rather protect individuals and take the fall than to expose 
this individual, so that is the problem that we have, that is the system 
that I am talking about, the system if you get, as I say if you go to any 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 130 of 134 
 
department you get – and any municipalities the system that I am 
talking about Chair and why I am saying this inconsistency there’s a 
case in I think in 2000, where a person, I will mention the name, 
because I had spoken to him at length, he was a councillor, Ketso 
Totumakumi[?], here is a person who was a mayor during the transition 
period, or during the transition local government and in the Northern 
Free State at the time and I will show you Chairperson that how 
inconsistent we are in applying this.   
 
This comrade was one of the comrades when they were 
approaching 1997, somewhere 1997/1998 by Mr Magashule.  At the 
10 
time you will remember we were, it was in 2000 the ANCPC had been 
dissolved and there was an ILC under the leadership of Ndumusala and 
the 
late 
Novimgomba, 
and 
Mr 
Magashule 
approached 
many 
municipalities at that time in the Northern Free State and asking them 
to 
consider 
the 
privatisation 
of 
water 
system, 
within 
their 
municipalities, and it was that (indistinct) municipality Sasolberg, the 
Transitional Local Council, that rejected that and the person who was 
leading that was (indistinct) so this (indistinct) was then elected as a 
mayor, as an executive mayor but it was not before he was discouraged 
by Mr Magashule not to stand, where he wanted he even encouraged 
20 
him to go to school that he has more (indistinct) funds for him to go to 
school, but he rejected that, and he ended up being (indistinct).  He 
was then approached by then the Regional Secretary, Deputy Regional 
Secretary and the Chair, without mentioning their names, and then to 
appoint certain, when he was appointed the Executive Mayor he was 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 131 of 134 
 
then asked by these individuals when he was approached that they 
should put some people, the majority of these people who were coming 
from Parys to be members of the mayoral committee and to this he 
rejected, refused to do that, but what then happened was the his 
refusal was informed by the fact that it was not coming from any 
structure, he was part of the original, our WC, the original Working 
Committee and the ILC at the time had not pronounced itself on that, 
and what then happened to Toto he then had a trip to China and then 
along the way, because there was threats of a typhoon etcetera, I’m 
just ...(intervention)

CHAIRPERSON:  One second, is that still in your statement or is it 
something outside your statement? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It deals with dispensing of patronage, I am 
just mentioning an example of this, that I said about this patronage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  And then he went to China, unfortunately 
there was a problem, they had to go through Spain and his bag was left 
here and he did not have clothes to change, they phoned back, then 
they said he can use his credit card, but when – and he did not, he 
used the credit card, almost about R300 less than that and then when 
20 
he came back with the you know, when he came back with the intention 
of paying because it was – he was advised.  What actually became a 
problem Chairperson what I am trying to point to you, is that in 2000 
when we were elected as in the leadership and the first casualty was 
this man, he was then removed and the argument was that he was 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 132 of 134 
 
removed for using the credit card, the official credit card and the 
argument was that the credit card was written goodies the statement 
and for that it was seen that the person had actually gone in and was 
paying for prostitutes at the time, and that is what was said in the 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think we must ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can I also request you that we deal – 
that’s why I avoided you to go into 34, I was happy the way you’ve 
dealt with it because I think you’ve conveyed the message.  Can we try 
to deal with the issues that are ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...In the statement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To the extent where you might seek to 
clarify certain issues it must not be outside the ambit of the statement 
and we are trying to do so in order to be fair to other individuals, 
entities, that might not be here who might simply be mentioned for the 
first time and for us also to be caught by surprise by the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but also Mr Dukwana while one accepts that 
there might be, that not everything you say might be in the statement, 
20 
there might be additions but one does not except too much of a detour 
or departure from the statement, and the advantage of having the 
statement is that both your legal team and the Commission’s legal team 
have looked at the statement, they know what you are going to say but 
once you go outside it too much you might say things that they would 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 133 of 134 
 
have said it is not proper to go into, so it’s – there is wisdom in sticking 
to it but as I say it does not mean that you cannot depart at all, but a 
limited departure when there are grounds to justify it is understandable, 
but one the departure is too much then there may be a problem. 
 
 
Okay, alright ,Mr Mokoena continue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  I take the counsel Chairperson because the 
– and I am not arguing the point further, all that I needed with this was 
just to demonstrate that in terms of taking decisions in some cases you 
may have a person with this and then you have got other people with – 
10 
who had done a lot of damage and nothing was done to them, so it was 
with that in mind but I take your counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, and if there is anything else what you might 
not have included in the statement that you think is important you can 
later on talk to your counsel and if there is a need to do a 
supplementary statement that can be done, okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair I was just about to move to the 
specific topics and the first one being the asbestos eradication audit.   
It is quite an involved topic Mr Chair, and subject to directions if we 
may have an early start tomorrow and deal with it right away rather 
20 
than to deal with it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether you don’t think we should take – go 
a little further, even if it is up to quarter to five, you think if we 
...(intervention)   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I might mention the names which I am 
27 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 150 
 
Page 134 of 134 
 
not supposed to mention, it’s late in the afternoon and I think that I 
need to restructure that – those agreements carefully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I see counsel for Mr Dukwana agrees.   So 
alright then tomorrow what time would you like to start? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Nine o’clock should be sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, is that fine? 
MR MXOLISI DUKWANA:  It is in order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will adjourn now then and then we will 
commence at nine o’clock tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
