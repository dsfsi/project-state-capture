PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 17 APRIL 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.  
ADVOCATE PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. Chair the 
next witness is also testifying under the rubric of Law Enforcement 
Agencies.  It is Major General Johan Booysen.  He will be led by 
Advocate September. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms September.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair before we begin with the 
10 
evidence of General Booysen I would like to take this opportunity just 
to orientate through the files that you find before you.  There are two 
lever arch files.  The first file being marked File – Exhibit ZA and the 
other lever arch file is marked Exhibit ZB.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair you will also find four 
small blue folders.  The first is Exhibit Z2 which contain s the first 
supplementary affidavit of this witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The next is Exhibit Z3 which 
20 
contains a timeline and diagrams to orientate this witness’ evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Exhibit Z4 contains his second 
supplementary affidavit and Exhibit Z5 contains a third supplementary 
affidavit plus additional documents.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85

CHAIRPERSON:  How come you have Exhibit 2 to Exhibit Z2 to Exhibit 
Z5 without Exhibit Z1? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How come you have Exhibit Z2.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to Exhibit Z5 without Exhibit Z1?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair I have been – I have 
been informed that ZA and B  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Effectively constitutes as 
10 
Exhibit Z1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will just have to try and sort that out 
because otherwise I could or anybody could look for where is Z1, am I 
missing Z1.  Okay alright. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.  Chair 
there is one preliminary issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually why do we not fix that now?  If you have got 
– if the lever arch files are Exhibit ZA and ZB this should be ZC to Z 
whatever is it not? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I am guided by – by you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is more logical to me. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  If that is so then Exhibit 
Z2 as you direct would become?  
CHAIRPERSON:  ZC. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair as a… 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 4 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Z3 will be Z4. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I am – if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Would it be possible at all to 
propose that the Exhibit ZA and Exhibit ZB referred to Exhibit Z1 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see you people need to be consistent.  When  
we were – we had Exhibit Y we had Exhibit Y, Exhibit YA and Exhibit YB 
so now if we change now to have Z1 and Z2 instead of ZA and ZB it is 
not logical.  So what is the change?  So if you have kept AB with the 
10 
others  it is better to keep it – to stick to that. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay I am led by your direction 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless there is any particular problem that I am not 
aware of that you want to tell me about?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The only challenge while I am 
guided by Chair ’s direction – the only challenge that may encounter is 
through referencing to the documents based on the evidence as it is to 
be presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you talking about referencing that has already 
20 
happened in existing statements?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  No Chair it is through the 
presentation of evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No when we – well if we change now to whatever 
whether we change to Exhibit Z1, Z2 and whatever the witness will be 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 5 of 212 
 
told and his will have been changed to that and he will g ive evidence 
using those exhibit numbers. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All I was simply saying is it is better to keep 
consistency.  I have no particular liking for ZA, ZB or Z1 or Z2 all I am 
simply saying I must not have a situ ation where I look at this and I 
think I am missing Exhibit Z1. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then in fact I do not miss anything.  So shall we 
just make it – we were making them ZC which is – was Z2, is that right? 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Z3 becomes ZD. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then Z4 becomes ZE. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Z5 becomes ZF.  Okay the witness’ ones mus t 
also be marked like that so that we are all on the same page.  Registrar 
do you want to assist the witness?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Should the Registrar administer the 
20 
oath? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADVOCATE 
VERUSHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 
Before 
the 
oath 
is 
administered. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 6 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I just wish to highlight a point 
and that is in particular relation to the Exhibit ZF  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Which is the last one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair this particular exhibit has 
been prepared to ring-fence a preliminary issue and the evidence in 
relation to the preliminary issue.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Concerning additional evidence 
that Mr Booysen intends to present to this commission regarding 
Advocate Mxolisi Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Who is your younger brother. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I guess you should not say ring -fenced 
because if you say ring-fenced it is like it is being made secret.  
Nobody must have access to it.  As I understand the position it is – the 
– the arrangement between the legal team of the commission and t he 
witness is concerned in the light of the discussion was it last week?  Is 
20 
that until I have received submissions with regard to what should 
happen relating to in regard to evidence about certain disciplinary 
hearings that Mxolisi Zondo chaired we will w ait until everyone who has 
that evidence as far as the legal team knows who is going to testify has 
it and if I am going to end up hearing it then I will hear it.  If somebody 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 7 of 212 
 
else will hear then that person will hear it.  So I just wanted to say it is 
not like ring-fenced as if nobody must see it.  It is just – it is evidence 
that is before the commission like any other evidence and it is not 
treated in any special way. Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that – thank you Chair.  I 
therefore apologise for the use of word ring-fenced because it was 
actually intended to mean that the evidence in relation to the conflict 
issue is to be dealt with separately.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it is certainly not secret. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, no it is just that it will be dealt with later 
because there is still the issue of who must hear it that must be dealt 
with first. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in line with the approach of 
the DCJ particularly in relation to McBride’s evidence we w ill then 
accept that this – that particular evidence which is contained all in 
Annexures Exhibit ZF. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Will not be dealt with…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Will not be dealt with at this stage.  
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  During these proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it will be considered and 
determined once the conflict issue in relation to McBride’s evidence 
has been determined. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 8 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  To set clarity for all other 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Of a similar nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I may then request that this 
particular witness be sworn in please?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the legal team may or may not have decided it – 
it may be important just as an announcement was made as to what the 
position of the – of Mr McBride was and Mr Sesoko was it may that 
each witness who has something to say about evidence that will be 
dealt with later is also announced but it could be that it could be 
announced later when the evidence is given.  So I leave that to the 
legal team and the witnesses concerned.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
20 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
Johan 
Wessel 
Booysen. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   No. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 9 of 212 
 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be 
the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise 
your right hand and say, so help me God.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before Ms September starts I heard her saying or 
rather Mr Pretorius say Major General Booysen and Ms September said 
10 
General Booysen.  I must just confess that I get very confused with 
police and military titles so maybe let us start by you clarifying is it 
Major General, is it General?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you Chair I am 
not rank conscious but you can  either address me as just General or Mr 
Booysen or Johan if you want to thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright I just thought I would confess 
my – my ignorance just on a lighter note talking about Major General 
Booysen and General Booysen when one of my sons was much younger 
and I was Judge President he asked me who is higher, is it Judge 
20 
President or President?  So I told him that the President of the country 
is the highest office.  So with Major General I also would not know 
whether it is the General or Major but I understand it must be General I 
do not know.  But thank you very much.  I wanted to say thank you for 
coming forward to assist the commission.  We appreciate it.  You 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 10 of 212 
 
probably know that we have been calling for people who have b een 
heading departments or heading units and other people to come – 
please come forward and share with the commission and with the nation 
what they know in terms of things that have happened in the past in 
their departments and elsewhere that relate to sta te capture, that 
relates to serious corruption that falls within our terms of reference.  
So I really appreciate it that you have come forward.  Thank you very 
much. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  May I 
address you as General?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  You may thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  If I could ask you 
to look at bundle ZA which is the one of the lever arch files befo re you?  
And if I can ask you to turn to page 1 of that bundle?  Do you recognise 
this document? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then ask you to turn to 
page 70 of the same bundle?  Do you recognise t he signature on that 
20 
page? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair that is my 
signature. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And is it correct that you 
deposed to this affidavit on the 2 April 2019 before a Commissioner of 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 11 of 212 
 
Oaths? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  If I can now ask 
you to turn to and please bear with me on the change of Exhibit 
numbers but it would be ZC.  In doing so can I ask you to turn to page 
1 of this affidavit?  Do y ou recognise this document?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please identify it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it is a 
supplementary affidavit that I deposed to.  
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you turn to page 4 of that 
same bundle. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And the signature that 
appears there Chair is my signature and it was made under oath at the 
Garsfontein Police Station. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that was on the 9 April 
2019, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  This particular affidavit 
corrects certain typographical errors in your main affidavit.  If I can ask 
20 
you to turn to page 2 of it and in particular paragraph 5.1.  Is it correct 
that at paragraph 30 of your main affidavit the date was incorrectly 
stated as May 2011 and ought to have been reflected May 2010?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  Is it also correct that in 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 12 of 212 
 
paragraph 40 of your main affidavit the date of 8 August 2011 ought to 
have been 8 September 2011?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is also correct 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  If I can now ask 
you to turn to Exhibit ZE please.  Likewise please turn to page 1 and 
kindly identify the document?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair that is a second 
supplementary affidavit that I deposed to and which I signed on the 15 
April at Midrand and it was commissioned in the presence of a 
10 
Commissioner of Oaths. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And that – sorry 
and this particular affidavit was signed on the 15 April 2019, that is 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can ask you to turn to page 
2 of the same affidavit and paragraph 6 in particular.  There are further 
typographical corrections that have been made.  Is it correct that you 
retired in the year of 2017 and not 2016 as re corded in paragraphs 4 
and 5 of your main affidavit?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  As you would have 
heard for purposes of your evidence today you need not refer at all to 
Exhibit ZF.  Turning to page 1 of your main affidavit in File ZA is it 
correct firstly that your affidavit which is your main affidavit your first 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 13 of 212 
 
and your second supplementary affidavits are all true and correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  In that instance 
can I ask you to please in your own words inform the Chair about your 
career in the service? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I joined in 1976 
as a constable where I was a patrol person, a patrolman and I retired 
as I said February 2016.  During my career I acquired certain academic 
qualifications I do not know if it is necessary to go into that?  
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please you are welcome to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BO OYSEN:  I obtained a National 
Diploma in Police Administration.  I also had a degree in policing.  I 
also have a Post Graduate qualification in management.  I have been 
trained by the FBI in the United States of America.  I have also 
received training by the FBI in South Africa.  I attended the Chinese 
Police University – Forensic University.  I done a number of internal 
courses in South African ranging from forensic courses to investigative 
courses to major case management and also Managerial courses.  I 
have attended a number of high courts all over the country.  I have 
20 
testified in a number of high courts in the country.  I have also testified 
at I think this is my fourth commission of inquiry in which I am 
testifying. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can just ask you to pause 
there.  Please indicate the Chair which Commissions of Inquiry to gave 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 14 of 212 
 
evidence at? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the first one I 
keep on forgetting the name but it relates the killing of eighteen ANC 
members at Shobashobane in 1995.  There was a subsequent 
Commission of Inquiry in which I testified.  I later testified at the 
Alexander Commission of Inquiry into taxi violence.  And more recently 
I testified at the Mogoro Commission of Inquiry.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  During your term serving the 
South African Police Services can you just at a higher level indicate the 
10 
ranks that you have held and the capacities in particular that you have 
held during your service?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair as I said I 
joined in 1976 those days you had to write exams to become an officer 
as opposed to today where you have to apply for a certain post so I 
went 
through 
the 
– 
the 
processes 
of 
writing 
the 
necessary 
examinations.  I eventually bec ame a commissioned officer in 1987.  
Subsequent to that your promotions are according to where you 
finished off on the candidate officer ’s course.  With the new 
dispensation in 1995 there was a different process.  I held the rank of a 
20 
Lieutenant Colonel just prior to the new democratic institution.  A few 
weeks later I was promoted to the rank of full Colonel and subsequent 
in the new dispensation I was promoted inter alia to the rank of a 
Brigadier and a Major General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank You. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 15 of 212 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  You mentioned that 
you retired from the South Africa Police Services during Sep – during 
February of 2017.  How does that date compare to the date of your 
retirement? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that I see in your statement that you also 
mentioned that you were also Deputy Provincial Commissioner in KZN 
at some stage? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair if I may just 
clarify that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  When the – with the 
advent of the establishment of the DPCI known as the HAWKS  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The Provincial Heads 
were appointed as Provincial Heads and also they also became Deputy 
Provincial Commissioners.  Subsequent to that there was the Glenister 
issue in – that went up to the constitutional court that had changed 
20 
subsequently but during my time I was also the Deputy Provincia l 
Commissioner for KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
That 
position 
of 
being 
Deputy 
Provincial 
Commissioner was it linked to the Police Provincial Commissioner or 
was it in relation to the HAWKS?  I am just trying to see whether that 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 16 of 212 
 
puts you as either the second in comma nd of the police in the province 
or one of the Deputy Provincial Commissioners in the whole police 
service or whether it was simply Deputy Provincial Commissioner in 
relation to the HAWKS? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I elude to that 
later on in my affidavit but if I can explain it now?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  What happened is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  We were all appointed 
10 
as Deputy Provincial Commissioners and I think that was t o circumvent 
the problem where there were other Deputy Provincial Commissioners 
as well that – so it obviated us reporting to them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So at that point in 
time we – I had two people that I reported to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I reported to the 
Provincial Commissioner and to the National Head of the HAWKS>  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But much later there 
was the Glenister challenge in the high c ourt that eventually ended up 
the constitutional court where the constitutional court held that I should 
report directly to the National Head of the HAWKS who in turn would 
not report to the National Commissioner at the time but to the Minister 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 17 of 212 
 
of Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair at this particular point it 
may be helpful to ask that slide 1 be placed on screen?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a slide you want to show?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us see. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  This particular slide is in fact 
found in your – in bundle… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh we already have it I remember it ja.  
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  ZD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  ZD in fact contains all of the a 
timeline and diagrams that will be referred to at different intervals.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  During Mr Booysen’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General – General Booysen if I 
may?  The slide that you see before you, is it correct that this slide was 
given to you by the commission to consider?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am not too sure if it 
is the same one that I altered. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes there is certainly another 
slide. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 18 of 212 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  To be shown now which is… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay I –  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Your one in particular. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I concede this was 
given to me by the – by the commission. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay thank you.  The slide is 
really just to orientate the evidence that you are about to give.  If I can 
then ask for Slide 2?  Is it correct that after considering Sli de 1 you 
had highlighted certain entities within the structure that your evidence 
addresses? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just to orientate this particular 
diagram when we look at the police cl uster if I may?  Thank you.  Can 
you for the record inform the different entities or positions that your 
evidence to be dealt with at this hearing will address?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you asked him whether he highlighted certain 
entities or sections and on the  slide that you were showing then we 
could see come some that seemed to be highlighted or darkened and in 
the one that you are showing now we can see some that are darkened.  
20 
Do you want him to just to confirm whether the ones he highlighted are 
the ones that have been shaded or something?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you confirm that…  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Those are my 
highlights Chair. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 19 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  In particular there 
is a slight variation to this particular diagram as compared to the one 
that you were provided with which is at Slide 1?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is so Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please identify the 
difference in structure and why you highlighted a difference?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if one could go 
back to the previous, the previous slide.  It actually shows the lineation 
of the actual command structure isolating from the National Head of the 
10 
Hawks to his National Office.  Under him at National Office he had 
certain component heads whereas in the second slide I delineated the 
rank structure from National Head to myself as a Provincial Head and 
then the different components in the Province that reported to me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Under you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This particular slide talks to – if I 
could use the term cluster, various clusters.  Such being Police, 
Justice, 
Intelligence, 
Finance, 
Governance, 
Parliament 
and 
the 
20 
Presidency.  To what extent are these different clusters dependent upon 
each other in the chain of the Criminal Justice System?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Mr Chair in my view 
the one cannot do without the other.  They all form very important gears 
in this big machinery and if anyone of those are absent the whole 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 20 of 212 
 
Justice System will be compromised in my view Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  It was your evidence that 
you were appointed as the Prov incial Head of the Hawks in 
KwaZulu-Natal and that you held at the time the rank of Major General 
and that you were also the Deputy Provincial Commissioner in KZN at 
the time.  That is correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just talking to your particular slide it 
was prior to this appointment or rather let me ask the question.  What 
position did you hold before that particular appointment?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I was just prior 
to that appointment the then Scorpions were dissolved.  I was then the 
Head - at that particular time I was the Head of Organised Crime in 
KwaZulu-Natal and prior to that I was the Head of Serious and Violent 
Crime.  Serious and Violent Crime and Organised C rime eventually 
amalgamated and I was then the Head of Organised Crime prior to my 
appointment as Head of the Hawks. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that you were also 
ceased with other departments which were support functions to the core 
units? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please indicate what those 
support functions were which is actually referenced in paragraph 11 of 
your affidavit? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 21 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if I may just 
clarify that.  In police parlour we refer to support functions Human 
Resources, Finance - Financial Departments etcetera which I was also 
responsible for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But there were other 
sub components which I would rather call them that resorted under my 
command. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which are inter alia 
10 
Serious Commercial Crimes, Serious Organised Crime and the Asset 
Forfeiture Investigation Units.  Although the Asset  Forfeiture Units were 
actually ran by an advocate from the National Prosecuting Authority 
they also had an investigative capacity which reported to me.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Looking at the four 
blocks in that particular diagram on your sli de two under the cluster of 
Police - for those of us like me who may not fully understand can I ask 
that you just explain the relationship in simple terms between Crime 
Intelligence, SAPS, the Hawks and IPID please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair with regards to 
20 
SAPS.  Crime Intelligence is a component of SAPS, of the South 
African Police Services and so are the Hawks, the DPCI.  They are an 
integral part of SAPS where supposed to IPID.  They are not an entity 
of SAPS.  They are an independent e ntity and they work on their own. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So from what position do 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 22 of 212 
 
you give evidence today?  Is it one of a civilian or is one based on your 
professional experience in the service?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I regard my 
evidence that I will give to this Commission as being part of the police 
structures for about 40 years of my life until I retired and more 
specifically to events more recently from around about 2010.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 12 of your affidavit you 
make a particular assertion in relation to the capture of individuals.  
10 
Can you please explain your?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him just articulate it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it is my view 
that for reasons that I will elaborate on further in my evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That certain elements 
– and not all of them – certain elements within the La w Enforcement 
and the National Prosecuting Authority had been captured for.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For reasons of own 
interest and in other cases to, to promote or to follow a particular 
agenda or narrative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For – at the behest of 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 23 of 212 
 
political – people with political power. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Or in some instances 
from politicians who were directly involved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Major General Booysen how would 
you explain your record of work during your service since you started in 
1976? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I regard myself 
as a born policeman.  It was my passion my whole life.  It was not a job 
10 
for me.  It was a passion.  I had an unblemished career.  I had received 
numerous national awards from the various National Commissioners in 
the previous dispensation and in the current dispensation.  I have 
received a number of awards at Provinc ial level and I was also 
recognised by the previous Head of Interpol and up until the events 
that unfolded roundabout 2010 I had an unblemished career.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in relation to the point you articulated earlier on 
you said you believe that the evi dence you will give will support the 
statement you have made about certain sections of the Law 
Enforcement Agencies being captured?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  You said that there 
was a change that came about in your record.  What was the trigger in 
your view for the change in the unblemished record that you had during 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 24 of 212 
 
your service? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I have no doubt 
in my mind that the trigge r for the change in my experience in the 
police came about roundabout 2010 when I initiated a corruption 
investigation relating to the business of a wealthy businessman in 
KwaZulu-Natal by the name of Toshan  Panday and his links with certain 
senior police officials. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance can I ask for slide 
three to please be displayed?  For your ease of reference you will find 
that particular slide in EXHIBIT ZD.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you arrange for me to get a hard copy of the 
same thing because I do not think I have got it here?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair you would find it in EXHIBIT 
ZD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I missed that.  Thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is page 3 of that bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  This diagram represents 
a timeline of your evidence in relation to the Panday investigation or 
rather the investigation into the businessman, Mr  Toshan Panday.  Is 
20 
that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it also correct that this diagram in 
fact consolidates in time order which may not be exactly reflected in 
time sequence in your affidavit, but that the way in which it is described 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 25 of 212 
 
in the timeline is in fact correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if would then start in the first 
block and you could use then this as your guide to giving the evidence 
in relation to this investigation.  Plea se explain to the Chair what 
happened on 28 April 2010 and in your own words amplify your 
evidence? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair normally at 
senior management level we have management meetings every morning 
at provincial level.  During those meetings those meetings are chaired 
10 
by the Provincial Commissioner, so Deputies and then all the senior 
officers from the respective components for instance the Financial 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am sorry.  Before you proceed just remind me 
again as at that date as at that year 2010 what your position?  Were 
you at that stage? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair at that stage I 
was Head of the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were Head of the Hawks Provincial Office?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
At 
the 
rank 
of 
20 
General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Ja, you may proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  During those meetings 
it is first a general meeting regarding the crime in the province the 
previous night and the previous day and thereafter we discuss financial 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 26 of 212 
 
issues, human resource issues, supply chain management issues 
etcetera.  On 28 April just before the meeting commenced I was 
approached by a Brigadier  Lawrence Kemp who was the Head of 
Financial Services in KwaZulu-Natal Province and he indicated to me 
that they had discovered that there appears to be some irregularities 
with regards to an acquisition of certain services.  So I asked him at 
that meeting could he prepare something in writing for me and then 
give it to me.  The following morning before the same meeting he came 
up to me and he gave me a copy of a report that he had compiled and 
he had also placed one in front of - at that juncture the Provincial 
10 
Commissioner had not arrived at the meeting yet.  So he had al so 
placed one in front of her – her empty seat.  For some reason I took 
that one away and I asked Kemp to just let me have a look at it before 
we, we actually distribute the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say he had also given a copy of the same 
report to the Provincial Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair he actually – 
she was late that morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Provincial Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
who 
would 
have 
been 
the 
Provinc ial 
Commissioner at that time?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That would have been 
Lieutenant General Mmamonnye Ngobeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright, but the meetings that you are talking 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 27 of 212 
 
about in the mornings are the – are meetings that in her ca pacity she 
would attend as well? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
particular 
morning she was late Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say you took the report that was meant for 
her? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So while we were 
standing around he gave me a copy of the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he placed one in 
front of her empty chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you took it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I took that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I said to him 
Lawrence just give me a day or two to see what is going on here 
because I quickly read through it and I said just give me a day or two to 
see what is happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 28 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Nevertheless after 
that particular meeting I went back to my office and I called in 
Brigadier Andre Lategan who was the Head of Commercial Crime in the 
province at that point in time.  So I gave him the report and I said to 
him he should have the matter investigated and then inform me what, 
what was going on.  So he – Chair also what we do is in the police 
normally when a case gets registered it goes on what we call the CAS 
system.  That is when a docket is opened, but what we do in the police 
especially with your more covert investigations beca use police officers 
have access to the CAS System they can establish when corruption 
10 
cases or any other case for that matter in which they could possibly be 
implicated in if a case had been registered.  So what we sometimes do 
we register on the same syste m an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Without, 
without 
specifying what it is all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
once 
all 
the 
evidence is eventually gathered to convert it to an officia l docket we 
will then convert that inquiry into a criminal investigation docket.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Although the enquiry 
is actually also part of the criminal investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the same people who have accessed to what you 
called – did you say? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 29 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The CAS System. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you spell that? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  C-A-S. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
Criminal 
Administration System. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  The same people with access to that 
system also have access to the registration of inquiries?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They, they would 
Chair but what. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they do not bother most of the time?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Because 
of 
the 
requirements in registering a criminal docket.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  You have to fill in 
every aspect of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of what is required to 
have the docket registered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  As opposed to an 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  You do not have to go 
into that detail.  So it is very difficult for a policem an who wants to go 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 30 of 212 
 
and see if there is a case being investigated against him or her.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To go and fish around 
to see if there is an investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you asked a? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Brigadier Lategan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Brigadier? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Lategan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lategan to investigate and report back to you on this 
issue? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So what he did Chair 
is he booked the investigation out.  At that point it was to a 
Colonel Hans Van Loggenberg and Colonel Vassan Soobramoney.  They 
were the two lead investigators in that particular investigation.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before, before you continue if I could 
just interject there for a second.  Can you just give clarity to exactly 
20 
what this investigation concerned please?   What was the nature of the 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair on face value 
and looking at the initial report from, from Brigadier  Kemp.  On face 
value it was clear that there had been some irregularities in supply 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 31 of 212 
 
chain management at provincial level in KwaZulu -Natal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At SAPS, S-A-P-S? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The indications were 
that all transactions during the World Cup  period preceding the World 
Cup and even after the advent of the World Cup just about every 
transaction had gone through the books of one particular businessman 
in KwaZulu-Natal which was Toshan Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I work with supply 
chain management.  It was part of my function and financial 
management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it just looked odd 
and suspicious.  I mean blankets, television sets, accommodation.  I 
can give you perhaps an example.  Police headquarters – the Hilton 
Hotel is situated about two blocks away from police headquarters.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When a senior officer 
20 
from police national head office had to come and visit in KZN  although 
the hotel was right next to – well two blocks away from where we were 
it still went through the books of the businessman in Umhlanga Rocks.  
So it just seemed out that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am, I am sorry.  I just want to understand what went 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 32 of 212 
 
into the books of somebody in Umhlanga Rocks?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So what happened is 
Chair the procurement process is defined in the Treasury Regulations, 
over and above an amount you have to get tenders.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is a certain 
amount which people at different levels can authorise themselves.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Can approve [intervenes]. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then there is also 
a lower level and I cannot recall what it is called.  It  is not tenders. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Quotations that is 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
We 
have 
to 
get 
quotations and then you need to – and then also there is a database in 
terms of BEE so it gets allocated.  So there are certain processes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
must 
be 
followed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And it appeared from 
that initial report that those processes were not  followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you were making an example about if 
somebody from national was visiting the provincial offices of SAPS and 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 33 of 212 
 
you were saying something about the Hilton Hotel.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  If I can give a 
practical example Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my capacity as 
Head of the Hawks.  If I wanted to visit any place in the country I fill in 
an itinerary.  I will send it to at the time the National Head General 
Anwa Dramat.  He will authorise it and off I go.  My secretary will do my 
booking at the hotel.  She will do my transport arrangements etcetera.  
In this particular instance officers visiting from national head office 
10 
their accommodation was procured and acquired via the busines sman in 
Umhlanga Rocks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was outside of the processes - which was not 
in accordance with – which would not be in accordance with the normal 
processes? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair strictly speaking 
I would not have had a problem if it was one or two occasions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because invariably we 
also make use of especially when it comes to travelling.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Certain agencies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But in this particular 
instance it appeared that everything from buying of television sets for 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 34 of 212 
 
police stations, blankets for the cells, cell mattresses.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Accommodation for 
people coming from national head office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
the 
actual 
problem related to the acquisition of accommodation for the deployment 
of police officers during the World Cup, the World Cup So ccer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was the major 
10 
part of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your concern? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Of 
the 
concern 
because although it went through the books of one or two close 
corporations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Those 
close 
corporations were all registered in the name of one person.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Which 
was 
20 
Toshan Pandya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you.  I just wanted clar ification. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  General what did you do 
once you considered the information that was given to you by 
Brigadier Kemp on 3 May 2010? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 35 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair at that juncture 
he had already registered the en quiry and I was continuing with my 
daily tasks and there were different departments reporting to me.  So 
obviously there are a number of investigations which are reported to me 
but over and above that I am also seized with other matters such as 
human resource management like I have explained before.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and who was allocated the 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
two 
chief 
investigators 
as 
I 
said 
was 
Colonel Hans Van Loggenberg 
and 
10 
Colonel Vassan Soobramoney Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and who registered the 
inquiry? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the registration 
is actually an administrative function. So I do not know whether it was 
Lategan himself or either the two investigato rs but that was just an 
administrative function although I mention in my statement or this 
diagram that Lategan was responsible for that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you so much.  What then 
happened during early May  2010 as you were travelling home?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I can recall this 
vividly.  I was driving in my car.  I just exited the city and I was on, on 
the freeway on my way home in Amanzimtoti which is on the South 
Coast when I received a call from the then Provincial Com missioner 
Mmamonnye Ngobeni and I could hear from her voice she was irritated 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 36 of 212 
 
and she said to me Johan what is this investigation you are busy with 
and I said to well General which one are you talking about.  There are a 
number of investigations that we ar e busy with and then she said no the 
supply chain management one and then I started explaining to her but 
she kept on interrupting me and she said to me no, no, no.  We already 
have these problems at Mountain Rise Police Station.  The police are – 
it is an embarrassment to the police.  Now she was referring Chair to - 
at that point in time there was an investigation pertaining to the 
manipulation of police statistics which eventually culminated in the 
prosecution of a number of senior officers at Mountain R ise and it was 
10 
quite prominent in the media.  So she said to me no we already have 
this problem at Mountain Rise and now further investigation – we are 
just going to embarrass the police more and that you must stop the 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when she said you must stop this investigation 
which one was it?  Did you understand her to be talking about?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was clear in my 
mind that she was talking about this particular investigation against 
Toshan Panday.  She then abruptly terminated the call Chair and that is 
basically what happened on my way home.  She told me to stop the 
20 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now she referred to it when you asked her which one 
because there are lots of investigations that are ongoing.  Sh e said the 
supply chain management one. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No, no.  Well ja that is 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 37 of 212 
 
what she said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how she described it, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right.  That is 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage was the investigation that you gave to 
Brigadier Lategan 
the 
only 
supply 
chain 
management 
one 
– 
investigation – that you were busy with or people under you were busy 
with? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair maybe at that 
point I had only been in that position for about two or three months.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So that was the very 
first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes supply chain. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Or only supply chain 
management or investigation that I  had been involved in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Relating to our own 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So, so there can be no doubt which one the two 
20 
of you were talking about?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Absolutely.  
Absolutely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 38 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did the Police Commissioner during 
that call ask you any details about the magnitude of the investigation, 
the role players involved or any other factual detail in relation to the 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She did not Chair.  As 
a matter of fact she hardly gave me time to speak.  As soon as I would 
start to try and explain she just cut me off and she was  adamant.  She 
just said no the investigation must stop.  She did not ask me what it 
was about, what the magnitude was or what it involved.  She said to me 
10 
I must stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were, you were the Provincial Head of the Hawks 
at the time.  Is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you - at that time was it during the time where 
you were supposed to report both to the Provincial Commissioner as 
well as the National Head of the Hawks?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So technically speaking could she tell you to 
20 
stop an investigation by virtue of the fact that you reported to her or is 
that something that even with her ranking above you and the fact tha t 
you reported - she was one of two people to whom you reported – is the 
position that it was she could not under any circumstances instruct you 
to stop an investigation?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85

MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair she, she had 
the right to give me instructions but most definitely not to stop an 
investigation.  That in my view was an unlawful instruction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Certainly in terms of what you had seen in the 
report that you were given by I think Brigadier  Kemp you saw enough to 
justify that an investigation be done at least preliminarily and then you 
would take it from there but she was saying stop that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you say she did not give you a chance to 
respond to her instruction? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Not when we had the 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Immediately, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair not when we 
had the conversation in the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please then clarify what is the 
normal procedures and protocols to stop an investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s quite 
simple, once a docket had been opened it can only, it can be closed in 
20 
various ways, and I’m going to try a nd keep it as simple as possible.  If 
there’s a housebreaking case it gets investigated, fingerprints are 
taken, witnesses are interviewed but if no suspects are identified and 
it’s a dead-end case the case will be closed by a police officer as 
undetected, and it remains open for a period of time depending on the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 40 of 212 
 
nature of the investigation, if it’s a housebreaking case after five years 
they might destroy the docket, if it’s a murder case it remains open 
indefinitely.  When there’s a suspect in the matter l ike in this particular 
instance where names are mentioned of people that had ostensibly 
committed criminal offences there is no authority within SAPS to close 
or stop an investigation, that docket must be referred to the National 
Prosecuting Authority to a  Prosecutor who will then weigh the evidence 
and decide whether he is going to prosecute a person or an individual 
or not.  If he so find that there are reasons, lawful reasons why a 
prosecution should not proceed, for instance if there was a case of 
10 
assault but the person acted in self defence that Prosecutor may then 
decide to noli prosecute or decline to prosecute in a manner, and he 
will endorse a docket as such.  The docket will be sent back to the 
police station and the Branch Commander of a certain r ank will then 
close that docket, so with regards with closing of dockets where there 
are suspects it must be by the – consequent to a decision of a 
prosecutor.  No police officer has the authority to summarily close a 
docket or stop an investigation, unles s if there are suspects indicated 
indicated in the investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So you received this call from Police 
20 
Commissioner Ngobeni, what then happens the next day?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair the next day 
after the management meeting in the morning I called in Brigadier 
Lategan and I said to him Andre we’ve got a problem here, the PC 
...(intervention)  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 41 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that meeting was she there the Provincial 
Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Not at this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not at this one, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair so I called 
in Lategan to my office and I said to him Andre we’ve got a bit of a 
problem here, and in police parlance we refer to the Provincial 
Commissioner as a PC, I said the PC has given an instruction that we 
must stop this investigation so we need to stop the investigation and he 
frowned and couldn’t understand based on what and he questioned, and 
10 
I said well Andre let’s – bring back the file and then let’s see how 
things develop and he left my office and he was obviously not happy, I 
suspect at a later stage and I think Lategan and even Soobramoney and 
a few other people also thought that I was in cahoots trying to suppress 
the investigation, nevertheless he left the office and he later on came 
back with a file to my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you asked him to bring back the file?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Did you ask him whether he knew  how the 
Provincial 
Commissioner 
might 
have 
got 
to 
know 
about 
the 
20 
investigation, Brigadier Lategan, did you ask him whether he had any 
knowledge as to how the Provincial Commissioner got to know about 
the investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   Chair I don’t have an 
independent recollection of whether I asked him that or not, but what I 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 42 of 212 
 
do know is, which emerged later on was that Van Loggerenberg and 
Soobramoney started to make enquiries in Supply Chain Management.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh those were the people who were assisting 
Lategan? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, in the investigation. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right so it 
emerged during the investigations that they’ve made enquiries to 
Supply Chain Management and at the Financial Department so we 
suspected that ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody then ... 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Well some of the 
people at Supply Chain Management formed part of the investigation 
and we suspected that they perhaps alerted her that we were busy with 
this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Based on the evidence that you’ve 
given that the process of stopping the investigation was improper why 
did you proceed to inform Late gan to return the file and stop the 
investigation? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair as I said in my 
view that was obviously an unlawful instruction and you have to 
understand and I saw Mr McBride also testifying about it yesterday, in 
the Police if something like that is going on and you go in the opposite 
direction you’re dead in the water.  Although in my mind I was never 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 43 of 212 
 
going to stop that investigation, that’s why I said to Lategan let’s see 
how this thing develops because I also know that the  National Head of 
the Hawks at that juncture was Dramat, Anwar Dramat, and I had no 
doubt in my mind that he was not going to be party to having the 
investigation stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So I was banking on 
his support later on, but initially I had to take the file back from him.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So your idea was to have the file brought back while 
you think about how to handle this situation?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because if the file didn’t come back Brigadier 
Lategan and those assisting him could be taking further steps and then 
the Provincial Commissioner could hear that the investigation has not 
been stopped and she could come back to you before you had made up 
your mind as to how to handle the situation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it actually went 
beyond that, what would happen is, and in this particular instance it did 
happen, people like Brigadier Kemp, Lategan, anyone who had been 
involved with that investigation would be ostracised by the Provincial 
20 
Commissioner and she would take it out on them and not everyone has 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Can handle that situation.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair, so 
I in a way I had to protect my investigators, but that did not mean that I 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 44 of 212 
 
was in agreement that the investigation should stop not at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On the 8 t h of May, while you were at 
home, you received another teleph one call.  Can you please share with 
this Commission what transpired and who called you on that particular 
day? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I was in my 
dining room when I received a call on my cellular phone from the same 
Provincial Commission Ngobeni and she was very irritated and she 
actually shouted at me, she said to me “Johan I told you people to stop 
10 
this investigation” so I said to her but General it has been stopped and 
she said no what’s wrong with you people, or words to that effec t, and 
she said no the investigation – so I tried to convince her no the 
investigation had stopped and then I said look let me phone Brigadier 
Lategan and confirm with him, so we terminated the call, I phoned 
Brigadier Lategan and I phoned her back and I s aid to her look I’ve 
spoken to Lategan and he says they’re not continuing with the 
investigation and she appeared to be happy with that response.  
CHAIRPERSON:  This was, I see you say this was on 8 May 2010, 
about how long after the first call, was it a we ek or a few days or two?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair the first call in 
my car and then the second call?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I would have to 
guess, it’s about between two and three weeks.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 45 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Just to clarify you mentioned that 
the first call happened during early May 2010 and the second call then 
happened on the 8 t h of May 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should be correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you never got to know what it is that may have 
made her think that the investigation was still going on?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I had no idea 
but I suspected at that juncture was because certain individuals from 
Supply Chain Management, such as a Colonel Navin Madhoe, who had 
a close relationship with the Provincial Commissioner, I suspected that 
he got wind of the story that there was an investigation and that he had 
alerted her to the investigation.  It later emerged during the 
investigation that there was a particular motive for her actions in that 
regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   General Booysen what was the 
20 
involvement of Lt General Anwar Dramat, if there was any involvement 
of him at all, following the last call that you received from the 
Provincial Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I don’t get the 
question. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 46 of 212 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay, so after the last call that you 
received from the Provincial Commissioner Ngobeni on the 8 t h of May 
2010 did you raise this issue with any of your superiors?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
No 
I 
did 
not 
immediately Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay, when did you raise this issue 
with any of your superiors?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair we often 
have national meetings for various reasons, and I can’t recall the date 
but it was not too soon after what had occurred that we had a National 
10 
Meeting with a component, well with the Provincial Heads with General 
Dramat at the Burgerspark Hotel in Pretoria and we started the meeting 
and at the first tea break he came and stood next to me and we were h 
having tea and he asked me what is this story about this investigation 
that’s been stopped ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was that coming to you to ask?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Dramat, General 
Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So I assumed at the 
20 
time that, and I suspect, not that I blame them for that, that it is either 
Van Loggerenberg or Soobramoney, and Soobramoney later told me 
that it was indeed him, I don’t know whether they phoned him or 
whether they went to see him and told him about what had happened, 
so I said to him well General I am a bit of a pickle here because the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 47 of 212 
 
Provincial Commissioner is adamant that we stop this investigation and 
he wanted to know from me but why and I couldn’t explain why.  Then  I 
made a suggestion to him I said, although – and I said to him there’s 
clear indications that there are irregularities and then I said that’s on 
the one hand and on the other hand she is adamant that we stop the 
investigation.  Then I made a suggestion t o him that we continue with 
the investigation, that – with the same investigating officers, but that 
they should then report to his office ostensibly whereas I would 
surreptitiously remain involved with the investigation, to which he 
agreed.   
10 
 
He then appointed a Brigadier Nkosi, who at the time was 
working at the office of Serious Economic Offences, to “monitor” the 
investigation, so – but I suspect in any event that Soobramoney and 
Van Loggerenberg had in any event continued with the investigation, 
because when we got together again it was clear to me that they had 
actually continued with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So normally the monitoring of the investigation 
would have been done by you, but now there was Nkosi but you said he 
was in inverted commas, so I assume that you mean on record he was 
the one to monitor because on record you were not going to be 
20 
officially or formally, but you would still have something to do with the 
investigation is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That was the case 
Chair and the idea with that was if I had any further problems with the 
Provincial Commissioner trying to interfere or to stop that I could just 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 48 of 212 
 
tell her look it’s not in my hands, you have to speak to Dramat, and I 
knew she would never confront Dramat  with something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you.  Just one clarity on the 
date as you mentioned earlier, if you turn to page 10, paragraph 30 of 
your affidavit, is it correct that the meeting that you had with Lt Gen eral 
Anwar Dramat happened during late May of 2010?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it was corrected in your 
supplementary affidavit.  Chair if I may, I understand it’s time for a 
10 
break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s time for the short break, okay.  We will take the 
short break and resume at twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
10 
ADVOCATE JOHAN EKSTEEN :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you for the indulgence 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen before the 
short adjournment you gave evidence in relation to the phone call that 
you had with the police commissioner on the 8 May.  We are now on 
page 6 of your affidavit where you describe in paragraph 19 a meeting 
that you had during mid-June 2010.  Please describe the events of this 
20 
meeting to the Chair in your own words?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I arrived at my 
office that morning just about after seven and then I received a call 
from the secretary of the Provincial Commissioner to come up to her 
office.  To me it was strange in a sense that she was never at the office 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 51 of 212 
 
that early.  She would invariably arrive late at work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Around what time of the morning would it have been 
more or less? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair that was about 
quarter past seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But invariably for – 
even for the management meetings which started – it was supposed to 
have started half past seven which she changed to eight o’clock but 
she invariably would come late for even those meetings.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That particular 
morning about quarter past seven I got the call to come to her office.  I 
then proceeded – I was situated on the 14 t h floor and she was on the 
18 t h floor.  So I proceeded to her office and then on entering her office 
I found her there as well as Major General Bongani Ntanjana who is 
responsible for support services in the province comprising supply 
chain 
management, 
financial 
services 
and 
h uman 
resource 
management.  He is now deceased.  There was also Major General 
Fannie Masemola.  He was the provincial head of operational response 
20 
dealing with amongst other things the deployment of police officers in 
the province.  General Masemola is curr ently I think the Deputy 
National Commissioner at the rank of Lieutenant General.  Also seated 
there was Brigadier Lawrence Kemp whom I referred to earlier on as 
the head of financial services in the province as well as Colonel Navin 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 52 of 212 
 
Madhoe who was from supply chain management.  At the point was one 
of the subjects of the investigation who would allegedly colluded with 
Toshan Panday.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  What then happened at this 
meeting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it was quite an 
uncomfortable meeting.  General Ngobeni aimed her frustrations 
towards Brigadier Kemp and it soon became clear to me that she had 
either been misled or there was something seriously wrong because 
she went hammer and tong for Kemp and she accused him of b eing 
10 
more concerned about finances, money than the lives of – of the citizen 
– citizens.  And then the more Kemp tried to explain to her the more 
she interrupted him and she would admonish him and there was some 
argument – well not argument, some discussio n between the two of 
them relating to some reports that he had sent to national office and 
that – she almost out of control and then she had a go at him for 
communicating directly with head office which I could not understand 
what it had to do with what we  were busy with.  And the conversation 
carried on and eventually she – I just kept quiet.  And the reason why I 
kept… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry when you came into the meeting had the 
meeting started already?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not yet? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No, no Chair. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 53 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had not started but you found that all of those 
people you have mentioned were already there [indistinct]?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Before the meeting started or when the meeting 
started was it announced what the meeting was about?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Not at all Chair I did 
not have a – I did not even have an idea what was going to happen 
when I – when she called me.  I did not know what she was calling me 
for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you – you did not know about this meeting 
10 
until you were – you got a phone call from her – somebody in her 
office? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So the first thing that happened was she started 
speaking and she effectively was speaking to Brigadier Kemp?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  She was speaking to 
Kemp but I got the feeling she was talking to me as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But not directing it at 
me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright no that is fine.  Continue.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the main reason 
I did not want to say anything was the mere fact that one of th e main 
suspects in the investigation Colonel Navin Madhoe was part of the – of 
the meeting so I just kept quiet.  Then she at one stage said to me 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 54 of 212 
 
Johan what do you say?  So I said to her, General I feel uncomfortable 
talking – I will talk to you later.  And I do not know if she sensed why I 
felt uncomfortable but she then excused Kemp and she excused 
Colonel Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us – let us – if you are able to let us get more 
in terms of what she said at that meeting as far as you are able to 
remember – what were – you have said that she if I can put it in my 
words.  It seems that you are saying she really was attacking Kemp or 
she was upset with him but I would like to hear exactly what she was 
saying if you are able to remember?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  What I recall Chair 
was that she – and that is why I felt she had either been misled by 
someone or else she knew what was going on and tried to make this 
thing off as if we – well she was talking to Kemp but by implication to 
myself as well that we were concerned about finances as supposed – 
as supposed to that we should be concerned about the lives of citizens.  
And I – it did not really make sense to me and that is why I did not say 
anything.  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But –  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There was a 
20 
discussion between her and Kemp about a report that he had sent to 
national head office.  I cannot recall that particular report did not have 
anything to do with our investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it had …  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 55 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And the discussion had nothing to do with that 
investigation that you told us about?  What she was saying at the 
meeting to Kemp? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did not concern the investigation that you told us 
about?  The supply chain management investigation.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No it did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja I think she – I do 
not know whether she confla ted two issues intentionally. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Or whether – but that 
whole meeting was – made no sense to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But it was evident to 
me that it related to the investigation that we were busy with.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say she was upset?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  She was visibly upset. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When she excused 
Kemp and Madhoe I said to her, General I do not think you understand 
what is going on here.  We are not concerned about the deployment of 
police officers because that is the impression that was being created 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 56 of 212 
 
that we are concerned about paying for the deployment of police 
officers.  I said to her we are not concerned about the actual 
deployment of these police officers what we are concerned about is 
what concerns us as investigators it would appear that all the 
acquisitions of – of accommodation and other issues as well were going 
through the books of one businessman In Umhlanga Rocks.  And I said 
to her it is clear that there is = there is something amiss here.  Her 
response to that was once again…  
CHAIRPERSON:  So at this time you – you decided or you had already 
decided that if an occasion arose you would – you would indicate your 
10 
concerns about – your concerns about these irregularities.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that is what I 
tried to explain to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Now I – I do not know 
whether she tried to pretend that she did not know what was going on 
or whether she – well that was – those were my thoughts at the time 
whether she had been misled or whether she did not really grasp what 
20 
was going on.  That is why I explained to her.  We are not concerned 
about the actual deployment what we are concerned about is the 
acquisition of the accommoda tion for the deployment.  Because it all 
seemed to go through the books of Toshan Panday.  Her response was 
once again the investigation must stop and then she said to General 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 57 of 212 
 
Bongani Ntanjana who is now deceased that he should commence with 
an investigation.  Now it did not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same investigation?  Same investigation that you or 
your people, your team, people under you were busy with and now 
actually were under General Dramat as well?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at that stage she did not know about Dramat’s 
arrangement? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – ja okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair so she told 
Ntanjana that he should take over the investigation.  It did not make 
sense to me because General Ntanjana had not been a detective for 
many years number 1.  Number 2 is he did not have the capacity to 
deal with such an investigation.  He did not have the investigators to 
deal with such an investigation. As it would turn out later we had to 
employ forensic auditors.  So and in my mind it did not make sense to 
me that he should do the investigation.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did it make sense to you that on the one hand at 
the same meeting and before she had said and was saying the 
investigation must stop but then now she was saying the investigation 
must be done by somebody other than the people who had already 
started on the investigation?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 58 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I – to me and 
my view that was a ruse.  It was a ruse to try and pacify me to indicate 
well there will be an investigation we are not going to sweep this under 
the carpet.  That is my view and it was actually my suspicion s were 
confirmed later on which I would allude to later on in my affidavit.  
Sorry Chair and then she gave – she said to Ntanjana he must conclude 
his investigation within two weeks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh did you that strike you as – as a kind of normal 
time within which to start and finish an investigation like or there was 
nothing wrong with that time?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair there is no ways 
that even myself with the resources at my disposal at the time a 
number of investigators whose sole  function is to do investigations.  
Whereas Ntanjana had none of those resources.  There is just – it is 
just impossible to conclude or finalise an investigation of that 
magnitude in such a short period of a time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So following that meeting …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe before we talk about what happened 
after.  Was – did the meeting end on the basis that Ntanjana was going 
20 
to do the investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the basis on which it ended.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 59 of 212 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Following that meeting were 
you provided with any form of an investigative repo rt from one of the 
investigators in the Toshan Panday investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair about two 
weeks later Colonel Vassan Soobramoney then provided me with a 
follow-up report which is much more detailed than the initial report th at 
I had received from Kemp.  And from a reading of that report it was – it 
was very clear that there were irregularities and I would go as far as to 
say that those irregularities related to possible corruption and even 
fraud and perhaps other crimes as well.  So he provided me with – with 
10 
this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was about how long after the meeting - the 
other meeting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it was about two 
weeks later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  While you do refer to this 
particular report much later in your evidence I think it is prudent to 
consider the report at this stage.  So in this regard I ask you to turn to 
Exhibit ZE which is a soft blue folder.  And in particular I ask you to 
20 
turn to page 2 of that affidavit.  In paragraph 5 on page 2 of this 
affidavit you mentioned that the progress report which was attached to 
your main affidavit was not in fact the actual report that you had 
intended to attach and so with this affidavit you attach the actu al report 
which is the report that you now speak of in your evidence as the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 60 of 212 
 
Report of Colonel Vassan Soobramoney.  Is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  This is the report 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I then ask you to turn to 
page 5 of the same bundle, soft bundle and because of the importance 
of this report to the entire investigation and the evidence that is yet to 
be presented I ask you to read through certain paragraphs into the 
record.  Can I ask you to read through the sec ond, third and fourth 
paragraphs please?  And before you do so for the record this particular 
report is titled Preliminary Report of Investigations Commercial Crime 
10 
Inquiry 07/05/2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it appears or it starts at page 5 of Exhibit ZE.  
Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I just want to 
confirm there are three paragraphs that are not numbered and then 
there are one set are numerically numbered.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Should I read 1? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if I could ask you to read 
20 
out the unnumbered paragraph 2, 3 and 4 which has the sub -
paragraphs in them. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Paragraph 2. 
“It is alleged that supply chain management from PHQ 
which will be Provincial Head Quarters Kwazulu Natal 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 61 of 212 
 
has from October 2009 to date utilised the services of 
Gold Coast Trading CC and settled claims in excess of 
R15 million.  On the little information given by  
Brigadier Lategan we were required to determine a 
link between Toshan Panday and members of supply 
chain 
management 
from 
provincial 
headquarters.  
However on Thursday the 6 May 2010 we were 
instructed 
by 
Brigadier 
Lategan 
to 
return 
the 
investigation file to provincial headquarters after he 
had received instructions to halt the investigations.  
10 
Thus 
far 
our 
investigations 
have 
revealed 
the 
following: 
There are three targets identified and what appears to 
be case – what appears to be there is a grammatical 
error sorry Chair.  Appears to be case of fraud and 
corruption namely Toshan Panday the Directors of 
Gold Coast Trading CC, Colonel Navin Madhoe 
attached to supply chain management provincial 
headquarters 
and 
Captain 
A 
Narainpesad 
also 
attached to supply chain management at provincial 
20 
headquarters.  Toshan Panday is also the director of 
eight other CC’s registered in the name – in his name.  
In two of the CC’s he has a partner.  From October 
2009 to date supply chain management from provincial 
headquarters have paid Gold Coast Trading in excess 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 62 of 212 
 
of R15 million for services rendered.  Of these claims 
99% on respect of accommodation obtained for SAPS 
members whilst two claims are for the procurement of 
blankets, one claim for two Sony Bravia 40 inch 
televisions, one claim for flipchart stands and one 
claim for the procurement of a generator.  It has also 
been established that supply chain management had 
made use of United Mzanzi Trading and Project CC a 
close corporation owned by Toshan Panday to hire 13 
C Class Mercedes Benz during February 2010 at a 
10 
cost of R198 000,00.” 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Paragraph 5 at the 
bottom of this page refers to a particular bed and breakfast, can you 
please identify the name and location of this bed and breakfast ?  It is 
in the actual heading. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It is called Tozers Bed 
and Breakfast at Bergville KwaZulu Natal Chair.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then what follows on the 
next page if you could start reading from the second lin e which begins 
with the first claim to give particularity to the natures of the claims that 
20 
were lodged? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“The first claim was from 24 December 2009 to 6 
January 2009.  The claims submitted and settled by 
SAP was for R113 400,00.  However the actual cost 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 63 of 212 
 
of the accommodation at Tozers Bed and Breakfast 
was R29 400,00.  The second claim from 6 January 
2010 to 22 January 2010 [6 nights for 6 members] for 
R172 800,00 was settled by the SAP.  Obviously the 
police.  The actual cost of the accommodation at 
Tozers Bed and Breakfast was only R33  600,00.  
However with regard to the second part of the claim 
Toshan Panday made use of Tozers Bed and 
Breakfast to accommodate the members and no 
further members arrived as an addition to  the man – 
10 
probably the main power requested for the detached 
duties.  However in the second part of the claim he 
submits that two late comers were accommodated at 
a cost of R43 200,00.  This amount is included in the 
R172 800,00 settled by the SAP.  Our i nvestigations 
revealed that only six members were deployed at 
Eskort for the required duties.  It would appear that 
this claim is false.”  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  To give credence to that 
summary you have mentioned I ask then that you deal with readin g 
20 
paragraph 6 and 7 please. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Of the same report? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Of the same report. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Paragraph 6. 
“In respect of the above deployment of six members 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 64 of 212 
 
to Eskort the total cost that the police would have 
incurred had they made bookings directly at Tozers 
B&B would have cost R63  000,00.  And then it says 
in brackets [R29 400,00 plus R33 600.00].  However 
by making use of Gold Coast Trading CC the SAP 
had to fork out R286 200,00 and then in brackets 
[breakdown of R113 400,00 plus R172 800.00]. An 
over expenditure of R223 200,00.  A statement has 
been obtained from the owner of Tozers Bed and 
Breakfast who submitted that he had charged 
10 
R350,00 per person per night.  However Gold  Coast 
Trading CC had billed the SAP R1  350,00 per person 
per night for eight members and not for six as 
submitted by Ms Tozer.”  
Then paragraph 7: 
“A second claim was submitted and settled for 
R119 880,00 
for 
six 
members 
that 
were 
accommodated at Pinetown.  According to the 
application for accommodation from Captain Narain 
Prasad accommodation was required for six members 
20 
being trainers from Pretoria for the training of NIU 
members.  NIU that means the National Intervention 
Unit 
members 
at 
Chatsworth 
College from 
21 
February 2010 to 14 March 2010.  Our investigations 
have revealed that the trainers were not from 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 65 of 212 
 
Pretoria but from KZN.  One trainer stayed at his 
house and travelled daily to the course as he lived 
nearby.  The course organiser Colonel Allie fr om the 
Divisional Commissions Training at Pretoria was 
contacted and he submitted that all trainers and 
trainees in respect of the abovementioned training 
were to be accommodated at the Chatsworth Training 
College.  No financial authority was granted for a ny 
member 
or 
trainer 
to 
be 
housed 
in 
private 
accommodation and an allowance of R50,00 per day 
10 
was however authorised.  Colonel Allie informed that 
no trainer from Pretoria travelled to Chatsworth 
College for the training of the NIU members.  It 
would appear that the expenses met for the – met – 
probably meant for the payment of this claim was 
utilised from KZN Provincial budget. From my 
investigations it appears that the trainers were 
accommodated at Ms Getz B&B despite being 
instructed to stay at Chatsworth College.  The actual 
cost of the accommodation paid by Gold Coast 
20 
Trading CC was R30 492,00 but the SAP was billed 
R119 800,00.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I guess you are not going to require asking him to 
read the whole report? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No Chair. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 66 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can just talk to important features or what he is 
able to make out of the report?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If – as it pleases Chair.  There 
is just two more paragraphs if I may?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Which ones? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 13 which is on page 
8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay and which one?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And paragraph 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Those are shorter. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Paragraph 16 and 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And 17 and the first sentence 
on paragraph 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine they are short.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In paragraph 13. 
“Our investigations has also revealed that Gold 
Coast Trading CC has submitted a tender of R55 
million for accommodation for SAP members for the 
duration of the 2010 World Cup.  This tender needs 
20 
urgent investigation.”  
And which is the next paragraph?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Paragraph 16, 16 on the same 
page. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 16. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 67 of 212 
 
“The invoices submitted by Gold Coast Trading CC 
do not have a VAT number and could possibly not be 
registered for VAT. This matter has to be reported to 
SARS for investigation as well.”  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then the first sentence on 
paragraph 17. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Our investigation also revealed that – that Gold 
Coast Trading is not registered as an agent to 
provide accommodation for [the grammar is not so] 
10 
for co-operates thus qualifying for a com mission.” 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in conclusion on page 9 
the requirements of the investigators is noted in the last paragraph.  
Can I ask you to just read that last paragraph please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which starts with it is 
our submission? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Correct. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“It is our submission that we would be able to prove 
fraud and or corruption in this matter.  We require 
20 
unhindered investigation in this matter and the call 
up instructions for all detached duties including the 
written request for the accommodation and other 
items mentioned above that was sourced by Gold 
Coast Trading CC.” 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 68 of 212 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Is it thus correct to 
just summarise what you have r ead.  That Mr Toshan Panday was the 
director of the claimant for all of these claims for Gold Coast Trading 
CC? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  From reading the 
report Chair that is my interpretation.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it also correct that there 
were essentially the following people who were involved in these 
particular transactions such being Mr Toshan Panday?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Colonel N Madhoe? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Navin Madhoe that is 
correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And Captain A Narainpersad if 
I… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct it was 
Aswin Narainpersad. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I have pronounced that 
correctly.  Is it then also evident from this report that the issues 
relating to the claim concerned false claims submitted to the South 
20 
African Police Services?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it also correct that there was 
an inflation of costs for the claims that were submitted to the South 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 69 of 212 
 
African Police Services for payment?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I would go further 
than that Chair they were drastic infla – those prices were drastically 
inflated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So having read the report at that time when you got 
it, it was clear to you that the persons who had compiled it were making 
some progress in their investigation and that they were getting to know 
that there indeed appeared to have been certain crimes that had been 
committed and they say at the end of their report they were confident 
that if they were given time to investigate more and their investigation 
10 
was unhindered they were confident that they could prove certain 
crimes including fraud and maybe corruption?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  If I can then ask you to 
quickly turn to Annexure JWB1 which is in your – in file ZA and that is 
at page 7 [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page of EXHIBIT ZA?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  72. 
CHAIRPERSON:  72, okay.  Yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that this was in fact a 
follow up report that was done pursuant to the first report that was jus t 
referred to now? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Or earlier, sorry. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 70 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but before we get there having read the report 
that you – parts of which you read a few minutes ago did you do 
anything about, about the report or the request made by those who 
prepared the report to say we would like to have an unhindered 
investigation to take this forward?  Is there anything you are supposed 
to do about – is there anything you did arising from being aware of the 
report? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the first report 
that I have just read out from. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was submitted to 
me by Soobramoney two - about two weeks after I was told to stop the 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The fact that he had 
given me the report imputes that we were still on the same score that 
that I was still supervising the inves tigation albeit surreptitiously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was it two weeks after the first call from the 
Provincial Commissioner when you were on the road or was it two 
20 
weeks after the meeting, the meeting that you talked about?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was two weeks, two 
weeks after the meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Where she – where 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 71 of 212 
 
Kemp and company were present and she told Ntanjana to investigate.  
So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  This report came two 
weeks after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you have been given this report.  It can be 
said to have been part of pursuing the arrangement that was made with 
General Dramat to say the investigation should continue and what role  
you would play and so on.  That was part of that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
I 
think 
10 
Advocate September had alluded to it earlier on that whilst I was 
preparing the statement of mine that I was writing it from my 
recollection of what occurred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And sometimes things 
are not perfectly in sequence here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I – if my memory 
serves me correctly I only spoke to Dramat a bit later.  If my memory 
serves me correctly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Ja, I remember that paragraph was 
in a wrong, wrong place.  Alright.  Ja, it was not in the right place. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could perhaps assist. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 72 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Due to the change of date which was 
rectified through a supplementary affidavit the date being changed from 
May 2011 to 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It shifted in sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But it was during late May  2010 as 
the General had given evidence that he met with Dramat in Pretoria.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just as an update then in terms of 
what this progress report stated which also is necessary for the 
evidence to follow.  Can I ask you to turn to page 75 of that particular 
bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is a very poor copy.  If it all possible maybe 
arrangements could be to get a better copy but if attempt s have been 
made and this is the best we – that can be obtained that is okay.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  My copy is 
similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
I 
would 
certainly 
request 
the 
investigators to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In obtaining a clear report if 
possible. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 73 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
if 
I 
could 
perhaps just assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  These reports – and I 
will perhaps speak to this later on in my evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  A number of reports 
and statements had gone missing from the dockets.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And a number of these 
reports I had to acquire from the investigators.  Some of them who 
subsequently required a number of the documents that are attached.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Were documents that I 
duplicated at the time which I kept.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In a safe location. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So the only way that 
20 
we will be able to get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this might be the best that we can have?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Unless they go to the 
prosecutor who is currently seized with this matter in KZN and ask her.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 74 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I understand even 
from her that various documents and reports have gone missing from 
the - those dockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  It may be that in the end one can read 
everything that is in it which is the most important thing.  Okay.  That is 
fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then ask you at paragraph 13 
to just read the first sentence of th at into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September I do not know whether your voice has 
10 
become softer than earlier. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if the people at th e back hear but 
maybe you can try and raise it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen if I can ask you to 
read the first sentence of paragraph 13 at page 75 into the record 
please? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 13. 
20 
“It has also been established that the target at 
Provincial Headquarters has the authority to sign 
off acquisitions to the maximum of R200  000.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who would this target be as 
referred to in the report? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 75 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
could 
be 
Colonel Navin Madhoe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could then ask you to read from 
the second sentence in paragraph 14 please to the end of that 
paragraph? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 14, the 
third sentence. 
“The target at Provincial Headquarters manipulated 
the system by ensuring that the claims were split as 
not to exceed the R200 000 limit.  In actual fact 
10 
Gold Coast Trading CC submitted a weekly claim for 
long detached duties.  A schedule of payments is 
available to prove this theory.”  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then paragraphs 15 and 16. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 15: 
“Nedbank contacted me to inform me that the 
Director of Gold Coast Trading CC has informed 
them that inquiries had been made into his account.  
He specifically mentioned the purchase of his new 
Ferrari where he paid R510  000 deposit.  The 
20 
information was only given to two senior officers 
from Provincial Headquarters and included in the 
reports 
submitted 
to 
Major  General Booysen.  
According 
to 
Major General Booysen 
he 
had 
submitted the report to the PC and he has not heard 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 76 of 212 
 
anything from her with regards to returning the 
original investigation file that was taken from the 
investigation team.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that team last sentence refers to 
the engagement that you had then with the Provincial Commissioner to 
which you have already given evidence at which you provided her and 
Ntanjana with a copy of the report.  Is that co rrect? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Have we gone – have 
we actually discussed that meeting?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You – the evidence that you gave is 
10 
that you gave a copy of this report to two people such being one the 
Provincial Commissioner a nd two being Ntanjana.  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I am not so 
sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am not too sure if we 
have covered that yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure if I follow.  We are presently  
dealing with the report at page 7 – starting at page 73 of EXHIBIT ZA.  
Now part of the report one of the paragraphs talk about a report that 
20 
had been apparently given to the Provincial Commissioner.  Is that what 
you are talking about? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So what is the question?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me rather retract the question.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 77 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may.  If I could then just ask you 
to read paragraph 16 and paragraph 18 int o the record pleases? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of, of the same 
report? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Of the same report. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraphs 16 and 
17? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes please. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 16: 
10 
“At this stage all the information needed to continue 
with the investigation is only available at supply 
chain management and ORS...”  
ORS will be Operational Response Services.  
“…at Provincial Headquarters.  We cannot get any 
information from PQ…” 
Provincial Headquarters I assume that is.  
“…owing to interference and obstacles from senior 
management.  In respect of the two Sony Bravia 
TVs 
supposedly 
purchased 
for 
Provincial 
20 
Headquarters there appears to be no record in the 
assets of the state.  The TVs were paid from the…”  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Not that paragraph the next one 
which is paragraph 18 please. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  “In order for 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 78 of 212 
 
any success to be achieved the investigation team 
must 
be 
allowed 
to 
investigate  
this 
matter 
unhindered and also to report directly to Lieutenant 
General Dramat or any senior officer appointed by 
him.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is correct then that this report 
has been compiled by Colonel  V Soobramoney dated 4 June 2010? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is apparent from this report 
according to the evidence that you have given relative to the report is 
10 
that unhindered investigation was necessary.  Is that correct/  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The earlier report that we dealt with would have been 
given to you in May? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and this was beginning of June, 4  June? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So were there monthly reports that were being given 
to you about the progress of the investigation?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair there were no 
prescribed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Periods. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Periods on which 
they. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 79 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  We – it was done in a 
solitary fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  So what are the important feature s of this 
second report – this report that you want to highlight in terms of the 
reports were to you and obviously seen what progress was being made.  
You were to decide whether there was anything you needed to do or 
you simply needed to allow the investig ation to continue? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I do not know 
whether I have covered this in my evidence or not yet with regards to 
10 
the earlier report which I received two weeks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If you think it links to that - to this you can talk 
about it. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would just like to 
clarify that first before I go into this report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So let us do that.  How do we do that?  Where 
do we go in order for you to testify about something that you w ant to 
testify or will you be guided?  Ms  September do you know what he is 
talking about? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  The page number is page 
20 
7 of his main affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is paragraph 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  23. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 80 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair the report 
that I am referring to there is the report in EXHIBIT ZE.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the report that you talk about in paragraph 23 of 
your affidavit is the report that we find in EXHIBIT ZE?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Go ahead. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now Chair that report 
when Vassan Soobramoney gave me that report I wanted to use that 
report to exert pressure on the PC, Ngobeni.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I went up to her 
office with this report and I said to her General I have got a follow up 
report from the investigating officers – from Soobramoney – and it is 
clear from this report that we cannot just sweep this under the carpet.  
She then asked me for a copy of this repor t and I specifically mention 
this which will become evident later why I am mentioning this now.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Unless the evidence 
leader wants me to deal with that now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So she says to me 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 81 of 212 
 
give me a copy of that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now Soobramoney 
gave me – Soobramoney is the IO.  He has compiled the report.  He 
gave me a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So she says to me 
she wants a copy of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ntanjana – by then 
10 
she also summonsed Ntanjana because I said to her because I 
suspected that Ntanjana had not done anything.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  About the so called 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She summonsed him 
to her office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Asked him how far the 
20 
investigation had gone and he had some obscure.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Answer. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Explanation he is 
waiting for a document, but it was clear that absolutely nothing had 
been done about the investigation.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 82 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then I told her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was about two weeks after that meeting that 
you told us about? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two weeks that he had been given, Ntanjana?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ja and it was clear to 
me that he had not even commenced with anything whatsoever.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So - and I made it 
clear to them that this re port from Soobramoney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  We cannot just leave 
this.  Then she asked me for a copy of the report and so did Ntanjana.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I made two copies.  I 
gave one to Ngobeni and one to Ntanjana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes, okay.  Thank you.  You asked to deal with 
20 
this in response to – because I had asked you the question what you 
did after reading the second report from Soobramoney.  The report that 
is in EXHIBIT ZA starting I think at page 73.  So my question was 
whether arising from reading that report there was anything you did.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No not from my side 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 83 of 212 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not from your side, but the report was directed to 
you.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and, and it would have been given also to 
General Dramat or you do not know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I, I suspect and 
I am speculating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think Soobramoney 
10 
at this juncture thought Booysen is also in with the PC.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he – I suspect that 
he gave this to Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because I think they 
suspected that I am also involved in covering up.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, but why would you not have done 
20 
anything arising out of it in the light of what appears to be a repeated 
plea.  I think starting from the previous report to say we need to be 
afforded an unhindered investigation.  I would have thought that you 
would have wanted to go back to Soobramoney and I say hear that just 
like in the first report you gave me you are still concerned that you are 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 84 of 212 
 
not getting an unhindered investigation.  This is what I have to say 
about it. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair various events 
unfolded after this which will become clear in m y evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And my interactions 
with Soobramoney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I do not want to 
pre-empt what my evidence is going to be later on.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
With 
regards 
to 
meetings I had with the PC and instructions that were given with 
regards to, to Soobramoney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did take certain steps is that r ight? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Soobramoney knew 
that I had their back.  All those investigators knew that I had their back.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
I 
made 
it 
abundantly clear to them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That I will, I will 
protect them in the investigation and I think I have proven that 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 85 of 212 
 
throughout the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Ms September you may have to make a 
judgment call.  Certain things belong to certain events and the timing 
and so on.  So I leave it to you whether the things that he is talking 
about should be dealt with now or later, but it is logical that if you get a 
report and people report to you, you should talk about what you may 
have done as a res ult of that report. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am – you have your own plan of how you want to 
deal with this.  So I am just alerting you that some of the most natural 
10 
questions that arise might need to be addressed e arlier than how the 
statement has been arranged. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact he is about to address some 
of the queries that Chair has now raised.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to that end it was during late 
June 2010 that you were once again summonsed to the Police 
Commissioner ’s office.  Is that correct?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Can I just check 
where about we are in my, in my statement?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You can turn to page 8 paragraph 24.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please explain to the Chair what had 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 86 of 212 
 
then transpired at this particular meeting and who was present.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Paragraph 28, did you say paragraph 28?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  24.  Okay.  Tell us what happened sometime in June.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I was called to 
the Provincial Commissioner’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And so I took the lift 
and I went to her office and she has an office with an adjourning 
10 
boardroom which are separated.  There is a door between the two and I 
entered the office and she asked me to go with her into the boardroom.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So she go up from 
behind her desk and I got up and she opened the door.  We went into 
the boardroom and on entering the boardroom I notic ed a lady who was 
introduced to me as Tasha  Giyapersad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tasha? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Giyapersad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She was an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Then 
there 
was 
another gentleman whom I recognised as being Advocate  Mkhize. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 87 of 212 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I recognised. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry, sorry to interrupt you, but just 
for the record can I ask you to spell Tasha  Giyapersad please? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is G-I-Y-A-P-E-R-S-
A-D. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The one gentleman 
there I recognised as being Advocate  Mkhize and I had engaged with 
him before in police matters – in High Court matters.  So he obviously 
10 
knew me and he stood up and greeted me and then I was introduced to 
a gentleman by the name of Toshan  Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the Provincial Commissioner asked that the two of 
you proceed to the boardroom?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the boardroom you met the three persons who 
you have mentioned.  So, so it was now in that boardroom yourself, the 
Provincial Commissioner, Advocate Mkhize, Ms Giyapersad and there 
was somebody else as well, Panday.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Toshan Panday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Toshan Panday, ja.  Okay, ja.  Proceed and what 
happened? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair during this 
meeting and I felt very uncomfortable during this meeting because I 
now realised that Toshan  Panday was one of the main subjects of this 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 88 of 212 
 
investigation that we were busy with and it was almost as if he chaired 
the meeting.  He accused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to, up to the time you entered the boardroom you 
still did not know what the meeting was about?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why you were called? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Okay tell. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell us what happened when the meeting started.  
AJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
after 
the 
introductions I was basically peppered with questions from Panday and 
Giyapersad.  They accused the investigators of not having a mandate 
and they are investigating unlawfully and they were almost on a fishing 
expedition to try and I had to negotiate my way through this meeting  
trying to avoid answering certain questions because I was not going to 
give feedback. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But hang on.  You have been called by the Provincial 
20 
Commissioner and, and she takes you into the boardroom where there 
are the people who you have mention ed.  The meeting is supposed to 
open, to be opened and everybody gets told what the meeting is about 
and one would expect that the Provincial Chairperson would be the 
person – the Provincial Commissioner would be the person who would 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 89 of 212 
 
do that.  Did she do that? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair this was no 
ordinary meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was not an ordinary meeting. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is why I say it 
almost like Toshan Panday was chairing the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but did he say what the meeting was about or did 
he just start asking you questions?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No they started by – 
obviously everyone by now knew about the investigation.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he started by 
making allegations that – and his attorney started talking and then he 
would interrupt her and they were asking questions about the 
investigation what mandate do we have and they even said that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But had you been told why each one  was here and so 
on?  You had not been told?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what their role was?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was an attorney.  There was an advocate.  
There was a suspect.  There was a Provincial Commissioner and 
yourself. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I felt a lot like I 
had been ambushed. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 90 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is how I felt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the attorney was Panday’s attorney? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was Mkhize his advocate?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And they levelled 
these allegations and I was for lack of a better description trying to do 
some shadow boxing around the allegations and I just wanted to get out 
10 
there.  One of the allegations that they came up with was that 
Soobramoney was extorting money from P anday.  So to my amazement 
the Provincial Commissioner who had already instructed me to stop this 
criminal investigation now tells me to investigate – she tells me to 
investigate my investigator - Soobramoney – for the so called extortion.  
So I indicated to the people that I can only investigate if they give me 
an affidavit which Giyapersad undertook to supply to me. She did 
subsequently – well maybe if I could just finish with this, with this 
meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, finish with the meeting, ja. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So during this meeting 
as I said I was peppered with questions and I had to negotiate my way 
through trying to avoid talking about specifics.  I dealt with the 
accusations and told them well I cannot see them accessing b ank 
statements etcetera unlawfully because they would not be able to 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 91 of 212 
 
utilise that as evidence at a later stage and that is after instruction was 
given that I should investigate Soobramoney the meeting was then.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the end of the meeting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was the end of 
the meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us try and get the gist of what was said.  There 
were allegations that you people were investigating without a mandate.  
Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was the basis given for that allegation, was 
10 
there a basis given why that allegation was being made?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair as I said 
Panday was carrying on there like he  was the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chairperson? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
The 
Provincial 
Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And he was going like 
this and he said to Giyapersad, I want you to sue th em, I’m going to 
sue you, it was actually quite, I was actually quite annoyed with the 
20 
way in which he carried on there as if he was the Provincial 
Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did the Provincial Commissioner say anything 
during that meeting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No she didn’t. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 92 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She just sat there and listened. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   She sat there and 
listened to a suspect interrogating me about an investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Advocate Mkisi did he say anything? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I had quite a 
cordial relationship with Mkisi because of our previous engagements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   But he was merely a 
spectator and I must say – and he also passed on subsequently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So the one allegation that was made was 
10 
that you people were investigating without a mandate, but I’m not sure 
if that makes sense to me, I mean that allegation, the police are there 
to investigate, who is supposed to give the police their mandate they 
are there to investigate. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it didn’t make 
sense to me, either at the time and still doesn’t make sense to me, he – 
they said we had no mandate to investigate, I don’t know what he 
meant by that, whether we had to seek authority from the Provincial 
Commissioner or whether we had to get prior authority from whomever 
to investigate but they said that my people did not have a mandate to 
20 
do this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so the one allegation was that you people were 
investigating without a mandate, another one was that Soobramoney 
was demanding money for them in order for them to stop the 
investigation extortion. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 93 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That’s correct Chair 
but there was another accusation as well and that was that my 
investigators were accessing bank statements unlawfully.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: And I made it clear to 
them I doubt that they would do something like that becaus e they would 
then not be able to utilise those bank statements as evidence in the 
Court of Law.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you say that you responded – you tried to 
respond in general without specifics?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja and then the meeting was over.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the meeting ended on the basis that insofar as 
they were accusing Soobramoney of extortion, you said they must give 
you an affidavit and then you would be able to look into that.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and after the meeting did you have a chance to 
say to the Provincial Commissioner what was this all about, what’s 
going on? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it was starting 
to become clear to me that something was amiss, so I – as a matter of 
fact I didn’t even want to talk to her after that I just excused myself and 
went to my office. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes okay thank you.   
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 94 of 212 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On your suspicion as your evidence 
entails that something was amiss, can I ask you to turn to page 17 of 
your affidavit – main affidavit in Bundle ZA at paragraph 55.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Paragraph? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   55 so it’s page 17 at paragraph 55, 
reference there is made to an independent forensic report can you 
please inform the Chair about this in the context of the evidence that 
you’ve given so far? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I refer to a 
forensic audit report by Price Waterhouse Coopers which is an 
10 
independent firm of accountants whom we had commissioned to do a 
independent forensic investigation into the financial aspects of the 
procurement and the payment of the money but even before I acquired 
this report from Price Waterhouse Cooper the investigators had 
reported to me – and that was during the same period that the 
investigation was being stopped and I think it was late May that there 
had been a birthday party for the hus band of the Provincial 
Commissioner, it was a surprise birthday party and the investigators 
informed me that this party had been paid for by Toshan Panday, it was 
a lavish party in a hotel in Umhlanga Rocks.  So those reports had 
20 
alerted me that there was something amiss here. 
CHAIERPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And according to the report what was 
the amount of money that was spent on the birthday party for the 
husband of the Provincial Commissioner at the time?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 95 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair the figure 
quoted was R30 000.00 but there were other statements in the 
investigation which indicated that the party actually cost R20  000.00 
and when Panday paid for it with his credit card he asked for a receipt 
of R30 000.00 I don’t know wha t his intentions were to obtain a receipt 
for a higher amount but it would appear that the actual amount paid 
was R20 000.00 whereas the receipt obtained by him was for 
R30 000.00. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the – so what you’re saying is there was an 
10 
independent forensic audit report from Price Waterhouse which 
reflected that Mr Panday had paid a certain amount of money for a 
birthday – for the birthday party of the Provincial Commissioner ’s 
husband and that the amount mentioned was about R30 000.00? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That is correct Chair 
but before I had this report the investigators had already indicated to 
me that there was this party for which Panday had paid.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so this report was confirm ing something you had 
heard?    
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And just to clarify, that birthday 
party happened, approximately when?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think it was towards 
the end of May Chair roundabout the 29 t h of May.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 96 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it’s something that happened during the same 
year when you started the investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That’s right Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So if I can just quickly take you back 
to the meeting that you had in late – if we can go back now to 
paragraph 24 on page 8 of your affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry just to connect this, if the birthday party 
happened sometime late in May 2010 it means it happened – it means 
that when you were called for the first time by the Provincial 
10 
Commissioner when you were on the road in your car and when the 
second call also came and when that meeting happened, in all 
probability arrangements for that party were happening because it’s the 
same month? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair what I can say 
about that there’s another witness who had deposed to an affidavit that 
– it’s one of the secretaries of the Provincial Commissioner and she 
made a statement, which I have a copy of and which she says, I think it 
was on the 26 t h of May, the Provincial Commissioner, during the 
morning meeting, I wasn’t present at that meeting, then indicated there 
20 
was going to be this party – surprise party for her husband and that she 
would invite certain individuals and she apologised to those present 
that she could not invite all of them for obvious reasons and she still 
indicated to one of the brigadiers, according to the statement, Brigadier 
Winkelman that it’s not because I don’t like you if I don’t invite you it’s 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 97 of 212 
 
because of other constraints but the significant part of what occurred 
there was what happened after the meeting because the secretary then 
went to the Provincial Commissioner and asked her th ose that’s going 
to be invited, are the spouses also invited and it’s at that point where 
the Provincial Commissioner looked at the minutes and saw that she 
had recorded the issue about the party and then she remonstrated with 
her for having recorded that as part of the minutes and that was on the 
26 t h.  So it would appear that there had been preparations for the party 
prior to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I could then just quickly take you 
back to  page 8 of your affidavit which then details – at which you then 
address the evidence that you had already given in relation to the 
meeting that you had late June 2010, can I just ask what exactly was 
the Police Commissioner’s attitude at that meeting towards continuance 
of the investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Which meeting are 
we referring to Chair? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The one at paragraph 24 at which 
you have already given evidence where Mr Panday, Mrs Tasha 
20 
Giyapersad and Advocate Mkisi was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Isn’t that the one where he said the Provincial 
Commissioner was quiet throughout, is that not the one?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair that is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes what’s the question then?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 98 of 212 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   My question is was – did the Police 
Commissioner indicate her attitude at all to continuance of the 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Not 
during 
the 
meeting Chair but before we met, and I omitted to mention it before we 
went in she confirmed with me that the investigation had stopped 
before...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   She confirmed that the investigation should be 
stopped? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
No 
that 
it 
had 
10 
stopped.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That it had stopped? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So I confirmed with 
her that it had stopped because it did not but that’s just before we 
entered the boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so just before you get into the boardroom 
she says to you the investigation has stopped.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your understanding would have been that the 
investigation that she was talking about that she was saying has 
20 
stopped, would be the investigation by Ntanjana because she had said 
Ntanjana was the one who was going to investigate. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair I think she 
was referring to the investigation that we were busy with that, that had 
stopped. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 99 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because we were now 
going to enter into a meeting with Panday and company and I think she 
just wanted to get clarity from me before we entered there that the 
investigation had stopped.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but was she asking you whether it had stopped or 
was she telling you tha t the investigation had stopped?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No by then she had 
already told me on more than one occasion to stop it so before we 
entered she asked me has the investigation – has it stopped so I said 
10 
to her yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay now I understand.  Okay but then – okay 
when you get into the meeting she doesn’t tell these people that the 
investigation has stopped instead the people are bombarding you with 
questions but you also didn’t say but the investigation has stopped, you 
didn’t say that either?   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No I did not say that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but she also didn’t?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No she didn’t. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair, thank you for 
clarifying that point and it was then at that meeting that you were – you 
mentioned that Soobramoney was – or rather allegations were made 
against him in relation to extortion from Mr Toshan Panday, that’s 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 100 of 212 
 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
 
And 
what 
was 
the 
Police 
Commissioner ’s direction to you in relation to that allegation against Mr 
Soobremoney? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair then she said 
to me that I should investigate Colonel Vassan Soobramoney.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And did you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
did 
Chair, 
I 
requested then for an affidavit and I think it was a day or two later 
10 
Tasha Giyapersad, the attorney arrived at my office w ith a statement, 
just like a half page it wasn’t even a full page but it was one of these 
nonsensical statements that – taken from Panday obviously that he had 
received this anonymous call and someone extorting a million rand from 
him but they couldn’t ide ntify the person.  So I took that statement and 
there was nothing – no-one else that I could approach to confirm so I 
confronted – well if I say confronted I say that in inverted commas, 
Vassan Soobramoney and I told him about the investigation and I 
obtained a warning statement from him and I presented the docket to 
the senior public prosecutor who then went through the docket and he 
20 
declined to prosecute the matter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this is the same Colonel 
Soobramoney who had authored the r eports that you have submitted to 
this Commission...(intervention)  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That was the same 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 101 of 212 
 
Soobramoney Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you, about one week later you 
were summoned to another meeting...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let him do the testifying let him testify about 
these events don’t – yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair I was – 
about a week later I was called to another meeting this time around 
same scenario, go to the office...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: Now to the – you were called to the Provincial 
Commissioner ’s office again.   
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: That’s right Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON: And this time who called you, did somebody phone you 
this time?   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
So what would 
happen Chair the Provincial Commissioner’s secretary would phone my 
secretary would then tell me the PC wants to see you.  
CHAIRPERSON: Oh okay alright you were in the same building you 
were on the 14 t h floor and she was on the 18 t h floor.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   She was on the 18 t h 
floor so I get into the lift, go up to her office, exactly the same thing 
20 
happened, go into her office, she’s alone door closed to the boardroom 
she confirms with me that the inv estigation had stopped, I confirm the 
investigation had stopped she said come with me, we go into the 
boardroom, same scenario but this time...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on you just told us about a meeting 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 102 of 212 
 
that happened where you got call ed to her office and you went into her 
office she was alone and she said the two of you had to go to the 
boardroom which is adjacent to her office or from her office you go into 
the boardroom, you went into the boardroom with her and found certain 
people there.  Now are you saying that now there was another meeting 
where more or less the same thing was happening, you go into her 
office, then she says you must go into the boardroom, she asks you 
about the investigation whether it has stopped, you confirm it has 
stopped and then you go into the boardroom, is that what you are 
saying? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That’s what I’m saying 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And in-between from the previous meeting there had 
been no interactions between the two of you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I tried to avoid her 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but did she try to make contact...(intervention).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Not that I can recall 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m just wondering why when you had told her before 
20 
that the investigation had stopped she would call you up and she asked 
you again, has the investigation stopped and you say yes and then – 
it’s like a repeat of the previous meeting.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I suspect what could 
have happened is, Panday and Mandoe are subjects of the investigation 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 103 of 212 
 
obviously had a network and they knew that the investigation hadn’t 
stopped because witnesses are now being approached from a 
respective bed & breakfast, so although I’m telling her the in vestigation 
had stopped...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   The truth was it had not stopped. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: And it could not be 
concealed because we had to approach – Chair in the end there were 
over 200 affidavits obtained in that inves tigation so somehow it must 
have gotten to Panday and Mandoe that, look, that in spite of the 
assurances given by the PC this thing is still proceeding and I think it 
10 
was at their behest that she...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Called the meeting. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair, 
she entertained them. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright so I stopped you as you were saying 
you went to her office and then the two of you went into the boardroom 
but before going to the boardroom she asked you  whether the 
investigation had stopped and you said yes and then you entered the 
boardroom. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So I went into a 
20 
second 
ambush Chair, now 
this 
time around 
because 
of 
my 
engagements with a number of High Court cases, I knew  most of the 
counsel in, especially Durban, so I walked in and there again I 
encountered Advocate Choudree SC whom I knew and Advocate Stix 
Mdladla whom I also knew.  So we exchanged greetings and then with 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 104 of 212 
 
them was again Tasha Giyapersad the attorney and Toshan Panday. 
More or less the same scenario unfolded that had occurred previously 
but this time around by then the investigators had reported to me that 
Giyapersad had been interfering with the investigation.  What had 
happened is, statement had already been obtained and I can recall one 
specific one from Bongola it was at, I think, Crocodile Lodge, Crocodile 
Creek or something called like that...(intervention).  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   You mention it at paragraph 29 if I 
can direct you there. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Crocodile 
10 
Creek Guest House, now the owner of that Guest House was Edward 
Ngwenya, the investigators reported to me there were at least two 
witnesses – I recall this specific one which had been approached by 
Panday 
and 
in 
this 
particular 
instance 
when 
we 
did 
further 
investigations or the investigators did further investigation but I then 
phoned a captain in – so what had happened is Edward Ngwenya had 
already made an affidavit to the investigators and there was anot her 
guy by the name of Singh I cannot recall so they report to me that 
these same witnesses who had already deposed to affidavits have now 
been approached by Giyapersad and I know specifically with regards to 
20 
Ngwenya that I sent a captain there to confirm it and he phoned me 
back and he said to me no, he’d spoken to Ngwenya and Ngwenya said 
no, because of the dealings that he’d had with Gold Coast Trading, 
invoices were coming to and fro and he had to sign documents, they’d 
send him a document which he had to sign which he did but the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 105 of 212 
 
document that he had signed, according to the investigators was an 
affidavit which conflicted what he had said in his affidavit to the 
investigators.  So I took issue with that and I said at the meeting – so I 
thought let me have a go at them and I said to Giyapersad, listen, 
you’re not at liberty to go and interview witnesses that my investigators 
had already interviewed and that developed into a bit of a heated 
argument between myself and Giyapersad and then in the end Advocat e 
Choudree said to Giyapersad I think the general is right just leave this 
and we left it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So at this meeting the Provincial Commissioner, once 
10 
again, did not say anything?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No she did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And...(intervention).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: Chair one correction at 
that stage I – and I cannot recall exactly at what stage I indicate – 
because we were running the thing on an enquiry and I think the 
investigators Von Loggenberg, I think it was Von Loggenberg I think 
they were getting fed up and they went and registered – converted the 
thing to – the enquiry to a docket to an actual criminal docket.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh in the meantime? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: In the meantime.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Without your knowledge? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Without 
my 
knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you did...(intervention). 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 106 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   But they told me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh they told you ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And I think it was at 
that meeting where I said to the PC that a docket’s been opened now 
it’s been converted to a docket and then she said, well then she can’t 
interfere but I think she was merely stating the obvious.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja well – so was she not surprised that just before 
you entered the boardroom you had confirmed that the investigation 
had stopped but now in the meeting you’re saying actually the 
investigation had been upgraded to the opening of a docket it w as no 
10 
longer an enquiry.  I would have expected that if she had believed you 
when you said the investigation had stopped, if now at the meeting you 
say actually a docket has been opened she should have been 
surprised. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I suspect she was 
surprised Chair because she said, well there’s a docket open then I 
cannot interfere but my take on that was she was merely stating the 
obvious, she knew she could not have interfered from the word go.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so what impression did you get of what the 
purpose of this meeting was from what was discussed?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I’m going to 
speculate as a detective it was – it was evident to me that there were 
communication between the PC, Panday and Mandoe,  now Mandoe 
being the middleman within the same building that we work he’s 
involved with the dealings of Toshan Panday, I think he’s the in -
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 107 of 212 
 
between person between Panday and the PC, so they were alive to the 
fact that we were – the investigation was ongoin g.  I think there were – 
it was either they wanted to put pressure on us to stop with the 
investigation and as I will explain later on in my affidavit they went to 
other measures as well.  Some less drastic others more drastic to try 
and either (indistinct) or compromise the investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but at this meeting what allegations or what 
was said really by the Panday side if I can call it that by the attorney or 
the two Advocates were there or him...(intervention).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   It was the same as at 
10 
the first meeting, that we’re investigating unlawfully, we’re making use 
of unlawful methods, it was repetition of the previous allegations.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and how did this meeting end or what was the 
basis on which it ended? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Obviously Chair, after 
my heated discussion with Giyapersad the atmosphere was a bit thick 
and the meeting was called off by the PC and I left.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and did you do as you had done in the previous 
meeting in the previous similar meeting that after the meeting you 
didn’t want to speak to the Provincial Commissioner, you left or did you 
20 
have some discussion with her about this meeting?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair I didn’t but 
what was obvious to me after those engagements with her, the PC had 
a very aggressive behaviour in management meetings and General 
Ntanjana, General Masemolo?, General Jula whose another PC in Cape 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 108 of 212 
 
Town will bear me out here, the way she sometimes spoke to them,  I 
would cringe and me being the only white general there I – from that 
time onward I basically got away with murder.  I would sometimes – 
because her meetings could carry on for hours and hours and I would 
just stay away from the meetings, they dared not stay away from a 
meeting or come later at a meeting and she would have a go at them 
and she basically left me and – what I sense from that is, I think she 
was scared of what we were busy with.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that’s why she treated you differently?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I was treated much 
10 
better than any of the other generals.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
Yes, 
yes, 
she 
wouldn’t 
shout 
at 
you 
like...(intervention).   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair and if I stay 
away from a meeting she woul dn’t even ask me where you were like she 
would do with the rest of the generals.  
CHAIRPERSON: Yes that’s quite strange yes.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Just 
one 
last 
question to close up this point.  You mentioned that at this particular 
meeting you were accused of unlawful methods of investigating.  
20 
Paragraph 28 of your affidavit alludes to a method of investigating, can 
you please explain what you meant by unlawful methods that you were 
accused of? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
 
They 
were 
accusing 
the 
investigators Chair, of accessing their bank documents and other 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 109 of 212 
 
documents that could possibly incriminate them unlawfully.  Now Chair 
what happens is in practice it does happen from time to time where 
investigators would, through their contacts in th e banks, acquire 
information and then ex post facto obtain 205’s.  When they accused 
my investigators initially of doing that I engaged with them, I called 
them to my office and I said to them, chaps I don’t want any of this and 
they assured me 100% that every single cell phone record, bank 
statement that they had acquired were lawfully done by means of 
Section 205 subpoenas from the Criminal Procedure Act.  They were 
saying that my detectives did not have 205’s and hence they were – 
10 
because the reports, an d it will become clear later why they would say 
that because the information in the reports contained information that 
could only have been acquired from the banks by means, either from a 
205 or unlawfully but they were saying we acquired – or my 
investigators acquired it unlawfully. 
I see that in your statement at paragraph 27 one of the advocates that 
you say were present at the meeting that you talked about just now is 
written as Advocate Stix Madlala, I think it’s Mdladla.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Mdladla, thank you 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be Mdladla, I can’t remember if he writes 
it without an h but if he writes it with an h then it would be Mdlhalha, 
but I don’t know what your recollection is how it’s written but it’s not 
Madlala, it must be Mdladla. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you for the correction Chair.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 110 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair I note the time, and I have 
been informed that it may be prudent ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, we need to take the lunch adjournment, it’s 
already five past one, and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms September you  may proceed. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  General 
10 
Booysen you mentioned that there is a certain correction that you need 
to make in relation to evidence that you had given earlier on the 
Soobramoney Report.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair it 
relates to the second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The longer version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The Chair asked me if 
that report was directed at me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which I confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Although I am not a 
hundred percent sure whether it was written for me.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 111 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Or written for Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But be that as it may I 
only obtained that report at a much later stage.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  From – from 
Soobramoney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay long after it had been written?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay which makes you think it might not have been 
prepared with you in mind?  It might have been prepared for somebody 
else and then that is why you got it much  later? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I will have to 
speculate Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I did say earlier on it was 
directed at me but I am not a hundred percent sure whether it was for 
20 
me or for Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well when I asked you the question I was asking 
you precisely because of that because my understanding and it may 
have been a mistaken understanding because of how some of th e 
events are dealt with in the new affidavit.  My understanding was that it 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 112 of 212 
 
– because of the role that you were supposed to play at a formal or 
official level after your discussion with General Dramat in Pretoria that 
it may be the report was meant for Gen eral Dramat and you were just 
being given it at a – on an unofficial basis.  That is what I was thinking 
and you are not sure? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am not a hundred 
percent sure of that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I may then – if we could go 
back to where you ended off just before the long adjournment.  You 
10 
were speaking about a Section 205 subpoena that was sought in 
relation to information that was required to be obtained.  Can you 
please in very simple terms explain to the public at large exactly what 
is a Section 205 subpoena?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair a Section 205 
subpoena is which we acquire normally.  If – and I think it is originally 
written for recalcitrant witnesses who d o not want to testify so basically 
that Section 205 subpoena means you subpoena a person to come and 
answer questions to a prosecutor in a court of law.  But normally we 
also use the same Section 205 to acquire bank statement and also 
20 
telephone records and whatever records we might need to legitimise 
the institution handing over those documents or files to us we have to 
obtain a Section 205 certificate – subpoena in terms of The Criminal 
Procedure Act. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you very much.  And  that 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 113 of 212 
 
is in fact the procedure that was followed in order to access Mr Toshan 
Panday’s bank accounts in relation to the investigation against him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is so Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now for the evidence going 
forward I am going to ask you to just bear with me I am going to hop 
around a bit in the affidavit itself with no disturbance to the sequence 
of events or the timeline. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  If I can take you to page 
10 paragraph 32 please.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to summarise to see where we are.  You got a 
report from Brigadier Kemp which he intended to give to you and to the 
provincial commissioner but you took the one that was meant for the 
provincial commissioner before she arrived and you subsequently 
instructed is it Brigadier Lategan to investigate after you had had a 
look at this report that you got from Brigadier Kemp.  And Soobramoney 
and Kemp were to assist Lategan, is that correct or o nly Soobramoney? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Soobramoney – it 
was Soobramoney and Van Loggenberg.  Soobramoney was the lead 
investigator that stage. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay so Lategan was not the – the lead 
investigator? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No he was not Chair 
Soobramoney was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but he remained part of the investigation team or 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 114 of 212 
 
not really? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair he was – he 
was 
actually 
the 
direct commander 
of 
the 
Commercial 
Crime 
Investigations so he was – he reported to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I did not at – it 
was like following the protocol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is what you did and then they began to 
10 
investigate and at a certain stage while you were driving you got a call 
from the Provincial Commissioner who was quite upset and did not give 
you much time to respond to what she was saying but effect ively she 
wanted you to stop the investigation relating to the investigation that 
you had asked Lategan and the people under him to investigate.  And 
then subsequently you got or you told Lategan that the investigation 
should stop because that is what you had been told but in your own 
mind you wanted more time to think about how to handle the situation.  
And then – and thereafter the file was returned to you by Lategan and a 
week or two after that you got another call from the Provincial 
20 
Commissioner, is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is when you were or on that occasion she 
asked whether the investigation was still going on or that is what she 
talked about. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 115 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  that is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you told her the investigation had been stopped 
and then after that you – a week or two later you got a call you were 
asked to come to her office to the Provincial Commissioner’s office, is 
that right?  And that is wh ere you found that she took you to the 
boardroom and there were some people there.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair there is just 
something that I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  You missed out. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have missed out yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that is the – that is the one 
meeting that she had with Kemp, Madhoe, Ntanjana.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Masimolo and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is the one I want to talk – I am talking about.  
Is it before where I am?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was the first 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that was the first meeting.  But it was after the 
20 
second call from the Provincial Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair, 
that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  And then – oh that was the first 
meeting?  And then later on there was another meeting.  You were 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 116 of 212 
 
called to her office and from her office you went into her board – the 
boardroom with her.  Before you got into the boardroom she asked 
whether the investigation had stopped.  You assured her it had stopped.  
That is when you met Panday, his attorney and Advocate Mkeza and 
you told us what happened on that occasion.  After the meeting you 
went away.  Sometime later you were called and there was a similar 
meeting.  You were called to her office, she took you to the boardroom.  
There was a similar meeting but the participants now were Panday, his 
attorney and two advocates who had not attended the  previous meeting 
and Advocate Mkeza who had attended the previous meeting was no 
10 
longer there.  So the advocates now were Advocate Chaudhary and 
Advocate Sticks Mdlala.  And you have told us what happened and the 
argument that you had with Mr Panday’s attorney.  That is how far you 
told us so far? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Following the 
last meeting that the Chair has just eluded to where you had an 
exchange of words with Tasha Giyapersad did you take any further 
steps subsequent to that specific to Tasha Giyapersad?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I did Chair.  Between 
myself and some of the investigators that worked with me I cannot 
recall exactly who drafted the letter but we did report her conduct to 
the Law Society at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did anything come out of that or you cannot 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 117 of 212 
 
remember? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair – Chair 
subsequent to that she did something else which I perhaps sequentially 
talk about later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which was also 
reported to the Law Society and it is now a couple of years ago I was 
informed about a month ago to come and testify in Durban.  Two days 
before I had to go to that hearing I was told no they have remanded it 
indefinitely. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because of the new  
CHAIRPERSON:  The changes to the Law Society?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and nothing happened after that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Nothing happened 
after that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then take you to page 
10, paragraph 32 of your main affida vit.  Mention is made in your 
20 
affidavit of an engagement that you had with national police 
commissioner General Bheke Cele, can you please inform this 
commission about that engagement?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair at the time the 
current 
Minister 
of 
Police 
Mr 
Bheke 
Cele 
was 
the 
National 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 118 of 212 
 
Commissioner of Police.  I received a phone call from him and he 
enquired from me as to the interference that I was experiencing with 
the investigation.  So I briefly told him but I did not go into any detail 
because we were still busy with the investigation and he said to me that 
I should not entertain any interference and that I should continue with 
the investigation and he also said that the reporting lines should be the 
way it is defined in the police struct ures and that the investigator 
should report to me.  I suspect that General Dramat perhaps had 
brought that to his attention that there might be interference.  And that 
– that phone call gave me a lot of reassurance that I can – we can 
10 
continue with the investigation unabated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the effect of what – of what General Cele was 
saying to you was that one the investigation should continue?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the investigation he was t alking about was the 
one that the Provincial Commissioner had said should stop?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you stopped? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the same 
investigation Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was saying that the investigators should 
report to you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not to the National office. Not to General 
Dramat? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 119 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – that was what he was saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your understanding that what he was saying in 
terms of the investigators reporting to you and not to General Dramat 
was your understanding that he was insisting that the reporting lines be 
the way they are supposed to be?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was the 
impression I gained Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Turning over to page 11 
paragraph 33.  Did Mr Toshan Panday challenge the Section 205 
subpoena’s that were sought against him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is indeed so 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry and I know Ms September that you said 
some parts of the statement are not where they are supposed to be.  I 
do not know whether what you are asking him about is a way from what 
he may have done subsequent to receiving these instructions from 
Commissioner – from General Cele whether what General Cele said 
20 
should happen was  effected – implemented? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am saying I do not know whether you are moving 
away from that because I would like to know that whether as a result of 
maybe let me ask him.  As a result of or subsequent  to the instruction 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 120 of 212 
 
from General Cele was he – were his instructions then implemented in 
terms of 1. The continuation of the investigation.  2. The reporting 
lines. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
Chair 
the 
investigation bar the week or so that the fi le was lying on my table and 
in cognisant of the fact that the investigators were still continuing the 
investigation never really stopped.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Had never stopped ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Never stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But what did change 
was the reporting – the reporting lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But as I said those 
were for just to get the pressure off me from the Provincial 
Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That they reported to 
Brigadier Nkosi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And the instruction 
from Mr Bheki Cele at the time who was the National Commissioner 
number 1 the investigation must cont inue that I should not entertain 
any interference and number 2 that we should adhere to the reporting 
lines within the police. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 121 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that instance during the 
continuing investigation did Toshan Panday challenge the Section 205 
subpoena’s at all? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair at some 
juncture during the investigation obviously that was after the issue 
about the Section 205 subpoenas had come up he challenged the 
validity of the Section 205 subpoena’s in the high court in KwaZulu 
Natal.  We obviously between myself and the investigating officers we 
opposed it in the high court and the court ruled in our favour that the 
10 
Section 205 subpoenas were legitimately acquired.  Upon the initially 
filed notice of intention to appeal but he never prosecuted the appeal.  
CHAIRPERSON:  After the instruction you got from General Cele saying 
the – about reporting lines and the continuation of the investigation did 
you speak to the Provincial Com missioner to say I have actually 
received an instruction from the National Commissioner of the Police to 
say the investigation must continue or did you talk to her about it now 
at all? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No I did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I could then take you to page 
12 paragraph 41.  Did the investigation result in any search warrants 
being obtained and if so against wh om? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 122 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair that is indeed 
so.  So what happened is as a result of the information acquired via the 
Section 205 subpoenas the investigators were in a position to obtain – 
to apply for search warrants for the residences of  Toshan Panday, the 
businessman, Colonel Navin Madhoe, Captain Aswin Narainpersad and 
also for the Provincial headquarters in which I was based namely for 
the financial department, for the supply chain management department 
and for the department responsible for the deployment of police officers 
for instance in the World Cup soccer.  Those search warrants were 
obtained and I realised that if we were going to execute those warrants 
10 
with the Provincial Commissioner and the building that – that all hell 
might break lose so I – we – we devised a strategy and Chair it was 
very difficult with this investigation because information kept on leaking 
out.  No matter what precautions we tried to take.  So I instructed the 
investigators to assemble a team because we wan ted to do all the 
premises simultaneously.  Because once you start with one by the time 
you get to the last one all the incriminating evidence had been 
disposed of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I just interrupt you and ask 
20 
you to clarify which premises were then being targeted for search and 
seizure? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So it was the business 
premises of Toshan Panday, his residence – his – where he lived.  The 
residence of Madhoe, the residence of Narain Prasad and also their 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 123 of 212 
 
offices.  But as I said Chair also the financial department where we 
wanted to seize documents and also at the ORS that were responsible 
for the deployment of police officers.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had obtained search and seizure warrants, is 
that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In respect of the people and the premises that you 
have talked about? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please explain then 
the circumstances of how those search and seizure warrants were 
executed? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair as I said that I 
was a bit concerned that if this whole team descended upon Provincial 
headquarters and started searching the offices it – there might be a 
small little nuclear explosion in the building so we devised this plan 
and what we did is we assembled a group of detectives from the DPCI 
and I instructed the investigators not even to tell the m what was going 
to be searched the following day.  They assembled the night before and 
20 
we targeted a specific day on which the Provincial Commissioner 
wanted me to accompany her to a parliamentary lekgotla. So the plan 
was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the provincial legislature? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The provincial one 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 124 of 212 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So the plan was that I 
would accompany her the following morning and on entering the 
building I would get wind of the story that the offices are being 
searched but that was a plan that we had decided upon beforehand.  
CHAIRPERSON:  As you – the plan was that as you were entering the 
building of the provincial legislature?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is when you would so to speak get the wind of 
10 
the offices being searched that was the plan?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was the – that is 
correct Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I would then inform 
her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I knew by then it 
would be too late because she cannot tell the politicians I am going 
now. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I have better things to 
do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So what happened is 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 125 of 212 
 
the night before in spite of the fact that I told the guys not to tell them 
who we are going to search, whose residences we going to search the 
following day they assembled the foll owing morning at six o’clock. They 
waited for me to give them the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  An instruction? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The sign that we are 
about to enter the Lekgotla and that is when they started with the 
search.  I then informed the PC th at there was a search underway but 
by then we were both bogged down with the politicians.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So she could not do 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But in spite of the fact 
that we tried to keep it secret somehow and I had instructed the night 
before that they do not tell the searchers who was going to searched 
and in spite of that they told him although the people were selected.  
The following morning it was clear that at least Mr Toshan Panday had 
been alerted that there was going to be a search executed on his 
premises.  In any event Chair all those premises were searched.  When 
20 
they came to Panday’s premises he was nowhere to be found at his 
residence.  They then phoned h im and he said to them no he was in 
Newcastle.  Chair Newcastle is probably about three and a half to four 
hours’ drive from Umhlanga Rocks. When the investigators indicated to 
him that they are going to wait there for him he arrived there about a 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 126 of 212 
 
half an hour later.  So he must have been in the vicinity and that is why 
we suspect he got wind of – well someone must have informed him that 
we were going to do those searches.  But be that as it may Chair a 
number of documents were seized from the respective pr emises, files, 
documents and computer files were confiscated from SAPS, from the 
various departments but one of the concerning matters was that the 
report that Vassan Soobramoney gave me, the – that is now the first 
one which I had given to the PC. She had  asked me for the copy and I 
had also given a copy to Ntanjana.  That same document was found on 
the – at the premises of Colonel Navin Madhoe.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the suspects?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  One of the suspects 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But Chair as I said 
earlier on I was – Soobramoney had given me the  
CHAIRPERSON:  The reports? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He was not going to 
20 
give it to the suspects.  I most certainly did not give it to the suspects.  
The only two people I gave it to was …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ntanjana and the Provincial Commissioner.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And the Provincial 
Commissioner that is correct Chair. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 127 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I then first I 
approached the – Ntanjana and he assured me that he had nothing to 
do with it and even showed the copy that he still had.  I then went to 
the PC and I said to her lo ok this is what transpired and I feel very 
unhappy about it.  And she was very dismissive and she said ag anyone 
could have given it to them and she just like dismissed me as if …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja as if this was nothing serious.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that regard can I quickly take 
you to soft file Exhibit ZE.  And in particular JB1.1 which is – starts at 
page 5.  Is this in fact the report that you were now referring to in your 
evidence? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the report 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I ask you …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  By the way is that the first report the one 
that you got from Soobramoney?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  That is – that is the report a copy of which 
was found at one of the suspect’s premises, residence?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Some important facts that were 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 128 of 212 
 
investigated obtained through investigation is referred at paragraph 3 
to paragraph 7 of that report.  At page 10 of that same bundle.  
Some 
important 
facts 
that 
were 
investigated 
obtained 
through  
investigation is referred at paragraph 3 to paragraph 7 of that report.  
At page 10 of that same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the question?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  There were certain facts that 
were discovered through the investigation which went t o the gravity of 
the investigation itself.  Can I ask you to please from paragraph 2 to 7 
to read that into the record?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he might not need to read but just to say if he 
knows but if he does not know he can read it to simply say some of th e 
new facts that were – that I referred to are the following 1, 2, 3,4 but if 
he does not know then he can – he can read. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Are you aware of these facts 
Sir? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair as I said earlier 
on this second report  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  This – this appears to be the 
first report. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Sorry? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  This is the first report. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that was my understanding from what you said as 
well. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 129 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay so Chair what is 
contained in this – in this report I cannot recall the detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But I was aware of 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you were aware of it. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please then place this 
detail on record by reading in paragraphs 2 to 7?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In paragraph 2 
“Mr Toshan Panday owing to the vast amounts of profit generated from 
his dealings with the SAP managed to purchase a 2009 model Ferrari 
California at a purchase price of R2 million R2.5 million.  He paid a 
deposit of R510 000,00 the purchase of his car was done in the first 
week of May 2010.  A brief perusal of the Nedbank bank statements of 
Gold Coast Trading obtained via Section 205 reve als startling 
activities.  The bank account was opened in 2007 but the request for 
20 
the statements from January 2009 to 17 May was done.  The activity 
between January 2009 to October 2009 shows that Gold Coast Trading 
was actually struggling financially with several cheques returned unpaid 
or deliberately cancelled by the drawer.  However from the first 
payment received from the SAP on 20 November 2009 the financial 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 130 of 212 
 
woes of Gold Coast Trading came to an abrupt end.  It appears so 
profitable that from the 20 November 2009 to the 24 December 2009 
the SAP paid R2.75043 million into the account of Gold Coast Trading.  
The accommodation for during this period from the Nedbank account 
totalled R475 188,00.  On the 5 January 2010 the SAP paid the total in 
one payment of R1 303 460 that must be million into the account of 
Gold Coast Trading CC. On the 1 March of 2010 the SAP paid a total in 
one payment of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you mention that figure 
there?  I think it is 1  894 or is it 18 million? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number 5. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair the number that he sought to 
clarify at paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Appears to be 1 303 460. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the number at paragraph 5 if I 
am reading correctly is 1  894. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. You may continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Thank you Chair.  
Then paragraph 6. 
“On 28 April 2010 the SAP made two payments into 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 131 of 212 
 
the account of Goal Coast Trading for R5 million 
and R536 780 respectively.   On 11  May 2010 the 
SAP made two payments of R1  795 million and 
R108 000 respectively into the account of Gold 
Coast Trading.  The back statements have to be  
analysed in order to trace all the funds received 
and transfers are paid out as there appears to be a 
great deal of activity on the account.  At this stage 
the only income into the account of Gold Coast 
Trading CC has been received from SAPS.  All other 
10 
accounts of Gold Coast Trading the personal 
accounts of Toshan Panday and his spouse have to 
be obtained and further analysed.”  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I am not sure if it is, if it was 
stated correctly but just to err on the side of caution the num ber at 
paragraph 7, the first number which is on 11  May SAP made two 
payments R1 795 million and R108 000 respectively into the account of 
Gold Coast Trading. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is how I read it 
Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you concerned about whether we got the – 
whether he got the number correct?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well it is written – the first one or the second 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 132 of 212 
 
one on seven? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The first one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is one million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is R1 795 million. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is how – that is how it looks.  Why is 
there a problem with this?  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your leader saying?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I understand that reference was 
made to 1 795 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the witness? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay well I think he does say now that whatever 
he may have said the amount is R1  795 million.  Is that correct sir?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBR:  If I can then take you to paragraph 47 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 133 of 212 
 
which is on page 14 of your statement.  Apologies, your affidavit.  
During the investigation were any monies paid to Mr  Toshan Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
the 
investigators indicated to me that the total sum that appears to have 
been fraudulently procured/acquired was R60 million of which R45 
million had already been  paid out to the company of Toshan  Panday 
and there was R50 million which was about to be paid out to him.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then take you to page 15 
paragraph 48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I, I know that you did say that you would be jumping 
10 
around in the statement. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is a little frustrating because one is not able to 
follow exactly what the story is.  I do not know whether it is because I 
do not have something that says these are the events that  we are going 
to be following because if there is a statement you just look – one 
looks there.  I am not sure whether you would be able to help me or not 
but the jumping around seems to be making it difficult to follow the 
story. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The approach of jumping around 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Was on the direction of. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 134 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Well. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Farida, but having said that C hair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe you might just – I do not know if it 
would help just to say these are the events that we will follow then from 
this event we go to this and we go to that.  That might help if I, if I 
know, but you might not have that ready.  So that might make it 
difficult.  Do the best that you can?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases.  Chair if I may the 
timeline that was prepared which has been EXHIBIT DZ.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact consolidates all of the  events 
in sequential order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Relevant to the affidavit that has 
been given and the supplementary affidavits that have been given.  
CHAIRPERSON:  This? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if I could point you in the 
direction with your leave to the third block on the far right hand side.  It 
20 
talks to during the investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be more convenient if we gave these blocks 
numbers?  Then you can say. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You go to block to number so and so then we all 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 135 of 212 
 
know. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody will need – I think you need to explain 
what you are doing to the witness but I gue ss we will mark one with the 
first one that says timeline Panday investigation.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we go on that line to the left.  Major 
General Booysen maybe you – I am sure you will be able to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To follow because we might use. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number so and so later on. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair maybe I can 
explain what happened here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When I drafted the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  A lot of it comes from 
recollection and my memory. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in sourcing the 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I spent quite a 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 136 of 212 
 
period of time preparing these statements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and it is quite comprehensive.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And while you are 
doing the statement there are a number of issues that happens 
simultaneously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Crop up. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So when I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Consulted with the 
advocate. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She suggested that 
we put up this timeline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which is our display. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So in the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The sequence are not 
20 
exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The way it should be. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
According 
to 
the 
dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 137 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Whereas the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  This document here 
gives the exact sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In terms of timelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think probably this will help.  It is just that I did 
not understand then tha t it would – it would form the guide of what we 
start with.  So- but I am just marking them - the blocks one, two, three 
so that you can say we are now at block whatever.  Then I know which 
10 
one it is. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
So 
to 
just 
ensure 
my 
block 
numbering is exactly the same it would be six blocks on top.  Is that 
correct Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be one, two – one up to six and then the 
second line starts from seven to 12.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they continue. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would that be in reverse?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have ended up on block 30. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  3-0? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 138 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct?  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now we can proceed at least.  I will – I should 
be able to – yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you so much Chair.  So now 
you are on block 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In relation to the R50 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that because we have covered all the other blocks 
before that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct.  In relation to the R50 
million payment that had not been made at that time.  Do you have any 
comments in relation to the payment of those monies?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  What 
happened is my secretary told me that she had received a call from 
20 
according to her the brother of the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma 
who wanted to meet with me.  So I said to her in connection with m e 
and she did not know in connection with what.  So I said to her where, 
where does – where do they want to meet me and she said know she 
will find out from them but it sounded like they wanted to meet me away 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 139 of 212 
 
from the office or he wanted to meet me away from the office.  So I said 
to my secretary look if I am going to have a meeting with anyone it is 
going to happen in my office.  Subsequent to that she told me that 
there had been another call but she then took ill and she was admitted 
to hospital and I think she was off six for probably about a month or so 
and no sooner had she returned she received another call from which 
she said was the brother of the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma.  
So I said to her Elaine look if they want to see me they can make an 
appointment and it has got come through the office to make it 
legitimate which she did.  I do understand that she did record that in 
10 
her diary as well.  I think it was roundabout the beginning of June then.  
CHAIRPERSON:  2010? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  2010 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She set down the 
meeting for I think it was the first week in June and then the gentleman 
arrived at my office.  Another friend of mine was present at the office at 
the time.  He just happened to drop by this friend of mine and then a 
gentleman came in and introduced himself as Edward  Zuma who I then 
realised was not the brother of the then State President.  It was 
20 
actually the son of the then State President, Edward  Zuma.  Now after 
we had exchanged greetings and incidentally Edward knew the friend of 
mine who happened to drop by in my office and they joked about a few 
things and so eventually we got down to business and we started 
talking and he started talking about the R50 mil lion which I had frozen 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 140 of 212 
 
and then he asked me if it is possible for me to unfreeze the money.  
So I said to him but what is your interest in this money.  He said to me 
no he is a silent partner with Toshan Panday and he is not getting his 
dividends because I had frozen the money.  So I said to him but did you 
invest into the business of Toshan  Panday and he said yes.  I said how 
much did you invest.  He said no he had invested R900  000.  So I said 
to him look let me give you some advice and go and approach 
Mr Toshan Panday and tell him you want your R900  000 back and take 
your money and walk away and never look back again and we laughed 
and he said no that is what he was going to do and I made it clear to 
10 
him I cannot unfreeze the money because I will make my self complicit 
in the commission of a crime and that will be corruption in itself.  
Unless it is – there is legitimate documents to release.  I cannot do that 
and we spoke awhile about generalities and after that he left.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
As 
the 
conversation 
between 
you 
and 
Mr Edward Zuma was taking place your friend was there present?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He was present Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Has there ever been any issues since 
that visit by Mr Edward Zuma about him attending your office on that 
20 
particular day? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair a couple of 
months later there was a traditional or cultural/traditional event at 
Nkandla and this very friend of mine who happened to be in the office 
he was invited to the cultural event.  I got a phone call – well from the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 141 of 212 
 
event but I did not know it was from the event and it was this friend of 
mine and he said to me hold on someone wants to speak to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was it from? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You got a call from somebody.  Who was that?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  From the same friend 
of mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who was in my office 
10 
on the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When Edward Zuma 
visited me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it was a couple of 
weeks later it could have been a month or two later.  I received this 
call.  He said to me I here at Nkandla where I am attending this cultural 
event.  So he said hold on someone wants to speak to you.  So he 
handed the phone to someone else and it was Edward  Zuma and he 
20 
said hello Booysen and we laughed and joked and I said I hop e you 
heeded my advice and he laughed and he said no, no I heeded your 
advice.  So we joked and laughed about it but it became clear 
afterwards he never heeded my advice and then we said goodbye to 
each other. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 142 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it appears that the call was just about him wanting 
to greet you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know who 
initiated the call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes], ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  If it was my friend or 
whether it was him Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but ultimately the discussion was nothing more?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About – nothing more than just greeting?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Has Mr Edward Zuma ever denied 
having visited you on that day?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair what happened 
is at some stage this thing leaked into the media – the main.  So 
initially he admitted that he had been there and denied the 
conversation.  Then later on he denied emphatically that he had been 
to my office.  So I do not know which one of the two but the last time 
that I heard him going public he denies having been to my office.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 88 of 
your main affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe before we proceed.  Just to go back to the 
R50 million.  Before Mr  Edward Zuma’s visit to your office there was – 
you said there was an amount of about R50 million which you had 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 143 of 212 
 
discovered was about to be paid out by SAPS?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had to be paid out to Mr  Panday’s company? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you had given instructions that that should 
not happen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right.  I wrote 
to our Financial Department Chair and I told them not to release the 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because it is subject 
to a corruption investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I indicated that if 
the money should be paid out that that could be another form of 
corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can take you to page 88 if you 
are there? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which page? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 88 of your main affidavit.  It is 
Annexure JWB4.  Is it correct that this is an affidavit that the 
Commission’s investigators obtained?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please identify the document. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 144 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it is a statement 
by Elaine Regina Latchanah who at the time was my secretary.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if you could read from this 
paragraph 3 second sentence which starts with:  
“According to…” 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  This is. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will appreciate that. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
this 
is 
the 
statement from Elaine Latchanah. 
“According 
to 
my 
recollection 
a 
person 
who 
10 
identified himself as Mr  Edward Zuma requested an 
appointment with Major General Booysen.  Mr Zuma 
called several times to secure an appointment.  A 
date which I do not recall was agreed upon after 
consulting 
with 
Major 
General  Booysen.  
Mr Edward Zuma did not inform me as to what the 
meeting was about.  Mr  Edward Zuma did arrive on 
the 
day 
agreed 
upon 
and 
me 
with 
Major 
General Booysen in General Booysen’s office.  I do 
not recall how long the meeting was and after the 
20 
meeting Mr Zuma left.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now this is in fact an affidavit that 
was deposed to on 23 November 2018.  Is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just for the record Elaine is spelt E -
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 145 of 212 
 
L-A-I-N-E.  The second name which is Regina is spelt R -E-G-I-N-A and 
the surname which is spelt L-A-T-C-H-A-N-A-H.  There was – okay.  
There is one particular event which is not included in this particular 
timeline and to that extent I would like to take you to  EXHIBIT ZC and 
in 
particular 
page 
3 
of 
this 
bundle. 
 
Paragraphs 
7 
to 
10 
documents/events that took place after Mr  Edward Zuma attended your 
office.  Can you please inform the Chair of such events?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair what happened 
is this friend of mine who I had mentioned earlier I request him to seek 
an audience with the then State President to enlighten him to what his 
10 
son was up to.  So he arranged this meeting and I travelled with him to 
Nkandla.  I had two meetings.  So I will describe the first meeting.  So 
the first meeting we arrived there at Nkandla.  I was asked to wait 
outside and my friend obviously being privy to what Edward was up to 
he went in and he spoke to the then State President Mr  Zuma.  A while 
later he came out and I greeted the President and I did not have any 
discussions with him.  So we got into my friend’s car and we left - 
departed for home.  So I said to my friend what happened.  He said not 
the President does not want to get involved.  So I left it at tha t.  Much 
later I again said to my friend I want to have another meeting with the 
20 
President.  He arranged a meeting again and if I recall correctly I think 
it was a Sunday.  We left very early in the morning.  So we arrived at 
Nkandla and this time around I entered the actual house where we 
found the then State President Mr  Zuma.  We exchanged greetings but 
there were no discussions about any formal issues.  He and my friend 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 146 of 212 
 
then excused themselves.  They went into an adjacent room and I got 
up but I walked outside and had a look at the area there.  About 15 
minutes later they came back.  They called me back into the lounge.  In 
the lounge we sat and the Edward  Zuma matter was not discussed at all 
by myself.  So we sat around and once again we spoke about the  
politics of the day and a few other issues and I think we still – I think I 
still posed with a photograph with the, with the then State President 
and we left.  When we got into my friend’s car he said to me look he 
had spoken to the President about it – about his son’s toys and we 
should go and speak to Khulubuse. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was that, Khulubuse?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The nephew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the nephew? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your understanding, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
I 
have 
met 
Khulubuse before that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On social occasions. I 
have met him once or twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I said to my friend 
okay but where is Khulubuse.  He says no he is in one of the places 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 147 of 212 
 
here in Nkandla.  So we drove there and it was like a big rondave l and 
we knocked on the door and he was busy also with a cultural story 
where he had to seclude himself from, from society.  He was laying on 
a mattress on the bed and we walked inside.  We greeted him and my 
friend explained to him what the President had said and then Khulubuse 
said look he will speak to Edward to stop his nonsense.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But the reason why 
suspects the President did not want to engage Edward himself is 
10 
number one they were not on good terms at that point in time.  For two 
reasons the one being that Edward was drinking too much.  I assume 
drinking too much alcohol and the second reason being that Edward 
had bought a house in the Durban North area and he had not invi ted his 
father to the cultural opening of the residence and then he said no he 
will go and speak to Edward to stop his nonsense, but that is where it 
ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What informed your insistence to 
seek an audience with former President Jacob Zuma? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I think it was 
important.  Here you have the son of a State President getting involved 
with – with serious corruption issues within the police and I felt it 
incumbent upon myself rightly or wrongly so to alert the State President 
what his son was busy with. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 148 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did your friend who accompanied you know what 
the purpose of the visit was?  Let us talk about the first visit.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He did both – on both 
occasions he did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and you had asked him to facilitate the 
meeting? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you left for Nkandla your understanding 
was that the meeting had been facilita ted and that the former President 
was expecting you or would be expecting you to arrive?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but when you arrived at his residence – in 
Nkandla – you said you never entered the room  or you did enter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The first time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first time you did enter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No the first time I did 
not enter.  I waited outside Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You remained in the yard or?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In the yard Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the yard and your friend entered a certain room?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He entered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he emerged later on?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And made a certain report to you about what his 
discussion inside the room was?  How it went?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 149 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you left without meeting the former President 
yourself? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the report that you got from your friend was 
that the former President did not want to get involved?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is the case 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then sometime later you – there was another 
– you made another trip to Nkandla another visit?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that one had been facilitated by your friend again 
as well? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
same 
friend 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same, yes.  On that occasion you did enter the room.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  [Indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at some stage in the room were yourself, your 
friend and the former President but for a set period of time the former 
President and your friend move into another adjacent room?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were left in the other room?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they came back later on and you talked 
about other things but not about the purpose of your meeting?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 150 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is an accurate 
description Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and later on your friend told you that the former 
President did not want to be involved and said maybe you people could 
speak to Khulubuse? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the report you got?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you went to see Khulubuse?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Khulubuse’s attitude towards that he would talk 
to Mr Edward Zuma but from what you said it is like he was 
disapproving of something about Khulubuse.  Is that right?  I thought 
you said something like nonsense.  I thought you said something that 
he must stop his nonsense or whatever?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was that coming from Khulubuse?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
it 
was 
a 
discussion between us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I might have used it 
that he must stop his nonsense . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he agreed to that. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 151 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but now you had gone to – you had wanted to 
see the former President because you believed that he should know 
about this – the involvement of Mr Edward Zuma? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume with Mr Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you wanted to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To alert him to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you ended up alerting Khulubuse and he said he 
would talk to Edward Zuma? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your understanding that he was going to talk to 
him with – with the idea that he must stop something or stop being 
involved with somebody or what was your understanding of what the 
purpose was going to be of talking to him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  You see Chair what 
happened is in that period there was a lot of speculation in the media.  
He had been to my office no he had not been.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Then 
he 
started 
making public statements and I wanted him to back off.  Th at was now 
Edward and stop his nonsense – if any- if he still had any connection 
with Toshan Panday. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 152 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So my understanding 
with Khulubuse was that he will tell Edward.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Leave this nonsense 
alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
was 
my 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Did anything result from your visits 
to Nkandla? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If you can then move on did Mr 
Toshan Panday do anything to try to derail the continuing investigation, 
and we are now on block 20?  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry before you get an answer to that, I think 
you have got the spelling for Khulubuse Zuma incorrectly there, there is 
no “a” instead of the “a” there, there should be “u” and the “h” before 
the “e” at the end should not be there.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes thank you so much Chair 
apologies for that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSHCHKA SEPTEMBER :   At paragraph 20 of our timeline my 
question to you is, did Mr Toshan Panday do anything to try to derail 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 153 of 212 
 
the continuing investigation against him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   He did Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please provide details in relation to 
it...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: It’s quite leading when you ask him that in that way 
but it’s okay, what did Panday do in regard to these investigations?   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I was busy 
attending a seminar in Kempton Park on domestic violence when I 
received a call from one of the warrant officers at the Cato Manor Unit, 
Warrant Officer Paul Mostert.  Mostert informed me that he had 
10 
received a call from a person by the name of Tosha n Panday who 
wanted to meet up with him and he had told Toshan Panday he was a 
bit busy, he says an hour or so later he received another call from this 
person, introducing himself as Toshan Panday who said to him, no he’s 
close to their office, Mostert’s o ffice and that he should meet him at the 
garage which was just around the corner, which he then did.  He then 
arrived there where he met the gentleman, Toshan Panday.  Toshan 
Panday then said to him, look there’s been a search on our premises 
and the police confiscated some files and he referred to one specific 
file being the most important file but he knew exactly how many files 
20 
had been confiscated and he said to him, these files are being kept in 
an office in Field Street and then he said to Mostert, I w ould like you to 
steal those files, failing which you have to set the building alight and if 
you do that you can name your price.  So Mostert said to me, he then 
told Panday no he couldn’t get involved in something like this, so I still 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 154 of 212 
 
said to – we call him Mossie, I said Mossie you should have actually 
engaged him and we could have gotten Section 252(a) authority, by that 
I mean authority from the Director of Public Prosecutions to proceed 
with an ostensible unlawful activity. I said to him, look why don’ t you 
phone him back and say to him, you thought about it, you’ve got a price 
and then let’s see if we cannot organise a Section 252 operation.   
 
I then immediately phoned the DPP’s office, what I normally do 
is, the Captain, Captain Hennie Pelser at my o ffice who co-ordinates all 
the Section 252(a) operations in the province, so I phoned him and I 
said, look you should immediately get authority, 252 authority from the 
10 
DPP, I’m flying to Durban from Johannesburg and they should get all 
the paperwork done.  I then also phoned Colonel Karl van der Vyfer 
from Crime Intelligence and I said to him, I’m flying back, we’ve got 
Section 252 authority, that they should rig up one of the vehicles, by 
that I mean, they should wire tap it so that we can record the 
conversations, which they did and the following day Mostert phoned 
Panday back to tell him, look here, he re -thought his position and he’d 
like to meet him – they did meet again but I think Panday must have 
gotten suspicious, he wouldn’t get into the vehicle an d the way he 
spoke to Mostert then, according to Mostert was that he was almost like 
20 
– he couldn’t even remember that the previous meeting had taken place 
so I suspect he knew we were up to something, so nothing came of that 
Section 252 operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when the person you referred to, did you say 
Moses? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 155 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Mostert we call him 
Mossie Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh Mostert. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: That was a colonel in the SAPS?   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 A 
warrant 
officer 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON: A warrant officer in Gauteng?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No, no in KZN at the 
Cato Manor Unit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so he got a call from Mr Panday at a tim e 
when he was with you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No he was not with you when he got the call?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Ja he was at the 
office in Cato Manor which is just outside Durban and I was here in 
Kempton Park. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh so he just reported to you about this call?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: And when he reported to you, he had already met with 
20 
Mr Panday...(intervention).   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay so you say that after he told you what – 
after his discussion with Mr Panday had gone, you said he should 
actually have handled it differently so that you could possibly do a 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 156 of 212 
 
Section 205 subpoena? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No, no Chair we 
wanted to do a Section 252(a) operation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay and what does that involve?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair normally we get 
Section 252(a) authorisation to engage in a criminal activity,  for 
instance if I can give you an example, if we want to buy drugs from a 
drug dealer we have to apply for a Section 252(a) authorisation from 
the DPP – there’s a designated Advocate from the DPP’s office who will 
then give us that authority and the reaso n for that being, policemen 
10 
would sometimes engage in criminal activities and when they get 
caught they say, no I was busy with an operation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so this is to make sure that if it is legitimate 
there is proof. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: Ja so it legitimises 
which ...(intervention).   
CHAIRPERSON:   That which otherwise is criminal?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That’s right Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay because if you don’t have it then you 
can’t say it was legitimate. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s indeed so 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay so – but – so that was arranged and in order 
for this to work Mr Panday and Mostert were supposed to meet and Mr 
Panday was supposed to get into the car that would have be en wired, I 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 157 of 212 
 
think you said, and then the conversation that they would have had, 
would have been recorded but that recording didn’t take place because 
Mr Panday didn’t want to get into the car?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: That’s indeed so Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and you say that they did engage in a 
conversation outside of the car but Mr Panday – Mr Panday was 
speaking on the basis that he had no recollection of the previous 
discussion. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, alright. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So it’s your evidence that Mr Toshan 
Panday must have suspected something, is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s what I suspect 
what happened and that’s why he would not enga ge with Mostert on 
that particular day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was this a few days after the first encounter that 
the two of them had, had when Mr Panday had made this request to 
Mostert? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No it was the 
following day Chair, I immediately flew back, I excused myself from the 
20 
seminar and I immediately flew back to be here.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So there’s no way that Mr Panday would have 
genuinely forgotten about that conversation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 158 of 212 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
 
General 
Booysen 
did 
...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if that is so clearly he had either got wind of 
something or he had looked at the whole thing and thought that there 
was something that Mostert was up to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair later on in my 
evidence I will – Panday was always very suspicious of certain events 
that took place and I’ll perhaps elaborate on that bit later in my 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thanks. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   General Booysen did you establish 
any reason for how Mr Toshan Panday may have suspected something?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair what happened 
is – and during the investigation we applied for Act 70 interceptions 
and for the benefit of the public Act 70 interceptions is where we, as 
investigators through Crime Intelligence apply to the designated Judge, 
of which there’s one, I think he’s based in Pretoria where we have to 
put in a motivation to legally intercept the communications  of a suspect 
under investigation.  At the time there were investigations – there was 
an application for such interceptions and Panday’s communications 
20 
were intercepted at the time and Crime Intelligence who dealt with 
these interceptions, then informed me , that a certain conversation had 
taken place in which they intercepted a call between a colonel that had 
worked under my command, Colonel W S Mahlangu and I actually 
listened to some of the conversations and I in fact, at a later stage had 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 159 of 212 
 
confronted W S Mahlangu, the colonel with certain discussions that 
took place between him and Toshan Panday.  He obviously knew he 
couldn’t deny it because I mentioned specifics to him and he said to me 
no he had phoned him because they were comrades in the ANC but as 
far as I’m concerned that was nonsense.  So W S was one of the 
colonels that reported to me but he had also worked in the same 
building where the investigators had worked. The significance of that 
Chair is, the exhibits that were seized, I did not even know where they 
were kept.  I only established much later that they were kept at – 
because the colonels that were involved with this investigations some 
10 
of them were ex-Scorpion members so they still had an office in Field 
Street, and that’s where they kept the exhibits.  So I didn’t even know 
that the exhibits were kept there until Mostert had told me the exhibits 
were there.  So we concluded from our investigations that the only 
person that could have told Panday where those exhibits were kept, 
must 
have 
been 
colonel 
W 
S 
Mahlangu. 
There 
were 
other 
communication intercepts between the two as well which related to 
compromising this very investigation.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Did colonel Mahlangu have any 
relationship with Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair yes, when I 
became the head of the Hawks in KZN there was a project, and I cannot 
recall what it was called exactly, where I had to authorise his 
secondment to the National Prosecuting Authority where they were 
going to try and find people that were murdered in the Apartheid 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 160 of 212 
 
dispensation which I authorised. So he spent quite some time working 
with the NPA but it was common cause amongst the investigators that 
he had a close relationship with Advocate Moipone Noko who was the 
DPP or she later became the DPP she was first acting and later then 
became the DPP.  During – well much later in events that would follow, 
at the time that Advocate Mxolisi Nxasana was appointed as the NDPP I 
was informed that W S Mahlangu was clandestinely  trying to find dirt 
on Advocate Nxasana and that information of mine was confirmed in a 
statement which I obtained from a person by the name of Terrence 
Joubert from the National Prosecuting Authority.  If my memory serves 
10 
me correctly, I think that state ment was attached to an affidavit 
deposed to by Advocate Nxasana in a High Court matter in the Western 
Cape, I speak under correction but in that statement Terrence Joubert 
states that W S Mahlangu had approached him to find dirt on Advocate 
Nxasana at the behest of Advocate Jiba. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   In that regard could I take you then 
to page 78 of your affidavit please – main affidavit. Do you recognise 
this document? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please identify the document?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair it’s an affidavit 
by Terrence John Joubert and it was signed – it appears to be his 
signature, I don’t know him personally, it was signed in Durban on the 
25 t h November 2013. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For the benefit of the record, can I 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 161 of 212 
 
ask you to read paragraph 3 and 5 into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Paragraph 3, “on the 
18 t h of September 2013 I was on duty and was supposed to fetch 
Advocate Jiba from the Ushaka International Airport, after making the 
arrangements I got a call from Advocate Jiba’s secretary to say that 
she would be fetched by colonel Mhlangu on instructions from the DPP 
KZN. Colonel Mhlangu is currently seconded to the NPA’s Missing 
Persons Unit that is headed by Debra Quinn in the Province and by 
Shaun Abrahams at VGM.  Their job is to assist members of the NPA to 
obtain 
information 
by 
interviewing 
witnesses 
to 
conclude 
the 
10 
investigations.  Shortly after the meeting between Advocate Jiba an d 
Colonel Mahlangu he, Colonel Mahlangu came to me in my office and 
told me that the new guy, referring to the new NDPP, Mr Nxasana does 
not like Advocate Jiba and Advocate Mogwebe.  His aware that I do 
have a great relationship with Advocate Mogwebe and h e was playing 
on my emotions. I asked why he thought so and he said that he was 
sent by Jiba as she’s convinced that this guy is not the right person for 
the job and that we should try and find something on him as they did 
against Mr Gumede.  Mr Gumede was  the first person that we had 
heard about who would have been appointed the NDPP, the DPP had 
20 
then insisted that Advocate Makosi (prosecutor) make a statement 
against Mr Gumede concerning the matter in which he, Mr Gumede, had 
ill treated her.  This instan t gave us indications as to the kind of people 
we were dealing with and to what lengths these people would go to get 
their way.  Mahlangu was instrumental in immobilising people to gang 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 162 of 212 
 
up against Mr Gumede”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the last paragraph being 
paragraph 5 please. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   “I told him that this 
would be playing with fire as we all – are all small fries, when 
elephants fight the grass suffers was my comment to his suggestion.  
Mahlangu ensured me that their efforts would not be in vain as Jiba had 
said if this man (Mr Nxasana) is removed then she would be appointed 
again.  The plan was not whether Mr Nxasana is guilty but the mere 
fact that they wanted to embarrass him and insist that he be removed”.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you and just for the 
avoidance of doubt, this is the affidavit of Terrence John Joubert?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you, moving on to block 21 of 
our timeline and if I may perhaps start off, my understanding is that 
Section 252(a) processes are referred to a “sting operations” is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay was there – or rather what 
happened on the 24 t h of August 2011? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Chair 
I 
was 
approached by one of my warrant officers at the time, warrant officer – 
well he was a sergeant then he’s a warrant officer now, Dina Govender 
and he indicated to me that Colonel Navin Madhoe, the guy that we’re 
investigating seeked an audience with me, he wanted to see me.  So I 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 163 of 212 
 
said to him, I don’t have a problem with him, he can come and see 
me...(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if I can interrupt you, Colonel 
Madhoe is the person who was being investigated in the Toshan Panday 
investigation is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: That’s correct Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
So 
Chair 
the 
following day he again phoned me and he said to me that Colonel 
Madhoe would want to see me, actually he sounded a bit agitated 
10 
because he said that Madhoe had phoned him and accused him of not –
for not wanting to facilitate a meeting between the two of us, so he said 
to me, can I meet Colonel Madhoe, I said no I’m fine I can meet him.  
So I asked him, where would they like to meet and he said to me no at 
Jaipur Palace which is halfway between Durban and Durban North.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that a restaurant? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   A restaurant, that’s 
right Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So I said to him no 
20 
let’s rather meet at the Elangeni Hotel which is pretty close – walking 
distance from my office and we agreed.  So I immediately got in my car 
and it took me about two minutes to get to the Elangeni Hotel and on 
my arrival there they hadn’t arrived yet.  So I went upstairs, one floor 
up where I could see down into the reception area of the hotel.  I 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 164 of 212 
 
waited a while and I didn’t see them coming so I phoned Govender back 
– Dina Govender back and I said to him are you guys still coming but 
as I was speaking to him he said, no we’ve just arrived and I saw them 
coming, him and Colonel Madhoe.  Mad hoe was dressed in a leather 
jacket and he had a laptop bag in his hand.  So they came up to – up 
the staircase and exchanged...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   And just remind me again, I think I may have missed 
the name, who is the person that was coming t o you together with 
Madhoe? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was Warrant Officer 
10 
Dina Govender, he also worked under my command at the time but he 
had nothing to do with them, I think he was friends with Madhoe.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair so once we had 
sat down there was a bench and the two of them sat across from me 
and we spoke for a while and then Madhoe said to me he wanted to 
speak to me on my own, now I don’t know...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   In private. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   In private so I don’t 
know if it was pre-arranged between Madhoe and Govender that 
20 
Govender would then excuse himself but when he said that Govender 
just got up and he walked away out of earshot distance from where we 
were.  Madhoe then took out his laptop and opened his laptop in front 
of me, started setting it up and he switched it on and he turned the 
laptop and – now if you look at files, those little red squares there then 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 165 of 212 
 
he would prompt one of those little squares and up came a picture of a 
person that’s obviously dead and then he’ll press another one, another 
person dead but it was obvious to me that all those photographs came 
from police files they were people...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that the pictures that he was showing 
were pictures of dead people?    
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay so he opened this laptop before he could 
say anything after the other person had left the two of you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s right Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So he would go to a 
couple of photographs like that but then it didn’t make sense to me 
because all those photographs were photographs that clearly ca me 
from police files, from police dockets because you could see the police 
cordoned tape was there and the cones were there and the circles and 
the spray where they marked exhibits.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he opening the laptop in such a way that you 
should see the pictures or you just happened to see the pictures, they 
were not meant for you to see?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No he showed me the 
pictures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh he was showing you the pictures.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: He showed me the 
pictures.   
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 166 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Then I said to him 
but these are normal police photos, what’s this all about, then he said 
to me, no, no but he can get more pictures, I said, well get more 
pictures and then he said to me – he started by saying there’s a lot of 
stress at home, obviously referring to the ongoing investigation and 
then he said to me is it possible for me to assist them in the 
investigation.  So I said to him, how do you mean assist you in the 
investigation – I was taken aback because, I mean, in my position for a 
colonel to approach me to – and he’s a suspect and the subject of the 
10 
investigation to approach me to assist them in the investigation was 
unheard of.  So I said to him and how can I help you in the 
investigation.  He then said to me that I’m in – myself, I’m in 
possession of a report by the investigators, Chair so what happens in 
the police...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was saying that you are in a possession of a 
certain police investigation report? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if I can just 
20 
explain, normally in the police it’s a police habit, especially if you’re in 
a management position, when you get a document on your table we 
normally take the date stamp, stamp it and initial it, that’s an indication 
in the future when you received it, when it landed on your table.  So he 
said to me I’ve got this report – a progress report and he ac tually 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 167 of 212 
 
named the report that was the same one that Vassan Soobramoney had 
given me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first or the second?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: The first one Chair, so 
he said to me that document hasn’t got that stamp and that signature of 
mine on.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: And he said to me – 
and the report itself is not dated, he said if I would take that report of 
mine and anti-date it to a date before the application for the Section 
10 
205 subpoenas went in, that would mean that the information in that 
report was acquired before the Section 205 subpoenas were authorised 
and at the same time they had this – that was more or less at the same 
time that they had the High Court application for the 205’s to be set 
aside. 
CHAIRPERSON: That’s now him and who, Mr Panday?   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Listen...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON: You say that is when they had an application to set 
aside the 205’s? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so I’m asking who they is?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Chair 
I 
cannot 
remember who deposed to...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he was one of them? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Ja he was one of 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 168 of 212 
 
them, I cannot remember who deposed to the founding affidavit and 
who made a supplementary I cannot recall that but be that as it may 
there was this application to have the 205’s set aside...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Panday was one of the people who were 
behind the application or you don’t know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair as I said I 
cannot recall who deposed to the founding affidavit and who made a 
supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair so the idea 
10 
was for me to anti-date this which would have invalidated the actual 
205’s and when we had the 205’s that put the investigators in a position 
to acquire the search warrants and the seizure of those exhibits, so it 
had the potential, if I’d done that, it had th e potential to compromise 
the entire investigation.    
CHAIRPERSON:   But was he not asking you to put a date on the report 
that would have been prior to the 205’s.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s what he did 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how would that invalidate the 205’s?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair the 
information on the report itself was information about that you could 
only have acquired by means of a 205 because it was…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOY SEN:  It was information 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 169 of 212 
 
pertaining to the bank statements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay okay okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So if they gave me a 
progress report with their bank details and I received it before the date 
of the application for the 205’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That means they 
already had the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then they applied 
10 
for the 205’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSE L BOOYSEN:  So I said to him I do 
not know how far this investigation had gone but what I will do I will 
speak to the investigator officer.  And that was the agreement and then 
we left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was the point about these pictures of dead 
people that he was showing you?  Was he trying to intimidate you or 
threaten you, what was the point?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I think it was a 
20 
subtle means of trying to intimidate me.  He comes from supply chain 
management so I do not know.  I have seen plenty dead bodies I do not 
know how many he has seen being from supply chain management but I 
– like I say the photographs that I saw were all people that had been 
either shot by police or that were normal murder scenes.  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 170 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so in the end the request he was making to you 
was that you assist him and whoever by putting a date on the report 
that on the second – on the first report that you got from Soobramoney 
put a date that would have been prior to the Section 205’s and if you 
had agreed to do that that could have led to the invalidation of the 
205’s? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  But you parted on the basis that you said 
you would speak to somebody – to the investigators? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I told him I will speak 
10 
to the investigating officer Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair when I left that 
meeting… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can just ensure I too 
understand the evidence that you have given.  Is it correct then that it 
was Mr Toshan Panday’s bank details which founded or rather was 
important to the investigation at hand?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I think it was both 
Panday and Madhoe’s bank details t hat was important. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Is it then correct 
that a Section 205 was necessary in order to obtain such bank details?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it then also correct tha t the 
request that was being made to you by Colonel Madhoe to predate the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 171 of 212 
 
report would have had the effect to invalidate those Section 205 
subpoenas? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And would it then be correct to 
say that the invalidation of the Section 205 subpoenas would have 
compromised the entire investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is my view Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes when you talk about invalidation all you mean is 
because there was a court application pending.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have helped the case of those who wanted 
the court to set aside these 205 applications that is the point you are 
making? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Ja that is one point 
Chair and another point is in terms of the doctrine of the fruit of the 
poisonous tree.  Once a 205’s failed the search warrants would have 
failed and the seizure of those exhibits would have been – we would 
have had to return thos e exhibits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which were vital to 
20 
our investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  What then 
transpired once you had this meeting with Colonel Madhoe?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair when I left the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 172 of 212 
 
meeting and as I said my office was basically two minutes away from 
there I immediately phoned the investigating officer well the – 
Soobramoney and Van Loggenberg and asked them to come to my 
office.  I also phoned Captain Pelser but Captain Pelser sits on the 
same floor that I – which I am sitting.  He is the coordinator for the 
Section 252A authorities.  So I told him meet me in my office I am on 
my way.  So on my arrival at the office Pelser was already  there and 
the investigators joined soon afterwards.  I explained to him exactly 
what had transpired at the Elangeni Hotel.  So I said to Pelser go and 
contact the DPP’s office so long and get us authority for in terms of 
10 
Section 252A of the CPA.  Now Chai r what normally happens with sting 
operations with the drug related matters we normally get verbal 
authority and then invariably I will get a call from the DPP’s office they 
still waiting for the affidavits.  In this particular instance I immediately 
went and sat down and drafted my affidavit as to what had occurred at 
the hotel.  It was sent through to the DPP’s office Advocate Nel who 
then authorised 252 engagement with Madhoe onwards.  I also told…  
CHAIRPERSON:  252 being the operation that you and Moste rt tried 
with Panday and it did not work?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  A very similar one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja a similar kind of operation.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right.  
Because I did not know what would come of those initial di scussions 
about me assisting them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 173 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I also said to the 
investigating officer that he should document everything that had 
transpired at the hotel in the actual docket for later references.  That 
same afternoon the DPP had authorised the Section 252 authorisation – 
it authorised the engagement with Madhoe.  Chair the following day I 
had a meeting at National head office and I first went…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in Pretoria now?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BO OYSEN:  Yes in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am now still in 
10 
Durban.  So the following morning I first went to my office and cleared 
my desk and then to go to the meeting when I received a call and one 
of my other warrant officers from my office picked up the phone – my 
phone – my cell phone and he gave it me and he said to me it is 
Colonel Madhoe.  So I took the phone and Madhoe said to me I must 
come down to the basement of the building where our cars are parked.  
So I went down and when I arrived there he was there in his car.  So I 
got into the car with him and he then said to me did I find my report?  
And I lied to him, I said no I cannot find my report.  The one that they 
wanted me to alter.  So he lent over backwar ds and took an envelope 
20 
from the backseat, a big brown envelope which he handed to me and he 
said to me the report – that report that you are looking for is inside this 
envelope.  The one I now had to put the date stamp on.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you proceed.  Was it strange that 
somebody at his level would call you to come to him downstairs or was 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 174 of 212 
 
there some previous discussion?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It is – no Chair that is 
– it just does not work like that in the police.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Where a Colonel calls 
a General down to the basement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I thought was strange.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you went anyway?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  I played along Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because we had the 
252A’s in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I assume you were still going to contact him 
in order for you to make arrangements where you would meet so that 
you could execute your 2052A?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja Chair the meeting 
happened on the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And early the 
20 
following morning I was preparing for a national meeting so that was 
not forefront in my mind.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I intended engaging 
him when I get – when I got back from Pretoria. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 175 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you came back.  Yes so – but when he called 
you and asked you to come downstairs you were ready t o use your 
operation already or not really?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Well Chair depending 
what emanated from there a lot of things could have happened.  I did 
not know why he had called me down there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you went there. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But be that as it may 
we had a 252 in operation so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It would have covered 
any eventuality that would have flowed from there on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he gave you a brown envelope and said that report 
that he was talking about is inside the envelope?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair then I – we had 
a general discussion I said to him you know things does not always 
20 
come for free or so – words to that effect and then he said no, no …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was saying that now?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Then he said to me, 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 176 of 212 
 
no Panday had – I think he said – ja Panday had two bar available for 
me for my cooperation.  Oh no he did not say that at that stage.  First 
what he said is, he said to me how much do I want?  Now Chair in my 
whole police career no-one has ever asked me what I want or 
something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And it was very 
difficult to say the words.  So I said to him look what I am going to do 
is I am going to send you a text message and then I am going to put a 
figure there and then you can add a couple of noughts to which we 
10 
agreed.  And then I left.  I then phoned the investigating officer and I 
said to him to come to my office immediately and I  gave – because I 
had my report.  I had lied to him about not having had it.  So I said to 
the investigating officer this Van Loggenberg I said to him, Hans take 
this thing send it to forensics see if you can find DNA or fingerprints on 
the envelope or what is inside the envelope which he did.  About a 
week later Van Loggenberg phoned me that the fingerprints found on 
the envelope was not those of – well now the fingerprints found inside 
on the document were not those of Madhoe the Colonel who had given 
it to me.  So I said to him, look where can we get a set of fingerprints 
20 
from Toshan Panday?  And he said to me come to think of it when they 
searched his premises earlier on there were a set of fingerprints lying 
there because he had applied for a firearm licence and they had taken 
that.  So I said to him well send that to the fingerprint department let 
them compare that.  And I think it was about a week after that he 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 177 of 212 
 
phoned me back and he said to me – it was late in the afternoon he 
said to me the report had  come back.  The fingerprints on the document 
– my progress report which was in the envelope the fingerprints 
matched those of Toshan Panday.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you had – you had opened the envelope that 
Colonel Madhoe had given you?  At some stage y ou opened it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not open it?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair I never 
opened it I gave it…  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You gave it to…  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Just like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes as it was? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja I never opened it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay but somebody did open it at some stage?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It was opened at the 
local criminal record centre by the fingerprint experts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  So they actually found the report 
that he was talking about inside or what?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The same report 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same report ja okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The same report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Your discussion with Colonel 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 178 of 212 
 
Madhoe entailed you providing a number can you please give more 
detail in relation to what transpired thereafter?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you send Madhoe the figure that yo u had 
promised to send? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair so what 
happened the followed morning I then left to go home and back my 
bags and fly to Pretoria.  I flew to Pretoria and then the following 
morning I was actually sitting with General Dramat at – in the venue 
where we were having the meeting when I received a text message from 
Colonel Madhoe and he typed like the kids type nowadays with these 
10 
short abbreviations.  Hi General did not know you had gone when you 
back that funny language and he said – and then he ended off the 
conversation with a 2 in brackets.  And then I – by then General Dramat 
was – had been alerted to my engagements with Madhoe so I still went 
and showed him the text message that I had just received.  And we 
actually joked about it because I thought they – they thought I was 
cheap because they were going to give me R20  000,00 for a R60 million 
investigation.  Chair okay after that I went back to Durban after the 
meeting.  I do not know if you want me to proceed after tha t? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you did not respond immediately to the – to the 
20 
message from Madhoe? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I did and all 
those conversations have subsequently been captured.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Between him and 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 179 of 212 
 
myself it forms part of the evidence in the docket.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The actual sms’s, the 
timelines have all been captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am trying to find out 
where I am now. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  You are on page 12 paragraph 
39.  Alternatively we could look to…  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay.  So Chair after 
that I… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Block 23. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Sorry? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I say it is block 23 or that 
particular paragraph but please continue.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair and another 
engagement that I had with Ma dhoe and I must mention now 
simultaneous to my engagement with him we are also running the Act 
70 interceptions.  So Colonel Padiachi from Crime Intelligence is telling 
20 
me exactly how they discussing – how they have…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry I know that you said that the 
interaction between the two of you is captured and is in some docket.  
Do we have that anywhere here or it is somewhere else and we will get 
it some other stage? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 180 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the docket that I 
am talking about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is current? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the – and I am 
going to talk about that later in my evidence because that docket 
became a big issue eventually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That docket as we 
speak is with Advocate Wendy O’Brian from the Specialised Commercial 
Crime Court in Durban because my understanding is that they are now 
10 
preparing after seven years a prosecution in these matters and Chair it 
is vast volumes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay well we – we need to find a way of leaving 
out what we get and what we might not get out of that.  We just need to 
find a way of connecting the story.  You had received a message from 
Colonel Madhoe and at some stage I assume you reverted to him and 
then something happened.  Are you able to say, I did revert to him and 
subsequent to that we have had another engagement or something like 
that?  I just want to see even if we are not going into the contents.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the messages. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair the first 
meeting is at the hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The second meeting is 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 181 of 212 
 
the following morning where he gives me the report in the envelope.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the building? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I then go to Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You get the message. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Subsequent to that we 
had another engagement.  Most of the engagements were initiated by 
him.  And at a follow up engagement when we discussed now…  
CHAIRPERSON:  The engagement is in a meeting form or just talking 
on the phone? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No it is in cars. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It was always in cars 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Clandestine there in 
the basement.  These meetings took place in the basement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There were other 
subsequent meetings that took place at McDonalds but this particular 
one took – also took place in the basement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  After I had returned 
from Pretoria I engaged with him again also in the basement.  He then 
gave me another hard drive in which he said there are more photos on 
the thing.   
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 182 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of dead people? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and I guess this time do you ask him what is the 
point about this or you still do not  ask him? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No, no I was playing 
along with there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In terms of the 252. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you pretend you were scared?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Sorry Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you pretend you were scared by this?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No not really Chair I 
just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair and at one of 
these subsequent engagements he said to me,  no Toshan Panday had 
two bar available for my cooperation in this matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Two bar? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Two bar.  So I know 
what two bar is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what was your understanding of what that …  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So two bar in my mind 
is R2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But I thought he does 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 183 of 212 
 
not know what two bar is because I – I mean no-one gives you R2 
million.  So I thought maybe he is thinking R200  000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So my understanding 
from the beginning was that they were going to give me R200  000,00 to 
sign that document and put a date on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chair it continued I had a number of meetings w ith 
him and the day before we did the actual sting operation one of my 
detectives was shot and killed and I attended the funeral.  He also 
10 
came to the funeral. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around those days? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It was all in the space 
of a week, week and a half Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we are around mid-2010 or where are we now?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The 2010 August 2010 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  August 2010 ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back if I may.  The message that you had 
20 
received from Colonel Madhoe when you were with General Dramat 
where there was a two is that the one that made you think he was 
talking about R20 000,00. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Then I thought it was 
R20,000,00, 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 184 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Only put the 2 there 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But then when he 
subsequently told me 2 bar then I thought no this man does not know 
what 2 bar is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Maybe he is meaning 
R200 000,00. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Just one correction 
this is now in 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 2011 ja okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSE L BOOYSEN:  Chair on the day 
before we did the actual operation which I will refer to as the sting 
operation or two days before that I cannot remember I met him at the 
funeral.  Well he came to the funeral.  And after the funeral he came up 
to me and he said to me I must not forget to write and he gave me the 
date. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To backdate the report?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja but he wanted a 
specific date.  And I took this very pen which I always carry with me 
and I took it out and I said to  him give me a piece of paper.  So he took 
out his wallet and he gave me a piece of paper and he gave me the 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 185 of 212 
 
date which I wrote down on the piece of paper.  So he said okay no that 
is fine.  Okay so now I will not forget.  When I left – when he left turned 
the piece of paper around and it was an ATM slip from his bank 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So on my return back 
to my office I called the investigator and I said to him take this ATM slip 
and we can use it as an exhibi t later on because where would I have 
gotten his ATM slip?  So the investigators took that.  Chair the day 
before the actual sting operation I met him for the last time at 
10 
McDonalds at Gateway in Durban North.  I think we sat in my car and 
then we had a discussion as to where we going do this now?  Where 
they going to give me the money and I am going to give him this 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The backdated report?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage you had no t backdated – you had not 
backdated it 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Not yet Chair, not yet 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So he wanted again 
he said to me I think he said we should go to the Japanese Gardens 
which is right next to Hyper by the Sea where the Jaypore Restaurant 
is.  So I said to him no let us rather go to the casino in the basement of 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 186 of 212 
 
the casino.  And the reason why I did that is because I know the people 
at the casino and I knew that they would be coope rative for us to use 
their CCTV footage.  And he agreed to that.  Then I said to him okay 
now how are we going to do this?  Now first of all he indicated to me 
that during one these discussions they could put the money in my kids 
account or put it in my fr iends account and I knew if we do a sting 
operation and money gets transferred to my account there is going to 
be no – no direct link.  So I still said to him no I wanted cash.  And I 
said to him at one stage I want it in R200,00 notes.  He later came back  
and said to me no they – there is a problem with the R200,00 notes at 
10 
the bank which at the time was indeed so but I established later on that 
there was a different reason why they could not give me R200,00 notes.  
So he said no they could only get R100,0 0 notes and R50,00 notes so I 
said it is fine.  And then the day before we said okay how are we going 
to do this?  I said – he said to me he is going to put it in a duffle bag.  I 
said no, no do not put it in a duffle bag why do you not rather get some 
photocopy boxes from your office put the money inside there.  And that 
is what we agreed to do.  And then I said to him okay what I will do is I 
will give you the document in the morning then you give me the 150 
and… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are now having this conv ersation at the basement 
of… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No, no this is now at 
McDonalds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are still in the car?  
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 187 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In the car Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I said to him give 
me – you give me the 150 I will then give you the document then if you 
are happy with it you can pay me the balance of the 50 in the 
afternoon.  Then he said to me hey I said R2 million what did you 
think?  Then it dawned upon me he is act ually talking about R2 million.  
Then I said no, no that is what I thought.  But I really thought it was 
R200 000,00.  Then it really dawned on me it is actually R2 million.  So 
Chair then we departed.  I left from there I went straight to the casino 
10 
where I spoke to a Mr Christo Van Rooyen who is in charge of 
surveillance there.  I told him look we are busy with an operation they 
must make sure that those cameras are all working and we agreed 
everything.  Chair the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  This now the arrangement b etween the two of you that 
is yourself and Colonel Madhoe was that you were going to go to the 
casino the following day?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So after I had 
20 
arranged with Mr Van Rooyen at the casino I went home.  During that 
week the Provincial Commissioner was away in Pretoria and I was the – 
being the Deputy she had appointed me as the acting Provincial 
Commissioner so I was wearing two hats in the – during that week.  I 
have to add Chair every single meeting that I had with Madhoe was 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 188 of 212 
 
done by prior arrangement with the DPP’s office.  They were informed 
except the one time when he called me down to the basement there was 
not time to – but I immediately informed them afterwards.  But every 
other engagement before I would go I would inform Pelser, Captain 
Pelser he would inform the DPP’s office they would record it 
accordingly and I would inform the investigating officer in the main 
corruption docket.  After I had engaged with Madhoe I would once again 
phone Pelser back and gave him feedback verbally on the phone and I 
would phone the investigating officer and tell him to diarise in his diary 
exactly what had happened on that day.  On the day that the sting 
10 
operation was set to be done that – I think that was the one and only 
time that I engaged him, the initiative came from me.  So I phoned him 
in the morning I said to him look I am ready for this now, meet me in 
the basement.  So I met him in the basement of Provin cial 
headquarters, police headquarters.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And you cannot at this stage remember the date or 
you have got the date somewhere?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I could take you to paragraph 
40. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Ja it is on the 8 
20 
September Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  8 September 2010? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  2011 now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2011 ja okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair now I – I had 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 189 of 212 
 
to play with time because I had to get people in position and  
unfortunately – well why I had to get people in position we were ready 
to go to the casino.  He then tells me all of a sudden no, no, no he 
does not want to go to the casino because there might be cameras.  So 
it put – I was off guard now because now I had to change my plans very 
quickly.  So he once again suggested the Japanese – I said – the 
Japanese Gardens.  I said hey why do we not just do it here in the 
basement?  And he said to me are you okay with that?  I said no I am 
okay with that.  So I said to  him look I am the acting Provincial 
Commissioner I am very busy so let me go up and just sort out the 
10 
correspondence and the meeting and then I will phone you when I am 
ready.  But the idea was for me now to get all the detectives in place.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja redeploy the people. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair.  
So in the building where I work if you stand across the road you can 
look up into the basement area.  It is not closed off.  So I said to him I 
am going to reverse my car in so that would make it easier for whoever 
is going to observe us from the bottom to see what was happening.  So 
I said I am going to reverse my car in and then you reverse in next to 
me and then we can do the business in the basement.  And he agreed.  
20 
I went upstairs at that stage Colonel Len Sheriff he dealt with that 
particular operation.  I phoned him I said to him Len you guys need to 
get in place we are not going to the casino any longer this is going to 
happen in – at Provincial headquarters in the – in the basement.  So 
they hurriedly had to change their plans.  They got people into position 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 190 of 212 
 
on the fire escape, at the exit to the building and they also had people 
across the road to observe now how the transaction takes place and 
then it was roundabout 12 o’ clock when the Sheriff phoned me and he 
said to me they are in place now.  So I phoned Madhoe and I said to 
him okay I am ready to come down and meet you and I thought he – I 
thought he was still some distance away and he said to me no, no, no.  
I am here already.  So I thought I hope he did not see all the activity 
around the building but fortunately it is a very business/business area.  
So he did not pick up the activity of the people getting into position.  
So Chair just before I left the office  my brother who is a private 
10 
detective walked in and he said to me – I said Marius I cannot talk now. 
I am busy with a sting operation and he is one of these gadget guys 
and he said to me have you got a camera and I said no.  He said do 
you want one.  I said yes and he gave me a key holder with a camera in 
and there was no time to do a crash course in how the camera worked.  
I just said switch it on and leave it on.  So I took this thing and I 
walked obviously now with the document which I had endorsed whic h I 
put in an envelope.  Got into the lift and one of the Generals was in the 
lift with me.  One of the ladies not the PC and she was talking to me on 
the way down and my mind was somewhere else and we both exited on 
20 
the same floor and we walked out but as  I walked out I noticed my car 
is standing there and his car  is not next to mine.  So as I got into the 
basement I looked to my left and his car was standing there and he was 
halfway out of the car.  So he alighted from the vehicle and the General 
walked to her right and he said to me it is safe here and I knew if we 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 191 of 212 
 
were going to do it there the people across the road would not see us 
because I was going to touch my head as a single for them to pounce.  
So I just carried on walking towards my car and I sa id no, no come and 
park your car next to mine and I had this camera on the whole time and 
so he reversed in next to my car and he waited for this other General to 
disappear from our sight.  He then got out of the car, walked to the 
boot of his car, opened the boot of his car.  I opened the boot to my 
car.  He then took out which appeared to be a brand new suitcase.  So 
he put it in the boot of my car and because the arrangement was that 
he would come with boxes I still asked him - and that is all recoded.  I 
10 
said where did you get this and he said I bought it and the way he 
spoke I could not.  I said what.  He said I bought it.  He bought it.  I 
said okay but now I am scared that they were going to try and 
bamboozle me.  So I said to him he must open the sui tcase I want to 
see the money because I was scared there might be bricks or 
something else in the suit – he had a little lock and he opened it – he 
opened it and it was packed with notes.  So I said to him okay close it, 
closed my boot and I took the envelope and I opened and I slid the 
piece of paper out like that and it is all on camera and I am actually 
holding the camera in his face now and I read the date and the stamp 
20 
there to him and he said to me hundreds as we.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He said/ 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He said hundreds 
meaning 100 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 192 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I handed him the 
document.  He then got into his car and I started walking towards the 
lift now and I was expecting – I never realised that they had placed 
detectives on the fire escape.  I thought they were going to arrest him 
or block him when he emerged from the building with his car.  So I.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Then the indication. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I touched my head 
and then I thought I hope these people and I was actually slapping 
myself of frustration but I carried on walking and then as I am about to 
get in the lift I just heard this shout wow and then I looked to my right 
10 
and the guys had jumped from the fire esca pe.  So they took him out of 
the vehicle.  I carried on walking.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Got into the lift, went 
upstairs.  At that stage I had never done something like this before.  I 
was shaking a little bit.  So I composed myself and I went down again.  
I did not go – by then they had taken him out of his vehicle and taken 
documents out of his vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I called - I think it 
20 
was Sheriff - and there was a beehive of activity around his vehicle and 
I said to him there is the key to my car.  Do all the forensics that is 
necessary in the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I went back to my 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 193 of 212 
 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think they counted 
the money that evening and although the arrangement was that they 
would give me 1.5 million the money actually counted in the – in the 
suitcase was 1.3, just under 1.4 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Rand in cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On that score can I just direct you to 
10 
paragraph 40 of your affidavit which informs of the actual amount you 
may be referring to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  It was 
R1 372 million in cash. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  and just one point for clarity.  You 
mentioned now that there was one 1.5 million that out to have been 
paid but your earlier evidence was two bar which you understood to be 
2 million.  Can you please clarify?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair as I said the 
day before the agreement was that they would give me 1.5 million.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In exchange for the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then when they 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 194 of 212 
 
are happy with the document that same afternoon they would pay me 
the balance of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Half a million Rand.  
The R500 000.  The problem with that scenario was once I had allowed 
them to get away with the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And they did not keep 
their side of the bargain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They could have used 
that document and compromised the  whole investigation.  That is why I 
arranged that we arrest him there and then.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I could not allow him 
to get away with that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course even if he had gone away with the 
document and when – and he was not arrested there and then on the 
20 
spot with you having taken photos with – you had a camera with you.  
You would have been able to show the circumstances under which you 
had backdated that document and his - his picture would have been on 
the camera when he showed you the money in the basement and all of 
that. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 195 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair that is indeed 
what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My main concern was 
and I have dealt with a number of High Court cases.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Keep it as simple as 
possible to have gone to a second transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I knew that there was 
10 
enough evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To arrest him at that 
juncture.  I did not want to take a chance to let him get away with that 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no I understand, ja.  I am just saying it does 
not look like it would have been the whole operation would have been 
defeated but obviously you were better off having him arrested there 
and then? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I could just 
perhaps add here.  Simultaneous to this where the [indistinct] is 
running.  So listening to the intercepts afterwards and we had this done 
scientifically where we plotted exactly where they were at diffe rent 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 196 of 212 
 
times.  So it is clear from that that Toshan  Panday and Navin Madhoe 
had met at the Japanese Gardens.  That is where the money was 
transferred from Panday to Madhoe’s vehicle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Madhoe 
then 
proceeds to my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  About 10 minutes into 
the – into the process of going to my office and I would say about a half 
a kilometre to a kilometre away from my office Panday phones Madhoe 
10 
and he says stop the vehicle.  So Panday stops the vehicle and he says 
okay I have stopped he vehicle.  So he says okay go and open the boot 
and take a cloth and wipe the suitcase.  So that is obviously to wipe off 
his fingerprints if any were on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On the suitcase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now on the same day?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Same day Chair.  So 
what happened Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, before he came to the building, before Madhoe?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair.  
That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so he got this call on his way to the building?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To meet you? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 197 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja, 
okay 
and 
you 
hear 
this 
conversation 
subsequently? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well subsequent when 
we listen to the intersects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He says to Madhoe 
stop the vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Wipe the suitcase. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To wipe any possible 
fingerprints there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of his that could be 
on the vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On the – on the 
suitcase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may.  Two points, my 
attention is being drawn to the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is now quarter past four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I guess that we should at least go up to half 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 198 of 212 
 
past.  Would that be fine with you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us go up to half past I think.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next segment of his evidence 
would likely take longer than 15 minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But if you – if you are happy for us to 
proceed on that basis that is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, let us use the – let us the 15 minutes.  We will 
stop whatever and then we will proceed tomorrow.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  I have also been 
handed a better copy of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the second? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  [Indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The second report? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is JWB1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Registrar. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  With your leave if I may hand it up.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I just want to – oh that is much better.  
So I will just replace this one with the new one.  Thank you.  You may 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 199 of 212 
 
proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  We are now block 24 of 
the timeline.  On the very day that Colonel  Madhoe was arrested on 
8 September 2011 a certain telephonic exchange took place.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You say September.  I see that in 
paragraph 40 he has got 8 August 2011. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct Chair.  That was in fact 
corrected through one of his supplementary affidavits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So it is September?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  It is September. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was actually correc ted in 
paragraph 5.1 of his first supplementary affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  EXHIBIT ZC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I had mentioned that on the very day 
that Colonel Madhoe was arrested a certain telephonic discussion took 
place to which you were made aware of.  Can you please inform the 
Chair about such exchange?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair subsequent to 
the engagement we listened to some of the telephone conversations 
intercepted conversations of Panday.  So obviously he had now sent 
Madhoe with just under R1.4 million to my office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 200 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he is now waiting 
for Madhoe to return with this document that is going to assist them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he does not come 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
he 
makes 
a 
number of frantic calls.  Some to the Provincial Commissioner who does 
not take his call and we suspect she might have  been busy in Pretoria.  
He phones a number of senior police officers [intervenes].  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like he is getting worried now?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He is getting very 
worried.  You can hear he is frantic.  He cannot – he does not know 
where Madhoe is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The money or the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
then 
one 
particular conversation I think it was late in the evening Chair was 
20 
between him and a person by the name of Deebo Mzobe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Deebo Mzobe from my 
understanding is a nephew of the - or a cousin – I am not too sure – of 
the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 201 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
there 
is 
a 
conversation between Panday and Deebo where Deebo  Mzobe – where 
Panday says that I am acting – Booysen now – I am acting like the 
mafia and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I am now standing 
in the way of everything – words to that effect. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could perhaps just take you then 
in line with the conversation that you now speak of to page 82 of your 
10 
main affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  82? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  82. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is page 82 of EXHIBIT  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Z. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ZA? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather than 82 of his affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  His affidavit goes up to 70 something.   Okay, 
20 
thank you.  82. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the document actually starts at 83.  Is that right?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  On 80. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really, at 82 ja. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 202 of 212 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 82 is a transcriber’s 
certificate which appears to be dated 8  September 2011 and it has been 
transcribed by Shweta Typing and Transcription Services.  Is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies.  It in fact appears to 
relate to. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The transcription of an event that 
took place on 8 September 2011. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct that that is in fact 
the same date on which Colonel  Madhoe was arrested? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then ask you to turn to page 
83 which runs until page 86.  Is this in fact th e conversation that you 
were referring to? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
is 
the 
conversation I am referring to Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to then identify - or 
rather the document talks to male one and male two – can I ask you to 
please identify who male one is and who male two is?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair male one in this 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 203 of 212 
 
conversation will be Toshan  Panday and male two will be Deebo Mzobe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance I am going to ask 
you to read this transcript into the record, but in doing so to identify 
what male one says relative to what male two says.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Are you asking him to read t he 
whole transcript? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think that is really – he should read the 
whole transcript.  He had listened to the conversation and he has read 
10 
this.  He should just tell us what the main features of the co nversation 
is and one can read this later. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me ask him.  You listened to the 
conversation.  Did you not?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have read this transcript, have you?  This 
transcript have you had a chance to read it?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What are the main features of the conversation 
20 
between the two people?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
with 
your 
permission I would like to read this because this is the nub.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of where I think my 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 204 of 212 
 
problem started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, alright. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  If the Chair would 
allow me to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine then, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Read it then.  It is, is it four pages?  Okay, 
read. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Thank you Chair.  
Male one - that is now Toshan Panday. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
“Howzat.  
Male two:  [inaudible].  Male one:  But can you talk?  
Male two:  [indistinct].”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  “Male one:  
Okay.  You know I told you our pressure was 
denied.  Male two:  Hm.  Male one:  The PC [?] sent 
a parcel with one of the boys who is a Colonel.  
Male two:  Hm.  Male one:  Of some cash.  Male 
20 
two:  Sorry.  Male one:  2 million cash.  Male two:  
Yes?  Male one:  Because Booysen wanted that.  
Male two:  Sorry.  Male one:  Can you talk?  Male 
two:  Yes, yes.  Yes, I can hear you now.  Male one:  
This is our situation right.  Our guy went to 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 205 of 212 
 
Booysen with the cash of 2 million cash.  Male two:  
Yes.  Male one:  That is what Booysen wanted and 
then Booysen made it into a trap.  Male two:  
[Whistles].  Male one:  They arrested the guy.  Male 
two:  Do no tell me.  Male one:  Honest my brother 
that is why I did not answer your calls today.  I was 
running around to help that brother out.  I got the 
General in Pretoria phoning me because she went 
some stats or out of crime stats or whatever 
[indistinct].  She was busy.  [Indistinct] go and help 
10 
the brother out, but the bottom line is how can 
Booysen do that.  Male two:  How, how, how  come 
on man how.  Male one:  You see if you are playing 
ball you are playing ball.  You know what I am 
saying.  He went against.  You reckon no.  I mean I 
do not know what went into him.  He arranged a 
trap and he sorted it out and the guy he took the 
bag of money.  There is no doubt about the 2 million 
in R100 notes.  Male two:  How man.  I do not 
believe this.  Male one:  That is what happened.  It 
20 
will be in the paper tomorrow morning.  So it is a 
big thing.  Male two:  What means that your name is 
not there?  Male two:  My lady is not there.  She is 
in Johannesburg but this was our boy.  Male two:  
Now I am saying that you name is not there.  Male 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 206 of 212 
 
one:  No, my name is not there.  No it is not there, 
but obviously they know my name is there because 
we arranged that you know what I am saying.  
[Speaking simultaneously the two of them].  They 
suspect we did this but this thing is getting out of 
hand with Booysen.  Booysen thinks he is a mafia 
now you know.  Male two:  [Indistinct].  Male one:  I 
said Booysen thinks he is a mafia now.  Male two:  
Hm.  Male one:  You know for him to behave in this 
manner he thinks he is above everyone else now. 
10 
Maybe even need to clip him a bit.  Male two:  How, 
how, how I do not believe this man.  Male one:  Ja, 
he did that.” 
And I will not use the word Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is being televised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
“That 
whatever White bastard and I told my sister do not 
trust this White bastard but s he said no send it 
20 
through because he is going to play ball.  He will do 
this.  He will do that and whatever.  [Speaking 
simultaneously the two of them] and that is what he 
does.  He wants, he wants. Male two:  But your aunt 
she is not involved?  Male one:  No she and I are 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 207 of 212 
 
not involved.  You see we used someone else to go 
there and sort it out.  You know what I am saying.  
Male two:  Okay.  Male one:  Ja, but we will meet 
and we will have a briefing and we will decide how 
we are going to take care of this guy because he is 
obviously going to stand in the way of everything.  
Male two:  Ja.  No is it fine.  It is fine, but okay.  
No, it is fine.  It is fine.  Male one:  [They speak 
over each other].  I said I must get bail for this boy.  
I cannot tell him I s aid no I do not want what you 
10 
are talking about because I do not know whether it 
is a trap or not a trap, you know.  Male two:  Yes.  
Male one:  But then I phoned him back from the call 
box.  He says no just help him whatever you can 
because he is a good man.  You said the guy that 
got arrested is a Colonel.  He said he is a good 
man.  Just help him wherever you can help him.”  
Chair I think that is perhaps the part that I would like to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Important part okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Just to reiterate, please 
20 
identify again for the record who male one is.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Male one will be 
Toshan Panday and male two will be Deebo  Mzobe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you know what the relationship is 
between Toshan Panday and Mr Deebo Mzobe? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 208 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it emerged from 
the investigations that the investigators were doing that Toshan  Panday 
and Deebo Mzobe are two – are both registered partners to different 
close corporations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So some of the close corporations which were the 
subject of the investigation were – or two of them – were close 
corporations in which both Mr Panday and Mr Mzobe were involved. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Reference in this discussion is made 
10 
to a person who appears to be a woman.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In your understanding who was that 
woman that they were referri ng to? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair the inescapable 
conclusion that I come to is that they were referring to the PC.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The Provincial Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there something you can point out in the 
conversation that. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Oh Chair the mere 
fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you say suggest that it was the [intervenes]?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because I am - sorry 
Chair for interrupting you. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 209 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair was indeed in 
Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  With a meeting with 
crime stats. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he refers to our 
lady being in Pretoria with the crime stats.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The conversation also refers to “the 
guy who was arrested”.  Who was the guy they refer to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That could only have 
been Navin Madhoe Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then mention was also made in 
the conversation on page 85 in particular and I read:  
“Maybe we need to clip him a bit.”  
What does that mean? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
my 
20 
interpretation of that is that I need to be clipped.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know having 
been a member of the Hawks whether they want to clip my wings, but 
they wanted to clip me somehow. 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 210 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Which you understood to mean what?  What did 
you understand them to be meaning when they say you needed to be 
clipped? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair at that juncture 
it could have meant anything, but subsequently it was clear to me wha t 
that clipping meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  So at that juncture you were not sure.  Is 
that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I was not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But subsequently you attached a meaning to it?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the meaning that you attached to it 
subsequently? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair subsequent to 
that events unfolded that led to myself being targeted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ostracised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Eventually arrested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you could link that to this clipping of wings 
20 
that the – that was referred to in the conversation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Definitely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were any subsequent arrests made 
after Colonel Madhoe was arrested? 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 211 of 212 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is indeed so 
Chair.  I think about a week or two later after further evidence h ad been 
gathered by the investigators they managed to apply for a warrant of 
arrest for Toshan Panday.  At the time he happened to be out of the 
country.  He was flagged at movement control and on his return from 
abroad – if I say abroad I think he had gon e to the DRC – and on his 
return at O R Tambo Airport he was arrested at the airport and brought 
to Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was still 2011, second of half of 2011?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do? 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the time he was arrested – that is Mr Panday – 
Colonel Madhoe was out on bail or not yet or you cannot remember?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
I 
cannot 
remember.  I suspect he was still in custody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you recall the charge against 
Mr Toshan Panday for which he was arrested?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think it was for 
20 
corruption Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  We are – we have just gone past half 
past four.  I think we may – we can – we should adjourn now and then 
17 APRIL 2019 – DAY 85 
 
Page 212 of 212 
 
tomorrow Mr Pretorius shall we start at 10 tomorrow as well?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Chair we did discuss it during the 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and we talked about half past nine.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  The choices are 09:30 for two hours.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Or 10 for two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think maybe let us s tart at 10. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  We will adjourn at this stage then and we 
10 
will start at 10 o’ clock tomorrow morning. We adjourn.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 18 APRIL 2019
