PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 17 MAY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Chaskalson, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready this morning? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am – we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And today Mr Makhubo has 
returned to complete his testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Makhubo. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Good morning Counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine you might wish just to 
remind the public where his evidence fits in and where we 
ended last time so that they can follow – the public can 
follow the evidence. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Certainly Chair.  Mr Makhubo is 
the current Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg.  
He testified on the 27 November and he testified primarily 
20 
at that stage on issues relating to entities in which he had 
an interest and the relationship with those entities and the 
Regiments Group of Companies that had contracts with the 
City of Johannesburg. Those contracts were – spanned a 
period when Mr Makhubo was not part of the political 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 4 of 413 
 
leadership of the City of Johannesburg but also running into 
a 
period 
when 
he 
was 
the 
member 
of 
the 
Mayoral 
Committee for Finance. 
 
 
We are going to pick up today and for the most part 
today I am going to dealing with a different set of issues 
those relations – those relating to the links between Mr 
Makhubo and his entities and entities and persons within 
the EOH Group of Companies. 
 
But before we leave… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair before we leave the 
proceedings last November Mr Makhubo last time that you 
testified your legal representatives and indeed yourself had 
expressed 
a 
concern that the documents 
and – the 
documents that were provided to you and they ran into more 
than 1000 pages have been provided to you on short notice. 
 
And I just wanted to give you an opportunity before 
we start today is there anything that you want to revert to in 
relation to the questioning on the 27 t h of November relating 
to documents which possibly you have not had a lengthy 
20 
enough opportunity to peruse? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before he does so let us have the oath or 
affirmation administered then he can respond. 
REGISTRAR:  Please stand.  Please state your full names 
for the record. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 5 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  Moloantoa Geoffrey Makhubo 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth; is so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
10 
me God. 
MR MAKHUBO:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated.  Then 
you can respond to … 
MR MAKHUBO:  Chairperson there is a bit of an echo the 
sound was not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it was the aircon.  Is it still there? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I think the problem may 
have been that I was not switching off my microphone when 
I was not talking. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know if that should create a 
problem.  I think it – it should not because initially we 
thought we should switch them off but very often they are – 
all three on and there is no problem.  At the moment Mr 
Chaskalson’s mic is off but mine is on and yours is on can 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 6 of 413 
 
you hear any echo? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no it is better as he was talking there 
was a bit on an echo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MAKHUBO:  It is not quite audible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh maybe – oh okay alright. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am not sure if it was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe.  Okay let us – that is fine.  
Let us see how it goes – you will switch it off when you are 
not speaking and see how it goes.  Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Makhubo. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Makhubo it may be simpler if – 
when I am – if you and I alternate on microphones so when 
I am talking I think that might help on the echo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His one can stay on.  Most of the time I 
keep mine off except when I am talking but sometimes I 
leave it on and there is no problem.  But his one can stay 
on even when he is not talking it should be fine.  But I will 
keep mine off when I am not talking. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Makhubo 
then to get back to that question I just wanted to clarify that 
now that you had a longer opportunity to look through those 
documents is there anything that you wanted to revert to or 
qualify in relation to your testimony last time around. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 7 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I possibly be more specific 
then.  There was a transcript of a Power FM interview at 
Bundle – Flow Funds Bundle 2 page 926 onwards and we 
invited you assume that it was a correct transcript but if you 
wanted to check the tape you were free to do so.  I just 
want to clarify that you do not dispute any of the accuracy 
of that transcript? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I – I did not check the tape but I am not – I 
am not disputing it. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  And similarly, there were a 
series of tables of transactions that ran from Flow of Funds 
Bundle 2984 to Flow of Funds 2991 and there was also a 
table of transactions at Flow of Funds 3 pages 849 to 850 
which were transfers between Molelwane Consulting and 
your personal accounts.  I just want to check if there are 
any of those transactions which – which you want to place 
in dispute? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Chaskalson.  I 
20 
understood from what you said that Mr Makhubo may be 
legally represented. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  He is Mr Mphaga is  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I apologise to you and Mr 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 8 of 413 
 
Mphaga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay would you just… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I should have given him an 
opportunity to put himself on records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja could have placed on – on record. 
ADV MPHAGA SC: Thanks Chairperson.  Advocate Moses 
Mphaga SC I am appearing for Mr Makhubo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHAGA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then I want to take you to – 
specifically to transactions that I did not question you 
directly about last time beyond referring to them generically 
in that bundle from page 984 to 991.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Bundle 2. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you go to Bundle 2 page 990.  
MR MAKHUBO:  Page 9? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  990. 
MR MAKHUBO:  You say the black ones or the red ones? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The black ones – I will be 
20 
referring exclusively to the black numbers today.  990. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There is a table of cash deposits 
at the top of that page – ignore that for the meantime but 
then 
there 
are 
a 
table 
of 
transactions 
from 
TSS 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 9 of 413 
 
Management Services to either of the two Molelwane 
Consulting Accounts with an aggregate figure of R4.457 
million.  I just want to clarify that there are no transactions 
there that you dispute. 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then below there is a table 
from ACCsolve but you can ignore that but go over the page 
to 991 and first there is a table of payments aggregating to 
R500 000.00 from Patrick Mak – with the reference Patrick 
Makhubedu that were paid into the two Molelwane accounts. 
10 
Again can you clarify if there are any of those transactions 
that you dispute? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And at the bottom – the last table 
is a table of payments with the reference Payment Zylec 
that were paid into the Molelwane current account a total of 
R630 000.00 – are there any of those that – that you 
dispute? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now if I – I can ask you to turn to 
20 
page 417 of that bundle – same Bundle 2.  That is the 
affidavit that you furnished to this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page again? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  417 Chair Bundle 2.  And – and if 
you go down to paragraph 42 of your affidavit you say: 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 10 of 413 
 
“To my knowledge Zylec is an entity owned by Mr Patrick 
Makhubedu and one Mr Metse Phiyega.  I had no business 
relations with this entity.” 
 
Now if you have no business relationship with Zylec 
can you explain why it was paying you amounts that 
aggregated to R630 000.00 or paying Molelwane amounts 
that aggregated to R630 000.00? 
MR MAKHUBO:  As far as I remember Patrick would 
especially in the early days when there is no cash flow in 
Molelwane he would assist, from whatever quota that we 
10 
would do including from Zylec that is how – that is what I 
remember. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see – and – so if we back to that 
table which is at page 991 the last – the last table in the – 
the bundle.  If one looks at those date of the Zylec 
transactions they are 2012 and 2013. Now that is after 
Molelwane has successfully obtained its – its biggest 
contract ever which was the contract with Regiments in 
relation to the Johannesburg sinking fund quite a long time 
after that in fact it is after that contract should have expired 
20 
but it is during the period where that contract was 
prolonged. 
 
Are you still suggesting that these were the cash 
flow payments? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I still maintain that in the early days that is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 11 of 413 
 
how we used to – between ACCsolve – Molelwane whoever 
had cash flows if I did Patrick would help with the cash 
flows. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But this was not the early days 
this was after 2011 it was in fact after the time when 
according to your evidence you had intended to resign. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes there were still people at Molelwane 
and he would assist.  Remember when I left ACCsolve 
where I was partners with Patrick we had agreed again that 
things would continue and he – we had agreed that for the 
10 
value that is in ACCsolve he will still have to pay me but 
this one specifically I am referring to I really think that it is 
around the – around those cash flows in Molelwane. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So if I understand you correctly 
these would essentially be loans to Molelwance that Patrick 
would 
have 
organised 
to 
tied 
it 
over 
its 
cash 
flow 
difficulties. 
MR 
MAKHUBO: 
 They 
would 
be 
between 
Molelwane 
ACCsolve, Patrick, myself yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So they were not – but the nature 
20 
of the payments would – would not – it is like there was an 
underlying transaction supporting them beyond a loan to 
tide over cash flow difficulties. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is how I understand them yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  Can we then 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 12 of 413 
 
move to the EOH issues and for the most part of – for these 
questions I am going to be referring to documents in the 
bundle Flow of Funds 1.  Bundle 1 Flow of Funds.  So if you 
can put Bundle 2 away and go to – go to Bundle 1.  Once or 
twice I might have to refer to Bundle 3 so if you can also 
have that to hand but I – I am unlikely to refer to 2 again for 
a while. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can I ask you to go to Bundle 
1 page 761. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And there there is a document 
Chair I am not sure if you have page 761 of Bundle 1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  She is going to give it to me just now.  
761. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes Chair.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There is a proposal for the 
upgrading of the City of Johannesburg Network and Security 
Infrastructure prepared for the City of Johannesburg dated 
20 
16 April 2014.  It is an EOH document.  Do you recognise 
this document? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I see it was sent to me but that – it does 
not make sense so I do not recognise it at all. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You do not recognise it? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 13 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I take you … 
MR MAKHUBO:  I think it had nothing to do with me Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry it does not. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Saying the City it had nothing to do with 
me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In the City it had nothing to do 
with you? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think legally that should have 
10 
been correct but can I – can I ask you to go up a page to 
760.  Now this is an email taken off a EOH computer.  It is 
addressed 
by 
Patrick 
Makhubedu 
to 
geoff.makhubo@gmail.com is that your Gmail address? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes it is. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And it is dated 27 August 2014 
and the attachment EOH CoJ Networking Solution Volume 
3.docx is the document that we have just seen.  Do you 
recall receiving this email from Patrick Makhubedu on the 
27 August 2014? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  I – I do not – I tried to go back to my old 
emails but I – I do not.  As I said when I read it it does not 
make sense why it came to me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes I – it also does not make 
sense to me why it came to you but the – there is an email 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 14 of 413 
 
on EOH computer which is addressed to you attaching this 
document.  Are you saying you have never received this 
document? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no I am not saying I have never 
received it I said I can see it is sent to me but I – I do not 
remember reading this document I do not even remember – 
as I say it is meaningless to me.  IT was not even part of my 
portfolio. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So IT was not part of your 
portfolio? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  You have this bundle of 
documents for over six months now.  Have you raised with 
Patrick Makhubedu why there is an email from EOH address 
to your Gmail attaching this document? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No I did not. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Did you not think it would – I 
mean you say it makes no sense that he would have sent it 
to you. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But they why did you not raise 
this with him – why did send it to me? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I did not occur to me that I visit with him 
but I just did not think it was important to raise but I did not 
raise it with him. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 15 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  And if you did get involved 
in a procurement decision around IT that would have been 
completely irregular would it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes to receive a proposal. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You – you did yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  If I did. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  But I did not. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yeah you say you did not yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja it is a supposition that I did not. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But there is this rather curious 
email from Patrick Makhubedu to you attaching an IT tender 
proposal. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I think it will be best to answer it himself I 
do not know really what – if… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  Well this email on its face 
was sent to you on the 27 August 2014 can I take you to – 
and you will recall that the proposal itself had a date of 
April 2014.   
MR MAKHUBO:  I see it here yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I take you to some other 
documents or emails exchanged between you and Patrick 
Makhubedu 
in August 
2016 
shortly 
before 
this 
email 
apparently was sent to you.  Can you go to 606 of Bundle 2.   
CHAIRPERSON:  60 – 606 of? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 16 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  606 – oh sorry of Bundle 1 – of 
Bundle 1 – Bundle 1 I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  606 of Bundle 1.  Bundle 1 is the 
bundle in – the same bundle that we have been working on 
and all of the references unless otherwise stated will be to 
Bundle 1.  For the record I will try to remember to mention 
Bundle 1.   
MR MAKHUBO:  606? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  606. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So at the top of 606 you see an 
email from Patrick Makhubedu to Rene Jonker dated 6 
August 2014 and what it forwards is an email that appears 
to come from you geoff.makhubo@gmail.com also 6 August 
2014 to patrickmakhubedu05@gmail.com and can I just 
clarify at that point it is patrick.makhubedu05@gmail.com a 
Gmail address that you would use in corresponding with 
Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes and EOH ja but they use this one. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the email that appears to 
come from you to Patrick Makhubedu says: 
“Dear 
Patrick, 
the 
ANC 
Greater 
Johannesburg requests urgent assistance 
with the relaunch of its Youth League this 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 17 of 413 
 
weekend.  Apologies for the late request but 
it 
is 
an 
imperative 
from 
Head 
Office.  
Attached is the accommodation quotation 
funds can be paid directly into the ANC or to 
the venue. Regards Geoff Makhubo and 
Regional Treasurer.” 
Do you recall sending that letter? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I remember this email requesting for 
money for the Youth League Conference. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right and if we go down two 
10 
pages – oh sorry not two pages – if you go up to 602 – 
602/603 we will see a letter from Rene Jonker to Patrick 
Madhubedu on the same day 6 August 
“Banks will pay first thing in the morning.” 
And underneath there is an email from Patrick Makhubedu 
to Rene Jonker forwarding ANC bank details and those ANC 
bank details appear to have been forwarded from you to 
Patrick Makhubedu later on the 6 August 2014 at 3:50.  Do 
you recall that email attaching – forwarding the ANC bank 
details on 6 August 2014? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes it would have made sense that we 
send bank details when you request the funding. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  And then if you go down a 
page further at 604 you see an email from Patrick 
Makhubedu to Jehan Mackay who was a Senior Executive at 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 18 of 413 
 
EOH at the time and he says: 
“Hi please assist as per email below.” 
And what is forwarded below again is an email from you 
geoff.makhubo@gmail.com 
to 
patrick.makhubedu05@gmail.com and over the page is the 
attachment that was attached to that email.  Is that the – 
the quotation for the Youth League Conference venue that 
you wanted EOH to pay on page 605?  R582 100.00. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes Chairperson it is a – it is a quotation 
from the venue where the conference was held and it was a 
10 
request for funding on behalf of the African National 
Congress Youth League Johannesburg region.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right. And then if we go down to 
page 612 we will see that your request was actually 
successful – sorry 607 you will see the Proof of Payment of 
R582 100.00 from TSS Managed Services which is an EOH 
company to the ANC Greater Johannesburg.  Do you recall 
receiving payment of this amount R582 100.00 in the ANC 
bank account from TSS in response to your request? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes the request was honoured. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I ask you then to go down 
further to page 609 and that is a letter that comes from you 
in your capacity as Regional Treasurer and you will see that 
it is signed or is in your name at the foot of 610 – can you 
go to 610 in – we are in Bundle 1 Flow of Funds Bundle 1.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 19 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you describe this letter – 
sorry is this a letter that you sent to the EOH Executive 
Director copied to Mr Ebrahim Laher? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Chaskalson did you say 
610? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  610 is where the – Mr Makhubo’s 
name appears on the document – 609 is where it is 
addressed to the Executive Director EOH Mthombo and 
copies to Ebrahim Laher. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Is this a request that you sent to 
Mr Jehan Mackay? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if one goes through the 
requests one sees that it is a request for a contribution 
relating to upcoming conferences and congresses and the 
total expenditure that the region needs is R6.180 million.  
You can see that figure at the foot of 610.  And you were 
asking … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Chaskalson I am looking for 
R6, whatever? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  R6 180 000.00 at page 610 Chair. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 20 of 413 
 
Grand total just above banking details.  Grand total is 
R6 180 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Okay now I see I was looking on 
the columns before that ja.  I have seen it ja.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you sent this request to Mr 
Mackay – what sort of donation were you hoping to receive 
from him? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well we – we were sending to say that 
from August to January there would be activities that would 
be carried out by – by the region which is why we even 
10 
broke the – the cash flows per month that we do not need 
the lump sum but if they can assist us to carry out all these 
activities that are stated in the letter – in the different 
months because the 2014 was a very busy year towards to 
the end.  So that is – that is basically part of the fund 
raising efforts amongst others that we sent to – to EOH. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see and what sort of donation 
were you hoping receive from EOH? 
MR MAKHUBO:  How do you mean Chairperson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  I do not understand the question. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I mean what kind of donation were 
you expecting to receive from EOH?  What – what size? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well the –  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  What part of the R6. – just over 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 21 of 413 
 
R6.18 million were you hoping to get from EOH? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No I mean at that time they would tell me 
what they can afford and then so that I can approach other 
donors that would fund the region as well – let us say 
maybe you can afford R900 000.00 then it is fine. We would 
sent the same to other donors who would – and who – who 
in any case would have funded ourselves as well – funded 
the ANC as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  Now the ANC was at the 
time the controlling party in the city was it not? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Come again. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The ANC was the – at the time the 
governing party in the City? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And EOH did a lot of business 
with the City did it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  EOH has being doing business with the 
City pre-dating before I became Treasurer as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but I am interested in August 
2014 was EOH doing business with the City? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes EOH was doing business with the City 
and continues to do business with it ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And in August 2014 did EOH have 
any pending proposals before the City. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, to my knowledge – as you say that, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 22 of 413 
 
to my knowledge EOH was doing business at that time in 
The City. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, I am interested in a slightly 
different question which is whether it had any pending 
proposals.  In other words, business that it wanted to get 
but had not been awarded yet. 
MR MAKHUBO:   From the proposal that – I saw the email, 
it is very clear that they sent a proposal at that time but I 
was not – I mean, this really did not make sense to me but 
yes they were going to continue to do business with The 
10 
City.  They have been doing business for a long time with 
The City and they still do business with The City today. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And as we see from that email, 
there was a proposal pending before The City at the time. 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is apparent from the email, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, do you think it is 
appropriate for the ANC as the governing party of The City 
to 
solicit 
donations 
from 
companies 
who 
are 
doing 
business with The City and had pending bids before The 
City? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I suppose maybe there is an issue 
to be canvassed and I thought that it was canvassed with 
our national office as internally(?) structure when the 
President was here and the Treasurer General but we ask 
for donations from the spaza shop to do anyone doing 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 23 of 413 
 
business with The City to anyone not doing business with 
The City.  We go to private sector to ask for business... 
sustain.  So I just think that whoever is willing to fund the 
ANC and we send proposals and it is transparent.  So it 
should be appropriate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, you said it is transparent.  
In what way is it transparent? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Because I had wrote the letter to the 
Executive Director.  You know, it is not a hidden thing.  It 
went into EOH as posing(?) to the EOH process.   
10 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
but 
that 
is 
hardly 
transparent visa vie the public.  I mean, EOH knows if you 
are soliciting a donation from them.  Does the public know? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, this is a private matter between the 
organisation.  It is only now that the deal(?) was passed 
but, you know, private donations must be disclosed that 
are above hundred thousand, Chairperson.  But before 
then, political parties – who knows who funds the DA in the 
Western Cape, whether they do business or not with the 
Government of the Western Cape.  Who knows who funds 
20 
other parties.   
 
But 
previously, 
of 
course, 
between 
the 
organisation and whoever donated it was kept a secret 
except when you go to conferences would account to our 
own members.  Even some of the sessions are open.  So 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 24 of 413 
 
our own members would know who has funded us. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, so I think one of the rare 
points of common ground between the ANC and the DA at 
the time was nobody wanted to disclose the source of their 
donations. 
MR MAKHUBO:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   That has to be true.  [laughs]   
MR MAKHUBO:   [laughs]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [laughs]  They even went to the 
Constitutional Court together on that one.  But what I want 
10 
to put to you is that in terms of an appearance of 
manipulation of tender processes.  If a city – if a governing 
body in command of a city is soliciting donations from 
businesses who are doing business with The City and who 
are applying to do more business with The City, there is at 
least an appearance created that whether they respond to 
the donation and how they respond to the donation may 
affect the outcome of their pending proposals.  What is 
your response to that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I, during my tenure, would not have 
20 
linked whether getting a tender or not.  So I was not – in 
fact, if you ask anyone that I spoke to, will tell you that I 
always a said a thing that I do not sell tenders because I 
am not involved in tenders.  So as you speak about 
appearance, I – for me it is quite clear that the reason for 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 25 of 413 
 
me to go to ask for money from, one, people I know.   
 
Two, from any other businessperson who is 
willing to fund the ANC.  Some of them would volunteer 
and I would write them letters.  You would not even have a 
causality and Xhosa link between that and doing business 
in The City and the tender.  So whether you win the tender 
or not, it does not depend on whether you fund the ANC or 
not.   
 
There are lots of businesses doing – there are 
lots of business doing – having transactions and business 
10 
in The City but they do not fund the ANC and you know it 
does not work against them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will get back to what you 
yourself did in relation to tenders and what you did not 
later 
but 
for 
now 
I 
am 
just 
wanting 
to 
talk 
about 
appearances.  So I want you to not to speak about your 
own actions.  I just want to hear your response on whether 
you accept that if the governing party solicits donations 
from companies doing business with The City and applying 
to do more business with The City that creates an 
20 
appearance of impropriety in the sense that the outcome of 
the pending proposal may be effected by the response for 
a donation.  What is your response to that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Appearance to whom?  I do not think so 
that – you know because I was a player in requesting 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 26 of 413 
 
money, for me, Chairperson, it does not really – unless you 
expressly say:  If you do not fund this – our organisation, 
you will not get a tender.  I do not see how it appears that 
this causality between, you know, funding the organisation 
and getting a tender.   
 
Firstly, I am the Treasurer of the organisation.  It 
means then I would have to instruct the accounting officer 
and the committees that preside over these tenders and 
illegally interfere in the procurement processes, which I am 
prohibited(?) to do, for me to get – for the company to get 
10 
the benefits.  Then what does it mean?   
 
It means that everyone will have to queue at the 
ANC door for them to get the tenders or any other 
governing party for them to get business with The City.  So 
I do not know about the appearance because for me it does 
not appear that the appearance is the way you described 
it, Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Well, let us go back to 
what actually happened then.  Can we go to page 612? 
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there you will see a payment 
from an entity called Prime Molecular.  Do you know who 
Prime Molecular are?   
MR MAKHUBO:   I have subsequently learnt that it is 
Patrick’s company. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 27 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  And if you look at that 
group of payments  It is R 20 527.30 to SCC/14872 and if 
you go up a page you will see the covering email and that 
is an email from Patrick Makhubedu to yourself on 
20 August 2014, 
saying 
proof 
of 
payment 
Sandton 
Convention Centre.  Do you recall receiving that email from 
Patrick Makhubedu with the proof of payment with twenty 
thousand odd to the Sandton Convention Centre? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I saw the email as I was going 
through the bundle. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what was that in connection 
with? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think it was about a small meeting we 
had in the Sandton Convention Centre. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, it was? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It was about a meeting we had at the 
Sandton Convention Centre. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   An ANC meeting in the Sandton 
Convention – a regional ANC meeting in the Sandton 
Convention Centre? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, actually, it was not an ANC regional 
meeting but it was a meeting of people that we organised. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But in connection with an ANC – 
was it an ANC meeting or was it a ...[intervenes]  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, it was in connection with an ANC 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 28 of 413 
 
thing(?). 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Can we then go further 
down to page 613?  And there you will see another email 
from Patrick Makhubedu to yourself on the 22 n d of August 
and it says forward payment confirmation 165 and it 
forwards a payment confirmation from Standard Bank.  And 
if you go down two pages to page 615, that is still in 
Bundle 1, you will see that there is a payment that is made 
to a beneficiary, the ANC, and it has the beneficiary 
reference Patrick Makhubedu and it says R 70 000,00 on 
10 
the 22 n d of August 2014.  But for now I just want to draw 
your attention to what it says below: 
“If you need more information or have any 
questions about this payment, please contact 
Mfundi 1...” 
 
Do you know what Mfundi 1 was? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not know Mfundi 1 but I subsequently 
learnt that there is a company called Mfundi. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mfundi. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what did you learn about 
Mfundi? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is has got links with Patrick. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do you know who else it has 
links with? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 29 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think it is Reno. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Reno Barry? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if I recall ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   I saw it from the ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   From the transcripts(?). 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And recall your testimony earlier 
10 
that Reno Barry is your financial advisor. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, Barry was introduced to me by 
Patrick and I asked ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   And I asked him to – in the affidavit I say, 
when I – because Mululane(?) people used to do my tax.  
When they stopped, I asked Reno to continue assisting me 
with doing my tax, not my financial advisor, just as my tax 
and my work tax, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  In your affidavit you 
20 
actually described him as your financial advisor but are 
you saying he just does your tax? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, he just does my tax.  My financial 
advisor is somebody else who does my advice with my 
investments and everything. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 30 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  So Reno Barry is 
confined to tax? 
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you to page 336 of 
this bundle?   
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 1, page 336. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there you will see an email 
from 
Reno 
Barry 
to 
Patrick 
Makhubedu 
on 
10 
10 September 2014 which attached a document called 
Mfundi Management Report 10 September 2014, and it 
says: 
“Hi, 
Patrick. 
 
Please 
find 
the 
attached 
management report...” 
 
And if you go down a page to 337, you will see 
the management report which was attached. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Or the spreadsheet that was 
attached as the management report. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you bear with me for one 
moment? 
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The – if we start at the top, it 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 31 of 413 
 
says Sales Monthly EOH Invoice.  So Mfundi is invoicing 
EOH 
monthly 
and 
there 
is 
a 
monthly 
amount 
of 
R 406 000,00.  It runs across from October 2013 all the 
way through to August 2014.  Then underneath, another 
sale that Mfundi does, is an EOH special invoice and we 
see R 1.2 million in June 2014.  A special invoice to EOH 
in June 2014.   
 
We see no other income to Mfundi other than 
income from EOH.  You have an accountancy training.  
Would you accept that that is a correct assessment of this 
10 
spreadsheet that the only income comes from EOH? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is how I read this spread sheet but I 
would not know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  No, I am not suggesting 
that you have personal knowledge of ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...relies on but ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...on the report from Mfundi to 
Patrick Makhubedu, all the income comes from EOH.  Then 
20 
underneath the sales, there are costs of sales, a range of 
them.  And a lot of them seem to be relating to house 
alterations or house constructions.  So if one goes down 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5 one sees KG Designs.   
 
A few later, one sees Northern Wholesale Tiles.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 32 of 413 
 
And then you would see Inovar Floor Centurion.  A bit 
lower, 
one 
sees 
Pioneer 
Floor 
Heating, 
Advance 
Renovators, Dayzhan(?) Customer Furniture, Sundowner 
Skylights.   
 
A bit lower down, Riapha(?) Properties.  Can you 
offer any ideas to why Mfundi might be billing EOH for 
expenses of this nature, house improvement expenses of a 
cost of sales on their invoices to EOH? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I honestly why – and the operations of 
Mfundi, I would not even know. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  And you yourself did not 
do any household alterations or house construction in that 
period of May 2014 to August 2014, which is when 
these...? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, no. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   The things(?) to my house has nothing to 
do with Mfundi. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, no.  I – everything – anything – 
20 
everything that has to do with me has nothing to do with 
Mfundi.  It is my house.  I mean, you are asking me about 
...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but I am asking a separate 
question.  Were you doing household alterations in that 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 33 of 413 
 
period? 
MR MAKHUBO:   My house alterations were around 2011 to 
around 2013 and of course we continue doing things.  Even 
today, we are doing maintenance. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But none of these expenses, 
Norman 
Wholesale 
Tiles, 
Inovar 
Floor 
Centurion 
...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   No. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   KG Designs.  Do you recognise 
any of these suppliers? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, no. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Pioneer Floor Heat Keating. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But you have floor heating at 
your house? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Pardon? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you have floor heating at 
your house? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do you remember when it 
was installed? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It was installed when I built in 2012. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In 2012? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 34 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Not in 2014? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, can I take you to two which 
– two expenses which do affect you? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Or were related to you.  If you 
see 
– 
remember 
we 
saw 
the 
proof 
of 
payment 
of 
R 70 000,00 to the ANC? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go down, the 
August 2014 column, you will see that R 70 000,00 is 
reflected and then you move across left, is reflected as 
Mfundi Cost of Sales to EOH for the ANC.  So it is cost of 
sales, ANC and you go across, you will see R 70 000,00 
was paid by Mfundi to the ANC in August 2014.  And Mfundi 
accounted to EOH as treating this payment as the cost of 
its sale to EOH.  Is that an accurate description of what we 
see in this management report? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I would not know how they classify the 
20 
expenses and how they do their books and ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, no, but you see how they do 
it right now.  You are an accountant and you see 
...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I see that.  They called it costs of 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 35 of 413 
 
sales and then I – I mean, how would be this be a cost of 
sales to them? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, they seem to be treating it 
as a cost of sales against the only sales that they have 
which are EOH invoices. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja, that is – I mean, I would not know.  
As I say, I see it from here.  It is like reading any books as 
a third party but I cannot comment on why they would do 
that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But you will accept that as an 
10 
accountant who reads management reports like this what 
this suggests or what the stakes as a report is that the 
R 70 000,00 payment to the ANC by Mfundi was built as a 
cost of sales on the EOH invoices that were the only sales 
that Mfundi had in that period. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is how I read the ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is how they classified it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is presumable how 
Patrick Makhubedu would have read it when he saw it.  
20 
That is how any trained accountant would read it, is that 
not right? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot presume what Patrick read it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, how would any trained 
accountant read it? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 36 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Any trained accountant would read it as a 
cost of sales... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The cost of sales in respect of 
invoice and the only sales are invoices to ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Cost of sales of generating the sales that 
are ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [Indistinct] 
MR MAKHUBO:   ...reflected there.  That is what an 
accountant would read these financials. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And those sales are invoices to 
EOH. 
MR 
MAKHUBO: 
 
 That 
is 
how 
I 
am 
reading 
this, 
Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let us go down one. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And one sees an R 80 000,00 
20 
payment.  This time to Molelwane Consulting also in 
August 2014.  And if I can just ask you to briefly shit to 
Flow of Funds, Bundle 3 and go to page 612? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I see, Mr Chaskalson, when you said let 
us go down I was wanting to go to the next page because 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 37 of 413 
 
...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   On, sorry.  No, no the same 
page, Chair.  If you see where the R 70 000,00 is 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, I can see that.  Now I 
understand.  Just that previously you ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I was saying down by page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or up when you say let us go back.  
You have not said let us go down when you say let us go 
forward.  So... 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I will try to be more precise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Alright.  Bundle 3, what page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 3, page 612. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if one starts at 611, which 
tells us what the document is.  So up a page to Bundle 3 to 
page 611. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is a bank statement from 
Molelwane Consulting starting at 16 August 2014 and 
20 
ending 17 September 2014.  And you confirmed that it is. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Now if one goes, one sees 
that the opening balance is R 621.45.  So Molelwane is 
almost in overdraft at that point.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 38 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if one goes to 22 August, 
the very first entry in here is that R 80 000,00 that we saw 
reflected 
as 
an 
Mfundi 
payment 
to 
Molelwane 
in 
August 2014.  It has the reference Patrick Makhubedu.  Do 
you see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if we then go back – well, 
keep that page open because we are going to come back to 
it, but if we go back to August, the management report that 
10 
Barry sent to Makhubedu which is Flow of Funds, Volume 
1, page 337 we see that that R 80 000,00 from Mfundi to 
Molelwane appears on this management report again as a 
cost of sales in respect of the sales generated by those 
EOH invoices that Mfundi is issuing.  Do you see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So as between Mfundi and EOH, 
R 80 000,00 paid into your close corporation was treated 
as a cost of sales between Mfundi and EOH in respect of 
the EOH invoices that were issued to Mfundi.   Do you 
20 
know 
what 
this 
payment 
was 
for, 
this 
R 80 000,00 
payment? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think it was, as I see and as I read it, it 
was a cash flow to pay salaries in August 2014 attributed 
to assist Molelwane like just because – just as Accsolve 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 39 of 413 
 
was assisted before.  So on the 22 n d, he deposited 
R 80 000,00 just to help pay the people there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So payment is Molelwane’s cash 
flow problems, is that you are saying that R 80 000,00 
was? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think that what – how I can said and 
then that is how – you know, that is how we operated 
between Exsolve and Molelwane.  That is – the two 
companies operated interchangeable for the longest of 
time. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, which two companies? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is why I am saying Exsolve(?) 
...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   ...was a director, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Exsolve? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Exsolve. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes.  And therefore, Patrick, when I left 
him he said:  Look, please look after this up until it runs 
down.  I think that is what he did and he would be the best 
person to answer, as I say what the issues were there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I just want to – before we 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 40 of 413 
 
get the opportunity to ask questions to Patrick, we need to 
get clarity from you.  Your understanding is that is an 
R 80 000,00 
payment 
to 
ease 
cash 
flow 
problems 
Molelwane would have at the time ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...and to enable it to pay 
salaries. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is my understanding, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And indeed, we saw those cash 
flows problems because its balance was, before it received 
10 
that payment, its balance was down to R 621.45. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is what it appears, ja, from the bank 
statement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But if you go back then to page 
337.  Sorry, it is – that same management report. 
MR MAKHUBO:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We see that this payment to 
ease Molelwane’s cash flow problem is treated as a cost of 
sales as between Mfundi and EOH.  How – can you offer 
any explanation as to why Mfundi would treat a payment to 
20 
Molelwane as a cost of sales arising from its income from 
EOH? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I definitely do not have idea why Mfundi 
would classify something like this. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  Well, maybe we will have 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 41 of 413 
 
the opportunity to ask Mfundi in or Patrick in due course.  
Let me take us back to the chronology where 22 – we have 
gone through to 22 August.  And then we come to 27 
August ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Which bundle is that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, you can just put that one 
back.  We have gone through all of these donations to the 
ANC and to Molelwane in early August and then on 
27 August, we come to that email that I started with today 
at page 760 of this bundle.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 3, must we ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 1.  Bundle 1, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Must we keep Bundle 3 open at any page 
or not really? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Not at any page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We may come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But we – it will be in a different 
context, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is Bundle 1, page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   760. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And so it is in that context of all 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 42 of 413 
 
of these donations that have been solicited for the ANC 
and all of these and then this payment that has been... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that seven, six, zero or seven, one, 
six? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   760. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   760, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is in this context that on 
27 August, Mr Makhubedu emails you a copy of the EOH 
10 
proposal.  Does the timing – can you comment on that 
timing in any way? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, I have no comment on timing.  I 
would not have a comment on that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see, what I want to put to 
you is that Mr Makhubedu has made a series of donations 
to the ANC in the previous couple of weeks and he had 
now saved your company, Molelwane, from its cash flow 
difficulties and it was in that context that he thought he 
might ask your assistance in relation to a pending EOH 
20 
networking proposal.  What is your comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, Patrick could never do that.  We were 
business partners for a long time.  We have helped each 
other for a long time.  We – he would not solicited any 
tender to me like this or any other way.  We have known 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 43 of 413 
 
each other for long. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But then why would he email you 
this proposal? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I am not sure why he would email me this 
proposal.  As I said, it has nothing to do with me but our 
relationship is such that he would not say I have donated 
to the ANC to this.  No, he has never done that.  And they 
have donated from the days before it was bought by EOH 
and they have never asked me for anything.  Even before I 
joined The City.  Even, I think, before they even got 
10 
business from The City that or even donate to the ANC.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Again, I ask you.  Did – why 
would he email you a proposal? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not know.  As I say, it is his best 
place to answer that.  I would not know because I was not 
even 
responsible 
for 
IT 
or 
any 
other 
procurement 
processes.  I would not know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let us go a little bit further.  
Let us go down to Flow of Funds, Bundle 1, page 778. 
MR MAKHUBO:   778? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there you see another email 
from Patrick Makhubedu to yourself dated 29 August 2014.  
And it has an attachment and the attachment I son the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 44 of 413 
 
following page 778.1.  You want to turn to page 778.1? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The attachment is an invoice 
from TSS which is the EOH subsidiary to The City and it is 
in the amount to R 106 185 395.36 which is exactly the 
same amount as the proposal that Mr Makhubedu sent to 
you on 27 August, two days previously.  Do you recall 
receiving this email? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Again, I saw it on this bundle.  I do not 
recall.  It does not even make sense.  Again was – how do 
10 
you sent a proposal four days later, the invoice, before you 
even get the job?  I mean, it does not even make sense.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, the proposal was in 
respect of a proposal that had been made in April but we 
will get to why it all make sense in a minute.  So you say 
you have no recollection of receiving this email? 
MR MAKHUBO:   As I say, I see it here but I could not 
even go to my old emails.  So I do not have a recollection 
of this thing. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But this is an email, again, taken 
20 
off an EOH computer that is addressed to you on that date.  
Can you deny that you received it? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I see this on page 778 and as I say I tried 
to go back but I do not – I could not get as far as 2014 on 
my emails.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 45 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.   
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you are not in a position to 
deny that this email was sent to you on the 29 t h of August 
by Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I am not denying that it was sent to 
me but obviously I have got no recollection of an invoice 
sent to me that I could do nothing about. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I could do nothing about this. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, you have now had this 
document for over six months.  You have gone back to look 
to see if you have found it on your Gmail and you say but 
you could not get back that far.  Have you raised it with 
Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, in the same way of the proposal, I did 
not raise it with him. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Why have you not raise it with 
Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I did not see the need because I did not – 
20 
I – nothing, nothing - this thing had nothing to do with 
me... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I understand that it had nothing 
to do with you legitimately but the appearance is being 
created that Patrick Makhubedu is sending you emails 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 46 of 413 
 
relating to procurement practises that are none of your 
business.  Have you not want to find out from Patrick 
Makhubedu why he was doing this? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I was not... on the basis of appearances 
and I say, I did not – and when things to me do not affect 
me, do not want me to take action, I just ignore them.  That 
is how I work. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  Let us go a little further.  
Let us go to 1 September 2014 on page 779.  That is an 
email from Patrick Makhubedu to Reno Barry and this says: 
10 
“Please pay R 100 000,00 into the Molelwane 
account 
from 
Mfundi 
and 
make 
immediate 
clearance...” 
 
And if we go to Flow of Funds, Bundle 3 at page 
612.  Bundle 3, page 612.   
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There we see that R 100 000,00 
payment on the 1 s t of September.  This is the Molelwane 
bank statement that we earlier looked at where there was 
R 80 000,00 payment from Molelwane on the 22 n d of August 
20 
with the reference Patrick Makhubedu.  If we go on the 
1 s t of September, 
Patrick 
Makhubedu 
referenced 
R 100 000,00.  Do you see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I am seeing that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it looks as though that 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 47 of 413 
 
Molelwane 
instruction 
resulted 
in 
a 
payment 
of 
R 100 000,00 into your Molelwane – sorry, that Mfundi 
instruction from Patrick Makhubedu reduced a payment of 
R 100 000,00 
into 
your 
Molelwane 
account 
on 
the 
1 s t of September.  Is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And again, that was a point at 
which Molelwane was having cash flow difficulties before 
that payment.  If you look, its balance was at R 597.57. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And after that payment it was 
over – it was at R 100 597,45.  Without that payment it 
would not have been possible on 2 September to pay 
Kakali(?) salary R 10 000,00.  Do you accept that is 
correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I am just going to overdraft.  Yes, to 
the...  [Speaker not clear] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Who is Kakali? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is my mother.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right.  So your mother ’s salary 
20 
would not have been paid without that R 100 000,00 
payment by Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, without we starting injecting money 
to the company, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And that money came from 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 48 of 413 
 
Mfundi. 
MR MAKHUBO:   For me, it came from Patrick, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, yes.  But we have seen the 
instruction that it came from ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...that it came from Mfundi.  And 
then on 2 September, there is a R 20 000,00 payment to 
Jeff Standard.  Is that a R 20 000,00 payment into your 
account? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And again, that R 20 000,00 that 
was paid to you would not have been possible without the 
R 100 000,00 payment that came on the 1 s t pursuant to 
Patrick Makhubedu’s instruction to Mfundi.  Do you accept 
that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   If Patrick had not transferred into the 
account, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Then there are some 
payments below.  Metzi(?), Rory and Simon got payments 
of R 3 500, R 3 500,00 and R 2 500,00.  Who are Metzi, Rory 
20 
and Simon?  
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot remember.  It must be one of the 
comrades. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Well, those comrades 
would not have been paid but for the R 100 000,00 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 49 of 413 
 
payment that Patrick Makhubedu instructed from Mfundi.  
Is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:   If Patrick had not paid into our account, 
yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  And what about this Liberty 
Life policy or this Liberty Life payment on the 5 t h of 
September, R 22 895.00?  Do you know what that – looks 
like a policy premium.  Do you know what that is in respect 
of? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, when we were in Molelwane they 
10 
would take policies for a couple of people including myself, 
my mother working and others, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  So the premium on a 
policy of which, among others, you and your mother were 
beneficiaries also would not have been able to be paid but 
for the R 100 000,00 that Patrick Makhubedu instructed 
Mfundi ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, let me put it this way.  If Patrick 
had not paid, probably would have asked for an overdraft 
or something like that.  But as I said earlier, we used to 
20 
work like this.  If he had cash flow problems, we would 
help him.  If you do not – but you know Exsolve – between 
Exsolve and Molelwane.  That is how we used to work. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.   
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 50 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did Molelwane have an overdraft 
facility with FNB at that time? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, you could ask for ten thousand 
facility.  They used to grant us before then.  At this time, I 
would not because as I have said I was not – ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But you have no standing 
overdraft facility with FNB? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, no.  But whenever we needed 
temporary facilities, they assisted. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And would it have been possible 
10 
to organise a temporary facility on one day’s notice? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no not really.  Not really.  But I think 
two days or three days, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  But ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Even on my personal account, normally 
when there is a temporary facility I would get it within a 
day.  Then we would...  [Speaker not clear] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But any rate, you would not have 
been able to pay that R 10 000,00 or – payment to your 
mother on the 2 n d of September and the R 20 000,00 
20 
payment that went into your Standard Bank account on 
22 n d of September.  The R 20 000,00 payment that went 
into 
your 
Standard 
Bank 
account 
also 
on 
the 
2 n d  of September. 
MR MAKHUBO:   You know the way you phrase it, it is like 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 51 of 413 
 
there was no any other way to find cash flow but in this 
case, yes, Patrick did, as always, as we helped each other, 
as there was inter-company all the time, as we would inject 
money into the different companies to keep the cash flow 
going and we have done that for...  [Speaker not clear]  It 
is not the first time that we do this.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  But this particular 
payment, why I am interested in it is, it is coming from 
Mfundi.  The accounts to EOH for payment of this nature is 
costs of sales for its invoices to EOH.  And I am saying, 
10 
without that payment all of these subsequent payments out 
of Molelwane would not have been possible about that cost 
of sales of Mfundi.  Your comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   You know, how Patrick – when we talk 
and he has got a couple of businesses, how he transacts 
with me or he transacts with Molelwane and/or Exsolve, I 
really do not – it has not been part of my – I will not even 
ask him to say:  Where do you take the money from?  But 
the way you are asking it, because of the document that 
are here.   
20 
 
Yes, this money came from Mfundi, the way I see 
it on the documents and yes he did pay into Molelwane but 
whether he takes it from his personal account, Standard 
Bank or he takes it from Mfundi, Nedbank or whatever.  I 
really would not even ask him where he gets the money 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 52 of 413 
 
from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would this be a convenient time, 
Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea adjournment.  We will 
resume at half-past eleven.  We adjourn. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...in bundle 1.  Can I ask you to 
10 
go to page 782? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is on from 781 to 783, my 782 is blank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have 782? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, 781 and then 782 is a blank page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is a blank page. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I will ask for a 782 to be 
found for Mr Makhubo but maybe before we – while we are 
looking for that I can go onto another document, does not 
have to be dealt with immediately. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you to page 339?   
MR MAKHUBO:   In bundle 1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In bundle 1, yes, and maybe 
start on 339, not 339. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 53 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You will see on 338, there is 
another email from Reno Barry to Patrick Makhubedu, 15 
September this time.  It is says: 
“Proof of payment, Molelwane Consulting.“ 
And if we go down, this time it is a payment from 
Molelwane Consulting with a beneficiary description Patrick 
Makhubedu – sorry, payment from Prime Molecular to 
Molelwane Consulting with the beneficiary descript Patrick 
Makhubedu this time the amount is R70 000 on 15 
10 
September 2014.  This payment is made not into the 
account that we have been looking at up till now but into 
the other account of Molelwane, 62052928060.  Do you see 
that on the payment confirmation? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you confirm that that is a 
Molelwane account number? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So another 70 000 comes to 
Molelwane from a Patrick Makhubedu entity executed by 
20 
Reno Barry on the 15 September.  Any comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I have no comment, I suspect it is one of 
those again.  I have no comment.  You know, Chairperson, 
the Molelwane and ACCsolve used to share offices in 
Braamfontein in Noswal Hall, 8 t h floor and at that time, as I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 54 of 413 
 
said, the active people managing Molelwane and to know 
what problems are there would not be myself as the 
executive.  I stopped being executive at that time.  So 
whatever the problems would be, whatever cash flows they 
would need, I think because Patrick used to oversee 
ACCsolve 
and 
take 
an 
interest 
in 
what 
happens 
in 
Molelwane.  So I am not sure what this is. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But you see what strikes me as 
strange about this payment is that if it was a cash flow 
payment surely it would go into the business accounts of 
10 
Molelwane, the 62002637025 account that we have been 
looking at because that is where Molelwane’s cash flow 
ran, is that not correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think that is correct. As I say, I would 
not – I did not quite look what the issue was here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But if Mr Makhubedu was 
alleviating cash flow who would not direct a payment into 
the other Molelwane account, would he, because that 
would not help on the cash flow. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Where would pay to and how interbank 
20 
transfers would happen, I mean, I cannot comment on that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No but you can comment on one 
thing which is that a payment into that account, which is 
not the business account of Molelwane, is not going to help 
with Molelwane cash flow, is it? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 55 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   What is the business account of 
Molelwane? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Sorry, the account that we have 
been looking at when it hits cash flow problems, payments 
come in.  That is 62002637025.  This account into which 
the payment was made was a different account, was 
62052928060.  How would a payment into that account 
help with the cash flow problems of Molelwane? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I honestly would not know why they chose 
this account now. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see but on its face it would not 
be your usual cash flow payment because a usual cash 
flow payment would go to the other account, would it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   But even if it got into this account, I 
mean, these accounts are linked, it would have been a 
sweeping exercise, not a – I do not think it is an issue 
really. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  Let us see what else 
happened on the 15 September.  Can I take you to page 
783 of bundle 1?  And there you see an email from Patrick 
20 
Makhubedu to yourself again off an EOH computer and the 
attachment is on the following page and the attachment is 
a blank draft of a letter of award from the City of Jo’burg 
been drafted – it has been attached to an email from Mr 
Makhubedu to you from EOH to the City.  So the EOH 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 56 of 413 
 
sends a draft to the City that says – it is backdated to the 
22 May although it is sent on the 15 September, the same 
day that Mr Makhubedu has arranged for a 70 000 payment 
into your CC and it says – addressed to TSS, it says: 
“Attention:  Mr P Makhubedu” 
Backdated to 22 May 2014 although we know it was sent on 
the 15 September.   
“Dear Mr Makhubedu, upgrading of the City of 
Johannesburg network and security infrastructure.” 
Do you recall what else was given that description?  Mr 
10 
Makhubo, do you recall what else was given the description 
upgrading of the City of Johannesburg? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, it’s the proposal that you are 
familiar. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, the proposal from April 
2014: 
“We refer to your proposal dated 16 March 2014…” 
In fact it was dated 16 April 2014. 
“…submitted in response to the abovementioned 
RFP.  We have pleasure in advising you that after 
20 
careful consideration of the proposals received and 
the evaluation thereof, your proposal has been 
successful and that you have been nominated as 
the preferred supplier for the upgrading of the City 
of 
Johannesburg 
network 
and 
security 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396

infrastructure.  Your participation in this tender 
process is highly appreciated.  Yours faithfully.” 
And then there is a line for someone to sign.  Do you recall 
getting this email? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I saw it on the pack, I do not recall this. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you deny that you received 
it? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Pardon? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you deny that …[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, I do not deny that. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you do not deny that it was 
sent to you? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes because I see the email here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I cannot say I did not …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, you do not recall getting it? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, I cannot recall – I mean, what would I 
do with a letter like this, I do not – I do not sign letter like 
this, I – they are meaningless to me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, I see, they are meaningless 
20 
to you. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But, Mr Makhubo, let me put to 
you what this letter suggests very strongly to me which is 
that Mr Makhubedu, who had been arranging a succession 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 58 of 413 
 
of payments into your CC and a succession of payments to 
the ANC at your instance and who had earlier sent you a 
EOH proposal and an invoice to go with it, was now 
sending you a letter for the City to sign to award the bid to 
EOH.  That is what it looks like.  What is your comment to 
that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Why would you send a letter a letter to 
somebody who cannot even sign, cannot even instruct the 
accounting officer to sign?  I think that appearance – for 
me, this thing is meaningless ot me and I would not 
10 
…[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no, no, let us answer the 
answer.  Do you agree that this is what its appearance is? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Appearance maybe to you but for me it is 
meaningless, this thing, it is completely meaningless.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us deal with it.  As I understand 
it and you must tell me whether your understanding is the 
same, Mr Makhubo, that on the face of it – well, not on the 
face of it, actually, that Mr Makhubedu seems to have 
prepared a letter of award or a letter that he wanted or 
20 
expected to be written to him or to TSS by the relevant 
official of the City of Johannesburg saying that TSS had 
been nominated as the preferred supplier for the upgrading 
of 
the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
network 
and 
security 
infrastructure.  Is that your understanding of what seems to  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 59 of 413 
 
- to what he was doing when you look at the fact that this 
draft letter comes to you together with – comes to you from 
him and  the proposal is still pending and he had sent that 
proposal to you.  You remember we talked about that 
earlier as well? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you did say you did not understand 
why he would send it to you because you had nothing to do 
with IT.  Is my understanding – does it coincide with your 
understanding of what this represents? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, Chairperson, I mean, I think you are 
correct to say that he probably would have expected a 
letter of award to be sent to him written this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But I think he is the best placed person 
to respond to something like – I cannot go into his mind,  
to say what is it that he was thinking.  All I know is that – 
and I think people would understand that a person in my 
position would be – would not even be part of signing a 
letter like this because you need an EAC minute, you need 
20 
to accounting officer to award, you need to Group Chief 
Financial Officer, you need a lot of steps in procurement of 
the City.  That I understand because I was presiding over 
the policy, the procurement policy of the City but at the 
policy level, you know, the EAC, the central acquisition 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 60 of 413 
 
committee, the Bid Adjudication Committees, they would 
have 
gone 
through 
those 
processes. 
 
Now 
why 
Mr 
Makhubedu on this instance would have sent a letter to me 
untitled – unless I would have expected him to say Geoff 
Makhubo or Moloantoa Makhubo sign this.  So I think best 
placed – instead he is best placed to answer this, I am 
not… 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would agree, would you not, that 
it is very strange that he should send this to you because 
being close to you, as I understand him to have been, he 
10 
ought to have known that you would not sit in the 
committee that would award the tender, is it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, he would have known and he works 
in the public sector so he would know the responsibilities 
[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would know, ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   And he was a public sector executive so 
he would know the responsibilities of the accounting officer 
or the politician in all levels of – all three spheres of 
government. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   And this letter, I mean, would have been 
sent to myself as per this email from EOH, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, the first thing that is strange 
about this, I would imagine and you can say whether you 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 61 of 413 
 
agree is that the – that he should draft the letter from 
outside of the City that should be sent by - to him or his 
company by somebody within the City, that is the first thing 
that is strange.  You say to yourself why is he doing that 
because if the City – if the relevant committee or official 
who must decide this, does decide to nominate him or his 
company, they would write their own letter.  Why is he 
drafting the letter for somebody within the City?  Would 
you agree that is also strange that he would do that or was 
it normal for bidders to do this? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not know about bidders in the City. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   As I say, I hardly am in involved 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you do not get involved, yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   In exchanges between the City and 
suppliers and service providers and that process I would 
not know its intricacies of how it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But what is strange, as I say, is for me to 
20 
have 
received 
a 
letter 
like 
this 
but 
save 
to 
say, 
Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe before you proceed, do not 
forget the point you wanted to make.  Before you proceed 
are you, do you agree with me that that ordinarily would be 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 62 of 413 
 
strange itself, that he should draft the letter himself?  It 
should not be – you should not expect the City to draft its 
own letter to him? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I would expect the City to draft a letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   As I say, I am not privy …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To how they do things. 
MR MAKHUBO:   How they do the things between the 
administration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   But my expectation would be that the 
person would not even know that they are appointed up 
until the City writes to them to say you have been 
appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is my expectation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, exactly. 
MR MAKHUBO:   And because I was in business and I was 
doing business with the public sector, that is how it 
happened.  I received letters from …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the... 
MR MAKHUBO:   From the client to say your bid has been 
successful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has been successful. 
MR MAKHUBO:   We will contact you for contract 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 63 of 413 
 
negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   So I would have expected it to happen 
that way, not to happen this way because that is what has 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So two things that are strange about it. 
1. Is that he drafts the letter being an outsider to the 
City, a letter that should be drafted by somebody in 
the City. 
2. That he sends it to you. 
10 
So that is the second thing.  But I interrupted you when 
you wanted to make a certain point and I said do not forget 
the point you wanted to make. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, I was saying with proposals, I, even 
now in the position I hold today, I probably receive one 
proposal or the other on a daily basis – or maybe let me 
not stretch it, let me say on a weekly basis, people wanting 
to meet, people sending about innovative ideas, unsolicited 
bids.  So in my email and Whatsapp you would find all sort 
so people trying to sell whatever they sell in the City, 
20 
solution for potholes, solutions for this and that, you know, 
to modernise the City.  So proposals do come to us, I mean 
half the time we either send them to the chief of staff to 
say 
look, 
just 
send 
to 
the 
administration 
but 
the 
procurement process – because there is nothing I can do 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 64 of 413 
 
with them and I think there is an understanding that when 
you are in a position of power or influence you are able to 
influence things.  So things like proposals as they come to 
me, I think this one, the question is – because Patrick is 
close to you, why would he send something to you, which 
is what is strange but ordinarily, ordinarily, Chairperson, I 
receive emails – a barrage of emails around solutions, 
whether it is street light solutions or solar solutions or 
things that have been far from me, you know, water 
purification, if these things come to my email and we can 
10 
attest to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think to a certain extent one can 
understand people may be sending their ideas to the mayor 
about 
problems 
that 
the 
City 
should 
confront 
with, 
solutions and so on, generally speaking, maybe without 
even talking about any particular tender, you know, 
because maybe the mayor is the face of the City, you 
know?  So maybe in some – up to a certain point one can 
understand people doing that.  Of course with him one, as 
a business person who deals with the public sector lot, he 
20 
would 
have 
known 
that 
with 
the 
position 
you 
were 
occupying you would not have anything to do with this 
proposal and him being close to you, he definitely would 
know that and that is why Mr Chaskalson’s question arises, 
why does somebody who knows that this is not something 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 65 of 413 
 
you are getting of him send it to you.  So I think that is the 
context but I think your answer is one, you do not know, is 
that right?  You do not know why he sent it? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, Chairperson, I do not know and in 
fact I am just thinking now that I am interested to see who 
else it was sent to in the City. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   If at all, the same proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if you do not know one would 
expect that that is all the more reason why particularly in 
10 
preparation for evidence here you would think it necessary 
to phone him and say, you know, I do not remember 
receiving this but I see that you sent me these things.  
Why were you sending me these things, you know I am not 
involved with this thing.  Well, that is what one would 
expect. 
MR MAKHUBO:   With the bundles and from the three 
bundles and the experience of the 27 November that Mr 
Chaskalson here would concentrate on 20 pages of the 
three files, one would look at this and say what sort of 
20 
question can come out of her? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was not one of them you were 
expecting. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, this was not one of those that one  
was expecting because remember, the way I see it, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 66 of 413 
 
Chairperson, he is trying to create a link, causality that 
this has happened, therefore it is as a result of this, the 
funding of the ANC is directly linked to this proposal and I 
think that is where the question is going and in my mind 
being a treasurer from 2008, even way before, I would 
understand that I have never have linked any proposal with 
saying this is the tender I want you to pay to certain 
tenders so it never occurred in my mind that I would have 
read that was this question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   This is an issue I canvassed at 
length with Mr Powell when he testified.  Did you not read 
Mr Powell’s evidence? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, it was not sent to me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You were aware the bundle that 
went to Mr Powell, this bundle, FOF1, was sent to you as 
an implicated person.  Your evidence in relation to TSS 
and EOH was deliberately stood down beyond that week of 
27 November to the backend of the week because you did 
not have enough time to read through the bundle relating 
20 
to Mr Powell in particular, it had been given too late.  Mr 
Powell then testified about you and there was considerable 
coverage about it in the press.  Did you not see that 
coverage? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I did not watch but I heard snippets 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 67 of 413 
 
of what he said, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now …[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   I was so surprised because he mentioned 
my name without – I was not even aware that he was going 
to mention my name there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, you got a Rule 3.3 notice 
saying that you were an implicated party in relation to his 
evidence or your attorneys did. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not remember getting that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, that is an issue you must 
10 
take up with your attorneys but your name was mentioned 
and you saw it in the press. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Pardon? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Your name was mentioned 
repeatedly and you say that in the press, you have just 
said you saw …[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I did. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now were you not interested to 
find out what was being said about you? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, the sorts of things he said about, 
20 
you know, payments, the 2016 tender, those sorts of things 
that I looked at. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, there were two tender that 
were addressed in his evidence.  The one was the 2014 
tender and the other was the 2016 tender.  Did you not go 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 68 of 413 
 
back to issues in relation to the 2014 tender? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, the 2014 tender because for me there 
was no 2014 tender that I would have known and that I 
thought was important. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So when was the first time that 
you paid any attention to this letter from Mr Makhubedu 
and these three letters from Mr Makhubedu the one 
forwarding you the proposal, the one forwarding you the 
invoice and this forwarding you a draft letter of award.  
When was the first time that you paid any attention to 
10 
those? 
MR MAKHUBO:   When I read the bundle. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And when was that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Last week. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And did you not realise how 
embarrassing these three emails look for you? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, I did not think so. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You did not think it was 
embarrassing 
that 
Mr 
Makhubedu 
was 
corresponding 
directly with you in relation to pending tenders and sending 
20 
you draft letters of award and invoices for the City.  Did 
that not strike you as embarrassing? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, it did not embarrass me because 
I just thought look, I had nothing to do with this, so… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But the impression to the outside 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 69 of 413 
 
world is Mr Makhubedu, your close friend, thought that he 
had a relationship where he could send you these letters.  
Did you not see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is – I am surprised at that, Mr 
Makhubo, because certainly he is sending you things that 
he should not be sending in terms of your role in the City.  
Now he creates the impression that he expects you to do 
something for him or for his entity about these things.  I 
would have thought that you would find that embarrassing 
10 
because it suggests something improper, does it not?  It 
suggests that you – his expectation is that you would so 
something improper by interfering in tenders, is it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, if I receive something and I 
call – just as an example – and I say [speaking in the 
vernacular] and I leave it at that.  No, I cannot do anything 
- I am just saying – and then life continues.  So those 
things happened, you call and say why are you doing this 
or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at least he would stop, one would 
20 
expect. 
MR MAKHUBO:  But I am just saying – because remember, 
I am reading this thing now and you say look, I did not call 
him but ordinarily when things like this happened and you 
are aware of them at that time, you can phone and say 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 70 of 413 
 
look, why are you sending me this?  I would not respond by 
email and say why are you sending me this?  You call and 
say but why are you sending me this, for what purpose.  
No, no, maybe for information.  Oh, can you do something?  
No, man, you know I cannot do something about this.  And 
then you continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at least he can give you an 
explanation, 
would 
he 
not, 
and 
one 
wonders 
what 
explanation he would give you because he cannot say to 
you I thought you could do something because he knows 
10 
that you know that he knows you cannot do anything 
legally. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That much he knows so one would 
expect that you would call him to account so to speak, say 
why were you sending these things to me because you 
know I do not do tenders, I do not – I am not going to go 
and talk to the relevant committee official to say they must 
give you a tender.  Why are you sending me a draft letter 
that is meant to come from the City to your company to 
20 
give a – to say you are the nominated – why are you 
sending it to me, why do you do that because you know I 
cannot do that, you know I would not do that.  You are not 
like somebody who does not know me. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I take counsel, Chairperson, but I will ask 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 71 of 413 
 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I will call him and ask him why did he do 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But as we speak now, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, the importance of it is that 
it might be said that that is the reaction of somebody who 
did not know why these things would have been sent to him 
but that if you knew why they were sent to him, you would 
10 
not call him to account because you knew and his answer 
would be ja, but you knew why I was sending them to you.  
You see, that is the importance of looking at it. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I do agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But on other instances what I said, now 
when you receive a barrage and a whole lot of things, 
other things you just delegate to – and you deal with what 
is important at that time for you.  But I suppose the 
question is since you read this thing why did you not pick 
20 
up a call and say in 2014 why did you send me this thing 
because it might be at that time that I just thought ag, it is 
one of those things that – one of those emails that come, 
one of the many but I do – that I did not do it, I did not call 
him. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 72 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, there are two separate 
issues, as you have correctly identified.  The first is why 
you did not call him to account in 2014.  Now you say well, 
you may have thought it is just one of those emails that 
come but it is not just one of those emails that come, it is 
an email that comes from a close friend of yours, not a 
member of the public that is sending you an unsolicited 
suggestion for an award of a contract by the City, it is a 
close friend that is doing that.  Do you ignore Mr 
10 
Makhubedu’s emails on a regular basis? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Even if you can ask him sometimes will – 
even then, even now, if you read my message, no, no, I 
have not read it.  Why?  I read it, why did you not reply?  
No, no, I will reply later.  I did not read it, I did not 
respond to him and I did not ask him. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But these are three emails that 
run from sometime in August to the 15 September on three 
different dates and you did not call him to account on one 
of them. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And he did not come back to 
you. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And say I have sent you 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 73 of 413 
 
successive emails on this, what are you doing?  Why are 
you…? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No.  No, I do not remember speaking 
about even this thing. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see, Mr Makhubo, I find that 
very, very implausible, that someone would send not the 
same email three times but three successive increasing 
emails.  The first one is the proposal, the second one is 
the invoice, the third one is the letter of award.  These are 
three different invoices with different purposes and your 
10 
version is that you did not respond to any of them. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, no, not at all because at least to my 
recollection, not at all because you probably would have 
found the email in the server had I responded but I did not 
respond because I cannot do anything about this. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, you may not have 
responded by email but you may have responded by acting 
on it.  
MR MAKHUBO:   By action? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, I mean …[intervenes] 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   But, I mean, Chairperson, with all due 
respect, what counsel is putting to me – and I am telling 
him my version.  He has got his version.  I do not know, I 
mean, it is a presupposition.  I do not – you gave me 
counsel that, you know, you would have expected a 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 74 of 413 
 
response like this and I duly agree that – as I said, I took 
counsel from you, but I did not. 
ADV MPHAGA SC:   Chairperson, just to add on my client’s 
response.  I think we just – Mr Chaskalson is just cross-
examining my client, I think he has already responded to 
the questions and I think we should just proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, obviously what Mr Chaskalson is 
doing is he wants to put a possible – maybe more than a 
possible position that comes to his mind for you to 
comment on it because it would be fair for you to comment 
10 
on it and, of course, you can comment on it or whatever.  
What he does not want to do is not to put that to you and 
maybe later on present an argument to me to say in the 
light of this and that that Mr Makhubo’s evidence, this is 
the finding that you should make.  So he is trying to be 
fair.  So I think let him repeat that.  I understand – but I 
think you will understand more because you are his 
counsel.  So it is more about being fair, to give you a 
chance to say if you want to say something to what he is 
going to put and you can say – you can dispute it or deny it  
20 
and say it is not correct or it has got no foundation if you 
think there is no foundation for the proposition but he just 
wants to make sure that he puts it and then you can 
respond.  You understand? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I do.  I thought I had already 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396

answered, he is just going over and over the same thing 
but I thought I had already replied to Mr Chaskalson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, because I am not sure that I had 
heard what it says, I think he must just [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let me put it this way, 
Chair.  I am going to submit that the most plausible reason 
why there would not have been any response to these 
emails in 2014 and there would not have been any attempt 
to engage Mr Makhubedu about these emails now in 2021 
10 
and last year in 2020, is that you knew exactly what Mr 
Makhubedu was asking of you and you were willing to 
provide what he asked of you. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I deny that and I think that it is a very, 
very wrong supposition. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I put it you have denied it.  Let 
us look at little bit further.  Let us go to page 785, bundle 
1, 785.  That is an email sent from Mr Makhubedu at his 
EOH address to his own Gmail address and it forwards an 
email from Ebrahim Laher of EOH to him and it says: 
20 
“Subject:  Forward EOH Confidential CoJ. 
Hi Patrick, in preparation for your meeting now with 
Geoff please see below for confirmation on the work 
being done by SAP.  Our qualms are these services 
are part of A472 that was awarded to us.  No formal 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 76 of 413 
 
tender process was done by the CoJ to award these 
projects to SAP.  Who signed these projects off in 
the City?  Trevor has indicated to Ashley he did not 
know about this.  SAP have now been there for 
about 
year. 
 
Where 
is 
this 
billing, 
etcetera, 
happening?” 
That is from Ebrahim Laher.  Now we have been unable to 
identify any Geoff other than yourself with whom Patrick 
Makhubedu dealt at the time.  Do you recall meeting with 
Patrick Makhubedu around September 2014 in relation to 
10 
work being done by SAP? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, I specifically do not recall 
the meeting with Pat around the work done by SAP but 
maybe on a round of golf we would have a conversation 
about there are pinpoints and send them to – let us say 
this thing, would sent them to say no, go and speak to the 
City Manager, go and speak to the Group Financial Officer, 
go to speak to whoever is responsible, the G2 and all that, 
hey man, we have not been paid and it is not – I receive  
those all the time, we have not been paid in eight months, 
20 
the SMMEs, so I – the specific – I do not even know what 
the 872 is, but the specifics of this, I do not recall but it 
might be that, you know, on a round of golf or something 
like that we spoke. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Or would you agree that if the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 77 of 413 
 
Geoff referred to is yourself then what this email shows is 
that EOH thought that they could talk to you about matters 
relating to tenders at the City. 
MR MAKHUBO:   If the Geoff is me? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If the Geoff is you. 
MR MAKHUBO:   If the Geoff is me I think they would have 
spoken to me about what they are doing in the City. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I want you to answer my 
question.  If the Geoff is you, does this email not reflect 
that EOH thought that they could talk to you about tenders 
10 
at the City? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, would I really have to 
comment on what EOH thought? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me put it this way.  Do you 
understand this email the way I do and I think the way Mr 
Chaskalson does that EOH thought that they could discuss 
tenders with Geoff, whoever that Geoff is. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I thought that what this would say is that 
please discuss with Geoff that we have got issues in the 
City and we are escalating these issues if we do have them 
20 
in the City because you are working there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   We get this over – from everyone, we 
have not been paid, you have not done this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 78 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   These are issues in the City of work that 
is happening in the City. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is how I understand how even 
service providers come in to introduce themselves and 
speak to us about what affects them all to talk about the 
work they do in the City. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So your understanding too 
was that this letter or email contemplated that there would 
be a discussion with Geoff whoever that Geoff was about 
10 
these matters. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, Chairperson, this email would 
contemplate that, like any other service provider that is in 
the space or any other space especially when it relates to 
things like billing or all that, which was a pinpoint at some 
point in the City.   You would from time to time discuss 
whatever with the accounting firm we hired to do the step 
change or an ICT firm that you hired to correct the 
interface between City Power [indistinct] and the City but 
we are discussing the actual what is the problem because 
20 
when these things blow up, they blow up to the politicians, 
they blow up to the officials, so that might be what this 
intention is internally to say if you are going to have a 
meeting with a client because we do meet on – from time to 
time, even now in this position we do meet people, formal 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 79 of 413 
 
meetings, can we come see you?  You know, we are 
working in the city, these are problems we face, we have 
got community issues.  So I am saying it is not abnormal 
that you talk about work that has been done in the City. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson, this may or may not 
have helped. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But that is not what they are 
discussing here.  What they are discussing here is that the 
10 
City is giving work to SAP that they say the City should be 
giving to EOH.  Let us read it: 
“Our qualms are these services are part of A472 
that was awarded to us.” 
Now A472 you will recognise is the number of a contract 
that the City awards, will you not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, they used to call – ja, A something, 
something, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right.  So they are saying these 
services were part of A472 the contract that was awarded 
20 
to us.  Then they say: 
“No formal tender process was done by the CoJ to 
award these projects to SAP.” 
Sp SAP is doing work which, according to them, was not 
governed by a formal process. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 80 of 413 
 
“Who signed these projects off in the City?” 
Who is responsible for letting SAP do these project?  That 
is what they are concerned about and that is what they 
want to speak to Geoff about. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But in this case, I mean, they even talk 
about Trevor because this would have gone to Trevor and 
say what happened here?  I mean, go and speak to Trevor. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no.  No, no, they have 
already spoken to Trevor because Trevor indicated that he 
did not know about it.  This is in preparation for a meeting 
10 
with Geoff. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja, they are talking about work done by 
somebody else that they want to do or that should have 
been done by them, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, that they think they should 
be allowed to do. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja, that should be – that they say it is 
part of their own tender. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But I would not even know the details 
20 
that appears. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No is this an appropriate thing to 
be speaking to you about? 
MR MAKHUBO:   About problems they have?  About 
problems they have inside the City, about the work that the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 81 of 413 
 
work that they would be doing? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, about the fact that they say 
these jobs that you are giving to SAP you should be giving 
to us because we say that A472 covers that work and we 
say that SAP did not go out to tender for that work. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, Chairperson, if service providers feel 
aggrieved about what is happening and they want to 
escalate to political leadership it is not about awarding of 
jobs to say look, we were awarded the BRT now somebody 
else is doing it, we want to come and – it is for those 
10 
things to happen, they feel aggrieved about something that 
is within their own contract and of course you will call the 
City to say look, City Manager, please sort this thing out 
be it looks like there is a contractual thing which is your 
domain but that bidder is aware.  Because the alternative 
of this is going to court.  I going to court to say we were 
awarded this and the alternative is to – so we look for 
other mechanisms to say can we escalate to the political 
principals failing which then we will challenge this thing 
legally.  It happens all the time. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But why would they go to you if 
you say IT did not fall within your portfolio?  
MR MAKHUBO:   I would not know but if it relates to 
billing, they know that my pinpoint was billing. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but it did not – it did not 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 82 of 413 
 
relate to billing, it related to IT. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well it relates to – I thought you said it 
relates to billing, to SAP. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It relates to SAP, yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, yes, I assume SAP, that is my worry 
to say what is happening if there is a dispute.  I would not 
- know - I would have thought that is what they are talking 
about, but IT was not with me, yes.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So what their complaint is, is 
that if you go down a page to 786, you will see six projects 
10 
that have been given to SAP.   The Human Resources 
upgrade, the Solution Manager Dependencies, Employee 
File Management, SAPS Strategic, Archiving and SLO’s 
service and they are saying those services should be 
provided by EOH not by SAP. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yeah, no, this sort of gone to, as it was 
about billing, this should have gone to ICT or the MMC for 
Corporate Services.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it should not have gone to 
Geoff. MR MAKHUBO:   No, if Geoff it is me. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Is there not another problem that 
even if it fell within your portfolio, the conversation should 
not 
be 
between 
someone 
who 
has 
been 
advancing 
hundreds of thousands of rands to keep your cash flow 
going in your CC and yourself, is that not a problem? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 83 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not think you are linking things that 
do not link, you are making links on things that do not have 
causality, our - his official position at EOH and my – our 
historical business relationships dating back to 2001, 2002 
have got no links what we are trying to put together, so I 
do not I do not see how all these things link Chairperson, 
with all due respect.   
 
Maybe when you say why would they be speaking to 
you that the question that is appropriate, but when you now 
linking things that do not link because you could have 
10 
easily used his relationship with me, if ever, I mean, he 
does not need to pay me to - we friends, we exchange 
things we, you know, exchange cars, our kids know each 
other. 
We have been friends before I even - 10 years 
before I even got into the city, so I do not see why, why 
these things are being made. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is correct that in the previous 
months, it is been advancing large amounts of money into 
your CC to stave off cash flow problems, is it not?  
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   I did say that, between xSolve and 
Molelwane sharing the same office, he was active on that 
floor between the people managing Molelwane at the time, 
then himself they would talk about problems of both 
companies and then he would assist.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 84 of 413 
 
This was not the first time it was happening 
between the two companies, you can go back to 2004, 
2005 and later on, I mean, the relationship between two 
companies and the two companies has been like that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, I know that, sir, but what 
has happened is in the previous month, very substantial 
amounts of money have been paid into your Molelwane CC 
account at the instance of Patrick Makhubedu in order to 
stable the cash flow crisis Molelwane has been suffering.  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, that happened but we are linking 
10 
what is happening in the city with what is happening 
outside, I am saying the two do not link.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I will show you later that 
EOH linked it very clearly, but do you – but before we get 
there, do you not agree that it is improper for someone 
who is advancing money to you in a private commercial 
capacity to be discussing business of the city with you in 
your official city capacity? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, Patrick Makhubedu is my 
friend and a business partner in two companies and I do 
20 
not find it strange that he would have asked me a question 
on one thing or the other if he did.  So what the SC is 
asking here is that I am finding it strange that Patrick 
would ask me about something that relates to EOH, 
meanwhile we do have other relationships, I am finding it 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 85 of 413 
 
strange.   
I am not even sure whether people do limit what 
they talk about when they come together but certainly if 
ever he says that was one thing or the other I cannot say 
no, not now make a meeting in the office.  No, I do not find 
it strange.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   My question was not strange my 
question was improper, do you are not find it improper that 
someone who is advancing large amounts of money to you 
in your personal commercial capacity might be asking you 
10 
to assist him in your official city capacity? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Patrick Makhubedu advanced money to 
me around consulting, that he worked together with xSolve 
have been helping each other for a long time.  This thing 
have got no relationship with the question that you are 
asking me about the city.  
So if we ask for help from Patrick, whether in 
whatever capacity, then you say, Patrick, this is me, your 
friend or Obakeng and others who are managing Molelwane 
at that time are saying, we need cash flow and Dadi 
20 
Makhubedu it is not been happening.  I do not find it 
improper 
that 
it 
is 
happening 
there, 
so 
having 
a 
conversation with Patrick, you say the type of conversation 
we are having, because they said he must have a 
conversation with me.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 86 of 413 
 
And another thing is I am not even sure whether the 
conversation happened, but I do not find it improper, sir.  I 
think you are making links, things, links on things that do 
not link. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, I want to put it to you that 
it is improper, but I think you have given me your answer, I 
am not sure we can take it any further.  If we are talking 
about the impropriety, I want to take you to just some 
further documents.  Let us go to page 621 and you will 
recall…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is on Bundle 1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 1, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   621? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   621, you will recall that on the 
18 t h of September, EOH were telling Patrick what he 
needed to discuss with Geoff.  Well, let us see what 
happened on the 19 t h of September.  Do you see halfway 
down 
the 
page 
an 
email 
from 
yourself 
to 
Patrick 
Makhubedu: 
“Dear Patrick, 
20 
Find a letter of funding request towards our regional 
conference expenses.  
Regards, 
Geoff Makhubo.” 
Do you see that?  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 87 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you recall sending that 
email? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I must have because it was it was the 
time of our regional conference. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go down to page 622, 
Bundle 1 and 623, you will see the letter that sets out the 
details of this request. 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is correct.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you will see it is addressed 
10 
to Ebrahim Laher at EOH. 
MR MAKHUBO:   It was addressed to Patrick. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, sorry, it is addressed to 
Patrick, CC Ebrahim Laher at EOH 19 September 2014 and 
you set out what your expenses will be and you conclude, 
at the foot of 622: 
“The Regional Executive Committee will appreciate 
contribution of at least R2.5million to ensure a 
successful conference.” 
And then you give your bank details or the bank details of 
20 
the ANC greater Johannesburg branch region.  You say: 
“Your support is highly appreciated and we thank 
you 
in 
advance 
for 
your 
commitment 
and 
contribution towards strengthening democracy.” 
That is the day after EOH are talking about a meeting of 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 88 of 413 
 
Pat and Geoff to sort out EOH’s problems at the city.  Do 
you recall sending this request for R2.5million donation 
from EOH to the ANC?  
MR MAKHUBO:   It was during the time of the conference, 
yes, I fundraised from a lot of people, yes EOH was one of 
them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go down to page 625, 
you will see that EOH responded to your request, possibly 
not as generously as you had hoped, but still quite 
generously.  If you go to page 65, you see proof of 
10 
payment on the 2 n d of October of R1.5million from TSS 
Managed Services, which is the EOH subsidiary to the 
ANC, greater Johannesburg. 
And you will see also if you go up to 624, that 
Patrick Makhubedu emailed you this proof of payment on 2 
October. Could you confirm that you received this proof of 
payment from Patrick Makhubedu on 2 October?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, the money did go into our bank 
account.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But - and this email from Patrick 
20 
Makhubo was sent to you on 2 October with proof of 
payment? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I did not check the email but I know 
that the money came into it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 89 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you have said Patrick Makhubo. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ah, Patrick Makhubedu, I 
apologise. Can I – I have gone forward to 2 October but let 
us see something else that happened on 20 September, if 
you can go to page 296, Bundle 1 and you will see at page 
296, that a payment is made by TSS to Molelwane on the 
20 t h of September in the amount of R570 000.  You see 
that?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do you know what that 
10 
payment was for?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, it was relating to the old contract of 
CCMA.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, the old contract of the 
CCMA? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What was that contract? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It was between TSS Managed Services 
and Molelwane Holdings for the work that was done at 
CCMA. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What was that work?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Sorry? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What was that work?  
MR MAKHUBO:   That should have to do with Voib[?] and 
another things at the CCMA, and also random agreement 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 90 of 413 
 
that that was entered into in 2009, I think 2010. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this is a payment made in 
2014, on that payment, you say?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, at some point the payment stopped.  
I remember even much later we had a meeting with Jehan 
to say, but, you know, we need a full and final settlement 
because things have not been paid as they should have 
been much later than this, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that just happens around 
the same time in September 2014 where these other two 
10 
contractual processes in the city, have been going on that 
we have been discussing. 
MR MAKHUBO:   TSS Holdings, TSS Managed Services 
and Molelwane Holdings had an agreement and they owed 
Molelwane some money. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   When do you say that debt 
originated? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It was originating because they were 
billing on a monthly basis as far as the agreement and 
record and understand, and at some point, the payment 
20 
stopped and I do not think there was active follow up and 
then we - there was a follow up, it originated previously. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But when and when did it start? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot recall the date, the contract 
started around 2009, 2010. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 91 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And how long was that contract 
around?  
MR MAKHUBO:   It was supposed to run for five years. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the payments, but the 
payments would have stopped when do you think? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well the payments if they were kept up 
they would have stopped when the contract stopped. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but when did they stop 
being kept up? When did this amount of R570 000 start 
accumulating?  
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot hear you, sorry? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ultimately an amount of R570 
000 was paid in September 2014, as you say that is an 
accumulated arrears.  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I think at that point that would have 
been about a million or so if I remember well. But they 
themselves were trying to get some final payments and, 
and all that if I do remember well, but this was related to 
CCMA.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No I understand it is related to 
20 
the CCMA I am trying to work out how long those areas had 
been building up. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot tell you now. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well you say it was about a 
million you say the areas were? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 92 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what was the monthly 
payment? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Shu, monthly payments would have been 
about 60 or 70 000, somewhere there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So for - to get from 60 to 70 000 
to a million you are looking at a well over a year are you 
not. 
MR MAKHUBO:    Something around that, yeah. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we are talking about arrears 
10 
that on your version have been there for over a year, but 
are settled on the 19 t h of September 2014? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I do not think they were settled at 
that time, if I remember well, to my recollection, but there 
was a toing and froing and a whole lot of things and I think 
the meetings with Jehan Mackay would have attested to 
that they were owing us and there would have been those 
conversations. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I see, this did not settle the 
areas it part paid the areas you are saying.  
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   As far as I remember, yes and I said I 
raised about a million I do not think it was the full amount 
because at some point I do not remember the date well, 
but it was much later than this where we said, look, we 
need full and final settlement so that Molelwane can walk 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 93 of 413 
 
away because then it is one down. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see, but after not paying for 
over a year EOH paid for the first time in September 2014? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, to TSS paid in 2014, yeah. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is within a month of 
sending you three letters asking you to act improperly in 
relation to the ICT services and sorry, infrastructure and 
support contract and the day after they were expecting 
Patrick Makhubedu to meet with Geoff to discuss EOH 
getting back work that apparently had been given to SAP.  
10 
Can you comment on that chronology? 
MR MAKHUBO:   The first chronology I think we have 
canvassed quite extensively, the talking to Geoff, I think 
we have been extensively again canvassed.  I cannot 
comment on what the date but we needed our money at 
least Obakeng told me that we needed our money at that 
time, yeah. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Alright, I am now going to move 
onto the 2016 tender, we will still be in Bundle 1 but the 
starting point is for this section of the questioning is 
20 
November 2015 when a tender invitation is put out by the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
for 
the 
SAP 
upgrade 
and 
implementation tender, we have heard evidence that that 
invitation went out in November 2015.  Can I take you to 
page 480 of Bundle 1.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 94 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   I am there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And at the top of 480 you see an 
email from Nyiko Mutileni of EOH to Jehan Mackay, do you 
know Mr Mutileni? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it says: 
“For 
your 
information 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
outsourced 
tender 
is 
out, 
I 
prepare 
all 
team 
members to attend to it.  I have also notified Mr 
Makhubedu because of Geoff's influence, thank you. 
10 
So once again, Mr Makhubedu is being asked to get 
involved because Geoff has influence.  You know of any 
other Geoff’s who might have had influence over City of 
Johannesburg tender at the time? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not know of any Geoff who had an 
influence - I do not know of any Geoff that would have had 
an influence on any tender. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you know of any Geoff's 
other than yourself to whom Mr Makhubedu is close? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I only know myself but I would not have 
20 
an influence on any tender. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will get to that, can I then 
take you to page 451.  This is again an internal EOH email 
in relation to this tender it starts at the top then going 
down for an email from Ebrahim Laher to an EOH team and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 95 of 413 
 
it says: 
“I need this properly mobilised for this, no half-
hearted efforts and internal politics please.  This is 
life and death of SAP services.” 
And below, there is an email from Ebrahim Laher to Asher 
Bohbot copied to Patrick Makhubedu and it says: 
“COJ support contract going out for tender.” 
And it says: 
“COJ are proceeding with the advertising of our 
current contract this week.” 
10 
So this was a contract that EOH held. 
“This despite their assurance that they would rather 
extend our contract.” 
Were you aware that EOH had been assured by people and 
the city, that the city would prefer to extend its contract in 
relation to SAP support? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, not at all, I am one of those who do 
not like irregular expenditure.  So I would have thought 
that if something must go to tenders – so I do not know 
who would have assured them for extension. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see, and then on it goes and 
then at the end it says: 
“Anyway, I suspect the next quarter is going to be a 
political minefield, we need to be proactive and 
ready for what is coming, we cannot lose this.” 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 96 of 413 
 
Says Mr Laher.  Then, if one goes down to 487, we are still 
dealing with the same contract and Jehan Mackay writes to 
his team including Patrick Makhubedu on 2 December, he 
says: 
“Please can we ensure in our bids to COJ we 
commit a certain percentage of work and revenue 
we allocated to the Josie at work program.  We 
need to provide more or less an estimate of how 
many SME’s, this allocation will benefit, number of 
jobs created from our meeting last night this part is 
10 
very critical.” 
Then two paragraphs down: 
“EB/Pat, we need a number urgently that can be 
allocated for goodwill to the organisation.” 
And then there is a sort of smiley face after goodwill. 
“A number that can be allocated for goodwill to the 
organisation.” 
Do you know any organisation in respect of which goodwill 
payments might assist a City of Johannesburg tender? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I would not know what Jehan was writing 
20 
here.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, lower down there is a 
forwarded email from 1 December 2015 and that email may 
well be illegible on your copy or very difficult to read.  So I 
am going to read it out.  It says: 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 97 of 413 
 
“On 1 December 2015 at 8:21am, Ebrahim Laher 
wrote, Hi guys. 
Quick update on the consortium talks for the bid.  
Deloitte have pulled out of the bid.  They think they 
will get the TMO, Trevor has apparently assured 
them.  I have asked Ashley to contact KPMG as per 
Pat's conversation with Geoff, HDS wants to pull 
out according to curtain.” 
Now, did you have a conversation with Patrick Makhubedu 
in relation to putting EOH in contact with KPMG? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I have not seen this email and I 
cannot recall that, I know that KPMG was - had been 
appointed earlier on to help us with what we call a revenue 
step change and to deal with the issues of billing and 
revenue and cleaning up data and all that, so I would not - 
I would not have - I mean, I would not - I did not see this 
email so I would not have thought and thought it through, 
to link it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But the question is, did you have 
a conversation with Patrick Makhubedu suggesting that 
20 
EOH contacted KPMG?  
MR MAKHUBO:   I do not recall that conversation. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You do not recall that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Are you denying it or are you 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 98 of 413 
 
just saying you cannot recall? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot recall the conversation, I had 
many conversations, so I cannot recall this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson I think it would be helpful 
if you would have the content of that email, the one that is 
illegible on our bundle if it could be typed out from where 
you read it, because it obviously is legible.  Where you - if 
it could be typed out or something so that a note can be 
made to say this is what that email that is illegible is 
supposed to read.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I will attend to that Chair, we 
can hopefully get that done at the lunch adjournment 
because I have the text ready to cut and paste. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay because on mine it is 
completely illegible. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, Mr Makhubedu we have 
heard evidence that the closing date of the bid for this 
tender was 14 December 2015.  I want to take you to 1 
20 
February 2016 and for that, I want you to go to Bundle 3, 
page 646, Bundle 3, 646 and at this stage there still had 
not been any award of the tender.   
But if you go to 1 February, you will see that on the 
1 s t of February, a payment of R200 000 was made with the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 99 of 413 
 
reference 
P 
Makhubedu, 
Mfundi 
into 
the 
Molelwane 
accounts and that took the balance of the Molelwane 
account from R63, 19 to R200 063,19.  Do you see that?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this, again, is one of these 
cash flow payments, I assume that Mr Makhubedu arranged 
for Molelwane.  Now certainly the cash flow was much 
more acute at that stage, and it have ever been the 
account was down to R63,00.  Do you see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, yes I do. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now without that payment, there 
would have been no money to pay the R10 000 to the Absa 
credit card and the account numbers there given on the 2 n d 
of February whose Absa credit card is that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I can check but I think it was mine, but I 
will have to verify it.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, put it this way if it is not 
yours, please come back and let us know.  If you do not 
come back to us, we will assume it is yours.  Then there is 
another payment on the same day of R30 000 to Geoff 
20 
standard.  I assume that was a payment of R30 000 into 
your Standard Bank account.  Is that correct?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there is a payment on that 
day of 30 000, Nono, FNB.  Do you know who Nono is? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 100 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is my wife, yeah.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, that is? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is my wife. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is your wife? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there is a payment of 10 
000 called credit card payment.  Do you know whose credit 
card was paid with that 10 000? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, I must just check as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, will you come back to us 
10 
on that and just confirm if it was yours or not.  Then there 
is a 26 000 payment, 296 to that same Liberty Life premium 
that we have heard earlier, which was in respect of a 
policy, of which at least you and your mother were 
beneficiaries. Is that correct?  
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, and others yeah. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then there are two payments 
on the 4 t h of February to the Palazzo Monte, and I presume 
that is Monte casino, that is a hotel and casino and those 
two payments of 3 881 and 18,255 aggregate to just over 
20 
22 000.  Do you know what those payments were for? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot recall. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you do not know who ran up 
this bill of 22 000 at the Palazzo Monte casino and made 
that purchase on a cheque card? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 101 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   No I cannot recall what they were for. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You cannot recall that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see the details of the 
cheque card are mentioned on the account.  It says 485442 
and then a couple digits missing, and 5778.  Would you be 
able to establish whose cheque card that was?  
MR MAKHUBO:   I suspect is Molelwane card but I cannot 
recall what was happening at Monte. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see. Now, none of these 
10 
payments would have been possible without the 200 000 
payment made through Mfundi at the instance of Mr 
Makhubedu.  Do you accept that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, you do.  So we have just 
looked at payments into Molelwane on the 1 s t of February 
and payments that were made out of Molelwane on the 2 n d 
of February and let us then go to page 488 to see what 
happens on the 3 r d of February and in the – Bundle 1, page 
488.  
20 
In the middle of the page, you see an email from 
Ebrahim Laher…[intervene] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Sorry, Bundle 1? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 1, Bundle 1, sorry. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 102 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, in the middle of that page, 
you see an email from Ebrahim Laher of EOH to a large 
number of EOH employees and it says: 
“Hi, guys,  
I have been running around like crazy and have not 
had time to debrief you on all the key things I have 
been involved in that I need to share with you.  
COJ, I am very concerned about the city allowing 
people to re-price seems to be a way to catch us 
out on scope.  We need to be careful here, actions, 
10 
I will meet with Geoff.” 
Did Mr Laher meet with you in February 2016? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot remember the date but I did 
have 
lunch 
with 
Ebrahim 
sometime 
in 
2016 
at 
my 
insistence to ask for money for elections, per say. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But the elections were later in 
the year were they not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, we were preparing for research for - 
because they have to do research earlier, around February, 
March, April. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see; you do not recall meeting 
with him in February 2016? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No I do not remember the date but we did 
meet at my insistence, though, to discuss the issues – I 
might say he did raise that his got issues in the city and I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 103 of 413 
 
said look, that is the issues that you need to discuss with 
the city manager. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see, what is it do you 
recall…[intervene] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Sorry, he plans to meet a whole lot of 
people not me only, my and others -  I do not know who 
else, this thing is not clear.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, the names that I see are 
Dada, Mike and Mike, and Dumisani.  Do you know who 
Dada might be and Mike and Dumisani? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think Dumisani says COT, it is not COJ. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ah, yes you are absolutely right. 
I am sorry, so in COJ, it is Dada and Mike. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Do you know who Dada and Mike 
might be in the City of Johannesburg? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well there is a couple of Mikes, there 
was Mike working in the revenue department but was he 
support services, I am not sure whether they referring to 
him and I am not sure which Dada is this, the only Dada 
20 
that I know is the regional secretary of the ANC.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see and can you give surnames 
for the two, the Mike that you mentioned and the Dada that 
you – is the regional secretary of the ANC? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Come again? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 104 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Dada who is the regional 
secretary of the ANC, what is his surname?  
MR MAKHUBO:   It is Dada Marrero, but I am not sure 
what it has to do with COJ because he is not in the city, he 
does not work for the city.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, I understand that but EOH 
seem to, as we will see later seem to regard the ANC as 
controlling decisions within the city, and Mike? 
MR MAKHUBO:   If it is the Mike, the Mike that was 
working in finances, Mike Dube.  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mike? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Mike Dube. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Dube? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think so because I am not too sure of 
any other Mike’s that I would know. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see, so his going to meet with 
Dada and the only one you knows is involved in the 
regional ANC.  Mike, the only one you can think of is in 
COJ finance and Geoff.  You said he tried to raise issues 
with you in relation to the city, do you recall what issues it 
20 
was, they were?  
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot remember specifics but two 
things. One, broadly, one was to do with their support 
contract, issues of payments and all that and I think two, 
he was talking about the issues of the upgrade, the tender 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 105 of 413 
 
upgrade, and I said, look, we cannot be talking about that 
this thing is out and it is on tender.  So you cannot be 
talking about it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So it is this tender, the SAP 
services upgrade that he tried to engage you on, and you 
said no…[intervene] 
MR MAKHUBO:   About these issues that he raises here 
about re-pricing, other people are allowed to re-price and I 
said look is not my forte and that is it, I am here to see you 
because I need money for elections.  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right, but did you not say to 
him, this is totally irregular, why I am a political leader of 
the city you should not be engaging with me about these 
things.  
MR MAKHUBO:   I said these issues are best referred to 
by the officials, the accounting officer who is ultimately 
responsible for supply chain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your meeting with him, did you say when 
it would have been in relation to February, March or are 
you not able to say? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, it is around - if I remember 
well it is around March, because we were wanting to – we 
wanted 
money 
for 
research, 
elections 
research 
and 
normally, we do a dipstick around, if elections are around 
August we do a dipstick around March, April, you know, to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 106 of 413 
 
gage the mood, and I think all political parties to do 
research, what are the issues, what we should respond to, 
so it should have been about around that time, I cannot 
remember the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine.  I am just trying to 
think what the chances are that the Geoff he is referring to 
would be you just bearing in mind that he talks about the 
need to meet Geoff, if it so happens, maybe that you also 
need to see him around about that time.  What - have you 
got any sense what the chances are he may have been 
10 
referring to you irrespective of whether he was justified or 
it was improper for him to want to discuss those matters 
with you? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I mean; I can only assume I do not - 
these are internal emails.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MAKHUBO:   I mean, I - people are talking about me, 
you know, I can call them named droppers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   People are dropping names all over 
20 
which 
is 
happening, 
but 
I 
remember 
in 
2016 
that 
specifically…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You met with him. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Which is not far back, specifically, I 
needed to see them for substantial amount of fundraising 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 107 of 413 
 
but initially I needed money for research.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Makhubo, can I clarify 
that 
this 
tender 
the 
SAP 
upgrade 
tender 
was 
that 
something relating to billing that would have fallen within 
your – or under your oversight? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think it is much more broader, yes ISU, 
the ISU portion would have been under ourselves, but HR 
and finance, finance would have been under supply chain 
but broadly it could have been run both by business and 
10 
ICT, which is somewhere else. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, the actual running of the 
tender bid but oversight of the contracts that are ultimately 
awarded, at least part of it is falling under your finance 
jurisdiction, is that not so? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well the total contract would have been 
under ICT, but the operations of the actual module would 
have been under, ourselves whether it works or not. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, the operations of? 
MR MAKHUBO:   The module, the module that, the billing 
20 
module. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see, so there are many 
modules. 
MR MAKHUBO:   There are different modules, so there will 
be all over the modules.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 108 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I understand the billing module 
would have been under your oversight in its operation, the 
award of the contract would have been a matter for ICT 
administration – the administration of the city in ICT. 
MR MAKHUBO:   It will be ICT, and the city manager and 
the Group CFO. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, thank you.  Can we then 
in this chronology, we have gone from February maybe 
March let us go to April, Bundle 3, page 652. Bundle 3, and 
it is 652 and I emphasise that the tender is still not been 
10 
awarded at this stage.   
And there you see again a payment of 50,000 on 
the 25 t h of April from Patrick Makhubedu and it comes in 
with a balance of R617 in the account that takes that 
balance from 617 to 50 617.  Is this another one of these 
cash flow payments? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I would have to check at this time 
because, yes it is, because there are some things that are 
coming out of here.  But when we do a recon on what he 
owed me from the xSolve exit I will have to see that this 
20 
was not part of it but yeah, this is – I will have to, in 2016 I 
will have to check. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, the - I did not get your 
last comment…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think his answer is yes, he thinks it 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 109 of 413 
 
might be one of those cash flow payments but he would 
like to double check to make sure because it could be 
something else. 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, when I said that in - we did agree 
when we left xSolve that whatever value there is there he 
himself because his the sole owner at that point.  We came 
up with a figure that he will pay me overtime because of 
the cash flow.   
But I am just figuring out that if this is not one of 
those that he put in here because I can see the things that 
10 
come out of here are less for Molelwane but more for me 
that use to come out, me and other people that use to 
come out of here and but as we speak he still has not paid 
me in full but that is that is not for the Commission.   
But this is the – I would rather go and double check 
this I did not go through every payment to say this one's 
cash flow because the people are already gone at that 
point, the Chairperson, the staff in the main has already 
been retrenched, severance pay, severance packages 
already paid at Molelwane and the factor Molelwane was 
20 
winding down at that point.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So by April Molelwane is winding 
down it no longer has employees, you say? 
MR MAKHUBO:   It no longer has employees, yes active 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 110 of 413 
 
employees, yeah.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   April 2016, can we…[intervene] 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think that, sorry, I think that happened 
earlier than 2016.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It may even be earlier. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Sorry? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It may even have been earlier. 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is earlier, the winding down happened 
earlier, the retrenchments happened earlier. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   How early maybe 2015? 
MR MAKHUBO:   2015, around, 2015 around late 2014, 
2015 I mean, I think there are letters somewhere I just 
cannot remember the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if we go to back to Bundle 
1 and page 194. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are at one Mr Chaskalson.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, this is as good a time as 
any to take a break, thank you.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you say we can adjourn we do 
not have to…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, Chair that is convenient.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take the lunch adjournment 
and we will resume at two o'clock.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 111 of 413 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us proceed. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair before the 
adjournment we were going through the chronology of events 
around the time of that SAPS support contract in 2016 and 
we had in a payment – we had gone up to a payment of 
R30 000.00 into Molelwane on 25 April 2016.  I now want to 
go to 30 April 2016 and Mr Makhubo can you turn to Bundle 
10 
1 page 194.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 1. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  194 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  194.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There you will see an invoice from 
– it says Molelwane Holdings Pty Limited but in fact the bank 
account details at the foot of the page are Molelwane 
Consultings bank account details.  It is an invoice to TSS for 
R500 000.00 ostensibly in respect of professional services – 
20 
LAN and WAN.  Mr Makhubo do you know what work was 
done to justify this invoice? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Again anything that had to do with TSS as 
far as I can recall the full and final settlement around the 
local area network and the world area network is the CMA as 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 112 of 413 
 
this was connected to that when I looked at it.  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So – so what you say is that this 
was a full and final settlement payment in relation to the 
CCMA work? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But the invoice was issued – the 
invoice does not say that. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes the invoice – the invoice basically was 
– was as per the normal.  I mean you can look at even the 
address it is not our address at Braamfontein but this was a 
10 
– I know this was the full and final settlement.  I did check. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that is – that is what you 
understand. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It to be.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
am 
sorry 
please 
remind 
me 
the 
settlements arose out of what?  I think you dealt with it 
earlier but I just want to connect it with what you are saying 
now. 
MR MAKHUBO:  An earlier point that was canvassed around 
20 
2014 that there were – the invoice is not paid at that time 
and it was –  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was  - did not paid Molelewane? 
MR MAKHUBO:  To Molelwane ja Molelwane Holdings but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Molelwane Holdings or Molelwane 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 113 of 413 
 
Consultings. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Consulting ja.  Yes, yes the others have 
been paid before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By – by TSS or by somebody else? 
MR MAKHUBO:  By TSS Holdings – by TSS Managed 
Services yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes okay. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you referred to the CCMA was that – 
that was not the normal CCMA. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  That was a client.  That was a client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the normal CCMA that we know or is it 
somebody else? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no that was a client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The commission. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The commission yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For conciliation. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So were you both engaged by 
the CCMA that is TSS and Molelwane? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no what happened  was there were 
services on the Memorandum of Agreement in 2009/2010 
that when TSS tendered for VOIP which is Voice Over IP 
LAN and WAN then Molelwane then plugged into Supply 
Chain Management Services and others at that point. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 114 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the CCMA had given that contract or 
that work to. 
MR MAKHUBO:  To TSS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  TSS only. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes.  Yes TSS Managed Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then TSS had an arrangement with 
Molelwane. 
MR MAKHUBO:  In 2009 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To assist it in regard to some aspects. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore Molelwane was owed not by 
the CCMA. 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no by TSS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But by TSS certain amounts. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For work that it had done. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the instance of TSS. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  At the instance of TSS yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But this is work that would have 
been a long long time ago, is that not right? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That would have been work that had 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 115 of 413 
 
continued until the end of the contract. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but when we – when we dealt 
with the 2014 payment and you said this was part payment of 
the arrears. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You said that that was about – the 
arrears were around a million and that was half a million and 
that was in 2014 and you accepted that those arrears had 
already been there for about a year in 2014.  Is that not 
correct? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So this would be payment in 
respect of arrears that had been there for about a year 
before 2014 – say 2013? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes and continuing yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But it could not have continued for 
– it could not have continued beyond the point at which 
Molelewane stopped having staff surely? 
MR MAKHUBO:  It could not have continued to the extent 
that people who have worked on it – because remember 
20 
some of these things we would use sub-contractors and all 
that.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am just saying that most contracts that we 
would get if we do not have people on the bench and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 116 of 413 
 
companies do that you use sub-contractors and all that but 
this was full and final settlement of the – of the figure as far 
as I remember. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes – yes but I want to – I want to 
pin down when the work that you think was done was done.  
Are you suggesting that it would have been done after 2013? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No.  I – I would not have the exact date but 
I know that work continued to be done.  I mean I can – we 
can find out if we need a submission from working and 
others. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You see and you talk about paying 
sub-contractors I do not see any evidence in the bank 
statements of Molelwane Consulting of payments to sub-
contractors to IT sub-contractors in those bank statements.  
Maybe you can find them for me but I do not see any. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I – I – all I am saying is that some work 
would have been done through sub-contractors and this one 
– this – what I say – ACCsolve people who worked – worked 
there then we paid ACCsolve but this one was full and final 
settlement as far as I know. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes if you say full and final 
settlement when I earlier asked you about arrears and what 
was outstanding you said that the R500 000.00 paid in 2014 
was about half of what was owed. Is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 117 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You recall that.  Now this would 
seem to be the other half of what was owed if your 
recollection is correct. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct and probably more but that 
is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But a million was owed in 2014 
and we agreed that that was in respect of services that 
would have been at least a year old then, you recall that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  As I said that the payments were about 60 a 
month or so.  I do not have – I know the contract was to end 
10 
around 2015 or so. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right but at 60 a month you need 
to run for a year to build up … 
MR MAKHUBO:  More than – ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Ja.  For more than a year to build 
up the money. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja, ja so the calculation would have been 
look if is more this is full and final settlement yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But what I am saying to you is I 
have looked through the accounts of Molelwane and you do 
20 
not see ongoing payments from TSS to Molelwane from 2014 
through to 2016 that would reflect ongoing payments of 
current liabilities beyond the one or two odd payments that 
we have discussed together. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 118 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So if the arrears were a million in 
2024 and half were paid off in 2014 in respect of – in respect 
of services that were already a year old in 2014 you cannot 
have a final payment of R500 000.00 to settle those areas in 
2016 if ongoing services have continued to be provided. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The way I understood it from – as I have 
got the explanation from the guys who were manning at MC 
was that when we negotiated to say look we are small but 
can we get a full and final settlement to shut this thing down 
and that is it. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I – I see but you – you – that was 
a process that was also trying to be done in 2014 was it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No.  2014 was not full and final settlement 
no. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No I know it was not but when we 
discussed it if I recall your evidence correctly that was what 
was being looked for in 2014 or not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Was a payment of arrears in 2014 to say 
you owe us please pay us.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but you – I recall your 
20 
evidence to be in 2014 that they paid about half of the 
arrears. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So there were a million arrears … 
MR MAKHUBO:  I said about… 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 119 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Approximately … 
MR MAKHUBO:  Approximately does not mean that is a 
million rands yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So there were approximately a 
million arrears in 2014 which we agreed would have had to 
have been building up from at least 2013 or before. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And half of that was – was paid off 
in 2014 just around the time of those other contract between 
the City and EOH that we were talking about. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is around the time when we – we went 
to Jehan and said look there is an amount outstanding. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes, yes but – but we have dealt 
with it in the chronology of the payments – of the City 
relationship with EOH as well. 
MR MAKHUBO:  And I said … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Are you saying the two are 
unrelated. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The two are unrelated yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well now in 2016 we see another 
20 
payment of half a million and it just so happens to come also 
at a time when EOH has a ending bid out with the City for a 
SAPS support contract which they have said is a matter of 
life and death for them. 
MR MAKHUBO:  It was for them but for me TSS – TSS was 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 120 of 413 
 
owing us. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well let – can I take you to how 
TSS explained this payment.  If you go to the very next page 
which is 194.1 – sorry not TSS – EOH.  I beg your pardon it 
is 194.1 and – do you have 194.1? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now do you see there an internal 
EOH email about the Molelwane invoice and at the bottom of 
the page is a payment authorisation.  You see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And it is payment authorisation of 
this invoice of 30 April 2016 and it is – the payment was 
dated 20 – the authorisation was dated 26 May 2016.  
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then you see an email chain.  
If you go up from the payment authorisation there is a query 
about you know what is this for?  And then if go up further 
you get the answer. 
“It is ED for City of Johannesburg Enterprise 
Development for City of Johannesburg.  It 
20 
was budgeted for in the financial year 2016 
numbers.  I asked Rene for a schedule  of 
the – of ED payments budgeted when we 
compiled the budgets then if the amount is in 
the budget I do not ask further questions.” 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 121 of 413 
 
You see that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I read this and I thought look this cannot be 
– I do not even know who Peter Wayne is. All I know is that 
TSS was doing business with us at CCMA. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well what this reflects is that EOH 
whatever 
Molelwane 
thought 
EOH 
provided 
for 
this 
Molelwane payment of half a million plus VAT is what they 
call Enterprise Development for the City of Johannesburg.  
They linked it directly to the City of Johannesburg. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I would be interested to hear how they do 
10 
that – how they did that because the negotiations with Jehan 
Mackay was exactly this.  You owe us money for CCMA. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes well internally they regarded it 
as a payment linked to this City of Johannesburg that is what 
this email shows. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I – I – as I have said Chairperson I would 
be very, very interested to hear why would they have do 
something like this. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yeah I know – we may get there we 
may not but you will accept that what this reflects is inside 
20 
EOH they saw this payment as linked to the City of 
Johannesburg. 
MR MAKHUBO:  This is the email I see and we say – even 
inside EOH I mean I – they must corroborate this I do not 
know why they would have done this.  Now all I know is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 122 of 413 
 
exactly what I have said to you before. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well let us explore why they may 
have done it.  Was Molelwane working on any City of 
Johannesburg contracts with EOH? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No so it could not have been for 
that reason. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So I want to put it to you that the 
only plausible reason that they would have done it is that 
10 
they thought by paying money to your close corporation they 
were buying influence in relation to City of Johannesburg 
contracts. 
MR MAKHUBO:  TSS. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is what they thought. 
MR MAKHUBO:  TSS Managed Services owed Molelwane 
Consulting money for the contract that existed prior to the – 
getting to the City.  What they thought I would not know but 
all I know and I can tell you that I had a conversation that 
time with the leader of TSS to say you owe us please pay us. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see so when did you have that 
conversation? 
MR MAKHUBO:  The time when we – we started saying look 
you have not been paying us in 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  2014. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 123 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is when we started the conversation 
but it did not stop there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So you had a – you had a 
conversation – sorry who was the leader of TSS that you had 
this conversation with? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Jehan 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Jehan.  So you had a conversation 
with Jehan saying you must pay me money – or you must pay 
10 
Molelwane money that you owe Molelwane. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you had this conversation at 
the same time as EOH had a tender pending before the City 
of Johannesburg in this case the tender was I think for R400 
million plus.  Is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  The tender had nothing to do … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no I – just answer my 
question.  You had this conversation at a time when they – 
when the tender for R400 million plus was pending. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  My conversation with Jehan Mackay had 
nothing to do with the tender. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No I am asking about time.  You 
can – you can – you have made clear that you are saying 
that it had nothing to do with it.  I am asking timing.  Was 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 124 of 413 
 
this conversation at a time when that tender for R400 million 
was pending? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I had a conversation with Jehan Mackay on 
00:16:27. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  When I had that conversation regarding this 
payment to Molelwane.  What was happening in the City was 
none of – was not – I was not concerned about it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let – let us put a date on it.  An 
approximate date on it.  Are we talking about the first quarter 
10 
of – first half of 2016? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I had that around that time – same time that 
I said I had a conversation with Ibrahim to ask for money 
exactly the same time ja – around the same time. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
I 
see 
so 
– 
so 
now 
that 
conversation with Ibrahim Lehar if I understood was in 
relation to soliciting donations for the ANC. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So at the same time as you are 
soliciting donations for the ANC you also asking TSS to pay 
20 
Molelwane amounts that you say are owed from TSS to 
Molelwane. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am demanding money from TSS that is 
owed. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  Is there any written demand 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 125 of 413 
 
that you made to TSS? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no I just had a conversation. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  Why would you not put a 
demand like this into writing if it is a legal demand? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is how we operated – hey man you 
owe me please pay me.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Never been a legal thing. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  And all of this is happening 
in a period when the City is adjudicating a tender that is a 
10 
matter of life and death for EOH on their own version. 
MR MAKHUBO:  On their version and from what you say yes 
but as I say I am not talking about the tender I am talking 
about soliciting funds for the ANC not even soliciting asking 
for donations and asking for the money that is owed. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  Well let us go back to the 
ANC again.  Can I take you to page 499 of Bundle 1 – 499.  
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I am there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And there we see that on 19 May a 
letter is written from the office of the Regional Treasurer and 
20 
if you go down a page or two you will see that it is signed by 
you on – at the foot of page 500 – if you go down to 500 just 
to confirm that is your signature on it. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And this is a request addressed to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 126 of 413 
 
the CEO of EOH Mr Bohbot. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It was copied to Mr Mackay, Mr 
Lehar and to Mr Makhubedu.  It says: 
“Dear Mr Bohbot we would like to thank you 
for the continued support your company has 
been giving to the African National Congress 
in the past.  Support ensured that our 
activities become successful ANC in Greater 
Johannesburg region is preparing for the 
10 
2016 elections.  Part of the process the 
region is finalising the process of nominating 
its 
candidates 
thereafter 
the 
election 
campaign will be full steam starting with the 
local manifesto launch and unveiling of our 
mayoral conference.  As discussed with your 
colleagues 
in 
previous 
meetings 
these 
activities require resources to execute and 
the election budget is R50 million.  The 
Regional 
Executive 
Committee 
humbly 
20 
requests and will appreciate contribution and 
transfers as per timelines below.” 
And then you set out a timeline of contributions that 
you would want from 18 t h of May 2016 through to the 30t h of 
August 2016 and the total is R50 million.  And then you leave 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 127 of 413 
 
the – you give your account details and the rest is – is sort 
of courtesy comments. 
 
So let us – let us just go back.   
“As 
discussed 
with 
your 
colleagues 
in 
previous meetings.” 
 
Now this is plural – several meetings. Do you recall 
how many meetings you had with EOH people about 
donations to the ANC in this period of the first five months of 
2016: 
MR MAKHUBO: Sorry it would have been a meeting with Pat, 
10 
a meeting with Ibrahim, no I would have probably raised the 
same issue with Jehan as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry one meeting with Pat, one 
with Ibrahim and one with Jehan?  Or … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  When we sat for more than one but 
I know Ibrahim it was one and then Jehan it was one yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And with Pat probably several. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Probably several saying that how is this 
thing – how is this thing I had donations yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  Now you have already 
20 
indicated that in the same period – well you have already 
indicated that at one of these meetings somebody tried from 
EOH tried to raise the SAPS support contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Is that correct? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 128 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Do you recall who it was? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I did say on the record that it is the meeting 
that happened in my insistence with Mr Laher. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  So Mr Laher was the one 
who tried to raise the SAPS support contract and you 
referred him to the City Administration. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Mm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now in an earlier answer to my – 
one of my question you suggested that in the course – if I 
10 
understood you correctly that at one of these meetings you 
also engaged Mr Mackay over a payment of what you said 
was an outstanding debt due to Molelwane.  Is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  So there is a meeting about 
a donation to the ANC and at the same time you say you 
must Molelwane what you owe it.  Are these issues that you 
would raise with Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Are these issues that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Are these issues that you would 
20 
have raised with Patrick Makhubedu the- the issue of either 
the SAPS support contract or the outstanding payment that 
Molelwane was claiming? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well in this case with Patrick I was raising 
the issues of funding for the ANC and of course the issues of 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 129 of 413 
 
TSS because he was part of it before TSS was bought out by 
– by EOH to say look you guys owe us – and of course we 
would have other conversations. We used to talk about a 
whole range of things from football to what is happening in 
the City, how the business is going, how is he doing as an 
Executive, how am I doing in the City?  We talk about a 
whole lot of things. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  And all of this is happening 
while this life or death tender for EOH is pending before the 
City of Johannesburg. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well this is happening at this time when I 
am preparing for 2016 elections.  And I might say like it is 
not the first time that I would have asked for money from 
them and having said look please can you – can you fund us.  
It is not the first time that it happens. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  Can we go down then to 
503 in Bundle 1 it is an email that you sent on the 26t h of 
May.  
MR MAKHUBO:  500 and? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  503. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  Thank you.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  26 May it is an email addressed by 
you to Patrick Makhebedu and copied to Mr Laher and Mr 
Mackay.  Do you recall sending this letter? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I – I have read it and I think it was sent 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 130 of 413 
 
by me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And it says: 
“I have sent a couple of letters of request to 
your good selves as a sequel to the meetings 
we had.  Discuss those meetings now.  The 
last 
letter 
had 
cash 
flow 
requirements 
starting this week.” 
 
And I assume that the last letter referred to is the 
one that we have just seen.  Is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Huh. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The letter of 19 May 2016. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then the next sentence I – I am 
particularly interested in. 
“I have communicated our agreements to the 
ANC 
leadership 
especially 
the 
Regional 
Office Bearers and Province” 
 
So you had reached some agreements with these 
three gentlemen do you recall what those agreements were? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja that there is a commitment to fund. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well what was the commitment? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I mean they said to me look – then look 
what they saying and then they can – might not fund the 
whole 50 million but they will come back to me.  So the issue 
here was that guys this is the first week and we need to kick 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 131 of 413 
 
off. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you are saying that the 
agreement was something as vague as we will see what we 
can find? 
MR MAKHUBO:  The agreement was that they is willing to 
fund ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  They are willing to fund? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Nothing more than that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no nothing more.  I mean I would go to 
10 
the officer bearers and say look guys I have – got some 
money at least the initial money for the elections EOH is on 
board and I will approach other funders as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And did you write similar letters to 
other people? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Come again. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Did you write similar letters to 
other companies? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I fund raise to other companies as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No I am talking about similar 
20 
letters talking about agreements that have been reached and  
MR MAKHUBO:  Remember other… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Being engaged with the ANC 
leadership. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Remember others would say look we will 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 132 of 413 
 
pay you on a certain date or yes we agree we will give you 
R200 000.00 today or something like that. These ones I said 
look we have agreed to – to fund us because I need the 
money now they are kicking off the election campaign. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So what you are suggesting is that 
in the other cases you had agreements – fixed agreements 
we will fund this amount or pay this amount on that date but 
in this case you did not have an agreement. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Funding – funding is not a linear process 
and you get people handle them differently and you – you sit 
10 
with people and say okay we committing to funding but we 
will come back to you on the quantum and then the dates – 
so you say okay please I need it next week at least the first 
tranche.  Then they give you the first tranche.  It happens all 
the time to other people to say but you promised to pay me – 
to pay – to bring it for us for rental and rental is due today.  
It happens that way and then you can write to them as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now who else did you have 
engagements of this sort with?  What other companies? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No I cannot – should I disclose because 
20 
they are not here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no they are not here. 
MR MAKHUBO:  No there is no requirement to disclose 
people that I fund raise form it there Chairperson?  You know 
the law today is there but I mean to ask me who did the ANC 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 133 of 413 
 
fund raise from I think it is an unfair question and I do not 
think it is part of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well Mr Chairperson what we are 
going to submit is that the – when one has regard to the full 
conspectus of facts relating to these sorts of fund raising 
arrangements with EOH there is a very – or we will submit 
that these – that these were ultimately corrupt payments 
paid by EOH and if there is a similar arrangement with other 
– with other companies that Mr Makhubo had it is the job of 
10 
the commission to investigate that.   
I can understand that people are not present today 
and maybe Mr Makhubo does not want to say publicly but he 
can write it – he can write the name of the companies down 
on a piece of paper and then they will not be embarrassed 
publicly but it is not a question that he can refuse to answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well of course if that is the submission 
that would be made it would help the ANC to – or yourself to 
show that we are doing the same thing with other people – 
with other companies.  I am saying it would maybe I should 
20 
say may not would with other companies and whether in 
regard to the same companies – the same submission can or 
should or maybe made might be something else.   
But of course it might be something you wish to 
reflect on.  I mean – and maybe if he I am thinking about the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 134 of 413 
 
implications of the – of the previous regime before the – the 
passing of the Bill or the Act on political funding what the 
implications were for the fact that – for the period before the 
Bill became the Act Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There was no obligation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am talking – I am now trying – trying to 
think aloud in terms of disclosure. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Chair my understanding of that 
10 
regime is that there was no obligation to disclose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But there was no obligation not to 
disclose either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is not as though there is a 
statutory prohibition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  On answering the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But Chair I do not want this to 
delay the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that.. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 135 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The process of the cross-
examination.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I would be happy for Mr Makhubo… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  I think – I think reflect on it 
Mr Makhubo and maybe communicate to your legal team 
what the position is.   
I – I know that sometimes political parties would say 
we obtained these donations on the basis that we would not 
disclose the donors but I know that earlier on you talked 
10 
about transparency acting transparency in terms of these 
donations and of course there are letters here. It is not 
something that maybe was just the subject of discussions 
without anything on record.   
So – so reflect on it and you can get advise whatever 
advise you can get then communicate with the commission 
whether you wish to mention names of other entities where 
basically you dealt with them on the same basis as with EOH 
or whatever basis.  Your basis might not necessarily be a 
basis that Mr Chaskalson has but your own basis 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no we will get advise even from the 
head office from 00:02:40 and run on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  On what the position of the ANC is on this 
matter. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 136 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  And I had certainly very clear that my basis 
of engaging funders and the – the SC here Mr Chaskalson 
are quite different and are opposite because fundraising for 
a political party is not inherently corrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Shall we leave it on that basis Mr 
Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am happy to leave it on that basis 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I take us back then to the 
chronology and let us go to 30 May 2016 and if I can ask you 
to go to Bundle 3 page 267.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 267? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  3 – 267 Bundle 3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And will you confirm that this is a 
Molelwane Consulting statement for the month ending 30 
May? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if we go over the page to 268 
we see a payment from TSS on the 30t h of May for 
R570 000.00. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And we see again that this 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 137 of 413 
 
R570 000.00 comes in at a point where Molelwane has cash 
flow difficulties before the R570 000.00 the balance in the 
account was R268.00.  You will confirm that – R268.48. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct but I mean we did not have 
cash flow problems because there was actively trading. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry because it was not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am just saying when you say it had cash 
flow problems it looks – you sound like it had an operational 
cash flow problems. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But at this point it was not trading 
10 
you say. 
MR MAKHUBO:  It was not actively trading no. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes well let us – let us test that 
answer.  Can we go down to the next statement and maybe 
go down to page 370 where the transactions begin.  And 
here we see what happened to the R570 000.00.  The first 
payment is a transfer of R50 000.00 it does not tell you 
where it went.   
There were two transfers of R50 000.00 but if you – if 
you go to the table at page 849 of this bundle you will see 
20 
that that transfer ended up in your bank account.  Sorry I 
have given you the wrong reference there.   
Let me get the correct reference.  Correct reference 
will be page 849 which is the table of transactions from 
Molelwane accounts into your personal accounts and you 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 138 of 413 
 
see if you go down to 31 May 2016. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Which bundle is this sorry? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  At page 849. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Which bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 3 – Bundle 3.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the date Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  31s t of May 2016. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Bundle 3 – 849. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  849 that is correct.  And you will 
see that on the 31s t of May there is a transfer from the 
10 
62052928060 account into your personal accounts – your 
personal FNB account of R50 000.00.  You see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The dates are on the 3r d column. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The third column from the left is 
the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And this is maybe 17t h from the 
bottom or 15t h from the bottom around about there – towards 
the bottom of the page.  We will see two transactions on the 
31s t of May.  Okay.  
20 
 
The first if a transfer of R50 000.00 and while we are 
at it let us – let us also note the transfer of R200 000.00 
both on the same day.  You can pick those up on the bank 
statement itself if we go back to page 270.  Okay.  And you 
will see that the R50 000.00 is the first transaction on the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 139 of 413 
 
top of the page on page 270 – 270.   
MR MAKHUBO:  I am getting confused.  270? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  270 which is back to bank 
statement itself. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay.  And if you go down 7 items 
still on the 31s t of May there is a R200 000.00 transfer also 
with no description but we now know that that went into your 
– into your FNB account. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is right. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now there are other payments.  
There 
is 
an 
ABSA 
credit 
card 
4797692 
payment 
of 
R15 000.00.  Is that your credit card? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Your ABSA credit card right.  And 
then there is a payment saying Jet Standard for another 
R15 000.00.  Would that be a payment into your Standard 
Bank account? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then there is a payment with 
20 
the reference Kakale [?] that if I remember your earlier 
evidence is your mother? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And that earlier on was a salary 
payment in the same amount.  So did she still draw salary 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 140 of 413 
 
from Molelwane? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well I was paying her ja I mean we – it is 
not withdrawing putting into the flows and we were drawing 
ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry I did hear that. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Just saying we were not putting the thing to 
a close now we starting to draw and finalise but yes that is 
correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but she was drawing a 
R11 000.00 odd monthly salary still? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja we transferred it – we transferred 
R11 000.00 to her ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  And then – there is 
something… 
MR MAKHUBO:  Normally (talking over one another) salary 
ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  Then there is something 
called travel costs and travel costs and then a second 
reference Molelwane Moloantoa Makhubo – now that is you, 
is it not? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That R100 000.00. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Do you recall what that was for? 
MR MAKHUBO:  But it says travel costs I do not know – I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 141 of 413 
 
cannot recall which travel we were going. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh well –  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Chaskalson.  Is 
R100 000.00 on page 649? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh no Chair we are back on the 
bank statement itself at page 270. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I do not know if you have got – are 
you on 270 Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am on 270 yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So the payments we have dealt 
with are the R50 000.00 at the top of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Which is a payment to Mr 
Makhubo. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The R15 000.00 ABSA credit card 
which is a payment into his credit card. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The R15 000.00 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Below which is a payment into his 
Standard Bank account.  The R11 000.00 below that which is 
payment to his mother sort of a salary payment.  The 
R100 000.00 travel costs which are his travel costs. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 142 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So we got to the point.  Perhaps I 
might be able to help you here.  The travel agency we found 
out who received this payment was called Indigo Travel and 
it may be linked to the next payment which is R5 000.00 with 
your name and it says “Padi – P-a-d-I”.  Now Padi as I 
understand it is the international diving association.  Did you 
go on a diving trip at some stage around here? 
MR MAKHUBO:  My – my – the last born at home my 
brother’s name is Padi. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh Padi – okay well I drew a 
connection which was not there.  So that is your brother – so 
that is a payment to your brother – the R5 000.00. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the R100 000.00 is a payment 
to Indigo Travel.  Do you recall what you were paying Indigo 
Travel a R100 000.00 for? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No where do you get that?  Because I will 
have to – there is a statement somewhere I will have to.. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We just got the contract account 
20 
detail from FNB for that R100 000.00 payment. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I do not remember Indigo Travel.  I … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay they may have a different 
trading name.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 143 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But you cannot recall which travel 
expenses of yours. 
MR MAKHUBO:  But it says they are mine but I cannot 
remember where I was going ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right and you are saying that by 
that stage Molelwane was winding down so these are 
unlikely to have been Molelwane travel expenses. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  They look more likely to be your 
personal expenses. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is right.  That is right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  Then there is an amount 
below 
that 
on 
the 
31s t 
of 
May 
credit 
card 
payment 
R10 000.00.  Would that have been your credit card 
payment? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So let us – if we tot these up we 
see R50 000.00 + 2 x R15 000.00 gives you R80 000.00 _ 
R11 000.00 gives you R91 000 00 + R100 000.00 is a 
R191 000.00+ R5 000.00 is R195 000.00 + R200 000.00 is 
20 
R395 000.00 + R10 000.00 is R405 000.00.  So R405 000.00 
of this payment from Molelwane goes to expenses relating to 
you primarily but also your family, is that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And of course there was not that 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 144 of 413 
 
money in Molelwane’s account to pay any of these expenses 
before the R570 000.00 arrived from TSS. 
MR MAKHUBO:  What – what work do you do Chairperson?  
When you – when you winding down you collecting debts and 
you know what is left is to – as I said in the first – first – in 
November you extract value.  You take over – so you collect 
debts for exactly that – that reason.  So – so to say that this 
would not have happened – yes that would not have 
happened I agree with you.  But if there is a debt that has to 
be paid and it is paid that is what you do. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well you see that may be so in 
ordinary circumstances but here we are talking about a 
payment which the debtor describes as having been an 
enterprise development payment on a City of Johannesburg 
contract. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So – let me finish and then you 
can comment.  So R405 000.00 of what they pay and 
characterised as a enterprise development payment on a 
City of Johannesburg contract is R405 000.00 that goes to 
20 
you and your family and when I said to you earlier the most 
obvious reason for them to characterise it an enterprise 
development family is they thought they were buying your 
influence.  Do you think that this reinforces that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am saying to you that they owed us – your 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 145 of 413 
 
version and your thesis is one thing but the reality and the 
truth here if we ever wrote that – that email can come here 
and we can get counsel to cross-question to ask what they 
did or get one of the EOH people that are dealing with 
Chairperson and say look let us cross-question and say why 
did you do this – what was this – this all about for me?  And 
put it to them I can tell you that my version is correct. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
Well 
let 
me 
tell 
you 
this 
extraordinary coincidence in he chronology which is that 
after this R405 000.00 goes off to you and your family and 
10 
the 
balance 
of 
R4 
– 
R570 000.00 
of 
an 
enterprise 
development payment on the City of Johannesburg contract 
is paid to Molelwane.   
Two 
days 
after 
this 
happens 
low 
and 
behold 
Executive 
Adjudication 
Committee 
approves 
the 
EOH 
contract – the SAPS support contract and that you will at 
504. 
 
So 
they 
thought 
that 
this 
was 
an 
enterprise 
development payment on a City of Johannesburg contract – 
sorry it is 504 Bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  504 Bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  504.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the chronology confirms their 
hunch.   
MR MAKHUBO:  I suppose what you are saying is that the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 146 of 413 
 
checks and balances in the City the three committees and 
that I would be so influential that whatever I say goes.  And I 
can tell you I have nothing to do with this tender – absolutely 
nothing to do with this tender.   
So 
what 
– 
what 
my 
00:17:00 
sorry 
– 
sorry 
Chairperson – is that this money was owed that is why it 
went where it went and – and how the – the tender was 
approved I think the City – people who were sitting in the bid 
adjudication committee can be called.  I do not think it is a 
problem to call them and say what happened?  Did I say 
10 
anything to them if anything?   
Did I influence them in any way?  It cannot be that we 
leave it at the level of supposition and all that.  The people 
are here.  The people can be called and say what was my 
role in doing this thing?  And I can tell you now absolutely 
there is nothing that I said to them.   
So if we cannot be saying because of this and that 
you know we making linkages and causality that I do not 
think exists.  I just think it is a bit unfortunate and unfair that 
you know making causalities and linkages that are not there.  
20 
The people are there to be asked – to be called.  To be 
asked.   
They took that decision.  They make the – they did 
the evaluation.  They must come and say this is how we did 
the evaluation and what was my role in it and I think they 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 147 of 413 
 
can – they can corroborate that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well – well of course if the people 
corruptly twisted the adjudication process to reach a result 
that you required they are hardly likely to admit that in – in 
these proceedings are they?  Mr Makhubo do you think it is 
likely we are going to get an answer from them saying yes 
we – Mr Makhubo asked us to do this, this is what we did. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I say I did nothing you can call them.  I 
know if you are saying to them you corruptly evaluated that 
tender it is up to them to say I was not there and I did not 
10 
even talk to talk to anyone in those – in those – in that 
tender adjudication committee.   
Neither do I talk to anyone who has got – with 
tenders because it would illegal for me to do so.  And you 
are correct it will be –it will be very illegal.  But if you have – 
the decision is that no this thing was done corruptly I think 
the people are there in the City.   
The documents that shows was part of the DAC was 
shows who chaired the EAC – the Executive Adjudication 
Committee are there and they can – I think they can be 
20 
called. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Alright.  Well you will agree with 
me will you not that the EOH internal emails suggests that 
they thought that these payments were linked to the CoJ 
Contract and first let us stop there.  Do you agree with that?  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 148 of 413 
 
The EOH internal email shows that they thought that these 
payments were linked to the CoJ contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The email that you showed me now. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Of which I do not even know the people. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I know the people that I wrote letters to.  I 
do know who these people – who would they – they wrote 
these emails.  And I think they must come and answer.  I 
cannot – I cannot comment on them.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I know what the truth – what the issue is 
here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no but I would like you to 
answer my question.  That email shows that those people 
thought the payment was linked to the CoJ SAPS support 
contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The email as I read it says these things 
SAP ED whatever ED CoJ contract the way I read it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  But I do not think it is a correct email. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So you do not – you think that 
email got it wrong. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I think that email – I do not mean – I do not 
even know who these people are. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 149 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  But you will agree with me 
also that two days after the payment is made to the 
Executive Adjudication Committee has its meeting and 
appoints EOH.  That is what we see on this letter. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I see this letter signed by the CFO and it 
has got that date yes – the 8t h of June. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no the letter is dated the 8t h of 
June but it says the meeting of the Executive Com –  
“Kindly be advised that your offer in respect 
of an appointment of services provided for 
10 
the SAP implementation upgrade has been 
approved 
by 
the 
Executive 
Adjudication 
Committee at its meeting held on 2 June 
2016.” 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The meeting was on 2 June which 
was two days after the payment. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The two do not link. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  Let us just … 
MR MAKHUBO:  So we can – what I am saying Chairperson 
20 
and I am really throwing a challenge to the commission.  I 
am made to answer for people who wrote things that I do not 
know and I have got no idea why they wrote these things.  
So the Executive Adjudication Committee sends a letter to 
the EOH do you not think it is fair that the people who did 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 150 of 413 
 
this thing they must come and answer why did you – why did 
you pay on this day – what happened? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think you – you have put your side 
to say as far as you are concerned there is no link.  I think 
that is what you are saying. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  So Mr Chaskalson just wants 
to make sure that you can say whatever you wish to say 
about whatever link you make – putting and you are free to 
say there is no link and you are free to say there is no 
10 
justification to make a link.   
But the question of calling people that is a separate 
issue.  I am just talking about – about you commenting on 
what he says and – that when he makes a link about the 
dates and whatever you are free to say but there is no 
justification for linking the two as far as you are concerned. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Chairperson I have been repeating the 
same thing.  He uses different documents to come to the – to 
try and draw link but I will take that Chairperson and saying 
Mr Chaskalson I – I see the emails – I have seen the – I see 
20 
the file – I have read the file – I see these things in the file 
but I – I really do not know.  I see these things for the first 
time even here when I read. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I see.  Can I – can we just agree 
on one thing that the value of this contract that was awarded 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 151 of 413 
 
on the 2 nd of June was R400 – was more than R404 million.  
You add up those numbers you will get to slightly over R404 
million. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well I see – I see that includes for VAT on 
this letter of award yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  Inclusive of VAT yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In response to my questions you 
have said that these people who are linking payments from 
EOH to this contract are people who you just do not even 
10 
know.  I would now like to take you to some people who also 
link payments to this contract and they are people who you 
do know.   
Now the commission has heard evidence that Mfundi 
invoiced EOH R16million in respect of services that Mfundi 
described as “A CoJ SAPS Support Special” and this is the 
SAPS Support Contract is it not? Okay from the CoJ and you 
will recall that Mfundi is run by your tax advisor Mr Reno 
Barry. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now if you go to page 344 of this 
Bundle 1 you will see an email from Reno Barry on the 6 t h of 
January 2017 to Patrick Makhubedu another – your close 
friend Mr Makhubedu and it says: 
“Subject:  Mfundi ANC Recon.” 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 152 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I missed the page Mr 
Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  344 Chair.  344. 
CHAIRPERSON:  344 on Bundle 1. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 1 yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Mr Barry says: 
“Hi Patrick attached is the last ANC recon I 
have showing an amount of R560 000.00 still 
to go however there might be payments made 
10 
afterwards that must be added to the recon 
to reduce this 00:25:12 see columns for 
August and September 2016 for items not 
included.  Please advise if any items must be 
added to the recon.  Kind Regards Reno 
Barry.” 
 
If we go down a page.  It says: 
“Mfundi mobile expenses ANC GM.” 
 
Now those are your initials GM are they not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And I am going to show you 
documents that suggest that that is what they had in mind.  
They were referring to you.  ANC Geoff Makhubo.  We start 
off with sales and the sales from which Mfundi invoiced R16 
million were a CoJ SAPS support special.  The – Mfundi was 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 153 of 413 
 
providing services to EOH in relation to the SAPS Support 
Contract according to Mr Barry ie. Accounted.   
And let us see what those services were.  We see a 
list under cost of sales of ANC election expenses which 
come to R15.439 million. So you will agree that from this 
document Mfundi invoiced EOH R16 million in respect of the 
COP SAPS Support Contract and then treated as the cost of 
sales payments of R15.439 million that it made in relation to 
ANC electioneering expenses. Will you agree with that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes as far as I understood when I was 
10 
asked questions whereas – was that the initial – the donation 
for the ANC would be about R20 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry I did not hear the number.  
The… 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am just saying  when I heard – when I 
asked them was that the donation would have been about 
R20 million and then – and then I got that no look the – like 
– unlike before where they used to pay us directly into – into 
our account they – they have got a way to – to do it and I 
said no fine I do not – how you do it is your internal matter it 
20 
does not have anything to do with me.  I requested donations 
from yourselves and – and done let us keep on talking to 
Patrick about what I need paid and that is how we did it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So – so if I understand you 
correctly the – that they being EOH reached agreement with 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 154 of 413 
 
you that they would donate approximately R20 million to the 
ANC. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is the agreement that they said look 
we will give you about R20 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But they wanted to pay suppliers 
directly. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well they said look we cannot – we cannot 
give it to you directly so I said look find a mechanism I – that 
10 
is your problem I just need the money and I need suppliers 
to be paid. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you think of any legitimate 
reason why EOH would want to pay suppliers directly rather 
than paying the R20 million to the ANC as the donation that 
it says? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I would not know – I would not know 
Chairperson.  That is the information I got and I said look I 
am in election mode I do not – how it goes I just want 
expenses paid.  I am the treasurer there – the volunteers on 
20 
the ground would need apparel – would need catering on the 
ground and all that.  So that is what – that is what happened 
we need to bring you know we need to bring – we need audio 
you need a whole lot of things during elections. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So am I to understand that each of 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 155 of 413 
 
these line down – line items relate to requests that you made 
to pay and leave the top line item – Management fees and 
taxes leave that out.  But for the rest each of these line 
items relate to requests that you made to EOH to pay 
suppliers. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I can confirm that I recognise majority of 
them that – but yes the – you know adverts in the 
newspapers, and un-holdings would be bringing a project 
with 00:29:52 printers for printing yes – touch printers form 
printing yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well let us maybe look at the 
example – one of the examples.   Nahana Holdings.  If you 
go to 680 of this bundle you will see how the process seems 
to have operated.   
MR MAKHUBO:  600 and? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  680 Bundle 1. 
MR MAKHUBO:  80? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  680 yes.   
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you will see an invoice from 
20 
Nahana to the Greater Johannesburg Region ANC contact 
Geoff Makhubo and then there is an invoice for a social 
media strategy in various details that comes to R1250 plus 
VAT a grand total of R1425 and you will see that on this list 
next to Nahana Holdings there is the grand total of R1425 – 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 156 of 413 
 
sorry the list on page 345.   
But before you leave 680 if you go up a page to 679 
you will see that that invoice from Nahana was forwarded 
first to you by somebody called Andy Magaz to you and 
Obekeng Chikane and then you forwarded on to Patrick 
Makhubedu on the 22n d of July.   
So if I understand how the system worked a supplier 
to the ANC in relation to the election campaign would send 
you an invoice.  You would forward it to Patrick Makhubedu 
and he would attend to payment of the supplier directly.  Is 
10 
that correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And that is true of to the best of 
your knowledge of all of these line items on the email from 
Mr Barry to Mr Makhubo other than the top one which says 
Management Fees and Taxes which obviously did not go to 
the ANC but seemed to have gone to Mr Barry and Mr 
Makhubedu. 
MR MAKHUBO:  To the best of my knowledge number 1 and 
2 there from number 3 yes that is what happened here. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And that R4million cost of sales 
ANC fundraiser you did not see that amount? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no that amount went into a – a 
provincial ANC account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Provincial ANC.  So it did go to the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 157 of 413 
 
ANC it just did not go in the same way as paying suppliers. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now what we know from Mr Barry’s 
email is how he accounted for these expenses in relation to 
EOH was a cost of sales on a single sale which was the City 
of Johannesburg SAPS Support Special.   
So as between Mr Barry and EOH these payments to 
the ANC of R13million odd – just over R13million because 
you have got to take the R2.4million off the bottom figure of 
R15.439 million were a cost of sale in relation to the SAPS 
10 
Support Contract.  Is that not correct as they accounted for. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is what I see on the - what is 
appearing here Chairperson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now – so these are people who 
you know Mr Barry and Mr – and Mr Makhubedu. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I know them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And they seem to be treating these 
payments to the ANC as linked to the City of Johannesburg 
SAPS Support Contract do they not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  The – the – I requested for money but the 
20 
way they are accounting for it here they seem to call it a cost 
of sales.  I do not know how – how they agreed with – with 
EOH how they are going to account it but I formally asked for 
money to – from Asher and this is what I got. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but they – but what we see is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 158 of 413 
 
how they account for it inter parties is a cost of sales 
relating to the City of Johannesburg SAPS Support Contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is how I see it myself now. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  They link it to the SAPS Support 
Contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  They are doing it ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  I am not saying you are.  But 
these are people who you know well.  Have you ever raised 
with them why they linked these payments to the SAPS 
Support Contract? 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well when I – when I received – when I saw 
this – this recon I said but – so this thing went through 
Mfundi because I sent these things to Patrick and the way I 
understood it I thought it would be a direct donation and 
paying to – donation to the ANC and paying to the ANC.  
Why they treat is as cost of sales support I would not know.  
I mean I looked at this thing as even an income statement it 
looks like one but I would not have asked as to why do you 
treat this as cost of sales.  And how – why are accounting for 
this thing this way.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but my question was have you 
raised it with them because they will know why they 
accounted for it that way? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no not with Reno no.  I would have not 
raised it with Reno I – all I know is that I said look is the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 159 of 413 
 
money finished – no, no there was some money left can we – 
can we pay because in my mind this thing is a donation 
requested as a donation and let us send this an a donation 
and if my recollection served me well you know we – we 
thank them for a donation. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Is – so you – you got this 
reconciliation back in 2016 oh sorry 2017 because we only 
prepared in January 2017.  Did you get that reconciliation 
then? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I did. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. And it did not occur to you at 
the 
time 
to 
ask 
them 
why 
they 
are 
treating 
ANC 
electioneering expenses as a cost of sales on the City of 
Johannesburg contract? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Chairperson I – I really thought that it is 
their own accounting issues internally.  We asked for a 
donation, they gave it – give it in a particular way.  How they 
accounted for it – and in my letter I even say please 
whatever I said we asked for a donation and donation to date 
– into dates this – the donation request pre-dates this thing.  
20 
So I – look the accounting I cannot answer for them and I did 
not ask them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You see what their accounting 
suggests very strongly is they regarded these payments as 
part of a quid pro quo for that SAPS Support Services 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 160 of 413 
 
Contract.  That is what the accounting suggests.  Will you 
accept that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I would like them to answer that.  I – I – as 
I say I accepted donations.  I – if they – if you read it is the 
sense that quid pro quo I said I needed donations if in their 
minds quid pro quo I really cannot comment on it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now I know you would want them 
to explain why they did it but I need to interrogate your state 
of mind in – at the point at which you received this – this 
reconciliation so I need to ask you would you not – do you 
10 
not accept that on its face this reconciliation suggests that 
EOH Mr Makhubedo and Mr Barry and Mfundi regarded the 
ANC election campaign expenses as a quid pro quo for the 
City of Johannesburg SAPS Support Contract.   
Is that not what – what this document suggests?  I 
am not – not asking you to say that that is correct that is 
what they were but I am asking you to say – to comment on 
is this not what this document suggests? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Honestly when I see this document I saw – I 
looked at the expenses of what they – what I have asked for 
20 
has it been paid, is there money left if so what – what is 
going to be done with it?  What are the final expenses of the 
election campaign at that point?  Would they have been paid 
by other people?  You know those are the things that I 
looked at.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 161 of 413 
 
But looking at – at this thing to say okay these 
people are now using – I have got an income statement and 
it says this is a – they are treating this thing as their own 
expenses.  That is how I read it – as their own expenses not 
expenses on behalf of somebody else. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let us just take it step at a time 
then.  Did you see at the time that under sales the sales 
were described as CoJ SAPS Support Special.  Did you 
notice that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I noticed that and I thought it is their own 
10 
agreement between them and EOH.  Nothing to do with us. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes so you noticed at the time that 
as between EOH and Mfundi these expenses were going to 
be accounted for in relation to the City of Johannesburg 
SAPS Support Contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I saw that it looks like the invoice to me 
from Mfundi to EOH related to SAP – yes that I saw and I 
saw the expenses that I asked that they are paid. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  So these ANC election 
expenses you have knows since 2016 were accounted by 
20 
Mfundi to EOH as expenses relevant to the City of 
Johannesburg SAPS Support Contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am unsure what… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In terms of their accounting 
system. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 162 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:  I am – I am unsure.  I wanted – I asked for 
– for a list to say who have you paid – can we reconcile 
these things this is what I got.  What they do internally quite 
honestly Chairperson I does – had nothing to do with me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So are you saying that if they 
internally think that they are buying your influence on the 
SAPS Support Contract with these expenses you do not 
care? 
MR MAKHUBO:  They did not get what they bought because 
I did not buy anything.  I continuously requested donations 
10 
from them since 2008 from TSS and there has never been a 
buying of any favour. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well they did get the CoJ SAPS 
Support Contract whether it was due to you or not – they got 
it, did they not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  And then they got other contracts before. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Even before my time.  Even before I was 
the Treasurer. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes and the ones that we have 
20 
investigated do not look good.  But you knew after – so you 
knew at the time that this is how they accounted for them 
and since November you must have known that we regarded 
this as quite sinister.  Is that not correct? 
MR MAKHUBO:  You regard what as quite sinister? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 163 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Since November – since the 
evidence of Mr Powell where we spent some time showing 
the link between all of these expenses and the City of 
Johannesburg SAPS Support Contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You must have known that this 
commission regarded this as – as a problematic link. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I saw that when that Mr Powell’s says it 
seems as if it – it looks like these things supposes – and in 
my mind I said about these people are not buying friends.  If 
10 
they are accounting for it this way it has absolutely has 
nothing to do with us. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But you – if I understand your 
evidence correctly you – you have not yet asked Mr 
Makhubedu your close friend or Mr Barry your tax advisor 
why they accounted for it this way. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Why they called it cost of sales?  Why they 
called it cost of sales? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So why they called it – not – not 
just cost of sales but cost of sales in relation to a sale that 
20 
is the CoJ SAPS Support Contract. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Not really.  I honestly thought that it is an 
internal agreement between the two of them.  As I say I 
wrote a letter to – to EOH. I did not write a letter to Mfundi.  
I requested donations from EOH like I have done before and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 164 of 413 
 
earlier on you showed us that they have funding us but these 
are not the only funds that have – have – they have given to 
the ANC – these are not the only donations and that is what I 
knew.   
I knew that if they accounting for the – they wanted 
to use somebody else to pay I think it is best placed to 
answer for them and how they accounted for it this way.  All I 
can say Chairperson is that I – I met them and said look I 
need funds for elections.  I wrote a letter to them.  I even 
gave them the cash flow I need it this way – this month – 
10 
this is what I will doing.  I need to do elections – there is not 
00:12:54 and those things they have come to – to the party 
with and I thanked for it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now over and above these 
payments you said their total payments were going to be 
R20million.  Did they deliver on their full R20million that they 
apparently agreed to? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well I do not think it is a full R20million.  I 
know that they helped us pay for our research which is about 
R1.5million or so and ja I think it – I remember about there. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So at any rate it – well there may 
be other expenses as well that I might refer you to.  The – 
which are on this list but not – sorry which – which appear to 
have been forwarded by you to EOH but are not part of the 
R16 million that was reconciled on this list.  Did you forward 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 165 of 413 
 
other expenses to EOH beyond the ones that you see here? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes as I say I am – I am acutely aware that 
I did ask them to pay for – for our research and I think the 
invoice was sent to them directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I just ask the R20million am I right in 
understanding that that was in one year they promised that – 
R20million. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That was in 2016 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh to me that sounds quite a large 
amount does it also sound quite a large amount to you?  But 
10 
you were Regional Treasurer you would have a better idea.  
Maybe to say that was nothing compared to what others 
donated.  That sounds quite a large amount. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Chair if – if somebody is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To donate. 
MR MAKHUBO:   We ask for R50 million they say we give 
you 20 – we take it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  If you go somewhere you ask for 20 they 
give you 10 you take it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  If you go to others – I mean others would 
have – they vary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Others over a one year period they would 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 166 of 413 
 
you know give us R400 000.00 a month.   
CHAIRPERSON:  A month. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shew.  So over a year. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Over a year.  So – so I am just saying that 
they vary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That would translate to about how 
much in twelve months? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Just under R5 million if it is 
R400 000.00 a month. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MAKHUBO:  So – so they vary.  They vary Chairperson 
depending on what you ask from them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR MAKHUBO:  You know the – the – so during elections 
and 
I 
think 
we 
say 
somewhere 
that 
in 
the 
year 
of 
conferences and elections our – our fundraising peaks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  And during –especially – especially local 
government elections for us as a region our – our fundraising 
20 
peaks because you know we have to contest every ward – 
135 wards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  So we have a candidate in each ward.  We 
then contest in the media we contest to volunteers on the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 167 of 413 
 
ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  And all parties do that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  You know you need posters, you need 
pamphlets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  You need buses.  You need transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  You need food.  You need t-shirts which are 
10 
a large expenditure as well.  You know if is winter like this 
one we needed beanies.  We needed big jackets and we 
needed sweaters and you call them hoodies – we needed 
hoodies because this election was not – was – I mean it was 
bitterly cold on the 3 r d of May – on the 3 r d of August then can 
you imagine July how it was.  So this one was very – was a 
very expensive election campaign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am just thinking that if you talking 
about R20 million just for 2016 that was of course as you 
point out an election year for one – from one company in 
20 
regard to a region not even the province – not even the 
country so it must means that in the end if that is anything to 
go by that quite large sums of money are given for – at least 
for the ANC and obviously other parties fundraise and do not 
know how much they – they get and so on.  But it does seem 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 168 of 413 
 
to indicate that one talks about large amounts when it comes 
to at least election years. 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct which why I said R4million 
went into the provincial account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  So it helps other regions as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that out of that R24 million. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes it is yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
MR MAKHUBO:  And it was not all because we had thought 
10 
that we will give them more but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  But you know – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I just look a couple of other 
expenses.  If one goes to 647 Bundle 1 – 647.  For one sees 
again a – an email from you to Patrick Makhubedu on 3 June 
2016 and it has a quote from Gauteng Coaches behind it for 
R450 000.00 for 100 buses to go to and from FNB.  This as I 
understand it was another invoice that you – or quote that 
20 
you sent to EOH hoping that they would pay it.  Do you recall 
if they did pay it or did not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  As far as I remember they did not pay all 
the – for all the transport – all the buses – other donors did 
pay for – for the transport to the provincial launch of our 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 169 of 413 
 
manifesto. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So they would have paid for some 
of that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes some of it they would have paid for 
some of it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And that would be obviously over 
and above what one sees in the Mfundi reconciliation 
because those payments – the bus payments were not on 
that recon. 
MR MAKHUBO:  No that is correct which is why I said there 
10 
would have been payments.  I could only remember the 
research one. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Including the research. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now you see I need to put to you 
again that EOH are apparently regarding these sorts of 
payments well over R13 million on election expenses as a 
quid pro quo for the SAPS Support Contract that the City 
awarded to EOH in June 2016 – but EOH are regarding it as 
that.  And you seem quite unconcerned about that.  What is 
20 
your response to that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  If it was a first time that we – we dealt with 
TSS/EOH in terms of funding the ANC I – I would have been 
concerned but over time you know for a extended period of 
time we have rarely asked for money paid directly to a venue 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 170 of 413 
 
here, paid directly to Eskom centre, paid directly to this and 
that.   
And I think what you are raising is that you know the 
mindset of – of somebody who funds you Chairperson which 
is why I think the bill came to be concern was raised by 
parties and civil society in Parliament that we – we do not 
understand the nature of this payment and maybe the minds 
do not meet.   
I am asking for a donation and somebody is thinking 
that they are buying a favour or they are buying a person or 
10 
something like that.   
And what the SC is raising and which is what I think 
it is being covered by this – by the Bill now is that this thing 
because it is now in the – you have to declare it to the IEC 
every amount over a R100 000.00 and you cannot get over 
R50 million from one – one donor being – you need that 
organisation means – means that you know from a branch to 
national we cannot get from – from one month donor.   
We – it then covers really that the intention cannot be 
other than giving a donation because it is – it is open.  Now 
20 
– now I would have thought that the people that I dealt with I 
would not have really thought that they are – I would have 
thought that they thinking that they are funding the ANC not 
that they are buying a favour.   
That 
is 
how 
I 
would 
have 
approached 
my 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 171 of 413 
 
conversation with Patrick.  That is how I would have 
approached my conversation with – with Mr Laher and Mr 
Mackay to say look I am here as a Treasurer to ask for 
money.  It is yay or nay. I thought those are 00:22:48 on my 
face I know I can say no we are not funding.   
Others are saying no we will fund you but we will 
fund everyone who is represented in Parliament.  Others 
would say no, no we are funding nationally we are not 
funding you.  And we would every door whether it is a bank 
or it is – and whether we do business with the City – as I say 
10 
we – we go and help local – local branches sometimes.  
Fundraise from a taxi association.   
When there is a – there is a rally you go to the taxi 
association and say can you please ferry us for free from 
Ivory Park to FNB Stadium and then we quantify that thing 
because they are supporting the branch.   
And in our minds we – we put the ANC first and say 
we are funding the organisation – we are strengthening 
democracy – so what is being put to me is that the EOH 
thought they are buying a favour and they thought that it is 
20 
quid pro quo that we got this tender and now we – we are 
funding you and I thought but even before that I have asked 
them for funding and there has never been an issue that is 
being to a tender.  
 I do not know their accounting internally maybe if 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 172 of 413 
 
you searched it would have been the same – I do not know.  
But for now I really take it that I never doubted the bona 
fides of the people I was talking to as an ANC Treasurer. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But now you have seen the internal 
accounting both on the Molelwane payment and on the ANC 
donations.  In both cases they link it to that very specific 
City of Johannesburg tender. 
MR MAKHUBO:  I have seen their emails ja.  I have seen the 
emails here on the bundle. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes and in respect of both the 
10 
Molelwane payment and the R13 million odd that Reno Barry 
disbursed on ANC election expenses.  There is a connection 
between those payments and the SAPS Support Contract in 
the way they describe them.  They just – they describe that 
connection.  Not me they do. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja what they described here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes 
MR MAKHUBO:  They – yes. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
But 
you 
seem 
remarkably 
unconcerned about that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think – I think what Mr Chaskalson is 
saying Mr Mahubo is your attitude towards discovering how 
they described it should be different – should be how could 
they have linked you to – to tenders in the City because as 
far 
as 
you 
were 
concerned 
this 
was 
separate 
and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 173 of 413 
 
independent request for a donation and there is nothing you 
– maybe there is nothing you said to them which would have 
given them any indication that they should link the two and 
you – you would be surprised maybe more than that to say 
they – they were linking it and you – you do not see why they 
were linking it and it is something of – it is cause for concern 
to say I was dealing with people and I thought that they – 
they saw this request for donation as simply a request for 
donation unconnected to anything but I discover now that 
they were connecting it with tenders.  So – so that is what I 
10 
think he is – he is saying to you.  He says he would have 
expected you to – to be quite concerned about how they 
looked at this. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Chairperson I was going to – and I do not 
think it was a matter of the commission here because I was 
going to – to ask the people that I know myself to say you 
know that I do not trade in tenders.  I do not trade in 
proposals.  I have never done and I do not do that.   
So – so internally how is this still – how are these 
things linked to a 00:27:17.  Now did you know we had a 
20 
funder once and may his soul rest in peace who were playing 
golf and I was asking for donations I am just going to 
00:27:29 he made a call that I will follow and he says look 
can you deal with that as marketing expenses.   
So we were playing golf and I was trying to say look 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 174 of 413 
 
we are going to a conference we – or I cannot remember 
whether it was Women’s League and then I could hear him 
on the phone calling somebody to say look the letter will 
follow but this thing is quite urgent but treat that as 
marketing expenses.  And I asked him to say why do you 
treat donations as a marketing expense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Marketing expense. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Because you are not marketing to me I am 
asking you in donation so either it is part of CSI or 
something like that and he says look now I have always done 
10 
it because I – I am getting requests from all over so I need 
to make it expenses.  
 I say look I am going to write you a letter of donation 
I am not going to give you an invoice because a marketing 
expense must be linked to an invoice.  So if it is linked to an 
invoice then at least you know that it is an invoice done to 
you.   
So I asked him and he says look now that is how I do 
it internally.  When I write the letter what I do with my books 
I write off your business.  You asked me for a donation I am 
20 
giving you a donation.   
So – so that is the – the – what I got from – from this 
– this donor of ours.  So these are the things that you – you 
deal with – and not worry what – how they put it because you 
do not question their bona fides.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 175 of 413 
 
And I suppose what the commission is asking me is 
that you know I – I should – should be saying to them while I 
think that this is a donation and it is an arms length 
transaction that you donating when I internally without even 
saying it to us you are treating me as a – as a – for all 
intents and purposes a marketing cost related to this very 
same tender and every expense that is related to that comes 
out of this profit for this tender.   
And then I find that quite unfortunate that it is not the 
holistic donation from – from EOH it is something that is 
10 
linked to a tender.  I am interested to see how they have 
treated the buses and it is something that would be quite 
interesting to see how they have treated the buses, the 
donations and other donations previously because they 
would not have gone though Mfundi they would have come 
directly from EOH it would be quite interesting to see how 
they deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might not have – but you really have – 
have in mind Mr Chaskalson so feel free. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You - you have DCJ.  There are 
20 
two issues that I want to pursue going forward.  It is the first 
is what EOH has done in this case seems to be similar to 
what you refused to go along with in the case that you 
reference the anonymous donor wanted it – wanted an 
invoice.  Because what EOH did here is they got an invoice 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 176 of 413 
 
from Mfundi that said they got several invoices from Mfundi 
that said SAPS Support Contract and R16 million.  And then 
in Mfundi’s book that becomes a sale and the cost of sales 
for Mfundi are paying all of these electioneering expenses.  
So nowhere in the books of these entities does one see a 
donation to the ANC instead what one sees is a set of 
invoices with expenses.  You will agree with – that that is 
what one sees. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  - The book. And that of course is 
10 
misleading according to – to your view. 
MR MAKHUBO:  It is completely misleading. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Completely misleading and it may 
even be a fraud on the Receiver because if these are 
expenses they will be deducted – they will be deductible 
whereas if the donations they will not. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes, no I said that is a donation and it must 
be treated as such. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  Yes.  But in the books you do 
not see any donations. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  I do not see – well I am saying they are 
listing expenses – an expense list but I do not see a 
donation – saying donation yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that is the one problem but the 
other problem is more serious in my view because what it 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 177 of 413 
 
suggests is in their mind when they bill something to 
Enterprise Development for instance it is a legitimate amount 
to pay for a quid pro quo on a particular contract.  And that 
is – that is the issue that I would have expected you to get 
much more concerned about because the suggestion from 
the books of EOH is that they have been buying your 
influence.  That is very clearly what their books say if you 
look at them. 
MR MAKHUBO:  It will concern me if they thought they are 
buying but I know that I was not bought.  You are correct that 
10 
even in their minds they thought they were buying me 
because I would have had no assistance and no help from 
them – for them in a particular case. So whatever influence 
they were buying if they thought they were buying me and if 
they accounted for it as they were buying me according to 
yourselves here on the books it is quite concerning, you are 
correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But what then worries me is that 
you - you have not taken it up with them.  You have not 
raised it with them.  These are – these are not strangers; 
20 
these are people to whom you are close and you have not 
seen fit to raise it with them, why not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Chairperson as I say it – it did not dawn on 
me that these people are treating me as a – they are treating 
us as a marketing tool or buying our favour because I know 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 178 of 413 
 
there 
is 
no 
favour 
that 
they 
bought. 
 
I 
know 
that 
conversations I had with them is not about buying favours.  It 
is just arms-length conversations about funding, about – 
00:03:30 about legitimate debts so – so internally what they 
– what they do because for me it is up to them and SARS 
and others internally what they do to think that internally 
they can talk.   
In fact I was saying earlier to my counsel that you 
know we suffer in our positions a lot of name dropping. 
Somebody will say I was speaking to the Mayor and he says 
10 
this and that and that and that.  They will go to City Power 
and say no the Mayor sent me.   
And it – it really happens but what it shows here it 
shows that the – the business and what – what we think that 
is happening is sometimes not aligned because business 
think for them it is marketing; we think it is a donation and 
that is why I would – I would really support this new law that 
– that now says look tell us where you get your funds from 
and there is a limit – there is a cap to them so everyone is 
capped because then at least this misunderstandings will not 
20 
be – will not be there.   
I know that I was not – I was not bought by anyone.  
My – the letters show that we – we asked for money and I 
think even now the current Treasurer is still asking for 
money and other Treasurers throughout the country will 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 179 of 413 
 
continue asking for money from donors in the same way.   
So if this thing continues I think – or continued the 
same problem that there is no meeting of the minds between 
us and business and that is – that for me is quite 
concerning.  But because I thought that for me I was very 
clear what this transaction was all about.  I did not – I did 
not take it up with them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well I am glad to hear are in 
favour of a new Bill.  Of course the new Bill will not help to 
stop payments of expenses the way that EOH was paying 
10 
them unless there is prohibition of that because those 
payments will not – will not appear either in the books of the 
ANC or in the books of EOH as donations; will they? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I think the Act is very clear that it is a 
payment money and in kind paying rent on behalf of the ANC 
– paying for t-shirts so the income part is part of the Act. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But how do you ever enforce that?  
How do you ever – how do you ever – I mean the way you 
enforce the Act is presumably by looking at the books of the 
donors and by looking at the books of the – of the political 
20 
parties. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And donations like this do not 
show up in the books.    
MR MAKHUBO:  There is a duty to declare imposed both on 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 180 of 413 
 
the donor and on the organisation.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:  The new Act imposes … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You have far more faith in the 
compliance with duties than I do.  But I want to – I want to 
come back to the issue that is disquieting.  You talk about 
this as though this were an issue that were just internal to 
EOH.  How they accounting for it internally.  But they are not 
just accounting for things internally they are taking it 
external and they communicating with you about it.  So Mr 
10 
Makhubedu sends you three successive emails in relation to 
that 2014 contract.  He sends you the proposal, he sends 
you the invoice and he sends you a letter of award.  That is 
not internal.  That is addressed to you.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes as I said I did canvass that point earlier 
and I said I did nothing about it because I do not why he 
sent it to me and I thought that was fully canvassed. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but this is no longer an – an 
intern of how they viewing it in relation to themselves 
privately.  It is also – it is a communication to you about how 
20 
they are viewing in relation to you in your position as Office 
Bearer of the City is it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:  As I say I – I talked to Mr Makhubedu you 
know lots of times.  We chat and I never had an idea that 
would he will be using me as a – will be seeing me as a 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 181 of 413 
 
ticket to – towards his own thing.  I mean – that sort of thing 
so – so I would – I – it does not occur to me that he would 
treat me that way. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But in all of these conversations 
you have never seen fit once to ask him why did you send 
me a proposal?  Why did you send me an invoice?  Why did 
you send me a blank letter of appointment?  These are 
documents which on their face suggests something very 
sinister going on.   
MR MAKHUBO:  But I did nothing about them.  I could do 
10 
nothing about them.  I – so I could do nothing about them.  I 
did nothing about them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And you have never seen fit to – to 
raise them with Mr Makhubedu? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No I mean you know – you know 
Chairperson as I said earlier on I did not raise it – did not 
occur to me when I received this thing and you did ask me 
and I did say I take counsel.  
Remember you advised and I said no I do take 
counsel and probably I should have acted differently.  
20 
Because as I say I received many of these things; I refer 
them; some I ignore them.   
In fact most I just ignore them because there is 
nothing I can do with them.  Whether it is requests for this 
proposal of this they come all the time.  All the time. All the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 182 of 413 
 
time.  So earlier on you advised that maybe you should have 
in your position and you were close to this person call and 
say why do you send me this thing?  And - and–maybe one 
should have done that.  Sending to me.   
Now the recon you asked for X amount of money and 
you say hey I have sent you invoices surely there must be 
money left to – to wrap up.  Yes here is a list of what we 
paid.   
Okay now here is a list okay everything else tick, 
tick, tick, everything has been paid.  Give it to the guy who 
10 
was doing now – was helping with the books here – whose 
name is here and then say okay let us reconcile.  It was on 
the day when we account and send you thank you letters or 
when we account we have to say look this was transport, this 
was this, this received in kind, this we received in cash and 
when you go to conference we do say received R10million in 
kind.  Somebody paid for our t-shirts.  Somebody paid for the 
– there are many of those please can I pay the supplier 
directly.  There are many who do that.  Say look please send 
an invoice I will pay the supplier directly.  They – they do 
20 
that all the time.  So – so I just think this is – this is – as I 
say you advised earlier on and I do take counsel with that ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You see I want to put it to you that 
there is the same parallel with the way you dealt with 
Regiments.  You will recall that in November I showed you a 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 183 of 413 
 
document that Regiments were emailing among themselves – 
the cheat sheet. Do you remember the cheat sheet? 
MR MAKHUBO:  The so called cheat sheet ja.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes well they – it was their word 
not mine.  And the cheat sheet referred to issues that 
Regiments were going to – at least according to the emails 
were going to raise with you. You recall that?  Mr  Nyhonyha  
was going to raise the issues with you according to the 
email.  If you want to read the email again it is … 
MR MAKHUBO:  No I think it is said – because remember I 
10 
said the first time I heard about that thing I got it from Mama 
Phulane.  I did say to you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Because they asked me about it in 2018 
and I answered them exactly the same way I answered that 
this is the document we sent to Geoff that is what – I do not 
know I think that is what it says. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And were you suggesting that it – 
the Geoff was not you? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No, no I am suggesting that I do not recall 
20 
receiving that document.  I did not even know what the cheat 
sheet is.  I think that is – I re-read the transcript and I think 
that is what I said as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes I do not want to go – I do not 
want to go over that questioning again because we did it in 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 184 of 413 
 
November but the one thing that I do want to emphasise is 
Regiments were sending emails among themselves with 
Nyhonyha Pillay and Wood suggesting that they could use 
you to influence processes in the City of Johannesburg.  
That is clear from the emails.  But you never raised that from 
Reg – with Regiments after Amabhungane broke it. That is 
correct.  You never confronted Regiments to find out why? 
MR MAKHUBO:  No because as I said the same way – I 
mean these things have nothing to do with me.  Half of the 
things I do not even know about so why do I have to pursue 
10 
it?  Why do I have to occupy my mind with it? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well – because if nothing else it is 
causing you considerable inconvenience in having to explain 
yourself here at the Zondo Commission where there is an 
appearance that Regiments think they can use you to buy 
influence. 
MR MAKHUBO:  You know the Chairperson asked me on that 
day or maybe what you are asking is what will shock you.  
What will shock you and I answered.   
But I think it is quite unfortunate that my – my actions 
20 
Chair and maybe as I said take counsel is that when I think 
that things do not require me to take a decision I cannot take 
a decision; I cannot influence; I cannot do anything.   
They are just one of those things that come to me 
amongst many that come to me that I – I just put aside and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 185 of 413 
 
that you know if somebody sends you something requiring to 
do something maybe call them and say why do you send me 
this you know it is not – it does not belong to me; please go 
back.  Especially because it is some – they talk amongst 
themselves and when you look at – when you look at certain 
things you say but why would they talk amongst themselves 
they are not even talking to me.  But I do – I do take it 
Chairperson and see that – I responded in exactly the same 
ways. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes and I want to take you to a 
10 
different 
document 
which 
reinforces 
the 
notion 
that 
Regiments thought they could buy your influence.  And it is 
in the supplementary bundle it is at the back of Bundle 3.  If 
you could go to page 1068 of Bundle 3.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  1068 - 1068.  And what you will 
see at 1068 is an email from someone called Regina 
Ramasema to a whole bunch of people who sat on the 
Regiments Executive Committee in 2014 and it says: 
“Dear EXCO members please find attached 
20 
the following documentation in preparation 
for the next EXCO meeting on Wednesday 
morning at 8.” 
 
And there is an agenda and previous minutes.  Now if 
you go up to 1061 still in Bundle 3 – 1061 you will see the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 186 of 413 
 
previous minutes are the minutes of the monthly EXCO 
meeting on 28 May 2014.  You have that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if you come down to Item 5 on 
page 1064.  You have 1064? 
MR MAKHUBO:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  See 5 is funds action plan that is 
Regiments fund managers action plan.  It says: 
“Deal pipeline” 
 
And then there are a number of issues and then the 
10 
last one it is: 
“CoJ inking fund” I think that is a typo it 
should be sinking fund and what is recorded 
in the minutes is: 
“LN that is Litha Nyhonyha.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say under 5? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Under 5 – it says Funds action 
plan at page 1064 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  To the right it says Funds and the 
20 
last item under Deal Pipeline.  CoJ inking fund.  And I think 
it should be sinking fund which is – which was Regiments 
contract at the City.  Litha Nyhonyha mentioned that he 
made a follow up for the sinking fund mandate with the City 
manager Ms Gomotso Letsatsi and Mr Geoff Makhubo.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 187 of 413 
 
 
Now did Mr Nyhonyha in 20 – in May 2014 contact 
you in relation to the sinking fund mandate at the City? 
MR MAKHUBO:  And the answer is definite no.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Definite no you say. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So if these minutes are correct and 
this is what was – she told his partners he was – he was not 
telling the truth to his partners. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Well I saw this thing for the first time when 
we received the document – I saw the document on Saturday 
10 
from 
yourselves 
when 
we 
received 
together 
with 
his 
response because I was interested to see his response.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well his response is interesting.  
Let us go to that response.  It is at page 1057.  You see we – 
we or not we the Chairperson sent Mr Nyhonyha a directive 
in terms of Regulation 10.6 of the Commission’s Regulations 
at the foot of 1057. 
“I hereby direct you Mr Litha Nyhonyha to 
deliver on or before 30 April 2021 to the 
secretary 
or 
acting 
secretary 
of 
the 
20 
commission at the address given above an 
affidavit or a firm declaration in which you 
provide 
a 
full 
account 
of 
any 
and 
all 
discussions correspondence and meetings 
between yourselves, Ms Gomotso Letsatsi 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 188 of 413 
 
the City Manager of Johannesburg and Mr 
Geoffrey Makhubo then MMC of Finance 
regarding 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
contract 
between Regiments Fund Managers and the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg 
in 
respect 
of 
a 
Johannesburg sinking fund as reflected in 
Item 5 of the minutes of the Regiments EXCO 
meeting of 28 May 2014 emailed to you on 30 
June 2014 and copies of which are attached 
to this directive as annexures A and B.” 
10 
 
Those are the documents you have just seen.  Now 
Mr Nyhonyha’s response was very interesting.  You will find 
that response at page 1069.  So if you go down to 1069. 
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes I am there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Nyhonyha did not respond.  
Instead his attorneys said  
“We refer to the abovementioned matter with 
reference to your Directive which was issued 
on 22 ultima wherein you requested our 
client Mr Litha Nyhonyha to provide a full 
20 
account 
of 
any 
and 
all 
discussions 
correspondence and meetings between him, 
Ms Gomotso Letsatsi then City Manager and 
Mr Geoffrey Makhubo then MMC of Finance 
regarding 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
contract 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 189 of 413 
 
between Regiments Fund Managers and the 
City of Johannesburg in respect of the 
Johannesburg sinking fund as reflected in 
Item 5 of the minutes.  We invite attention to 
the fact that Advocate Hermie and Cronje the 
Director of Public Prosecutions stated under 
oath in restraint proceedings instituted by the 
NDPP 
in 
terms 
of 
Section 
26 
of 
the 
Prevention of Organised Crime Act that it is 
the intention of the NDPP to inter alia charge 
10 
Regiments 
Capital, 
Regiments 
Fund 
Managers, Regiments Securities as well as 
its directors including our client Mr Nyhonyha 
with 
the 
offences 
of 
corruption, 
money 
laundering 
and 
fraud. 
 
A 
substantial 
proportion of the evidence relied upon by the 
NDPP in its court papers are derived from 
hearings of the commission compliance with 
your request in the terms framed in your 
directive as the potential to violate our 
20 
client’s Section 25 Constitutional rights we 
are accordingly instructed to record that our 
client has elected not to provide you with an 
affidavit or affirmation.” 
 
 
So the one thing that Mr Nyhonyha did not say is no, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 190 of 413 
 
no, no this never happened I did not say this and I never met 
Mr Makhubo instead he said I plead my right to silence I do 
not want to answer this question.  So which I must put to you 
suggests very strongly that from his perspective it did 
happen.  What is your comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I – I say it did not happen.  I mean I read 
this thing when you sent us – when you sent it to us.  There 
is no meeting that would have discussed let alone what does 
not even make sense is that the court case was still going on 
in 2014 00:20:49.  So when I read this and I said look but 20 
10 
– court case is still going on the interdict is still valid in 
2014. I mean this thing was sorted out in 2015.  Why would 
we talk about a mandate then. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC: Well… 
MR MAKHUBO:  It just does not make sense. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let me take you back to the 
contract that you had with Regiments.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is in Bundle 2 page 714.  
Bundle 2 – 714.   
20 
MR MAKHUBO:  Correct.  I am there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if you go to paragraph 2.2 you 
will see the obligations of Molelwane Consulting under that 
contract.  There are six obligations that relate to the tender 
process.  There is only obligation that creates an ongoing 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 191 of 413 
 
obligation on Molelwane after the tender process and that is 
2.2.7 on page 715.  That says: 
“That 
Molelwane 
must 
maintain 
on 
an 
ongoing basis all strategic relationships with 
the City of Johannesburg for during and after 
completion of fund management mandate for 
the mutual benefit of the parties.” 
 
 
Now that clause says that it is your obligation to 
maintain strategic relationships between the Joint Venture 
which 
is 
yourself 
and 
Regiments 
and 
the 
City 
of 
10 
Johannesburg before during and after the completion of the 
fund management mandate.   
 
And my submission to you is that Regiments regarded 
that as an obligation on you to ease their way inside the City 
of Johannesburg.  What is your comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:  I mean you putting it to me that Regiments 
did – you saying to me – you put it to me that Regiments 
considered this an obligation to me.  Of course I did explain 
what I interpreted it as to be when we entered into a contract 
in 2005/2006 you now the strategic relationship.  Now if you 
20 
say in 2014 they are saying they were activating that and 
then says Oh no I never had the meeting with Litha 
Nyhonyha discuss and Gomotso discussing the sinking fund 
in 2014.  The case was going on.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well let us – we have seen how – 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 192 of 413 
 
we have seen how EOH accounted for the payments that 
they made to you.   Let us look how Regiments accounted for 
the payments that they made for you – to you.   
 
If you go to page 920 of this Bundle 2.  Or go up to – 
go down to 922 which is probably the best place to start.  
922 Bundle 2.   
MR MAKHUBO:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And what you see… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Chaskalson 
maybe because you are going to looking at that issue maybe 
10 
we should take the adjournment before you start. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I am near the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  My guess is maybe fifteen minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But I am happy to – I mean if you 
.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you will take about fifteen minutes to 
get to the end. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think I am fifteen minutes away 
20 
from the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no let us take a short adjournment 
and then we complete when we – we finish when you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the adjournment.  Let us take a ten 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 193 of 413 
 
minutes adjournment.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair.  We are at 
Bundle 2 and we were saying we were going to look at how 
Regiments accounted for payments to Molelwane.  And 
what we see at 922 is an email from Eric Wood to Salim 
Essa, Kuben Moodley and Valence, which is the Gmail 
address of Ashok Narayan on the 18 t h of May 2015.  Those 
10 
were the three individuals associated with the shell 
companies 
that 
the 
Gupta 
enterprise 
used 
to 
take 
kickbacks from Regiments.  And what Mr Wood says to 
those three is: 
“Hi, all.  I sent updated list of outstanding 
invoices to Transnet.  Please note that we 
have just issued a small invoice for iron ore 
for April...” 
 
And if we go up a page.  So go up to two pages 
to begin with.  You will see what he sent as part of the 
20 
attached spreadsheet which was an email of invoices 
Regiments had issued to Transnet and you will see what 
the Transnet invoice – what Regiments’ invoice to Transnet 
was, what the amount was.   
 
In the column that I am interested in raising with 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 194 of 413 
 
you now, which was pointing out to you is, you will see 
there is after the column, it says amounts.  There is a 
column that says Jivito(?) or Omics and those were the 
entities that took the Gupta cut out of payments to 
Transnet and Albertine was a Gupta related entity that took 
a smaller cut.   
 
And so this is how Regiments’ account internally 
or what happens to their Transnet money.  On the same 
spreadsheet, there is a tab that relates to companies other 
than Regiments Capital.  Two subsidiaries, Burnington(?), 
10 
which is one of the Regiments’ subsidiaries and Regiments 
Fund Managers.  You will find that tab on page 921.   
 
Now on the Burnington tab you have the same 
structure, the spreadsheet  Client, date of invoice, invoice 
number, amount, Omics which is going to be the Gupta 
related laundering entity that will take a cut and what is 
outstanding, et cetera.  Now in the first five months of 
2015 when this email was sent off, there have not been any 
invoices from Burnington’s.   
 
So that is all blank but underneath we see how 
20 
Molelwane features.  And essentially, Regiments treat 
Molelwane on exactly the same basis that they treat Omics 
which is an entity that has to be paid a cut of what they get 
from an organ of state as a way of easing them into 
position at the organ of state.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 195 of 413 
 
 
So you see that Molelwane appears in the same 
column as Omics.  And here there are two invoices that 
Regiments 
describe 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg, 
an 
amount 
of 
R 1.236 million 
that 
it 
received in – that it invoiced in February and banked in 
April 2015 and of that, it has to pay a cut of R 98 000,00 to 
Molelwane on the same in respect of the March fee that it 
received also in April 2015.   
 
So what I want to put to you is Regiments’ 
internal accounting records also suggests very strongly 
10 
that they have treated Molelwane as though – what they 
paid Molelwane was a payment for influence such an organ 
of state.  In this case The City of Johannesburg.  Can you 
comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Firstly, I will not comment on the 
internal(?), but I - for first invoice in January 2006 when 
we agreed on the structuring fee and how we are going to 
be splitting the invoices, the management fee and - fee 
that you say internally based on this spreadsheet that they 
are putting(?) us as a – no, not as a subcontractor but as a 
20 
something else.  I do not know.   
 
I do not even know who Omics is but I know that 
they had a relationship with these chaps, Regiments since 
2004/2004.  So I – I can - honestly cannot comment.  I 
mean, I have looked at this spreadsheet and I thought 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 196 of 413 
 
basically they are just separating what is due to them what 
is due to Molelwane in terms of the contract ... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The structure of the spreadsheet 
is that they treat Molelwane in exactly the same structural 
place as they treat Omics but they appear in the same 
column. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot comment on that.  They are not 
– these are different things where I see them.  This is 
Regiments Fund Manager fixed(?) the contract with me.  
What they do on the Transnet issues is none of my issues.  
10 
How they – because here there is no Omics.  There is 
nothing.  There is a Molelwane Consulting that - contract, 
work on the tender document in 2004/2005 with Regiments.  
So I will not comment on that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But all our invoices – Molelwane is not 
Omics.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no I know Molelwane is not 
Omics 
but 
what 
I 
am 
saying 
is 
that 
in 
Regiments’ 
accounting systems, how they treat the income from their 
20 
organ of state contract and their payments to Molelwane is 
exactly the same way as they treat their income from 
organs of state and their payments to Omics.   
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, [laughs] ...you get me this.  
Firstly, it is a spreadsheet just saying these are the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 197 of 413 
 
...[indistinct] and this how it gets paid(?).  This one comes 
to our bank.  And this is a spreadsheet from Regiments at 
an internal – it is an internal email.  Now counsel wants me 
to comment that they treating Regiments as Omics.  I 
mean, I cannot comment on that.  I do not know.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you say you cannot comment, 
that is fine.  If you do not have any comment to give.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see, your obligations to 
Regiments was to maintain on an ongoing basis all 
strategic relationships with The City of Johannesburg 
10 
before, during and after the completion of the Fund 
Management Contract.  You remember that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   My obligation was those seven points that 
we did up to 5.  Number 6 says where necessary we need 
to - did not happen.  When necessary, just check where 
everything is going.  So I do not know why – what Omics 
has got to do with my obligation in 2006, quite honestly.  I 
do not know why they linkage(?) and I find it very unfair 
and unfortunate that now I am being linked to Omics.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, I did not link you to Omics.  
20 
I mean, Regiments put you on the same spreadsheet with 
the same structure.  I did not do that.   
MR MAKHUBO:   But it is a completely different column.  
Different column completely. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, different...? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 198 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   It is a different tab, as you say.  It is a 
different tab.  I mean, that is aligned(?).  I do not see how 
– relationship is in – how they do it - I think Regiments will 
have to answer.  I am not Omics here.  We were never 
Omics. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja, it is not a different tab.  It is 
the same tab.  It is a tab for companies other than 
Regiments Capitals.  Subsidiaries other than Regiments 
Capital.  So Regiments Fund Managers is not Regiments 
Capital.  It is a subsidiary.  Burlington is not Regiments.  It 
10 
is a subsidiary.   
 
And you will see under Burlington, provision is 
made for payment to Omics in exactly the same place as 
under Regiments Fund Managers, provisions is made for 
payment to Molelwane.  I do not want to take it further than 
that.  I am not suggesting that you were Omics but what I 
am suggesting is that, from Regiments’ perspective they 
treated you at the accounting level exactly the same way 
as they treated Omics. 
MR MAKHUBO:   They are best to answer.  I cannot 
20 
comment to that, Chairperson.  As I said, I quite – I think it 
is quite unfortunate that we look at a spreadsheet and 
make inferences from that spreadsheet that would be 
treated(?) as Omics.  I – we are not Omics.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, I am not saying you are.  I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 199 of 413 
 
am saying your role for Regiments in relation to the 
Regiments Fund Managers contract was the same role that 
Omics played for them in relation to the Burlington contract 
...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Well, I do not know what they are.  What 
their role is.  Our role is 127 points to Regiments had – 
and we agreed on that contract in 2005. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let us look at seven.  What 
did you – what is this role?   
“Maintaining on an ongoing basis all strategic 
10 
relationships with The City of Johannesburg 
before, during and after completion of Fund 
Management mandate for the mutual benefit of 
the parties...” 
MR 
MAKHUBO: 
 
 
Again, 
Chairperson. 
 
On 
the 
27 t h of November, we canvassed that.  That question was 
asked but we will repeat because – to say, we took a view 
that 
we 
were 
interested 
in 
the 
long-term 
funding.  
Remember to grow the fund depends on the debt – the debt 
that The City takes and the debt that it takes on a bullet 
20 
form basis, effectively.   
 
So how they were going to – what is the capex 
outlook, what is the funding outlook, what is the difference 
between own funds loans, what is the carrying(?) capacity 
in the balance sheet?  Strategically, where is The City 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 200 of 413 
 
going?  What is the IDP?  So we emerged(?) ourselves in 
that.   
 
That is why even now by the time we got into 
The City in 2011, we much understood what was going on 
in The City because we missed(?) ourselves.  So for me 
that is what – that is the value add.  I mean, everything.  
We did not even say - because they ask the same 
questions that counsel is asking, that anything insinuating 
anything other than what I am saying is quite unfortunate.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, I just want to put it to you 
10 
that what you just described does not relate to the 
maintaining a strategic relationship with The City.  It just 
does not.  It is a different – that is an obligation – it is a 
different obligation all together.  But let me step back.   
 
If we look at the overall position in relation to 
Molelwane, you will agree with me that the primary source 
of income for Molelwane after 2008 was Regiments and 
that apart from Regiments the second largest source of 
revenue was payments by companies related to EOH, were 
they not? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I can say that there was a time 
where – when we worked with – started working with 
Regiments.  The other business – there were other 
business, refinery in Durban.  We were doing check-downs 
and others who were doing small ...  We were doing - work 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 201 of 413 
 
for companies.  And on the Molelwane’s side.  Yes, we then 
– in fact, 2005 went into what I thought was a - with 
Regiments, yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the question is quite simple.  
Is there anyone other than Regiments or an EOH Group 
company, TSS or EOH that paid more money than either 
those into Molelwane? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now the internal documents of 
both of those companies that we spent quite a lot of time 
10 
on show that they both assumed that you be able to 
influence processes in The City to their benefit. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja, ja.  Well, that is your version.  That is 
the assumption, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no the internal documents.  
Let us look at the cheat sheet.  Does the cheat sheet not 
show that they assumed that you could influence internal 
processes in The City ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   I said to you I do not know what a cheat 
sheet is.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But you have seen the cheat 
sheet.  You have sent he email.  Does it not reflect on their 
part a believe that you can influence payments – influence 
processes in The City to their benefit? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, I cannot comment on 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 202 of 413 
 
Regiments or EOH’s contention on what their - like this.  
And I think earlier on, we did go through this thing that 
when people do things internally and they say – and 
counsel 
here 
argues 
that 
they 
think 
that 
I 
can 
be 
influential.  And even 2000 – I do not know how I could be 
influential in 2005, quite honestly, in 2006.  I really – all 
we know ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The cheat sheet was 2010, if we 
are talking Regiments.  The internal minutes were 2014.   
MR MAKHUBO:   I really cannot comment on that because 
10 
what ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  No, no, no. 
MR MAKHUBO:   ...all I know I had contract with them to 
do certain things.  So what they thought, I cannot comment 
on that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we have seen a whole 
succession of internal documents from EOH that suggest 
that Jeff can be prevailed upon to help them out in certain 
circumstances.   
MR MAKHUBO:   I challenge the Commission to call the 
20 
people to ask them what their answers would be.  I cannot 
comment on that.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   I cannot. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I want to put to you that the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 203 of 413 
 
evidence is overwhelming that the payments made by EOH 
were payments made for your influence.  The EOH 
thought(?) was making to buy your influence.  What is your 
comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   I deny that and I dispute that.  There was 
never been a solicitation of funds from EOH to – from them 
to buy - to sell influence.  For the ANC, we will always ask 
for donations and they have always come to the party, like 
other donors. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Right.  But EOH linked those 
10 
payments, we have seen to be The City of Joburg 
contracts.  Did so twice. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I am interested to find out where they did 
that so that they can come and account.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is for them to explain. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is the state I am talking, their 
state of mind.  And Regiments, I submit, did so too in the 
way that they accounted for your payments the same way 
as they accounted for the Omics payment from Transnet. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   Again, Omics came in – I do not know 
what Omics is.  I think they came in later.  I know what our 
agreement with Regiments that we sent in 2006 in January.  
It had nothing to do with whatever Omics did.  I do not 
even know who they are.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 204 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am not suggesting that you and 
Omics were in any way linked.  I do not want to make hat 
suggestion.   
MR MAKHUBO:   But you are making – you are linking us 
together. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, I am saying that the way that 
Regiments accounted – I am not saying that you are part of 
the Gupta conspiracy.  I am certainly not saying that.  I do 
not want that to go out today.  That I am not saying.  But 
what I am saying is that the way that Regiments accounted 
10 
for payments to you was the same way as they accounted 
for payments to Omics.  But just like they thought they 
were buying influence with Transnet with Omics, they 
thought they were buying influence at City of Johannesburg 
with Molelwane.   
MR MAKHUBO:   So certainly for me, they bought no 
influence.  And I do not know whether you can call a 
spreadsheet an accounting sheet but this is a spreadsheet 
that I see here.  So in my years of accounting I have never 
called this thing an accounting sheet but... 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What we do know is that EOH 
repeatedly correspondent with you in relation to pending 
tenders and they repeatedly financed Molelwane when 
Molelwane was running into cash flow difficulties while 
those tenders were pending. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 205 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Not correct.  I have never received cash 
flows 
from 
EOH 
but 
my 
relationship 
with 
Patrick 
Makhubedu from his own – whatever is what he owns.  I 
explained it that with us and Exsolve, we used to work 
together.  So whether he gets it from Zylek or from anyone 
else.  And I have explained it earlier on.  EOH has never 
intervened in Molelwane Consulting ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So these payments come from 
Mfundi, they come from Zylek... Oh, sorry.  They come from 
Mfundi and on occasion come from EOH.  It is TSS itself.  
10 
Are you disputing that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, TSS, if you look at the payments from 
whenever this thing started, they have been coming to 
Molelwane Consulting.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What we have seen is that they 
come in at precise moments where there is a cash flow 
difficulty in Molelwane.  No payments come in at a time 
other than appointed which Molelwane is in cash flow 
difficulties.   
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson ...[intervenes] 
20 
COUNSEL:   Chair, maybe I must object.  I think 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
COUNSEL:   Chair, I must object.  I think Mr Chaskalson is 
now cross-examining the witness.  We have canvassed the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 206 of 413 
 
very same issues and I think he is expecting different 
answers from the witness.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I am just pulling together 
the strands at the end of the cross-examination.  I am 
trying to finish here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am going to suggest that the 
Commission should conclude that Mr Makhubo has been 
guilty of corrupt practices.  I need to lay a proper 
foundation for that.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And that is to the end of this – 
about the end of your questioning? 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 This 
is 
the 
end 
of 
my 
questioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  I think let us – we are 
finalising.  So that is fine.  Of course, if Mr Makhubo says:  
Well, I have already responded to that question, that is 
fine. 
MR MAKHUBO:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, Mr Makhubo, I am just 
20 
summarising what has come before.  We have seen 
donations of millions of rands to the ANC which you 
solicited while EOH had pending bids in The City and which 
they and the Mfundi accounted for as costs in relation to 
EOH contracts with The City.  You have seen that? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 207 of 413 
 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, I have seen that and I have 
answered that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And thus far I have just been 
looking at how EOH and Regiments have – what one can 
infer about the state of minds of EOH and Regiments but 
let us look at your state of mind.  You deliberately misled 
the public on the Power FM interview when you claimed 
that you derive no benefit from payments to Molelwane 
after 2011.   
MR MAKHUBO:   I answered that on the 27 t h of November 
10 
and you spoke about undue benefit. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Well, let us look at what 
you actually said on Power FM.  
MR MAKHUBO:   I know what I have said and I correct it 
here to talk about undue benefit. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, but that is not what you 
said on Power FM and it could not conceivable been what 
you thought you said on Power FM at the time because you 
were so emphatic.  Can I take you to what you said at 
Power FM?  It is at page 941 of Flow of Funds, Bundle 2. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now when I question you on this 
in November, you had reserved your right to check the 
transcript.  You come back and you have not corrected 
anything.  So I did not, on the 27 t h of September, wanted to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 208 of 413 
 
take you to task on anything in any detail because you may 
have come back and said this is not what I said but we are 
passed that now.  So the presenter says to you: 
“Alright.  So the time you were already MEC at 
the time you resigned...” 
 
You resigned from Molelwane.  That is what he is 
referring to. 
Mr Makhubo:  “Yes, yes. 
Presenter:  “Which means you continued to 
derive benefit from a company doing business 
10 
with The City.” 
 
And your answer is: 
“I did not derive benefit.  In fact, if any 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, what page – what line? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, sorry, Chair.  We are down 
at page – we started at 21, 21 of line – of page 941. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In fact, let us start a little bit 
earlier, 17. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
Mr Makhubo:  “Ja, I resigned.  The final 
resignation was around 2013/2014.  I must get 
my dates.  But it is around 2013/2014 and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 209 of 413 
 
basically everything else was pushed out.  The 
company was deregistered this year...” 
 
That is 2020. 
Presenter:  “Alright.  So the time you were 
already MEC at the time you resigned?...” 
 
That is the presenter and you say:  “Yes, yes.” 
Presenter:  “Which means you continued to 
derive benefit from a company doing business 
with The City.” 
 
And your answer is: 
10 
“I did not derive benefit.  In fact, if any fees 
came because the fees came, they went into 
staff and all that.  I did not derive any benefit 
from that time.  I, Jeff Makhubo, did not...” 
 
That is very emphatic.  And it is false.  We know 
from the tables that there were in fact adequate payments 
of more than R 7 million from Molelwane into your personal 
accounts. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, on the 27 t h of November I 
clarified this.  Even you and the transcript you will repeat 
20 
to say:  Are you saying you – it was ...  I said yes.  We 
spoke about undue benefits on the 27 t h ...[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is not what you said, 
Mr Makhubo. 
MR MAKHUBO:   On the 27 t h of November, that is what I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 210 of 413 
 
said, sir. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no that is what you tried to 
explain in the statement but that is not what you said on 
Power FM.  You did not mention undue at all. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I stick to my explanation to the 
Commission, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I – the 27 t h of November was about 
what?  Six or so months ago?  So one needs to be – to 
make sure that one understands.  So is your position that 
you explained on the 27 t h of November that you were 
10 
talking about undue benefits?  That is what you were 
saying you did not receive? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Chaskalson was saying, the 
question was not whether you received any undue benefits.  
The question was whether – or the suggestion was that you 
continued to receive benefits from a company doing 
business with The City without making any distinction in 
terms of what was put to you as to whether it was due or 
undue. 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your answer was you were talking 
about undue benefits? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 211 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Depending on what you wanted 
to say although I doubt it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But it certainly is not what you 
said.  You did not mention the word undue at all and there 
is nothing in the turn-up of what you said that referred to 
undue benefit.  What is your comment on that? 
MR MAKHUBO:   ...I stick to my statement – that summary, 
sir. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see, the concern of the 
10 
presenter was not about due or undue benefit.  It was:  
Were you a member of Molelwane at the time it was doing 
business with The City.  And then your answer was that you 
did not receive any benefit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe let me put it this way, 
Mr Makhubo.  I think what Mr Chaskalson is suggesting to 
you is that where a question was -  a proposition was put 
to you the way it was put, namely, why you when you were 
– you could continue to draw benefit from a company doing 
business with The City.   
20 
 
If you intended to say you did not receive undue 
benefit, one would have expected you to say:  Yes, I did 
receive benefits but I was entitled to those benefits.  So 
there is no issue.  I was entitled to them by law.  That is 
what one would have expected.  I think that is the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 212 of 413 
 
suggestion from or implied suggestion from Mr Chaskalson.   
 
Because the proposition makes no difference 
between due or undue.  And if in your mind you were 
saying:  Well, I think I must make it clear that what I did 
not receive was undue benefits.  You would still say:  I did 
receive benefits but they were due.  And there is nothing 
wrong with receiving due benefits.   
MR MAKHUBO:   No, correct, Chair.  I could have said that 
I derive from undue benefit or the way you phrased it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   And what is written here.  I think it is 
simply broadcast but I really meant undue benefit.  And I 
would like to leave it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Look ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, Mr Makhubo, I am going to 
argue with that that is a dishonest answer because what 
you said is that if any fees came they went into staff.  Now 
that has got nothing to do with whether a benefit was due 
20 
or undue.  It has to do with whether you received the 
benefit.  And you proceed:   
“I did not derive any benefit from that time.   
I, Jeff Makhubo, did not..” 
 
So I am going to put it to you that this answer is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 213 of 413 
 
dishonest and that you knew at the time when you had this 
Power FM interview that you were giving an answer that 
was not truthful.   
MR MAKHUBO:   I stick to my answer.  I meant undue 
benefits, sir – Chairperson. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
And 
on 
similar 
line 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course  I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson.  
Of course, an answer that says you meant undue benefits, 
namely, you did not receive undue benefits, is an answer 
10 
that suggests that you did receive due benefits, is it not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
I 
think 
that 
is 
where 
Mr Chaskalson’s question arises, to say, the next part you 
say whatever benefit came went to staff and not I, 
Mr Makhubo.  I think he is where he is ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   No, I hear you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I am just saying that on the 27 t h you 
asked the question and I clarified it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   But ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MAKHUBO:   So it is – I mean, it just a letter that says:  
Look, you did not mean this, you mean this.  That is what I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 214 of 413 
 
meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MAKHUBO:   And then that is – that is – I would like to 
leave it at that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see, that is not the only 
misleading statement you have made to the public in 
relation to your relationship with Molelwane.  You gave a 
blatantly false answer to AmaBhungane three times in 
relation to this issue when you said you resigned from 
10 
Molelwane in 2011.  If I could take you to page 947 of, 
again, Bundle 2? 
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is your statement to 
Molelwane in October 2018.  And if you go to the second 
last – well, let us start with the third last. 
“There was never a conflict of interest as 
internal Molelwane agreement with Regiments 
on the first sinking fund would have lapsed in 
January 2011 when I took public office. 
20 
Molelwane 
Consulting 
did 
not 
continue 
providing services to Regiments in the second 
contract as it did not participate in the RFP. 
Further to this, I declared all my private 
business interests upon taking public office as 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 215 of 413 
 
required by law. 
In addition to this, I subsequently resigned as 
a 
member 
of 
Molelwane 
Consulting 
and 
Director 
of 
all 
other 
companies 
in 
November 2011...” 
 
So that is the first time you said it.  You then 
repeated that again in 950.  At the top of 950.  This is the 
second statement. 
“I tendered my resignation as a member of 
Molelwane Consulting in November 2011. 
10 
This was in line with my decision to use my 
skills as a public representative...” 
 
You then said it again a third at page 952, your 
third statement...  The bottom paragraph on 952. 
“As 
stated 
previously, 
I 
tendered 
my 
resignation 
as 
a 
member 
of 
Molelwane 
Consulting and other business interests in 
November 2011. 
See attached letters...” 
 
And there are some letters attached.  Now, we 
20 
know the fact that you continued to conduct the financial 
affairs of Molelwane for its entire life after 2011, do we 
not? 
MR MAKHUBO:   Yes, Chair.  I think this was canvassed 
and I – when we talked about interest and all that but I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 216 of 413 
 
tendered – I have moved as an Executive Director or 
Executive Member of Molelwane and this thing worsened – 
as I say, it was canvassed.  Here are the point – specific 
questions that were asked to me but yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I find it difficult to give an 
innocent explanation of the fact that three times you would 
misrepresent the fact that you continued to control the 
financial affairs of Molelwane after 2011 and in fact was 
still doing so at the time that you answered these 
questions from Susan McComery.   
10 
MR MAKHUBO:   Ja, she was asking me – she did not ask 
me about that but she was asking me specific questions.  
And I said and I said in one of the affidavits that because I 
knew that she was meeting with my oppositions, I was 
smelling politics into these things.  So, therefore, I wanted 
to answer the way I wanted to answer it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you – are you saying that you 
deliberately gave a false statement to Susan McComery 
because you thought that she was meeting with your 
political opponents? 
20 
MR MAKHUBO:   I did send a letter to Susan McComery 
but look, I gave somebody a power of attorney to do 
certain things.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  Well, look, what you said 
in relation to your resignation of Molelwane in 2011 was 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 217 of 413 
 
false.  
MR MAKHUBO:   It was not affected(?), sir.  And that is 
what I said.  It was not affected.  Even in my affidavit I 
said that.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  But no one reading those 
statements would have known that you were administering 
with financial affairs of Molelwane up until the time that 
you had write ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   As I said on the 27 t h, I was waiting for 
things to go down to the right value and I did canvass it.  
10 
And I think, Chair, you did ask me about the value.  I said:  
Yes, we want it down because of the interlink between – if 
it was a like Exsolve.  I resigned as a Director and all the 
things but the CC was intertwined.  Again, it was – I do not 
think that we deliberately picked – deliberately gave false 
information... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let us look at what you 
said to Power FM which the way you sort of retreated a 
little bit from misrepresentation but still gave a false 
version.  If you go back to 941. 
20 
COUNSEL:   Chair.  Honestly, I should not object.  I think – 
I know he was reading up but he is basically restating what 
he have already canvassed.  It is on the record.  And I 
think these are matters that he can leave for argument if 
there are any inferences to be drawn. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 218 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But Chair, this is literally my last 
question ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...before I put the confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But I would like Mr Makhubo to 
at least have the opportunity to answer it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because I am going to suggest 
that there was a corrupt relationship here and in fairness 
10 
to him, he must – and I am going to rely, in part, 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...on the past statements he had 
made in relation ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...a chance to say something if he has 
something to say.  If you do not have anything to say, you 
say so. 
MR MAKHUBO:   [No audible reply] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if you go to what you said to 
20 
Power FM on page 941.  You say: 
“Ja, 
I 
resigned 
but 
final 
resignation 
was 
around 2013/2014...” 
 
Now that too was false because you were still 
managing the financial affairs of Molelwane as late as 2019 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 219 of 413 
 
and ...[intervenes] 
MR MAKHUBO:   Chairperson, I think this was canvassed 
and I have really answered that.  I am not going to give 
any further comment. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you see, I struggle to 
understand why you would make these statements that are 
so clearly false in relation to your relationship with 
Molelwane after 2011.  And the only conclusion that I could 
reach is that you knew that it was improper to continue to 
benefit from Molelwane when their primary income came 
10 
from parties who were buying their influence at The City of 
Joburg where you were an office bearer.  And that is what I 
will argue to this Commission.  So I wanted to give you an 
opportunity to respond to that. 
MR MAKHUBO:   I think the whole purpose(?) of counsel of 
here is not correct.  No important(?) inference from me.  I 
stated on the record that we wanted to add value and we 
strike(?) value from Molelwane whatever is owed and deal 
with whatever is outstanding.   
 
So I think my comment is that I disagree with 
20 
counsel and he says he will argue it to the Commission and 
I suppose if there is a chance that we can argue to the 
contrary, we will show that the line of questioning and the 
so-called connecting of his dots are actually misaligned 
and completely false.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 220 of 413 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you,  Mr Makhubo.  We 
will have to leave it at that, Chair.  I have no further 
questions here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Counsel for 
Mr Makhubo. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, I do not have any re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No re-examination. 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
Save 
to 
– 
just 
get 
clarity. 
 
Again, 
Mr Chaskalson says he will argue ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
COUNSEL:   I am not so sure whether that opportunity will 
be available also to the legal teams? 
CHAIRPERSON:   There will be no oral argument as things 
presently stand but there will be an opportunity for written 
submissions to both the Commission’s Legal Team and to 
yourselves.   
 
So, actually, I would urge you to start working on 
the consult missions with regard to what findings I should 
make in relation to the evidence of witnesses who may 
have said certain things about Mr Makhubo and his own 
20 
evidence and evidence of what he may have said about 
witnesses who may have already given evidence here.   
 
So, the sooner you get onto that, the better.  So 
there will be that opportunity so that you can make your 
submissions.  We – I think in due course, I might put some 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 221 of 413 
 
deadline but in the meantime, I think just start working on 
it. 
COUNSEL:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you very much, 
Mr Makhubo. 
MR MAKHUBO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have come to the end of your 
evidence.  You are now excused.  We are going to adjourn 
the day session.  I will take a 15-minutes adjournment and 
at five o’clock we will start the evening session with Eskom 
10 
work stream.  We adjourn.

respect of which we agreed that it should be dealt with at 
the commencement today, if I recall correctly, last time.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 224 of 413 
 
We were all here.  That Mr Koko wanted or raised.  I 
cannot remember the details but I remember that I said:  
Well, let us leave it and when we start on Monday we can 
start with it.  But if nobody remembers is, it must mean 
that it is not so important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   I can recall it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay. 
MR KOKO:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have a recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That you were asking me whether I had 
two or three questions to ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That may not be what you have in 
mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is not, ja. It is something 
20 
else and Mr Koko obviously remembers it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it was something that involved 
documents, I think.  There were some documents that you 
wanted to deal with, if I am not mistaken.  Mr Koko, just 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 225 of 413 
 
remind us what it was. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  It relates to my signature on an 
Eskom procedure in August 2015, relating to the MSA.  In 
fact, relating to the National Treasury’s approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   That I signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And correctly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And a procedure in a practice note, that is 
10 
what we call ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...giving effect to the National Treasury’s 
statements ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...in Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the question that arose is that.  I sent an 
email on the 31 s t of August to the team that was delegated 
to negotiate the MSA ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...asking them what is purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Subsequent to that, on the 2 n d of September, I 
received feedback and that feedback, at the end of it, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 226 of 413 
 
amongst it, asked me for help and one of the things – one 
of the items that I was requested to assist on was the 
National Treasury’s ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Instruction note. 
MR KOKO:   ...instruction note.  And the question was:  
What did I do about it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I said I did nothing about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because the team knew my instructions on it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your position. 
MR KOKO:   My team knew my position on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But what was – is what was 
outstanding that you just explained as you have or there 
was more? 
MR KOKO:   Well, Mr Seleka took issue with the fact that I 
did nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
MR KOKO:   And I signed the instruction in August. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did provide that explanation.  So, 
Mr Seleka, do you remember what else there was to be still 
revisited? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  On that issue note, Chair. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 227 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Perhaps I should say, I did not take an 
issue with that that he did not do anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I was pointing out is that his 
version that he told Dr Ngubane about the requirement for 
Treasury approval was the one which I thought was new 
when he mentioned it for – the last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not that he did not do anything about 
10 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that issue has been traversed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the evidence is clear on that 
issue, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is alright.  Let us 
proceed then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I want us to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, before we start with Tegeta, I 
will just give a brief run-up ...[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 228 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...and then we will come to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   For now there are two issues.  Mr Koko 
then provided us with the documentation last time on the 
travel agents.  And my observation is this, Chair, because 
we were right at the end he was taking time taking the 
Chairperson through the documentation.  And I would have 
thought that the concession that Travel Excellence did do 
the arrangement for the trip from Indonesia to Dubai and 
10 
then from Dubai to Johannesburg, would have been given 
right at the beginning.   
 
But that concession was given to you at the tail 
end Chairperson.  That I do not dispute that Travel 
Excellence did the arrangements for the flight bookings.  
So that extent, Chair.  The documentation that was 
produced from Thompson’s do not disprove the evidence of 
Ms Sooliman.  So I do not need to ask question in regard 
to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me make sure I understand 
20 
that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one thing that was certainly said by 
Mr Koko last time was that the trip from Indonesia to Dubai 
...[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 229 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was booked by Travel Excellence.  
Now I cannot remember whether he also said from Dubai to 
Johannesburg also was Travel Excellence.  I just remember 
quite clearly from Indonesia to Dubai. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But from what you have said, it is like 
your 
understanding 
is 
that 
even 
from 
Dubai 
to 
Johannesburg he accepts that that was done by Travel 
Excellence.  Is that right? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That he did not dispute it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because that is in Travel Excellence’s 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Let me just clear that with 
Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your concession or admission in 
relation to Travel Excellence making bookings for you 
limited to the trip from Indonesia to Dubai or also – or it 
20 
extends to Dubai to Johannesburg as well? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, my answer is and again, I get workshop 
on the answering you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughs] 
MR KOKO:   So to - based on the workshop that I am 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 230 of 413 
 
giving, the answer is that I agree based on the evidence 
before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   That changes to my travelling plans from 
Indonesia to Dubai to Joburg ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...was booked by Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is sorted out. 
MR KOKO:   Now that it have answered your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
10 
MR KOKO:   I – there are two issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   And the first issue was that the affidavit of Ms 
Alana that served before you on the 1 s t of April or May, 
April/March was false because the travelling – Travel 
Excellence ought to have known that they did not book my 
travelling from Johannesburg to Indonesia to Dubai and 
back to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   They ought to have known. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   But two.  I have also said to you.  I have 
booked my trip through Thompsons from Johannesburg to 
Indonesia to Dubai – not to Dubai to Doha ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 231 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   ...back to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I – my family paid for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And it is only because of the problems we had 
with the visa that I requested assistance of Ms Daniels, I 
provide you with proof that we have paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And I have also motivated to you that Ms 
Daniels, instead of going to work, said here she went to 
10 
her friends.  So I concede – I accept the booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But what I need you to deal with is first the 
falsehood of Ms Alana’s affidavit because it is intended to 
– it is perjury.  It is a lie under oath that is deliberate.  
One.  Two.  It is another falsehood of Ms Sooliman’s 
affidavit that says on the 20 t h of June, which Essa paid 
hundred thousand for my travelling arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   When the evidence before you shows you that 
20 
the hundred thousand received ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  I think what you seemed to 
be saying is.  Except for the concession that you have 
made in relation to Travel Excellence making any bookings 
for you, namely for the trip from Indonesia to Dubai and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 232 of 413 
 
from Dubai to Johannesburg, except for that.  Any other 
booking that they say they did for you, you say it is false. 
Is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But I am also saying to you ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...that I do not know them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   They did not act under my instructions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes and I think you said they must 
have acted under Mr Essa’s, Daniels who would have been 
asked by Ms Daniels ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to arrange for those bookings. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of payment for that part of that 
trip or that leg of the trip.  Did you pay for that or what is 
the position? 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I gave you proof ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...from Thompsons ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...that they received – we have paid 308 – 78 
– three thousand eight hundred rands. [Speaker not clear] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 233 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   ...including the trip to Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR KOKO:   I gave it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the payment you made to Thompsons 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...included that part of the leg of the 
trip, namely from Indonesia to Dubai ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   To Johannesburg. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to Johannesburg. 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You did not pay to Travel 
Excellence. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You paid to the travel agents that you 
knew. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay.  Mr Seleka, at least, 
I think the areas of dispute are ...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...seem to be clear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes-no ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where there is agreement, it is 
clear. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 234 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, indeed, Chair.  That was 
going to be my next question which you asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I am listening to that answer given 
to you, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I wonder, Mr Koko, how do you get 
a trip and flight bookings, visas arranged for you by one 
agent and then you pay another agent?  And the payment 
that you have shown the Chairperson, it shows that these 
10 
are payments – they have November against them.  So I do 
not know whether the payments are made in November or 
of which year because the payment that Travel Excellence 
is talking about is made in January 2016.   
MR KOKO:   Chairman, I gave you an email from my 
daughter, Tato(?), dated December 14 to the agent that 
says for the three members of the party, Mrs Koko and 
Ms P Koko and Mr Koko.  They are – they are changing – 
they are making changes to their travelling plans...  So the 
first thing is that.  It has always been my family’s plans for 
20 
the three of us to go via Dubai in November already and 
for that, in November, we had paid R 51 000,00 for it 
because my wife got a budget – for that and we paid for it.  
So there is no ambiguity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 235 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   The point now ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...the point now is.  Once we had problems 
with the visas and I took all the documents that are before 
you except the ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on.  By the way, have those 
been put into a bundle now? 
MR KOKO:   We have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I will refer the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will refer to them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Now, all those documents with the exception 
of Mr Tato’s email which comes after the fact when we 
were running around to prove our innocence, which she 
said were given to Ms Daniels including our confirmatory 
invoice from Thompsons.  I said:  Ms Daniels, I am – we – 
my family wants to go to Dubai.  We are battling with the 
20 
visas.  You have always handled this for me, at least in my 
capacity at work.  Can you help her with?  This is the agent 
that I am working with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And she went to sort it out.  I did – I only 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 236 of 413 
 
know when we were looking at the records that I now know 
how she sorted it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR KOKO:   But the point is.  I have given you documents 
as evidence that shows you that we have paid from – 
through Thompsons, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On your version, the position would be 
that Thompsons were paid more than the work they did 
10 
because ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And not only were they – to be exact.  They 
were paid R 51 000,00 more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Which I never received back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   And I had no reason to receive it back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Because I got the service for the money paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 237 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What we have, just quickly.  The 
bundle has been prepared, Eskom Bundle 15(c).  Mr Koko, 
I think you will also have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  I do not want to forget 
this. 
 
I 
would 
be 
important 
to 
obtain, 
if 
possible, 
clarification from Thompsons because obviously if they did 
not make a booking, they should not have kept payment for 
a booking they did not make.  So it would be important to 
obtain what they have to say about this issue.  Okay 
10 
alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, indeed, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Seleka, I do not have 15(c). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, 15 ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   C. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, C. 
MR KOKO:   I have got A and B here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, here it is Mr Koko.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  These are the 
20 
bundles then, Chair, we received on Thursday last week.  I 
would like to refer the Chairperson to page 1554.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just say what bundle it is for the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 15(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 238 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1554.  This is the bundle of 
documents provided by Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Provided by? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On that page, 1554.  Mr Koko, are 
those the payments you are referring to ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Hang on one second. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that there is an affidavit by 
Mr Koko at the beginning of the bundle.  And that affidavit 
was deposed to on the 2 n d of December 2020.  Are the 
documents 
that 
are 
in 
this 
bundle 
attachments 
or 
annexures 
to 
that 
affidavit 
or 
are 
they 
standalone 
20 
documents? 
MR KOKO:   They are standalone documents, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are standalones. 
MR KOKO:   The affidavit in the first page ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 239 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   ...we have submitted previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But we cannot find – we actually handed it to 
you previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It was a correction of some of the errors of my 
previous affidavit that we have discussed previously with 
Mr Seleka.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But it is not in any of the bundles. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And counsel thought it prudent that we must 
include it for completeness sake of my bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
But 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
documents 
are 
standalones. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  We – okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Page 1554.  If 
Chairperson is there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am there. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko has 
said yes.  But Mr Koko, just for the benefit of the 
Chairperson.  So are the payments you say you made to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 240 of 413 
 
Thompsons? 
MR KOKO:   That is correct, Chair.  And there is no year 
there.  So this ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Oh, okay.  the payments that 
are highlighted there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is no year there but 17 November 
is 
17 
November 
2015 
and 
25 
November 
is 
10 
25 November 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And the total amount is R 383 800,00. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, Chair, those are the proves.  I 
think in light of the Chairperson’s request to us to obtain 
an affidavit from Thompsons, I will leave this matter at 
that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Because we know the payment by 
Travel Excellence, they say it is in January 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What Mr Koko’s concession may mean is 
that 
he 
has 
checked 
and 
the 
documentation 
from 
Thompsons does include payment for work they did not do.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 241 of 413 
 
Or, he might be meaning:  Look, based on what I – has 
been revealed, they did not make the payment.  They did 
not include certain parts of the work for which I paid them 
and – but whether or not – for some reason they paid – 
they included when they paid the airline.  I do not know.  I 
just want to clarify whether we are at a point where we say, 
the 
airline 
was 
paid 
for 
that 
change 
of 
the 
trip 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...by Travel Excellence. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Chairman, the documents are our travels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...as I looked at them ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are clear. 
MR KOKO:   ...do not show that Thompson ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...and Travel Excellence ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...ever talked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR KOKO:   ...note ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   They do not show that at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they do not, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 242 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Thompsons confirmed the booking from 
Johannesburg, Indonesia, Doha back to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Those are the documents before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is in this bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   The change in travelling plans, once our visa 
was confirmed, the documents also show they were done...  
10 
[Speaker is unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   From ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Travel Excellence. 
MR KOKO:   ...from Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Again, including the travel leg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So the travel leg – the return back was paid 
twice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Because Thompson was paid for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  The Joburg ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Thompson was paid – oh, you mean 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 243 of 413 
 
paid twice by different sources? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One payment coming from wherever. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Travel Excellence bought it. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the other payment having been 
made by you to Thompsons. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but Chair, if Mr Seleka wants to leave this.  
There are two issues I want to pick up ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...relating to Ms Sooliman’s affidavit.  And we 
dealt with it and I did not push back because I have always 
thought it is a minor issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And it is going to distract the bigger issue 
which is what we just dealt with.  And the bigger – the 
issue that I want to deal with is that there is a modification 
– there are changes on Ms Sooliman’s original affidavit 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 244 of 413 
 
that 
happened 
on 
the 
25 t h 
of 
March 
2015 
and 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Talk about who took the affidavit to the 
NPA or something? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because you did mention it. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, initially, before I could detect the 
falsehood of both ladies, I thought it is probably a mistake 
10 
but I can tell you no it is not a mistake because now after 
my appearance here I phoned Mr Anoj Singh.  I said:  Can 
you send – can you read me this paragraph that has been 
– what does it say?   
 
And it actually says – Ms Sooliman says:  I 
handed to the Commission the affidavit that I have 
submitted to the Hawks or to the police.  That she 
submitted to the Hawks.  So she says:  I submitted.  Now I 
think – I am looking – I have asked for it.  Because I can 
tell 
you, 
knowing 
their 
behaviour, 
chances 
are 
the 
20 
submission – the affidavit that she submitted to the police 
and the affidavit that we are working from here, it most 
likely says two different things.   
 
And Mr Seleka was not correct to show me an 
affidavit that she thought Ms Sooliman was referring to.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 245 of 413 
 
She was not referring to Ms Halima’s affidavit.  She was 
referring to the affidavit that she herself submitted to the 
police. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, I see that Mr Seleka is 
shaking his head but we – you did raise that issue last 
time.   
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, Mr Seleka, do you want to say what 
you want? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  We did. And the 
issue arose from the amendment made by Ms Sameera 
Sooliman in her affidavit where she changes the I, deletes 
that, and said it was Ms Alana.  She writes on margin of 
that.  And that is the explanation.  So we said, we have 
that affidavit which is the only affidavit that was given to 
us of Ms Halima Alana and she corrected the mistake that 
she is the one who submitted the affidavit.  We dealt with 
that.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But just to complete the story. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are coming tomorrow? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They will be testifying tomorrow. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 246 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Both of them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I intended to 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...mention that to the Chairperson.  
Both of them are coming tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And on the issue of announcement 
Chair.  Eskom’s attorneys, Bowman Gilfillan, I am at pains 
10 
to get an answer from the Chairperson on the cross-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] Or the leave to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] Ja.  So.  Chair does not have 
to mention it now but I thought ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...bring it to your attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have not forgotten about it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, tomorrow morning just remind me 
to indicate what is going to happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 247 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is another issue relating to that, 
now that they are coming up.  There is also a receipt that 
is purported to show a proof of payment where Ms Alana in 
her affidavit says I received the money in my house but the 
receipt says the money was received by Ms Halima.  And 
the affidavit – either the affidavit is wrong or the receipt is 
wrong.   
 
And Chair, it cannot be a mistake.  I counted 
more than five misrepresentations in this affidavit that 
when I raised them, they say no it is a mistake.  It is not a 
10 
mistake.  Either Ms Sooliman received the money or the 
receipt is a fault.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think I wanted to raise this 
question the last time but I do not remember that I did.  
You know they say they were asked by either Mr Salim 
Essa or to – by his secretary.  Obviously, the secretary 
would be acting on his instructions, I guess, to make 
bookings for you.  Now, you say you never had any 
dealings with them.  Is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   I do not know them, even today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know them, yes.  Now the 
question that which arise is.  If they made any - 
deliberately made any false statements in their affidavits 
about 
you 
or 
your 
travelling. 
 
One 
would 
look 
for 
...[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 248 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   The motive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The motive. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say:  you know, if you - if we know 
each other - you remember we were talking about - 
sometime back when you were giving your evidence, we 
were talking about... 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] If you had been friends, 
sometimes the relationship goes sour ...[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ... because of some reason.  So if your 
former friend makes certain false statements about you, 
you might connect it to the relationship having gone sour 
or whatever else but if it is somebody that does not know 
you, has never had any dealings with you, one wants to 
say why would they do that.  Now, I think they say 
themselves or one of them says in the affidavit they have 
never dealt with you.  They do not know you. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is correct, 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least one of them, I think says that. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that one is agreed with you that the 
two of you do not know each other.  They have never dealt 
with you.  on the face of it you would not expect somebody 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 249 of 413 
 
who has not dealt with you to deliberately lie about you  
but it may well be that there is some reason, there is a 
motive.  So I was wondering whether you are able to say 
what do you think why they would do that? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I had a good answer to that question 
myself and it is for that reason that up until the last time I 
was here accepted that the misrepresentation in the 
affidavits is nothing else but mistakes because they do not 
know me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   I do not know them. I mean ...[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They do not have any issues with you. 
MR KOKO:   They have no issues with me.  It is not like my 
maatjie(?).   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is not like miss Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So until I received my attorneys upon their 
request received a letter from Mr Essa’s attorneys of 
record that says actually here are the communications 
20 
between Ms Sooliman and Mr Salim Essa.  our client did 
make hundred thousand payment.  it was dropped by a 
gentleman called Shahiq and it was for the travelling 
details of Mr Essa, his wife and his son and his - I am not 
sure there is a son or...   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 250 of 413 
 
 
Let us say he is - for the neck of a better word.  
Here are the documents.  And then I sit back and I said but 
how can - and that was the email of the 18 t h of June 2015 
that was dropped on the 20th of June.  Now I sit back and 
say how can Sooliman miss such an important material 
fact.   
 
And not only do that but tell the Commission that 
this hundred thousand that I knowingly know well was for 
the travelling details off the family of Mr Essa.  Why does 
she allocate to Mr Koko?  It stops being innocent.  Now I 
10 
may not know the motive now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But This blows her cover that she is not acting 
innocently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, would it not - would the fact that 
there was R 100 000,00 that was paid, made on the same 
day that was for something else?  Would that scenario not 
suggest that they may be a greater possibility for a 
genuine misunderstanding of what was for what as opposed 
to a situation where there was no R 100 000,00 paid at all? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I can only work with the documents 
before us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the documents before us is that she 
received R 100 000,00 for a specific transaction which 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 251 of 413 
 
makes a dubious and suspect to allocate it to another 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, it comes from the same 
person that she says gave her ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what would the other R 100 000,00 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And that is convenience.  That same person 
has given to her the reasons for the R 100 000,00 in 
writing.  it says, here is my R 100 000,00.  Shahiq is 
10 
dropping it.  This is the reason for it.  Way back in 2015.  
So it is - me and you today have the benefit of hindsight.   
 
It is a document that existed in 2015 when we 
did not know that I will be sitting here in front of you as 
part of the Commission.  So it is not documents that are 
doctored.  They existed.  The only think she can say is that 
those documents are false.  That is the only thing that she 
can say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   But if there is no challenge on the document 
20 
and the documents are legit coma then it shows the - you 
know I have listened to Mr Makhubo who was sitting here 
and Mr Chaskalson - on the basis of his answers goes to a 
character.  and a set back and I shook my head and I said 
in this Commission it looks like certain witnesses are 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 252 of 413 
 
allowed to be an ethical - it is okay for as long as the other 
opponent belongs to a particular faction.  No, Chair.  the 
character of Ms Sooliman and the character of Ms Halima - 
it is in entirely based on their submissions.  It cannot be 
light.  It cannot be false.  It cannot be a mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, certainly what we want to establish 
is what the truth is because you have two travel agents 
here making certain claims in regard to the same family.  
The same about Mr Koko and his family and the travelling.  
So it is important to establish exactly what it is.  But I think 
10 
we have dealt with a period. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They will give evidence tomorrow. I am 
sure you will be watching. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they will be questioned about that 
issue.  I think – I hope Mr Seleka’s junior is noting that 
issue about that email from Mr Salim Essa saying what the 
R 100 000,00 was for. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us move on.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Now, Chair, I have told you the link.  The only 
person that I talked to was Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 253 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Now I do take note too that they say in their 
affidavits that they do not now Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   I have no ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...issues with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because clearly, I know evidence before the 
Commission here ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   ...that ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You analyses is that Ms Daniels spoke to 
Mr Essa. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Essa spoke to them. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, they know Mr Essa. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So just to say there 
20 
is no – on the – on what Travel Excellence says they 
arranged, Thompsons does not claim to have done the 
arrangement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And goes for that.  [Speaker not clear] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 254 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have – at some stage I thought 
that was right but over the time I think I may have mixed 
that up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is Travel Excellence’s version that they 
arranged only that part of the trip which was form 
Indonesia to Dubai and from Dubai to Johannesburg? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Thompsons – and that is subject by 
Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is Travel excellence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, Travel Excellence – Mr Koko, 
Travel Excellence – no, not Travel ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thompsons. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Thompson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Their version is that they made bookings 
for the trip from Johannesburg to...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To Indonesia. 
MR KOKO:   Indonesia, to Doha and to Johannesburg. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 255 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Doha. 
MR KOKO:   Back to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Back to Johannesburg. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is their version. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the part where they say back to 
Johannesburg cannot be right because that was done by 
Travel Excellence, is it not? 
MR KOKO:   It is correct.  They have done it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   They have made the booking? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but you travelled on the booking 
made by Travel Excellence? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  But then if it is so, they did 
the work.  What they might not have done is the payment 
for the ticket. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what ...[intervenes] 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...would not have taken place. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, okay alright.  So the – but is 
the – their booking in relation to Dubai, Johannesburg.  Is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 256 of 413 
 
it the same flight? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
No, 
no 
Chair. 
 
They 
did 
not 
book 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Dubai to Joburg. 
MR KOKO:   They did to book – no, they did not book 
Indonesia ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...Dubai back to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   They booked Johannesburg, Indonesia, Doha 
back to Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Which you never used. 
MR KOKO:   Which I never used.  Which I ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Johannesburg you never used. 
MR KOKO:   Which I never used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And I never got – I never reclaimed the 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay.  No, no, no.  Then I 
20 
understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So now I understand.  On what Travel 
Excellence claims in terms of what they booked, Mr Koko 
does not dispute anything. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 257 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Other than that, it was not at his 
instance. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as Thompsons is concerned, they 
say the booked Johannesburg to Indonesia, from Indonesia 
to Doha and from Doha to Johannesburg. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Johannesburg to Indonesia and 
10 
Indonesia to Doha was used? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Doha to Johannesburg was not 
used? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And but they were paid? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   And I did not claim the money back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you did not claim the money back, 
20 
ja. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So what they would have been 
entitled to is only the services for booking but the actual 
ticket, they were not entitled to claim that? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 258 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Correct. But remember, I did not go back to 
them and say:  You owe me money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I accept that you did not claim it 
back, ja. 
MR KOKO:   And there was a reason why. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because you said you did not know. 
MR KOKO:   Because I did not know.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But had you asked them to book a 
trip from Doha straight to Johannesburg? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had asked them? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did you ask them to change that? 
MR KOKO:   I asked Ms Daniels to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You asked Ms Daniels to do that. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you had asked them to book a 
flight from Doha to Johannesburg, you dealt with them 
20 
directly or did you ask Ms Daniels? 
MR KOKO:   I dealt with them directly.  My family dealt 
with them directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Directly, your family? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 259 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR KOKO:   And not only that Chair.  We paid R 51 000,00 
more ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   ...in anticipation that we are going to go to 
Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Which we never claimed that too. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  I think in that 
10 
context, Chairperson, you will see that it makes your 
question all the more important as to, if Travel Excellence 
has done the work ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...and it is accepted ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...who paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because they would have generated an 
invoice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They would have had to be paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So who paid for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 260 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Chair, you will recall – and 
Mr Koko I want to raise this with you so you can explain to 
the 
Chairperson 
that 
already 
in 
– 
on 
the 
3 r d of January 2016, you received your three visas, for you, 
your wife and the child from Businessman Info Portal.  
Chair, that is – could I refer the Chairperson – which 
bundle does the Chair has?  Oh, that is Eskom 15.   
MR KOKO:   Chair... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it 18(b) that Chair has?  I think it is.  
I think it is 18(b).  It must be ...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It must whichever one you asked them to 
put here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1088, Chair.  Let us go to page 1088.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 18(b)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page must I go to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1088. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1088? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And Chair once you have that, 
just give me an indication so I can move on to my next 
20 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is an – this the culmination of the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 261 of 413 
 
exchange 
of 
emails 
between 
Mr 
Essa 
and 
Travel 
Excellence, Chair.  The other emails are on the pages after 
this but they all come to this email from Businessman 
infoportal1@zoho.com on 3 January 2016 to Matshela 
2010, matshela2010@yahoo.com and it is a forwarding of 
the visas to Mr Koko which were received from Travel 
Excellence from Tjadida(?) Magette(?) re Koko family 
visas.   
 
That email, Mr Koko, gets to be forwarded – I 
mean it gets to be forwarded by you on Sunday – at the top 
10 
of the page – Matshela Koko on Sunday, 3 January 2016 to 
reception@grandestonbali.com(?)  So on the face of this, 
because you will see the email on Ms Tjadida Magette on 
the flipside on page 1089 as there are details which is 
Travel Excellence, 167 Rose Avenue and the rest of the 
information is there.  On the face of it, you would have 
seen that this document or your visas did not come from 
Thompsons.   
MR KOKO:   No, sir.  No, sir.  So before this, I had a text 
communications with Ms Daniels.  So I expected it.  It 
20 
came back from – and I have told you before that I have 
received it from the infoportal address.  I immediately 
forwarded it and all what attracted me – and you will see I 
have got it on my – I think a Samsung, a small phone, 
which does not give you the privilege to see the full detail 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 262 of 413 
 
of it.  So at no stage, up until 2018, did I know that this 
email, first originated from Travel Excellence and on the 
chain(?) was Salim Essa.  Not at all.  I only came to know 
about it on or around February 2018 and it was brought to 
my attention by Eskom.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, the documentation speaks 
for themselves.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The change of the trip for you not to 
travel directly from Doha to Johannesburg but – no 
...[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, ja correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, not to travel from Doha to 
Johannesburg but to travel from Indonesia to Dubai. 
MR KOKO:   Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And from Dubai to Johannesburg. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When was that made, that change? 
MR KOKO:   There is – you have got communications to 
20 
you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   You have got documents from Tato. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   On the 14 t h of December 2015. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 263 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that was done in December? 
MR KOKO:   2015, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay.. 
 
No, 
I 
just 
wanted 
to 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  And it was paid for ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...in November 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Then the one last thing on this 
aspect before I move on, Chair, is back to that Eskom 
10 
Bundle 15(c) which is the correspondence between the 
attorneys.  Mr Koko’s attorneys and the attorneys for 
Mr Salim Essa or what we are told by Mr Salim Essa’s 
attorneys, page ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1571. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Page 1571 is an email Chair from 
Mr Kgomotso Ndou, that is Mr Koko’s attorney sent on 
Saturday, 
20 
March 
2021 
at 
20:02 
to 
20 
nigel@shannonlaw.co.za.  The subject is Matshela Moses 
Koko, State Capture Commission of Inquiry.  It says” 
“Good day. 
We hereby act on behalf of Mr Matshela Moses 
Koko. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 264 of 413 
 
Our 
client 
has 
been 
summoned 
to 
give 
evidence at the State Capture Commission 
Inquiry to give evidence surrounding alleged 
state capture at Eskom. 
During 
1 
March 
2021, 
our 
client 
was 
questioned on the attached affidavit. 
According 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
affidavit, 
our 
client’s trip to Dubai was paid for by your 
client, Mr Salim Essa. 
We hereby kindly request confirmation in the 
10 
form 
of 
a 
written 
statement 
or 
collateral 
information from your client that the aforesaid 
payment have nothing to do with our client in 
order to put this issue to rest. 
Regards Kgomotso Ndou...” 
 
And his signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, you see the paragraph, the 
last paragraph of this email? 
MR KOKO:   [No audible reply] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a very curious request that has 
been made.  You did not get a written statement from the 
attorneys.  Is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   Which attorneys? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Salim Essa’s attorneys? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 265 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   We got a letter from them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but not a written statement? 
MR KOKO:   I got a letter from them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But not – okay.  Did you get a 
statement from Mr Essa? 
MR KOKO:   If you – I consider this letter a statement, 
Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay the Chairperson is still reading.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am listening.  I hear what you 
say.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you hear, Chair?   
CHAIRPERSON:   I hear, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the answer is a no you did not get a 
statement from Mr Salim Essa? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the statement is on page 10572. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay.  So that is a letter then 
Chair from what we are told is Mr Essa’s attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Chairperson you would have seen 
the paragraph.  Mr Koko referred to this letter but 
paragraph 4 – let me read 1 and 2: 
“We referred to your mail and your enquiry 
regarding the allegation made in an affidavit 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 266 of 413 
 
deposed to by a certain Halima Alana. 
The averment by Ms Alana is that our client, 
Mr Essa, allegedly made payment to the Travel 
Excellence for air tickets, which according to 
the deponent, was being issued to your client, 
Mr Koko, were paid for by our client by way of 
a 
cash 
deposit 
to 
Travel 
Excellence 
on 
20 January 2016...” 
 
And then they deal with this in paragraph 4.  
They say: 
10 
“The allegations by Ms Alana concerning your 
client are false. 
Our client did, in fact, make a cash payment to 
Travel Excellence on 20 January 2016 but this 
was in respect of his own air ticket and 
changes to travel arrangements for his wife 
and child which were effected through Travel 
Excellence. 
We annexed hereto an exchange of mails 
between Mrs Sooliman and our client which 
20 
clearly indicates that the R 100 000,00 cash 
payment by our client was for our client’s air 
ticket and the aforementioned amendments to 
the travel arrangements with the balance being 
held as a credit in favour of our client and not 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 267 of 413 
 
for travel arrangements for Mr Koko as falsely 
claimed in the affidavit...” 
 
So that is what they were asked to confirm, 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then they attached an email, which 
Mr Koko referred to, of the 18 t h of January 2016, where 
Mr Essa says – and that is on the next page, page 1574.  
Yes, please.  That is the top email.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, Mr Koko, one notes what the 
10 
attorney is saying which one takes it to be in accordance 
with their client’s instructions and that would need to be 
raised with the witnesses from Travel Excellence but it 
would have been better if they provided an affidavit by 
Mr Salim Essa under oath saying what he said here.  Or 
even better still.  If he came here and he gives evidence 
himself.  But I accept that you do not control ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I would think that the Commission has 
better control than I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I accept.  I am just mentioning 
20 
that it would have been much better.  I accept that you do 
not have control about ...[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And it would have been better for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no power to force it to come 
here. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 268 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Most certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   The only thing I said to you previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   That made me to trigger my attorney to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because every third week I get emails 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...from them on a different matter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but emails because we are in – when court 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Court, ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...with them and Eskom.  So every three 
weeks or four weeks ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ... I get an email from one of them. It is 
communicating 
with 
the 
courts 
but 
for 
some 
reason 
...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...I get all their communications with other 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well, it must be that they do not want 
to be accused of communicating with the court and leaving 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 269 of 413 
 
you out. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you are also involved in the same 
matter. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But – no, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, just to point out because 
that email on page 1574, Chairperson did note this last 
10 
time, that it is on the 18 t h of January 2016.  And Mr Essa 
says: 
“Yes, please.  Sending 100K which should, 
with Shaheed(?), to cover this - and leave me 
with some credit...” 
 
And the question was.  There is obviously a 
discrepancy 
between 
20 
January 
2016 
and 
18 January 2016.  I was going to ask Mr Koko whether did 
it take the driver two days to reach the Travel Excellence 
people to deliver the payment.  I do not know whether you 
20 
have an answer to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean, you would have asked 
Mr Salim Essa. 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  [laughs] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 270 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not Mr Koko.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   I was going to tell you ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR KOKO:   ...that I have no knowledge of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   All what I do know, based on the cover letter 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...is that the notification was on the 18 t h and 
10 
the delivery was on the 20 t h.  That is the only reasonable 
conclusion I can make, based on what is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Anyway, I assume that the 
witnesses from Travel Excellence have been alerted to this 
and they will be able to deal with it tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair we ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they are not, they need to be. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, they have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. We are going to have to 
move on but ...[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know if it is necessary for us to 
take another break.  We normally take it after two hours 
but could we please take a five minutes break? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 271 of 413 
 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair, may I just...  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   On this issue.  The documentation that 
came into our possession sometime in January, I believe, 
was the affidavit from Alana in February.  No, the affidavit 
from Alana was in January.  And you will recall, maybe not 
because that was quite a number of appearances ago as 
far as Mr Koko is concerned, but you will recall that we at 
that time asked that the original of this affidavit of 
Ms Alana should be produced and... 
10 
 
But 
in 
encompassing 
that 
request 
was, 
of 
course, the original documentation which is annexed to 
that document because these things all have audit trail and 
what we have seen was simply, in terms of those affidavit, 
for instance, one page out of a bank statement and the rest 
have been redacted.  But no sooner, at least, there must 
then be R 100 000,00 payments if one has regard to the 
full bank statements.   
 
But the point that I am simply making is that the 
original documentation is clearly very important to this 
20 
court because documents can be false, et cetera.  And for 
instance, a receipt book.  A receipt book – where are those  
receipt books. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Can they be produced to the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 272 of 413 
 
Commission?  And will we be allowed to inspect those 
documents?  Because – I think my learned friend at the 
time said that he will obtain the original affidavit and make 
it available to us but that has not happened.  But I am 
making a different point.  
 
 I am making the point that the court will have or 
the Commission will have to investigate the audit trails 
pertaining to these various transactions because they 
should be available.  And receipt books were apparently 
available in 2018.  So they should be available now as 
10 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Well, you reminded me of 
something I wanted to say much earlier Mr Barrie.  On the 
assumption that today is the last day for Mr Koko to give 
evidence.  If there are any issues you have raised that 
have not been attended to, I would like to know which ones 
those are in the form of a document.   
 
I think previously I asked for a document.  So do 
not forget that because I do want that all issues that you 
have raised be looked into and you get an answer one way 
20 
or another.  I do not want issues that will be left hanging.  
So I mention that.   
 
Of course, Mr Barrie has just mentioned the 
issue of the original affidavit and whatever, the receipts 
and so on.  So, Mr Seleka, do you want to say something 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 273 of 413 
 
response before we adjourn? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, on the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the affidavit we received that 
as submitted to the Hawks.  So they have wanted the 
original of that affidavit, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The original would be with the Hawks? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With the Hawks, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we have since obtained, ourselves 
10 
have since obtained affidavits from Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which we are specifically relying on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja/ 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  As evidence before ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have – I have asked investigators 
to obtain ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...to make a request to the Hawks in 
20 
regards to the original ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...of that affidavit which we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 274 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And has there been a response or not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am not aware whether there is a 
response from the Hawks.  I will have to follow up myself 
with the investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what can be done is, because 
probably the Hawks would like to keep the original. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What can be done is one of two things.  
Because it is Mr Barrie who wants to see the original. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously, if you want to see it you can 
do the same.  Is to arrange with the Hawks, to say in 
regard to this matter, if you are not going to release the 
original, can we at least visit your offices and inspect the 
original. 
 
So 
if 
Mr 
Barrie 
wants 
a 
letter 
from 
the 
Commission that will hopefully facilitate him seeing that, a 
letter can be ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...prepared and given to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He can use to the Hawks, to say:  I 
represent a client who has an interest in seeing the 
original and can I see it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   But Chairperson it is not really the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 275 of 413 
 
original 
affidavit 
as 
much 
but 
it 
is 
the 
original 
documentation.  The ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The receipts? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   The ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The receipts? 
ADV BARRIE SC:   They have to be somewhere.  And as 
your – as he has pointed out.  Presumable they will have 
that.  They will have the receipt books. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   And they should be able to produce 
10 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whatever original documents they have, 
which are relevant to our investigation, the Commission 
should be able to at least give you a letter that you can 
use to the Hawks to show that the Commission would like 
them to make it possible for you to see those documents. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   I would think, with respect, that that 
should 
come 
– 
that 
request 
should 
come 
from 
the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am saying that is one approach 
20 
but I am just saying because we are at the time at which 
we are in terms of the work of the Commission.  If the 
Commission might delay, one thing they can do is to give 
you a letter which that would facilitate.  So in the 
meantime, you do not have to wait for the Commission.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 276 of 413 
 
You can approach the Hawks and say:  In this request, I 
am supported by the Commission.  Here is a letter.  Then 
maybe they can...  Just in case, to avoid any delays.   
ADV BARRIE SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  I think, Mr Seleka, 
you can arrange for that to be attended to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Barrie or his attorneys can be given a 
letter that will ask the Hawks to ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Allow him to inspect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...make – ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they simply want to have sight 
and inspect it, ja.  Okay let us take a five minutes 
adjournment.  We adjourn 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, I 
remembered something during the adjournment that you 
20 
had in fact called one of the Travel Excellence ladies last 
year, late last year.  Ja?  You asked them about – ja, to 
ask them about this issue of payment? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not call them? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 277 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because one of them says you did call 
them.  
MR KOKO:   No, no, I have no relationship with these 
people. I do not know them I never spoke to them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or Ms Halima Allana. 
MR KOKO:   No, I have never talked to them, I do not know 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does she say that in an affidavit or…? 
MR KOKO:   No, she does not …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She has not reduced it to writing, 
chair, in affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, I have never spoken to them and if 
they say so then they look more suspect. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, she said she will check the 
records.  Mr Koko, you travelled from Indonesia to Dubai 
on the 4 January 2016.  You slept over there and travelled 
from Dubai on the 5 January 2016 back to South Africa, is 
20 
that correct?  
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  I understand that you slept over at 
the Oberoi Hotel. 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 278 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now if we could please – Chair, we can 
remove the other files, I would like us to go to Mr Koko’s 
bundle, Eskom bundle 15(b).  Page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the new file? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is an old file? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the old file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   15(b)? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   15(b) yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1476. 
MR KOKO:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From 1476. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, to make sense of the 
email trail because there is - you know, they always start 
at the bottom up, I would ask the Chair that we start at 
page 1480.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, there is 
20 
an 
email 
there 
on 
the 
3 
January 
2016 
at 
15.53, 
Reservations TODB and there is an email address and the 
email reads: 
“Dear Ms Sarah, greetings.  We have already made 
the 
reservation 
for 
Mr 
Matshela 
Koko 
under 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 279 of 413 
 
confirmation number 467415 and have shared the 
confirmation letter to Mr Ashu and cc’d to you.  
Please provide us with the guests’ mobile number 
and email address so we can arrange for the

instruction for the same.  Should you require any 
further assistance please do not hesitate to contract 
us, 
warm 
regards, 
Ria 
Poma(?), 
Reservations 
Oberoi.” 
I have read this to you, Mr Koko, which is confirmation of a 
10 
reservation made for you and they say confirmation letter 
has been shared with Mr Ashu.  Do you know Mr Ashu? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair, I know Mr Ashu, I have met him 
once. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Do you have any comment in 
regard what is stated in this email? 
MR KOKO:   I have no personal knowledge of this email so 
I have no comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Let us proceed to page 1479 
because you will recall she asked: 
20 
“Please provide us with the guest’s mobile number 
and email address so we can arrange for the 
transfers accordingly and kindly advise the billing 
instruction for the same.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I was just making a note 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 280 of 413 
 
here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page did you go to from 1480.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we are going in reverse order, 
Chair.  1479. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Just read again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the bottom of the page, the email 
trail starts, one is from Ashu Chwala at …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On Sunday 3 January 2016 and it is to 
Reservations TODB, c.c. Sarah Donhowin(?).  The subject 
10 
is booking for Sahara Computers.  Is that the one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct and it is a reply, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the time is 5.58 p.m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So she is replying to Ria Poma and 
she says: 
“Dear Ria, Sahara will pay the entire bill.  Please 
do not ask any credit guard guarantee from the 
guest at the time of check-in.” 
20 
And at the previous page is a – stamps. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko in regard to this exchange? 
MR KOKO:   No, I have no personal knowledge of these 
emails. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 281 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then still on page 1479, Chairperson.  
We go up, it is an email from Sarah still on Sunday the 3 
January 2016 at 16h00 to Ashu Chawla and reservations 
TODB cc’ing Duty Manager and it is also a reply: 
“Booking for Sahara Computers” 
And she writes: 
“Dear Ashu, the below is noted and the team has 
been informed.  Also for future bookings unless you 
let us know which guests will pay we will not ask for 
credit card guarantee or payment.” 
10 
Will your response be the same? 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then, Chairperson, we can go finally to 
page 1476.  The first email is the second from the top, so 
that is the email of 15.52, that is the time stamp. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC: From the Oberoi Dubai reservations. 
TODB.  As I said it is the 3 January again, 2016: 
“Subject:  Reservation confirmation at the Oberoi 
Dubai/Matshela 
Koko/467415. 
 
It 
is 
sent 
to 
20 
Ashu@Sahara.co.za, cc’d Sarah@oberoihotels.” 
And you see confirmation of reservation confirmation.  The 
guest name is Mr Matshela Koko with all the details.  
Arrival date Monday 4 January 2016 and the arrival details.  
At the bottom left hand corner, Chair, there is kind of a 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 282 of 413 
 
message, Mr Koko. 
“Dear Mr Koko, thank you for choosing the Oberoi 
Dubai.  We are pleased to confirm your reservation 
and look forward to welcoming you to the Oberoi 
Dubai.  Yours sincerely, Ria Poma.” 
Did you receive this confirmation, Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you have any comment in regard to 
this email? 
MR KOKO:   The only comment I have, Chair, is the – if the 
10 
email from Ashu to Mr Salim Essa which is in accordance 
to my proposition I have told you.  I have said to you from 
day one that my travelling plans were done through Ms 
Daniels and I have told you that Ms Daniels went to her 
friends to arrange the travelling plans and this just proved 
that.  This just proves exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this seems to suggest that Sahara 
Computers or Ashu Chawla made bookings for you only in 
regard to the accommodation whereas Travel Excellence 
maybe made bookings in terms of the actual flights. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR KOKO:   Just looking at the documents here. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 283 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that seems to be the position.  And 
now in terms of accommodation, had you asked Thompsons 
to 
make 
bookings 
for 
accommodation 
in 
the 
other 
destinations? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they had made them? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had not asked them to make any 
bookings about Dubai because… 
MR KOKO:   Because Dubai was part of my change in 
10 
plans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So the booking of the plane tickets and the 
accommodation would be done by the party that does the 
change in travelling plans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so on your understanding up to 
2018 or maybe up to more recent your understanding was 
that the accommodation in Dubai had been booked by 
Thompsons as well? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, Alright,. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, the accommodation in 
Dubai – was that the question, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But that will beg the question, Mr 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 284 of 413 
 
Koko, if your understanding was that the accommodation in 
Dubai was done by Thompsons, is that what you say? 
MR KOKO:   At all material times, Chair, my change in 
travelling plans were done through Ms Daniels using 
Thompsons because I paid Thompsons, I did not pay 
anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but you did say to the Chairperson 
last time when you were here that you did enquire with Ms 
Daniels why she used a different travel agency. 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, no.  Chair, once again, transcripts will 
dispense of it.  I asked Ms Daniels why am I receiving my 
visas on an email address that you gave me on the basis 
that it belongs to the Chair, why would the Chair of Eskom 
get involved in my visa travelling?  And her answer was it 
was convenient.  That is the only thing you will find in the 
transcripts, you will not find what Mr Seleka says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but that is – no, I have not said 
anything.  You interrupted me, that is what I was going to 
say.  So then, Chair, the email on that page, Mr Ashu 
20 
emails it or forwards it to Mr Salim Essa.  Mr Koko has 
already touched on that and that is the last …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1476. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 285 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We were on… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, here at the top? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the top, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So those reservation confirmations 
seems to have been emailed then by Mr Ashu Chawla to Mr 
Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the amount that you paid to 
Thompsons included also the accommodation? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes, except that when I got to Oberoi, I 
10 
was made to pay.  I was made to paid contrary to the view, 
I was made to pay and I paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And when I – one of the questions I asked 
from – while I was still in Dubai and the answer I got, no, 
your accommodation in Dubai you have to pay and I paid 
and the evidence before you today, if it has not been given 
to you, will show you that I paid – I made a direct payment 
to Oberoi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Well, I am just thinking this 
20 
thing is becoming more confusing because Mr Gama who 
gave evidence last week in relation to Transnet, he also 
had a trip that took him to this same hotel at some stage, I 
think it was the end of …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   From the World Economic Forum. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 286 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
MR KOKO:   For the World Economic Forum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might have been from the World 
Economic Forum. 
MR KOKO:   Yes and [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if I recall correctly, under the 
Transnet work stream there is evidence suggesting that he 
was – it may have been paid for by Sahara Computers, the 
same Chawla, Ashu Chawla, I think, is mentioned in emails 
connected with his stay there and there is correspondence 
10 
from that hotel to Mr Ashu Chawla about Mr Gama’s stay 
but Mr Gama has also produced and invoice and says he 
paid for himself.   So I am just saying …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Ja.  Chair, I cannot speak for… 
CHAIRPERSON:   For other people. 
MR KOKO:   For other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I accept that. 
MR KOKO:   In the same way – I do not know where these 
emails come from.  I suspect they come from the Gupta 
emails stuff and I do not want to get to  - to take you into 
20 
the authentic or not, for me …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are not interested. 
MR KOKO:   I am not interested in it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   What I will show you, as part of this bundle, is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 287 of 413 
 
my email communication with Oberoi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It is what I will show you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   And you have to make the judgment call which 
ones are authentic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Because I have an email – when this story 
broke out, because I paid, I wrote to them and I said give 
me proof, give a receipt, they gave me a receipt. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I took the same receipt to parliament.   Mr 
Seleka asked for it, I gave it to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I believe he has not received it but I gave it to 
him again.  My counsel had a problem with it.  He queried 
it and queried it and then we said okay, let us write to 
them again, you know, kill this story, let us – we wrote to 
them and they responded and they confirmed that I paid to 
them.  Again this is before. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   The rest of the – whether these emails are 
authentic or not, you have got investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Authentic or not, you are not interested 
in that. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 288 of 413 
 
MR 
KOKO: 
 
 
I 
am 
not 
interested, 
you 
have 
got 
investigators and they must deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Let us go now 
to page – okay, we are done with those pages, Chair.  That 
is on the 3 r d.  Now on the 4 t h, let us go to page 1482.  
There are two emails there …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page again, I am sorry, I was just 
making some notes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1482. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   1482.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, you will see there are two 
emails, the one is right at the foot of the page but that 
seems to relate to a different person, Mr Dan Mantsha.  So 
we will confine ourselves to the email at the top.   
“From concierge TODB, Monday 4 January 2016 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, where is the one that relates 
to Mr Dan Mantsha? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Right at the bottom of the page, it goes 
20 
over to the next page.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Dan Mantsha might be the person 
who was Chairperson of the Denel board from about mid-
year 2015.  Okay, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  So for present 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 289 of 413 
 
purposes, Chair, we concentrate on the top one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You focus on what concerns your 
work stream.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, what concerns the witness before 
me, Chair.  I have seen that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  “ 
“Concierge to Mr Ashu Chawla.  Re drop off” 
So it is a reply to his email at the bottom but let us see 
what the person is writing. 
10 
“Dear Mr Chawla, greetings from the Oberoi Dubai.  
Please note the chauffeur details mentioned below 
for the drop towards Emirates Hill.” 
Then the chauffeur’s name is given with the mobile number 
and then it reads: 
“Please also note the chauffeur details for the 
arrival transfers arranged for Mr Koko.” 
Then the name is also given for the chauffeur with the 
contact numbers. 
“Please contact me at the concierge for any further 
20 
assistance.  Warm regards.” 
So, Mr Koko, on the face of this, it again looks like Mr 
Chawla was involved in the arrangement for a chauffeur for 
you on the 4 January 2016.  Do you have any comment? 
MR KOKO:   I have no personal knowledge of this, Chair. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 290 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Then let us go to page 1484, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Koko, this appears to 
be an invoice from the Oberoi Hotel addressed to Sahara 
Computers.  The invoice is dated 10 February 2016. 
10/02/2016. 
“Kind attention accounts department.” 
Date – and the column regarding dates, they give the dates 
and the first entry is 4/01/2016, 4 January 2016 and in 
10 
regard to the particulars is your name, Koko Matshela A 
and they give the details 4 January 2016 – oh, it is arrival 
date and departure date.  4 is arrival, January 2016, and 
departure date is 5.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess A after Koko Matshela must be 
for arrival because he does not have an initial with A. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So D stands for departure, A for arrival. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the fees are indicated.  The next 
entry again has the same date, it is like a repetition of the 
first entry and then they give the amount of 3 160.  Then 
there are other persons there as well which I will leave this 
to the Chairperson. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 291 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They are familiar names, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So three more people seem to have 
been – at least one’s dates coincide with yours, Mr Koko, 
the others came there after you on the 22 January and the 
14 January 2016.  Mr Duduzane Zuma on the 14 January 
2016.  Do you wish to comment on this because it is an 
invoice addressed to Sahara Computers? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  If there is any document you need to 
10 
verify that is blatantly false is this.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   If there is any document you need to verify 
that in my view is blatantly false and is not in accordance 
with the evidence before you, that I will show you is this 
one.  This one and the next one following it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   One.  But, two …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let us go to the next one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are the reasons the same for both why 
20 
you say they are false? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they are the same then let us go to the 
next one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, they are not the same, Chair. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 292 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   No, the reasons are the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he would know which reasons he is 
advancing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, the reasons? 
CHAIRPERSON:   His reasons, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, but these documents are not the 
same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go to the next document so that 
he can give me the reasons only once. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I am with you, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Page 1485.  Mr Koko has already 
seen this from his comment.  So this is, on the face of it, 
an invoice with the name Mr Matshela Koko and under that 
name is Sahara Computers and then there is a DBL, South 
African travel agent.  That one is blank, no name is given.  
Against the name company you have Sahara Computers 
and there is a billing, the invoice on the right hand side, 
Chair, where you have the room number, 1601 guests.  
Arrival, you have the same date and departure, the bill 
20 
number, the rate, printed on 2 February 2016, the cashier’s 
name is also there and this, on the face of it, Mr Koko, 
seems to relate to your stay at the hotel,  Description of 
what they charged for, mini-bar, food, in-room dining food, 
accommodation charge, tourism fee, rooms municipality fee 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 293 of 413 
 
and so on.  So then you can address the Chairperson in 
regard to this invoice, which seems to be a charge for the 
services rendered to you, but directed either to yourself or 
to Sahara Computers. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, can you go to Eskom bundle 15(c)? 
CHAIRPERSON:   15(e)? 
MR KOKO:   (c). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next one, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   Yes but please do not move away from 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   From this page. 
MR KOKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, that is alright.  Eskom bundle 
15(c).  Have you got a page number? 
MR KOKO:   Page 66. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1565. 
MR KOKO:   Page 66. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page number? 
MR KOKO:   1565. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1565.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
MR KOKO:   The document you have in front of you on 
page 1565 on Eskom bundle 15(c), it is an invoice dated – 
printed on the 6 October 2017 and it was emailed to me by 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 294 of 413 
 
Oberoi and it is a correct invoice.  The document that you 
looked at in 15(b), Eskom bundle 15(b), 1485, purports to 
be the invoice.  I do not know what is the source of it but 
the document coming from Oberoi tells you services that 
was rendered to me that I received. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know you are struggling because you 
have small space there but when you speak away from the 
mic I cannot hear you. 
MR KOKO:   Understood, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright, just make the point 
10 
again?  You said the invoice that is at… 
MR KOKO:   1565, bundle 15(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the correct invoice. 
MR KOKO:   I an invoice sent to me by Oberoi.  It is in my 
name, top left, Matshela Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   It has no company names – name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It shows that I made a direct payment on the 4 
January 2016. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Direct payment.  You will see that it has got a 
– it is a stamp from Oberoi that says Invoice Paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  But that is only reference to Oberoi.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 295 of 413 
 
My counsel had a problem with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had a problem with which one? 
MR KOKO:   The document you see on Eskom 15(c) 1565. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
MR KOKO:   And the problem my counsel had was that the 
only reference to Oberoi is that stamp and nowhere else 
does it show that it comes from …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That hotel. 
MR KOKO:   From the hotel and basically my counsel 
pushed back on it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And then on page – on the next page, Eskom 
bundle 15(c), 1566. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   You will see there an email from me to Oberoi 
Hotel and it is in 2018, February and it is the general 
manager of the Oberoi Hotel and I said to him – and I write 
to him 24 minutes past eight in the morning, on the 
morning of the 13 February, on Tuesday and I say to the 
general manager  - and his name is there, I say: 
20 
“My name is Matshela Koko and the copy of my 
passport photo is attached.” 
I have to send in a copy of my passport to authenticate 
myself otherwise anybody can do that. 
“I arrived at your hotel on 4 January 2016 and left 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 296 of 413 
 
on 5 January 2016.  I was booked in room 1601 with 
my wife and my young son.  My bill number is 
76255, I made a direct payment and no third party 
paid for me, I need the information invoice please.” 
On the next page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is page 1567? 
MR KOKO:   Page 1567, the general manager  of the 
Oberoi Hotel responds to me: 
“Dear Mr Koko, thank you for your kind email and 
for having been our guest on 4 January 2016 for 
10 
one 
night. 
 
As 
requested, 
please 
find 
above 
attached the invoice for your last stay with us.  
Should you require any further information please 
do not hesitate to contact me directly.  Best 
regards.” 
On page 1570, that is the Oberoi invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1570? 
MR KOKO:   1570. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And this met the requirements of my counsel 
20 
and you will see that it – at the top it comes from Oberoi, 
invoice directed to me, again paid direct payment.  So I 
cannot talk to other communications between Oberoi and 
Ashu Chawla and I do not know them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 297 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   I communicate directly with Oberoi for the 
payment that I made directly and that is all what I can – 
that is my evidence to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   The rest I do not know and I cannot talk about 
other people that are not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  The same thing that 
has happened here has happened in the case of Mr Gama, 
so I think, Mr Seleka, you and Mr Myburgh, who is the 
evidence leader in the Transnet work stream need to talk 
10 
to try and establish what is going on here because in 
respect of Mr Gama, with reference to the same hotel, 
there is an invoice that has got the hotel’s name and that 
also that is addressed to Mr Ashu Chawla or Sahara 
Computers and on the fact of it you will say that the 
booking was made – you would say that Mr Gama is 
associated with or is part of Sahara Computers and then - I 
think that invoice had been obtained by the investigation 
team maybe from the Gupta Leaks, I am not sure.  And 
then Mr Gama had obtained an invoice from the same 
20 
hotel.  I do not know if it was two invoices, from the same 
hotel because he too maintained that he had paid for 
himself on the occasion of his stay in that hotel.  He 
contacted the hotel and he said he obtained an invoice.  
Now one of the invoices, there were two invoices in regard 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 298 of 413 
 
to Mr Gama or if not three, I cannot remember, but one of 
them also had the date stamp, just like one of these date 
stamps.  The other one I might not have had the stamp and 
might not have had the name of the hotel either.  So the 
same issues arise where there is correspondence that 
suggests that the invoice was sent to Sahara Computers or 
that Sahara Computers paid but the guest also says I paid 
and obtains from the hotel documentation that suggests 
that they paid.  So it looks like… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Like the travel agents …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is one thing, there is one step 
you are not mentioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well maybe I was still going there but 
mention it. 
MR KOKO:   The step is, it is not the evidence before you 
that Sahara paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   It is not the evidence that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Or it is not the submissions being made to you 
that Sahara paid …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not going …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   And I have not even seeing any …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to …[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 299 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   I am not seeing any evidence before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   That says Sahara paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I am not that far yet, you 
know, but you are right to mention that but with or without 
them having paid, there is sufficient concern to say what is 
going on here, you know?  You know, what exactly is going 
on?  So, I think, the evidence leaders must look into that 
and probably something more needs to be done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To try and establish what exactly is the 
position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  But to go to your reasons, 
Mr Koko, because I think you did not actually complete 
your reasons why you say the one on bundle 15 at page 
1485 is false.  Are you saying that because one, it does 
not have the name of the hotel?  Two – is that what you 
say? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, there is a lot of issues I can say but I 
20 
will not say them.  All what I can tell you is this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   The date of this invoice is 10 February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the date when it was printed? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, top right corner. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 300 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see 2 February, you say 10. 
MR KOKO:   Well …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am talking about the one at bundle 15 
page 1485 because that is the one you say is false. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, on page 1485, bundle 15(b) just at the 
of the box there is a date there.  I read there …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   For printing or for what?  I see three 
dates, one for your arrival, one for departure …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, no, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One for printed on. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Just on top of the total amount 275 with the 
date right at the top. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I think Mr Koko is on a different 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I suspect so. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, you are right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1484. 
MR KOKO:   1484, I apologise, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR KOKO:   The date at the top I read it as 10 February 
20 
2016.  That is the date of the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the one which is 1485 is an invoice, 
the one at page 1484 …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I sincerely apologise, I am probably 
misleading but it is …[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 301 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, let us not speak at the same 
time, Mr Koko.  The one at page 1484 – oh, is also an 
invoice.  Okay, I did not realise that. 
MR KOKO:   They are both invoices, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but the one is for a 
number of people. 
MR KOKO:   The one is for a number of people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the other one is for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
MR KOKO:   So the one printed on the 10 February says 
that I owed Oberoi Hotel 3 435 Dirham.   
CHAIRPERSON:   As at the 10 February. 
MR KOKO:   As at the 10 February, ja, and I am saying 
that is false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Right, if you go to the next one, it is printed 
earlier, it is printed the 2 February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   An it says I do not owe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that, yes. 
MR KOKO:   It says I do not owe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So just at the face of it, one of them is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 302 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So, it cannot both be right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then, of course – well, the one that 
you obtained after your counsel had raised issues about 
the one at 1485, that one appears to be an original invoice. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the balance there is …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Is zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Zero. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I does not indicate when it was printed, 
of course, or does it? 
MR KOKO:   It does, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, where is that? 
MR KOKO:   It does not but the email accompanying it is 
February 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, okay, so …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Just the audit trail show the falsehood of what 
is in the Gupta emails, allegedly.  So – and but I do not 
20 
want to be the one dealing with the falsehood of the audit 
trail, on the false – all what I am simply saying to you, by 
simply looking at it and doing the audit of the documents 
you 
find 
in 
the 
audit 
trail, 
there 
are 
significant. 
contradictions to them.  But finally, it is still directed to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 303 of 413 
 
Sahara and I had nothing to do with Sahara. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, I must just also mention – I 
forgot something.  You see, the invoice at page 1485, one 
of the two that you say must be false …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I am there, Chair, bundle 15(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, has got Mr Matshela Koko, Sahara 
Computers. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I did not double-check but I suspect that 
the one that you obtained after your counsel had raised 
10 
issues with this one does not have Sahara Computers. 
MR KOKO:   No, it does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because obviously if it had you would 
raise the issue. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it does not.  Even the one …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the position is that you had 
nothing to do with Sahara Computers. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  Even the one that I obtained before 
my counsel queried, it did have Sahara. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I want to say Mr Gama’s one 
20 
or one of those ones also had Sahara Computers and then 
the one that he obtained himself did not have any mention 
of Sahara Computers.  So I am just mentioning that there 
are these features about this hotel and its invoices that are 
…[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 304 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I assume you are making a big 
assumption that these emails are correct.  I have just 
showed you the contradictions …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I have just said to Mr Seleka, 
you remember I said he and the other evidence leader must 
look into this because you cannot – on the face of it you 
cannot have this kind of situation. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes.  Just – please recognise my 
approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR KOKO:   My approach is the one that say I will talk to 
the evidence I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I understand that. 
MR KOKO:   I will not rubbish the other evidence, it will 
rubbish itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I will only talk to what I know, I will only… 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I understand that but, you 
see, you can afford to take that approach because you are 
not sitting here. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sitting here and having seen that 
the same thing has happened in another work stream in 
regard to the same hotel concerning somebody who was a 
guest at that hotel, I have to say what is going on here?  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 305 of 413 
 
So that is why I said the investigators must …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Understood, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Koko, insofar as 
whether or not Sahara paid, we have seen that email from 
Mr Ashu Chawla saying to Ria: 
“Sahara will pay the entire bill, please do not ask 
any credit card guarantee from the guest at the time 
10 
of check-in.” 
And then obviously see that invoice goes to them.  I want 
to ask you this, Mr Koko.  When you say you paid for 
yourself on arrival, were you not given proof of your 
payment? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I was.  That is 2015.  The documents 
before you, you realise that I have to retrieve them and 
email them.  I had them before.  But I did not have the 
foresight 
that 
I 
will 
be 
sitting 
here, 
needing 
those 
documents.  All the documents I have here, I acquired 
20 
them later.  I had them before and if I knew that I will be 
sitting here I would have kept everything safe but I did not 
expect to be sitting here, so I do not have them.  But I was 
given …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I assume you would have paid with your 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 306 of 413 
 
card? 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair, when I travel, I bought a lot of – at 
the airport, just what you buy, a lot of [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   …and Euros. 
MR KOKO:   Yes and you buy, you pay, you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you paid cash. 
MR KOKO:   I paid cash, yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja 
because 
clearly 
from 
the 
communication they were told not to take your card for the 
10 
purposes of guaranteeing the payment when you are 
checking in, so it seems card was the method by means of 
which you would have had to guarantee your payment 
based on that email exchange with the hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course he had cash he would not 
have to guarantee anything. 
MR KOKO:   I do not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because he would just give them and 
that is it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, my question was, number one, 
20 
because this was a follow-up.  Number two is, of course 
these are invoices that you have requested in February 
2018.  There is no proof of payment.  These are just 
invoices that either were issued to you or to Sahara 
Computers but there is no proof of payment.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 307 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, the invoice tells you who made the 
payment and that should be good enough.  It says so, a 
direct payment by the client.  That is what it says.  I do not 
– I cannot take it any further than that, the invoice speaks 
for itself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course on your version, Mr Koko, if 
your version is true, let us proceed on that basis, then the 
scenario which would emerge is that people connected with 
Mr Salim Essa or Salim Essa and Sahara Computers, Mr 
10 
Chawla, they are all busy together with travel agents they 
use, namely Travel Excellence, they are all busy wanting to 
make bookings for your travelling and accommodation and 
even wanting to pay for these in circumstances where you 
have nothing to do with them.  Of course you say Ms 
Daniels is the one who is putting them to all of this without 
my knowledge.  You agree, that is the picture that 
emerges. 
MR KOKO:   I agree but there is one step further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   I have made submissions to you that all 
material times I know who paid for my travels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   So at no material times – there is no 
ambiguity. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 308 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I have given you documentary proof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that. 
MR KOKO:   About the payments.  But I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  So on your version it is Ms 
Daniels who just does not want you to use your own money 
as 
far 
as 
she 
is 
concerned 
for 
this 
travelling 
and 
accommodation, she wants these people to make bookings 
for you and to pay for you in circumstances where, from 
your point of view, they do not know you, they have nothing 
10 
to do with you, but she is buy wanting them to incur all of 
these expenses and they probably do not even ask why 
must we pay for Mr Koko, Ms Daniels?  Why?  We do not 
know him, we have nothing to do with him, why must we 
pay for him?   You understand that that is the scenario that 
emerges? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes and I need to comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, comment on it, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, one of the things you must look at, it is 
a document that I got from your legal team and I have 
20 
come to accept that some documents are made available to 
me by your legal team and your investigators, but you 
never come to see them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  You mean I never come to see 
them? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 309 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes? 
MR KOKO:   So I have come to accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are not in the bundle, the bundles. 
MR KOKO:   I need you go and read the judgment that is 
written by a colleague of [indistinct – dropping voice] Mr 
Cassim.   
CHAIRPERSON:   About Ms Daniels? 
MR KOKO:   About Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have read it. 
10 
MR KOKO:   And you will – once you read that judgment 
you will then get a picture of who Ms Daniels is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, I read it before she came to 
testify for the first time. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And once we look at this evidence, you will 
not take long to realise who Ms Daniels was doing the 
bidding for.  I did not know that but now I have regards to 
the evidence.  In bundle – in part 3 of Eskom 15(c), I have 
20 
included emails that shows her communications, blind copy 
me, vice versa.  I am curiously waiting for the report of 
Prof Bux of the forensics.  When we were here we made to 
write a letter to him which we did.  My proposition is that 
you are going to find all these letters on her computer.  In 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 310 of 413 
 
her affidavit, in her transcript and I can take you to them 
because I have got it, she accept and concedes that the 
letters of suspensions comes from her.  The origination of 
the template comes from her.  The professor says it comes 
from her computer and was modified on another computer, 
of an Apple computer.  They have offered her R800 million 
at Megawatt Park.  I never had that contact with her.  She 
says no, she wakes up on a Saturday morning to a meeting 
in Melrose Arch to meet people with pyjamas.  I am simply 
saying, once you have regard to the transcripts when Ms 
10 
Daniels was dismissed, you will not spend long to see who 
was the main Gupta man at Eskom or woman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us say she was a Gupta person 
at Eskom.  This is 2015 or early 2016 when you returned 
from your trip.  Now I go back to a question I raised earlier 
on.   At that time during that year the two of you were still 
close based on what you testified.  Now I am trying to 
understand what her motive would have been to say look, I 
know Mr Koko uses Thompsons for travelling arrangements 
but – and he will pay them, for himself, but I am going to 
20 
ask Mr Salim Essa to speak to the travel agents he uses to 
say can they make bookings for him and then maybe she 
asked 
him 
to 
talk 
to 
Mr 
Chawla 
to 
arrange 
the 
accommodation.  So I go back to the question of what is 
the motive because the one thing she must think about is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 311 of 413 
 
that if you wanted her to talk to Thompsons to make 
bookings for you and she has gone now to other people 
you will not be happy with that.  Why is she…? 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  So, Chair, remember, this is a trip that I 
paid fully for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR KOKO:   And the only thing that was a problem was a 
visa which my experience with her was that those type of 
arrangements she will easily dispose of, easily, quickly, 
that is the only reason I went to her.  My proposition is that 
10 
it was easier for her to deal with these friends to sort out 
my problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And that is why when I asked her post facto, 
she said it was convenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, warn me not 
to touch on everything Mr Koko but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I said non-material things.  If it is 
something important, material, obviously you have deal 
20 
with that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  Mr Koko you realise 
you are saying the invoice says that it is payment by the 
client. 
MR KOKO:   It is a direct payment. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 312 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, by the client. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it does not say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he said direct payment which he 
said he is interpreting to mean payment by him. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay.  Yes, no, I just wanted to 
establish that that is his interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is his interpretation, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes and it is specific, Chair.  If I can read to 
you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, do not read it, Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we will see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will know – but we have seen it, ja.  
Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, then that completes this 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the travelling. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the travelling, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we put away these bundles or…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bundle 15(b) we should still use it.  
The other ones we can put away. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 313 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hopefully we will be brief on this one, 
Mr Koko.  It is a question that had been asked at the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee and, Chair, in Eskom 
15(b) if we could go to page 1081 and this in regard to the 
Guptas.  Page 1081, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not have 10… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   …81. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I have got one that is written by 
hand when other pages are typed.  Is that the one you are 
10 
talking about?  It is on Mr Koko’s affidavit, supplementary 
affidavit.  Mr Koko’s supplementary affidavit starts on 1047 
and goes up to 1098.  So 1081 is page 37 of his affidavit.  
Do we have different bundles? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that Eskom …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise his affidavit the next page 
that is type in terms of pagination is 1184. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that 15(b), Chair, what you have? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think so, I think I checked.  Yes, 
Eskom bundle 15(b). 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to double-check whether 
you have got the same? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I see – the Chairperson has – 
okay, I am at 10.  Let us see, Chairperson, because the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 314 of 413 
 
transcript starts on page 1047. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second, just see this 
letter that sets out Mr Koko’s concerns as at 3 December 
2020 but I think that is the one that we have dealt with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Yes, you see, the last page 
before Mr Koko’s supplementary affidavit is 1181.  No, 
maybe I  - I think I went to 11 instead of 10. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, now I have 1081.  I think I was 
10 
at a wrong place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Koko’s supplementary affidavit 
needs to be properly paginated in terms of typed - in terms 
of it being typed, in terms of the pagination being typed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think that affidavit is misplaced, 
Chair.  I know it is somewhere else properly paginated.  I 
need to look at the Chairperson’s bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   When we are finished, you know, you 
must take it and make sure that it is put in the right place. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am at 1081. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair, you will see 1081 Mr 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 315 of 413 
 
Koko, you are already there. 
MR KOKO:   I am there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   First tell us what is the document at 
page 1081, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a transcript of the Eskom Inquiry in 
parliament? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
The 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
Committee, correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay and it starts at page 1047? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it continues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It continues until page 1128. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and at 1081 there are questions by 
committee members to Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then, Chair, I think – sorry, Chair, to 
make that point I was making, it is after this transcript that 
you see Mr Koko’s supplementary affidavit at 1129. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, one of his supplementary affidavits? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is that same one which is not 
20 
paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is a duplication? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this other one should… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should be taken out. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 316 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should be taken out? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But I will regularise the 
Chairperson’s file, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So let us go back to 1081.  Mr Koko, 
you will recall you were asked about whether you know the 
Guptas and the question arises from here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was asked whether. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will read the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whether he knows the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So it is – the first question is Dr 
Luyende(?) who says: 
“Mr Koko, it is the opportune time for you make a 
contribution that will clear the dark cloud over the 
state owned enterprises of which Eskom is one of 
them, on perception that is all over that the state 
resources that are looted deliberately by individuals 
within these institutions.  It is something that is a 
20 
concern to all South Africans so the position that 
you are in and the importance of the position that 
you are filling should be used by use here because 
we rely on you to clear that information honestly.  
And the question is, can you clearly indicate that in 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 317 of 413 
 
the position that you are in you do not know any of 
the Gupta family members pertaining to the service 
provision 
at 
Eskom 
illegally 
or, 
if 
legal, 
you 
indicate.” 
Do you recall this question, Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And then your answer comes 
after the Chairperson’s remarks there, Mr Chair, says 
against the name Mr Koko, your response was: 
“I do not know, I have not met any of the Gupta 
10 
brothers I see in the pictures.  I have met Mr Howa, 
I have met Ashu, I have met Salim Essa.” 
MR KOKO:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct.  And I have shared 
with you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand, Mr Koko, that last portion 
of that answer in the transcript where it says: 
“I have met Mr Howa, I have met Ashu, I have met 
20 
Salim Essa.” 
I understand within the context of the first sentence you 
make that that is what the media is saying, not that you 
were saying yourself you had met them? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, I have met Mr Howa. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 318 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR KOKO:   At that point I had met Mr Howa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By that time. 
MR KOKO:   By that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR KOKO:   I had met Mr Ashu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you had met Mr Salim Essa? 
MR KOKO:   And I had met Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, no, no, that is fine.  But why 
does the first sentence say: 
10 
 
“I do not know, I have not met any of the 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Gupta brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is the Gupta brothers. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As opposed to those referred to as their 
associates. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine.  So you make a 
distinction, I have not met any of the Gupta brothers but 
20 
here are people that I have met. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And, Mr Koko, these are people who 
have had dealings with the Guptas, they have had dealings 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 319 of 413 
 
with the Guptas. 
MR KOKO:   Well, they are regarded as Gupta associates. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As Gupta associates. 
MR KOKO:   That is what the media cast them as. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Salim Essa, we know from 
Eskom’s evidence that he was in Switzerland with Mr 
Zwane at the time, Minister Zwane and Tony Gupta to 
negotiate the deal for Tegeta and Oakbay to acquire OCH – 
OCM.  So we know from that evidence. 
MR KOKO:   I know from the evidence of Mr [indistinct], I 
10 
know 
from 
the 
evidence 
of 
Clinton 
Ephron 
and 
Mr 
Mosebenzi Zwane did not deny that.  So that is far as I can 
say, comment to your statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So Mr Ashu here is the same Mr 
Ashu Chawla we have reading about in the emails. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Just quickly on the Guptas, 
focusing on the Guptas, we now shared with you the 
affidavit of witness 3. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What they refer to as witness 3. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know that the Chairperson will not 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the witness 3 issue. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396

ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you had – you met Mr Ashu Chawla 
on 24 November 2015, that is the month when bookings 
were being made for you, is that right? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And you say he was with Mr 
Howa and Mr Salim Essa? 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought this sentence says that, it 
does not say that? 
10 
MR KOKO:   No, the sentence does not say that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So I met them on different occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you met them – oh, you met him on 
the 24 t h? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the others you were not – you did 
not mean that you met them on the same occasion with 
them. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair.  So I am certainly – I am certain 
20 
that we will get to the meeting of the 24 November 2015.  
Mr Seleka likes that meeting a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR KOKO:   So I am certainly sure he will take use there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Except that, Mr Koko, you say in that 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 321 of 413 
 
sentence: 
“I met Mr Ashu – was in the meeting of 24 
November 2015 with Mr Howa.” 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the two of them were in this 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr Salim Essa was not in that 
meeting. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And we will go to the – I am certain we will 
not close today without going to that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is fine. 
MR KOKO:   And it has got minutes and you will the 
minutes of the meeting, Ashu is there, Chawla is there and 
other executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, no, that is fine, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I did not see the full stop after Mr 
Howa in the transcript.  Okay, it is: 
20 
“Mr Salim Essa, I have met a couple of times, he is 
a shareholder of Trillian and he met me a couple of 
times to discuss Trillian transactions.” 
So when would you say you met him for the first time, are 
you…? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 322 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I have given evidence here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that was early in 2016. 
MR KOKO:   On the 10 t h – it was after the 10 February 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   That was our first meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   And then our last meeting was around June 
10 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Of course, Mr 
Koko, although you do listen to a lot of evidence of 
different witnesses you only have to remember those who 
say something about you.  I sit here and listen to a few 
hundred – I have set here, listen to quite a number of 
witnesses, so I am not going to always remember what Mr 
Koko said on a particular day. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I run a business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   That does its business – it is with cross-
border.  I am a project developer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I am happy I left Eskom contrary to what many 
people think.  Leaving Eskom was the best thing that 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 323 of 413 
 
happened to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So every time I take time off to watch 
witnesses at Zondo, at the state capture, it is a [indistinct] 
my pocket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   So I do not watch – I do not sit and watch 
Zondo, I sit and watch witnesses that are of interest to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, I understand, ja.  But you 
know why I was saying …[intervenes] 
10 
MR KOKO:   I understand that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  So on a lighter …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   I apologise when I say Zondo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   That is how – that is what we refer to the 
Commission, Chair, the Zondo Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a lighter note, does that mean your 
blood is no longer blue, now that you run your own 
business? 
MR KOKO:   I have moved on and even if you can rule that 
20 
I must go to Eskom, I will refuse.  I will refuse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, my blood is blue, you can see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Still blue? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 324 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   You can see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I know …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   You do not throw away 33 years of your life 
overnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko, questions of interest arise 
from what you say there about Mr Salim Essa. 
“Salim Essa, I have met a couple of times, he is a 
10 
shareholder of Trillian and he met me a couple of 
times to discuss the Trillian transaction.” 
Which transaction was that? 
MR KOKO:   The Trillian transaction, Chair, was the MSA 
contract with McKinsey.  That is what I referred to there.  
Now I may have used an unfortunately terminology there 
but when I say Trillian transaction I meant the contract that 
Eskom had with McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when – and I will be quick on this 
because of what I see here, I want to go to the Guptas.  
20 
When would you have met with him given that McKinsey 
decided quite early on not to have Trillian as their 
subcontractor? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, once again I testified to this, that I met 
Mr Salim Essa after the meeting I had with the lady – oh, I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 325 of 413 
 
forgot her.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Goodson. 
MR KOKO:   Ms Goodson.  And that meeting was on the 10 
February 2016 and that was the meeting where she asked 
me to pay the invoice of 30.6 million.  I met him after that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But your evidence to the 
parliamentary portfolio committee is that Salim Essa, I 
have met him a couple of times, not once. 
MR KOKO:   Of course, I have said I have met him – I can 
only remember two occasions, in fact I have met him only 
10 
twice, not a couple of times.  I have met him in February 
and I have met him in March – I beg your pardon, I have 
met him in June.  My main affidavit deals with those 
meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The invoice of 30.6 million has nothing 
to do with the MSA.  You are saying your meetings with 
him here was about the MSA, the Trillian transaction which 
you say you should have used the word MSA. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, Mr Seleka is right, so – and we are 
dealing with semantics here.  So when I said McKinsey – 
20 
Trillian transaction, I refer to the relationship that Trillian 
has with McKinsey that brought them to Eskom.  So I do 
not know how to answer that question.  It is quite simple, 
the only relationship that Eskom had with Trillian was 
McKinsey.  That is the only relationship, there was no any 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 326 of 413 
 
other relationship and Mr Seleka is right, the 30.6 million 
transaction had nothing to do with the MSA it had to do 
with the corporate plan.  So if I can be – if I can try to be 
precise to you, I will say corporate plan/MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, Mr Koko, I would expect you 
if you – if the meeting was about maybe their relationship 
to say relationship as opposed to transaction.  Post 
transaction seems to be specific as if there was a specific 
transaction. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have only met Mr Essa purely on 
10 
specific transactions.  We have never met to discuss 
anything general. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh, 
okay, 
then 
I 
must 
have 
I 
misunderstood you. 
MR KOKO:   We have never to discuss anything general.  
On two occasions I have met Salim Essa our discussion 
was very specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on this occasion on the – you said 
you met him a couple of times to discuss the Trillian 
transaction. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which transaction was that? 
MR KOKO:   Corporate plan/MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Koko did say MSA. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 327 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   I did say MSA, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka – I nearly said Mr Salim Essa. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, I did say MSA, Chair.  But it is 
nothing untoward there, I mean, I have said on many 
occasions here how even you, Chair, confusing the MSA 
and the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Even Mr Seleka used to do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
MR KOKO:   The only discussions I have had with Mr Essa 
10 
were specific and related to the corporate plan and MSA.  
That is the only relationship I had, that is the only 
discussions I had with Mr Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if you met with him in June 2015, 
Mr Koko, about the MSA, why would that be – why would 
you have met with him? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair, if you look at my main 
affidavit, I deal with that topic exactly because it raises 
eyebrows because in March McKinsey had already told us 
that they are not having a relationship with Trillian. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The red flags were… 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, they wrote to us I think on the – either 
the 29 t h or the 28 t h. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 328 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   29 March. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, my affidavit deals with that.  The 
arrangement Eskom had with McKinsey at that time was 
that it is termination but six months that – six months 
period, six months termination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Six months notice.  Or a certain period 
within which the arrangement would continue. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before it is finally terminated. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It comes to an end. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, now I have heard too many versions 
of that.  The fact is there continued to be a relationship 
between McKinsey/Trillian post March and the argument 
was work has been done therefore the partners are entitled 
to be paid.  That was the discussions we had in March and 
my response to them, you will see it in my affidavit, I said 
guys, I do not care who did the work, I have not contract 
20 
with you guys, I have got contract with this one.  I will pay 
this one on a valid invoice and it is up to you guys how you 
manage your relationships.  So that the discussions we 
have made in March.  My main affidavit is very clear.  I 
even make a point in my main affidavit that this meeting 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 329 of 413 
 
was strange given that the relationship with McKinsey had 
ceased to be the case in March.  So I deal with that quite 
nicely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair, because we know 
from Dr Weiss’ affidavit that they never partnered with 
Trillian.  So your – the convening of the meeting is 
surprising in the light of what you knew at the meeting of 
the 30 March 2016. 
MR KOKO:   Yes and the beauty part about it is that 
present in that meeting was McKinsey executive, Sagar. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I had not finished, but… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let him finish, Mr Koko.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But, Chair, that is the evidence we 
have, Mr Koko.  Chair, let me go to the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But complete your point.  I thought you 
have not completed the point you wanted to make, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the strange part about 
convening the meeting, even the fact of your attending, 
and you have not even said where you attended the 
meeting is the fact that not only did McKinsey write to you 
20 
but McKinsey had a meeting with the steering committee 
wherein you were told we will not be contracting with 
Trillian.  So that transition of six months, it is not even 
relevant to that point.  So the question is, the strangeness 
of the meeting and you having to go address Trillian, it is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 330 of 413 
 
still hanging. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it does not hang at all.  The meeting of 
June was arranged by McKinsey in Trillian’s offices.  I 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, it was arranged by McKinsey? 
MR KOKO:   By McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In? 
MR KOKO:   In Trillian’s offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   I saw nothing wrong in attending. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it took place in Trillian’s offices. 
MR KOKO:   In Trillian’s offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one that happened on the day 
when there was a to be a workshop or something? 
MR KOKO:   Ja, on both meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there was a workshop. 
MR KOKO:   Ja on both meetings we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   But the June meeting was arranged by 
McKinsey, Mr Sagar. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And it was Melrose Arch meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the purpose? 
MR KOKO:   The purpose was invoicing, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 331 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   There was a strong push from Trillian that 
says before …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They wanted to be paid directly. 
MR KOKO:   No, it was beyond that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Before the cancellation so much value was 
added, R25 billion and, Chair, I have told you before that 
anybody telling you that there was no value by McKinsey is 
lying to you but because the contract, the basis of the MSA 
was that you get paid on value created and the value was 
10 
created and the value was priced.  The number I have 
served before our board was R1.8 billion that was due to 
McKinsey.  Now Trillian was saying we are entitled to our 
share in that R1.8 billion.  That is a discussion I remember 
we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   And my response to them I said quite frankly, 
I have no business having these discussions with you.  
These are discussions Eskom should be having with 
McKinsey.  That is the meeting of June.  So first I – the 
20 
meeting was called by McKinsey.  It happened in Trillian’s 
offices and even today I see nothing wrong why I attended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course you could have said even 
without going there, there is no need for me to attend this 
meeting. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 332 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Ja, Chair, and again we have canvassed this 
too. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We did canvass it, ja. 
MR KOKO:   We canvassed it, I have never said no to a 
small and medium company calling me to a meeting with its 
principal and if I was still at Eskom today I will still go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that part has not been canvassed 
so your question was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I was under the impression that it 
10 
was canvassed. 
MR KOKO:   No, it was, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was not. 
MR KOKO:   We can go to the transcripts again, you will 
find it and I have answered it to you the way I am 
answering it to you now.  I will not – I saw nothing wrong 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But anyway, your answer is what you are 
saying. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely, because you are being called by 
a small to medium sized company, you were not going to 
say no. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would go there even if it was to say 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 333 of 413 
 
I am not supposed to – I am not going to stay. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I have got nothing to do here. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you leave. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is that what happened on that 
day? 
MR KOKO:   Exactly that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Because that 
explanation was given in regard to the meeting you had 
after Ms Goodson was at your offices.  But, you see, there 
is two parts …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, we are going back to Trillian again.  
We are not going to finish, next year we will still be here.  I 
have got a feeling that Mr Seleka will go back to a topic 
until he gets the answer that he thinks he wants. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  No, if you give a direct answer we 
will finish. 
MR KOKO:   Because now we are back to Trillian.  We 
have got to move, Chair.  I need to discuss Trillian, I need 
to discuss …[intervenes] 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 334 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tegeta. 
MR KOKO:   I have got a lot to say in Tegeta, we cannot 
keep – I am here eight times, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let me hear. 
MR KOKO:   It is for the eighth times I am here discussing 
Trillian and McKinsey, we have to move on now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is the question.  There is one 
10 
point which is what Mr Koko says there was no contract 
between Eskom and Trillian …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will tell you what we must do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us get to get to Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And anything that still needs to be 
addressed in relation to other topics, it can be addressed 
by way of the questions and he can do an affidavit after he 
has finished, is it not, because we are trying make today 
20 
the last day. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, we are not going to finish, it is my 
eighth time now.  I hope I am not coming here for the 
twentieth time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 335 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Your Commission has to end. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You see because I think there is an 
acceptance that anything that has not been done today can 
be dealt with by way of affidavits.  Let us get to Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is alright, Chair, because – 
can I just make one last point here then I will move on, 
Chair, which is this …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   Ja, there is an affidavit of witness 3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is this.  Mr Koko had also said 
this contract of the MSA did not fall under his department 
10 
at the parliamentary portfolio committee, so it is still a 
question why he attended this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us move on, you can put it in writing.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I will move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us move on.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, Chair, we will leave – should I 
leave the witness 3 evidence? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, no, you cannot.  This guy has lied 
about me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I was saying let us get to Tegeta 
20 
simply because in my mind Tegeta is there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But whatever, we just move to – get to 
something new. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 336 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   No, we have to deal with witness 3. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And you can see Mr Koko is very 
keen to deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, the evidence …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it will be quick.  The evidence of 
witness 3 was led by a different work stream, I have 
obtained the affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh, it is the one who says he saw 
10 
Mr Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but that is all he says is it not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Saxonwold in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what I am saying is, the only thing is 
that he says he say him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is nothing else, really. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, nothing else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Koko, do you want to say 
20 
anything about that?  I think you have already said 
something. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, Chair.  Chair, I have kids, I have 
worked hard for my name.  When a witness comes and say 
– witness 3 comes here to sit here and say  - let me quote 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 337 of 413 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, he did not sit there. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, Chair.  I have to quote him.  He says: 
“Whilst waiting in my vehicle for Gigaba to return 
from meetings inside the Gupta residence.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just indicate where are you reading 
from?   
MR KOKO:   It is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you reading from his affidavit or 
transcript. 
10 
MR KOKO:   It is affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what page are you – or paragraph, 
are you able to say? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, it is his main affidavit and I am reading 
paragraph 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
MR KOKO:   He says: 
“While waiting in my vehicle for Gigaba to return 
from meetings inside the Gupta residence I noticed 
on different occasions people arriving or leaving the 
20 
premises that I recognised.  Individuals in this 
regard include Brian Molefe, Matshela Koko, Ben 
Ngubane, Linda Mabaso…” 
Now the way he writes my name I conclude immediately 
that this person does not know by just purely by writing my 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 338 of 413 
 
name and then he…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, that is the first name.  Not the 
surname, the first name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  Now in his transcripts on the 13 
August 2020, day 250 he says – Mr Pretorius asks him: 
“Right.  Right, were you able observe whether there 
were 
any 
other 
people 
present 
outside 
the 
residence?” 
Witness 3 responds:  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just think I will need to look at it, ja.  It 
is a very narrow issue. 
MR KOKO:   “I saw Mr Brian Molefe and later I saw  
Matshela Koko of Eskom, Ben Ngubane, Linda 
Mabaso our Chair then within the premises.” 
Now he says Mr Mabaso, our Chair then.  Mr Mabaso was 
not the Chair of Eskom then.  So this is false, but listen to 
this.  Then he comes and comes and put a supplementary 
affidavit.  He says I want to clarify the I misunderstanding 
of – created by Mr Singh.  He says paragraph 8 of his 
20 
supplementary affidavit. 
“At the time when me…” 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I will read it for you. 
MR KOKO:   Page 9.  No, I have to read it.  Page 9, 
paragraph 9: 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 339 of 413 
 
“Regarding Mr Koko, I confirm that I did not know 
who he is when I saw him at the Gupta residence in 
2013.  I only began to know who Mr Koko is when 
Mr Singh was seconded to Eskom during or on 
about July or August 2015.  I provided close 
protection and driver services for Mr Singh during 
the 
secondment 
at 
Eskom 
for 
the 
period 
of 
approximately two month.  It was during this period 
when I saw Mr Koko at Eskom that I recalled that I 
had seen him on previous occasions in 2018 at the 
10 
Gupta evidence in Saxonwold.” 
Now, Chair, his affidavit is very clear, I saw Mr Koko, I 
recognised him in 2013.  You cannot recognise somebody 
you do not know.  You cannot recognise a person you have 
not seen before.  I saw Mr Koko, I recognised him but I did 
not know, I have never met him.  Chair this is type – these 
are the witnesses that are putting my name into disrepute.  
He says he does not know me, he has never met me.  He 
recognised me two years later.  Two years later.  Chair, 
these witnesses cannot get away with these type of things. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I hear what you are saying, it 
is a legitimate issue to raise.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
I 
think 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess there is not much you can say 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 340 of 413 
 
because …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, there is not much, Mr Koko 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not a witness you have consulted 
with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I realise how Mr Koko has earlier said 
one is dealing with semantics.  I think the witness, when 
confronted, with which Mr Koko is saying which is what Mr 
10 
Singh was saying about this witness, he explained it in 
paragraph 9 and I was waiting to hear how you criticise 
paragraph 9 but I did not hear any from the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what does 9 say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, this is the paragraph, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says: 
“Regarding Mr Koko, I confirm that I did not know 
who he is when I saw him at the Gupta residence in 
2013.  I only began to know who Mr Koko is when 
20 
Mr Singh was seconded to Eskom during or on 
about July or August 2015.” 
Which, of course, all that – that comment is correct. 
“I provided close protection and driver services to 
Mr Singh during the secondment at Eskom for the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 341 of 413 
 
period of approximately two month.  It was during 
this period when I saw Mr Koko at Eskom that I 
recalled that I had seen him on …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but that is what Mr Koko has read. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is what he has read.  So what 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there is difficulty with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is difficulty with it because you 
say today I saw Mr Seleka… 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say I recognised him and then 
sometime later you say you did not know him, you did not 
know him when you saw him but you said your recognised 
him.  So one of the points Mr Koko is making is you cannot 
say you recognised somebody when you do not know them, 
you need to know them in order for you to recognise them 
and that seems to be a legitimate point. 
 
And then also, if you are going to say you saw 
somebody you did not know two years ago… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   …when you meet them two years later 
you then recognise that it is somebody you saw two years 
ago.  You then say oh, I have got – maybe it could happen, 
I do not know, but it something that needs explanation. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 342 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Koko is right to raise that and 
point out that that is – that that part, as it stands, is not 
without problems. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, Chair, he is entitled to raise 
it.  Chair will recall the witness’ evidence was that this 
happened on at least six occasions in 2013 that he would 
see the people there at Saxonwold.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did he see Mr Koko on six occasions 
because I understand him to be talking about one occasion 
10 
when he saw Mr Koko.  That is how I understood his 
affidavit.  I may be wrong but that is our …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I will check and remember, Chair 
…[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   There is no six occasions, that part you can 
be assured.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But does he say a number of occasions 
maybe? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I remember the Chairperson and him 
counting – I will get that part about whether it was Mr Koko 
20 
he was seeing or …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but it must have been in regard to 
maybe somebody else that …[intervenes] 
MR KOKO:   In any event, he still did not know me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see on – when we were questioning 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 343 of 413 
 
him the work stream was different, so I would not have 
focused on Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have focused on Mr Singh, I 
think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And Mr Mabaso was not the Chairman of 
Transnet then, that is another lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us move on, it is a very narrow 
issue, ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair.  Mr Koko, we 
can deal with the OCM/Tegeta matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what is your estimate of how long 
you might be on Tegeta? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I think it depends on how Mr 
Koko is going to answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I could give a summary of how I would 
like to approach it because these matters are interrelated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, not that is fine.  I want us to 
20 
take another ten minutes break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I could take 30 minutes with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I could take 30 minutes with it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  I think the important 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 344 of 413 
 
thing is that we do strike a proper balance between doing 
justice to the issues and not taking too long. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take a ten minutes adjournment 
again.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.   Chairperson 
just in terms of the evidence we have in regard to the 
10 
Tegeta OCM matter, Mr Koko will give his version or his – 
ja his version against this evidence we have, which is that 
– just to paint a picture, prior to the secondment of Mr 
Molefe to Eskom, OCM and Eskom have a cooperation 
agreement which they are seeking to have it finalised in 
order to deal with the transaction, the supply of coal 
agreement between the two parties and that mainly relates 
to the quality of coal and the price for which OCM wants to 
charge Eskom. 
The cooperation agreement comes 
back from May 2014.  It gets to be referred to Mr Molefe in 
20 
April, 23 r d April 2015 and he terminates it and he has 
testified here and with that termination the - they issue a 
letter of demand for OCM  
to pay Eskom the R2.17billion which they say is for 
penalties. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 345 of 413 
 
That amount ultimately gets to be whittled down in 
agreement with Tegeta during the arbitration process, but 
with regard to the - going back to the arrangement between 
Eskom and OCM is the negotiations that go on to have 
OCM supply Eskom with coal even as OCM is under 
business 
rescue, 
but 
also 
negotiations 
where 
Eskom 
becomes involved particularly in the meeting Mr Koko is 
referred to of the 24 t h of November 2015.  When Mr Koko 
says to OCM officials, we will only buy - we will only 
consent to the sale, if you sell the assets of OCH not only 
10 
OCM, so to enlarge the scope of their assets to be sold.  
But the DMR Mr Joe Rapella had also said the same 
before this meeting to Mr Clinton Ephram, that meeting 
takes place and in that meeting OCM tells Eskom Glencore 
is taking a decision to take us out of business rescue, and 
we will honour the agreement and supply you. 
So they know this in November, in December, even 
as at the time when Mr Koko will then prepare the 
submission for the R1.68billion pre-payment in December 
2015 for the Board to make a round robin decision. 
20 
So Mr Koko will explain that submission, will 
explain his role prior to that submission, particularly with 
emails exchanged between him and Mr Joe Repella to write 
a letter to the DMR asking the DMR to intervene, which 
letter is used in that submission as the reason why a pre-
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 346 of 413 
 
payment should be made and I will not conclude that that 
pre-payment decision gets to be made and a guarantee 
after that - the day after the pre-payment is converted into 
a guarantee. 
And 
we 
will 
see 
whether 
Mr 
Koko 
has 
any 
knowledge in regard to that, I know his touched on it when 
we were not dealing with it and then it will be the 
submission of April 2016 which is again signed by Mr Koko 
and this is for a pre-payment to Tegeta of R659million and 
Mr Koko will then explain to the Chairperson, why that 
10 
submission was made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, why do you not ask him the 
questions?  When I asked you how long you took, I did not 
mean to say, stop now.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I just wanted to have an idea.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ask him the questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us go Mr Koko then, the 
submission, Mr Koko of December 2015, the 8 t h of 
20 
December 2015.  I would like you to before we deal with 
the submission in itself, explain to the Chairperson the 
email exchange between you and Mr Joe Repella in regard 
to the drafting of the letter to the DMR? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am going to spend one minute and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 347 of 413 
 
say to you, I felt bad…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, the email you are talking about 
can you identify it so that for the record, whoever reads 
the transcripts knows which email you are talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson, the emails are 
to be found in Eskom Bundle 18A, page 423 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is wrong with emails, you say h 
must explain the emails you want to put to him, what you 
want him to address with regard to the emails.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bundle 18A. 
MR KOKO:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 423, Chair again, the email trail 
is in reverse order.  So one really has to start on page 424 
to get the sequence of emails.  But Mr Koko could explain 
why did he engage with Mr Joe Repella in a matter that 
was a transaction or related to a transaction between 
Eskom and a private entity, OCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, these emails, let us identify them 
20 
that you are talking about first, they are from page 423 to 
where, what page?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, they start on page 424, if we go 
to page 423 and also page 425. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it only those two? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 348 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then Chair on page 428, it is part of - 
it is a reply to the one on page 425 by Mr Joe Repella. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you want to take these pages 
one at a time or do they have the same theme that you 
want to ask him about?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   They have the same theme?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay tell us what the theme is and 
put the question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The theme or the gist of what has been 
discussed here is putting together a draft letter by Mr 
10 
Koko, which will be addressed to the DMR in order to seek 
certain intervention by the DMR.  So, on the face of it, it 
seems to be him Mr Koko and one DMR official talking 
about what should go into the letter, what the contents of 
the letter should be, and the question is, why did Mr Koko 
do that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I - because there was nothing wrong in 
doing that, that is the answer.  It was the right thing to do, 
that is the answer.  On the 20 t h of August 2015 the 
20 
business rescue practitioners through Eskom into a coal 
emergency by suspending the coal supply agreement 
between Eskom and Hendrina.   
You will find that letter of suspension in PM affidavit 
PMM 7, and that was pace went to the hardship notice or 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 349 of 413 
 
quarter just pursuant to the Board resolutions of OCM and 
also on OCH on the 31 s t of August 2015.  Paragraph - the 
affidavit of Mr Glasenberg says we entered into business 
rescue because we wanted to change the course of the 
agreement and they and he thinks and I want to give you 
the paragraph I think we're going to run out of time 
because I wanted to take you to the paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we can go there. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, so let us go their Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that of Mr Marsden? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Glasenberg.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr? 
MR KOKO:   Glasenberg.  
CHAIRPERSON:   From my point of view, we can still go up 
to nine and so on.  All I wanted to do is just to get a 
picture so you do not have to rush as if…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, if you go to paragraph 30 and 31 of Mr 
Glasenberg, it is in Bundle 18 page 168, please Chair let 
us go there because we see…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what bundle is that, is that the same 
20 
bundle? 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 18, page 352.168 I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 352.168, yes I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph? 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 30, 31, I must find it Chair. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 350 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you sure it is Mr Glasenberg? 
MR KOKO:   Glasenberg ja, Ivan Glasenberg I will not 
make a mistake Mr Seleka on this one it is very important 
to my kit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 30 and 31 is found on page 
– of Mr Glasenberg affidavit. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   352.168. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, 168, Chair I have got it, you will see it is 
under the theme of placing OCH, OCM into business 
10 
rescue and he says he was aware of the OCM, OCH 
decisions took place and that is paragraph 29: 
“I was aware of the Board of OCH, OCM decision to 
place these entities into business rescue and I was 
accordingly in agreement with this decision.  It was 
thought 
that 
business 
rescue 
would 
not 
only 
reconfirm to Eskom the dire financial positions in 
which OCM and OCH were at the time but would 
also give the business rescue practitioners of OCM 
into an opportunity to renegotiate the CSA. We were 
20 
also of the view, and is a very important, we were 
also of the view that perhaps that business rescue 
practitioners will be in a better position to negotiate 
with Eskom than Glencore and OCM where I also 
understood 
that 
the 
BRP’s 
had 
the 
power 
to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 351 of 413 
 
suspend or cancel onerous contracts, which would 
potentially enable OCM to renegotiate their CSA.” 
Now Chair, I wrote an opinion piece and it is in the bundle. 
I said in the opinion piece, Optimum and Glencore has 
made their bed and they had to lie on it.  The CSA, and 
Chair I am  
just rushing in there is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no do not rush, just deal with 
matters. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you need to understand the design of 
10 
the course but Minister Mallika took you through the design 
of the coal supply agreement, including addendum 1, 
addendum 2 and addendum 3.  This coal supply agreement 
are meant for the security of coal supply for Eskom. You 
build a power station for 40 years, you build next to the 
coal mine, you put a conveyor, none of the two parties in 
the coal supply agreement can walk away.  It is the design 
of the of the coal supply agreement and I would refer to 
different clauses to that. 
If there was any dispute be it of interpretation to 
20 
the CSA of the effect to the CSA of the rights and 
obligations of parties in the arbitration, or any other 
dispute it is resolved in terms of Clause 30 of the coal 
supply agreement which is arbitration, and the outcome of 
the arbitrators is binding, no party can walk away. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 352 of 413 
 
The arbitration, that was the case – the last 
arbitration with Optimum was concluded on the 12 t h of April 
2011.  I have it here I will also send it to you, the 
arbitration of April 20 2012 signed by my former colleague, 
Mr Marokwane dealt with all the dispute that was in the 
contract and the rights and obligation, including the quote, 
quantities and the price. 
Chair, one of the – okay let me not go there.  So, 
there was a dispute and that is a dispute of hardship.  That 
dispute was - it was the dispute notice was on the 3 r d of 
10 
July 2013 and there was another notice on coal qualities 
on the 23 r d of April 2013, either way Chair it had to be 
resolved through arbitration and I have to deal with this 
Chair, please. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may I ask? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I understand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and I wanted some direction from 
you Chair, because…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but I want to answer that letter because I 
want to…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me here what direction Mr Seleka 
wants? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I wanted some direction Chair 
because he does not answer my question. 
MR KOKO:   No, Chair I am going to answer that question 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 353 of 413 
 
but you are not - I answered that question, I said it was the 
right thing to do.  It was the right thing for me to do.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you said that it was the right thing to 
do, ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because it goes - so if he 
answered the question, whatever he is saying now Chair it 
does not bear on that question and I suppose he can deal 
with it in due course, it is going to take…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let me say this, I can stay here 
until…[intervene] 
10 
MR KOKO:   I can stay here until tomorrow, Chair.  I can 
stay for this…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not until tomorrow from my side.  
MR KOKO:   For this I can stay until tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us deal with matters, obviously, 
not slowly but I do not want anybody to feel that now they 
have got to rush like that, but still keep within, ja – Mr 
Barry?  
ADV BARRY SC:   Chair I think that it is too optimistic to 
think that we are going to finish with Mr Koko. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I understand that Mr Barry. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, let us carry on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My approach is simply that if we reach a 
certain point where we cannot proceed today let us reach 
that point if we agree as I think we have an understanding 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 354 of 413 
 
that the rest would be dealt with by way of written 
responses and questions that is fine, but I do not want 
everybody rushing so much now.  
ADV BARRY SC:   Well, that is exactly my concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us just deal with it. 
ADV BARRY SC:   And it would not be possible to arrange 
another evening, for Mr Koko to come back again.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no. 
ADV BARRY SC:   The unfortunate issue about the Tegeta 
transaction is a very important issue before you.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRY SC:   And we have had endless questioning 
on various other things and we have now, we are about the 
eighth or the ninth day and only now do we come to this 
particular point and now, Mr Koko as it were is being put 
under pressure to get on with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I have repeatedly said to him, he 
must just give his evidence because I do not want anybody 
saying…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Chair, can I do that, can we carry on, I really 
20 
want to talk to this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let him finish Mr Seleka, finish 
what you were saying. 
MR KOKO:   So, to summarise it, the relationship between 
Eskom and Glencore had broken down.  Chair, and I must 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 355 of 413 
 
tell you upfront…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   By when had it broken down because 
that may be important? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, when they put on the 20 t h of August 
2015, when they stopped the belt from running, if I had a 
gun I would have pulled the trigger.  No one, nobody when 
I am the head of Generation dealing with load shedding 
nobody switches off the belt.   
Anybody who switches off the belt whether he is 
right or whether he thinks his right or wrong he breaks the 
10 
relationship with me as the head of Generation.  So the 
20 t h of August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is when the relationship broke 
down as far as you are concerned. 
MR KOKO:   Glencore broke the relationship, and all the 
benefit that I gave them I threw them out of the window 
and here is the benefit I gave them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But hang on Mr Koko you say all of this 
to make what point? 
MR KOKO:   What I am saying, what I want to come to I am 
20 
saying to you, I went rightfully to DPE which is not the first 
time, we do it in my 20 years we talk to DPE they sit with 
us. They are part of us, thee are part of the State to deal 
with the problems of supplying coal to Eskom. 
I go to them and say I do not have coal. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 356 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have? 
MR KOKO:   Coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I do not have coal.  You are the department 
that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is responsible for Eskom. 
MR KOKO:   They are responsible to get me coal.  
Glencore 
a business partner of Mr Ramaphosa has switched off the 
belt. So you have to work with me to get me the coal.  
10 
These guys had the option, they had – they are obliged by 
the coal supply agreement.  If they think I am difficult, if 
they think I am unreasonable they must arbitrate. 
They must arbitrate, they cannot do what they are 
doing and now in the affidavit they say it is our intention to 
suspend the coal supply agreement, when the coal supply 
agreement is very clear, if you are unhappy, you arbitrate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So part of what you are saying is 
because of the importance of a coal supply agreement, 
because of the consequences of stopping supplying coal to 
20 
not just as the whole country the CSA between Eskom and 
Glencore did not allow an aggrieved party…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   To walk away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …to do anything other than go to 
arbitration. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 357 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when they do anything other than 
going to arbitration because they are aggrieved that is 
wrong.  
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a breach of the CSA. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if they were aggrieved, they were 
obliged to go to – to either do nothing and continue 
performing or go to arbitration. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Exactly but Chair, but there was an arbitration 
agreement that was signed already.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and they were supposed to pursue 
it. MR KOKO:   Exactly, on the 13 t h of December 2013, 
there was an arbitration agreement that was signed 
pursuant to the hardship notice of July.  So pursue the 
arbitration do not stop the belt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no I think that is a point that I picked 
up from Mr Brian Molefe’s evidence as well.  He might not 
have put it the way you put it but the question of why did 
20 
they not pursue arbitration up to the last - up to conclusion 
was raised. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, and Chair just to finalise the answer.  
There is nothing in law or the Eskom framework that 
prevents me from going to the Department of Minerals and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 358 of 413 
 
Energy to work with them to solve the problem I have, we 
have done it many times and if Mr Seleka thinks it is 
wrong, he has to show me in law why I could not do that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, let us proceed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You see Mr Koko is becoming a lawyer 
now.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah, I can hear that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But his saying, approaching DMR well 
there was nothing wrong with that, it is a department that 
10 
is responsible for Eskom, and he had a problem relating to 
coal so he was entitled to go to them.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair the wrongfulness or 
otherwise was not my question.  My question was to him, 
he has to explain why he approached them, but he has 
said…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, his answer…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that is what I wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   His answer implies right who do you 
even ask me that question, because there is nothing wrong 
20 
with it. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, why you asking me that question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair that is a wrongfulness 
because he has answered that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 359 of 413 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He said, and that is what I need to test 
with him. I went to the DMR, because I do not have coal, I 
told them you have to work with me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he started by saying it was the right 
thing to do, you remember, that was his first answer.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will come to that the rightfulness or 
wrongfulness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us deal with the purpose of this, 
Chair and you need to deal with it in the context of the 
10 
sequence of events.  So let us start with the 20 t h of August 
2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not have to address it to me, 
you can continue asking him questions.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Koko so the 20 t h of August 
2015 is the day you have identified you say Glencore 
stopped the supply of coal. 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that was not Glencore, that was 
the business rescue practitioners who wrote a letter and 
20 
said they will not supply coal. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is not Glencore. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two, they made a proposal to Eskom 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 360 of 413 
 
which, in respect of which they gave you a deadline of the 
22 n d for the 24 t h of August to come back to them with a 
response.  You remember that?  
MR KOKO:   I know that is PMM 7, it is in a letter 24 
August, it is in a letter of reference PMM 7 in Pierre 
Marsden affidavit, I know that letter very well Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   I do not need to go to it because it is pain, it 
caused me pain. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and then you did not immediately 
10 
respond to that letter.  Is that correct?  What did you do? 
MR KOKO:   Alright, let us, let us carry on this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what you did was to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, I think he is trying to recollect. 
MR KOKO:   No, I am not, I must answer there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   He is asking me a question; I must answer 
you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, answer.  
MR KOKO:   So on the on the 23 r d on the 20 t h of August 
20 
until the 3 r d of September, there was no coal going to 
Eskom and one of the things we did was to ask a senior 
counsels opinion on our rights and obligations, that was 
one of the first things.   
 
On the 3 r d of September, we had a meeting with                   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 361 of 413 
 
Glencoe and business rescue practitioners and Chair in 
that meeting, I not Mr Molefe refused the business rescue 
practitioners from coming to the meeting, I refused that. 
Chair, I can safely say now, I hated them.  I hated anybody 
who wants me to switch off the coal and I said to Mr Molefe 
these guys they have never given us notice they stopped 
the belt is and in my meeting with them on the 17 t h of 
August it is out of that meeting that they went to write a 
letter of the 20 t h of August.  
They told me and said, listen, Mr Koko, the only 
10 
reason we will get this relationship, right is if you – is if we 
get an addendum to the coal supply agreement and we 
change the price from 154 to R442 per ton and we scrap 
the penalties.  That is the basis of our interaction with you, 
if we do not do that, we will liquidate the mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Part of your I will say argument, part of 
what you are saying is that OCM/Glencore had no right if 
they were aggrieved by Eskom refusal to increase the 
price.  They had no right to do anything other than going to 
arbitration.  
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And them doing anything else was 
outside of the CSA. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and part of what you are saying is 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 362 of 413 
 
Eskom and OCM/Glencore had an agreement in terms of 
which they had agreed that if ever there were any issues 
under that agreement, and they could not resolve them by 
talking the aggrieved party must invoke arbitration. 
MR KOKO:    Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say, the reason for that must 
have been because if you allowed such a party, for 
example, to stop supplying coal the consequences were far 
reaching for the economy of the country.  
MR KOKO:   Exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was - that was the rationale for 
saying, if you are aggrieved, you do not do what you would 
do in any normal contract that you have with somebody 
where you can terminate it or refuse to perform. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Here because of the nature of the 
agreement and the issues and the fact that they affect the 
supply of coal, or stoppage of supplying coal results in 
hardship for the whole economy, you are not going to be 
allowed to do those things that you would otherwise be 
20 
allowed to do when you are in a contract relationship.  
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your only remedy is to go to arbitration 
and both parties agree that they will be bound by the 
arbitration award. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 363 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   But I will take you further and say I know why 
they did not want to do arbitration, because they were 
going to lose, because arbitration says there must be 
special circumstances and those special circumstances in 
terms of paragraphs 17.2 excludes the export market 
conditions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is what they were going to rely 
on.  
10 
MR KOKO:   And there was this what they were going to 
rely on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Which is specifically excluded and again, it is 
the design of the contract, it is not Eskom that says go and 
export coal it is them who says we have the coal contract 
that we said in 1983, we want to export allow us to export 
and then Eskom says we will allow you to export but do not 
bring export problems to us.  So the context is well written 
and they knew that they stood no chance to win in the 
20 
arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one of the issues I have raised is 
precisely that, I would like to know from Glencore, why 
they did not pursue arbitration in its conclusion, because it 
was a remedy available to them in terms of the contract 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 364 of 413 
 
about the issues and I think that ties in also with the 
question of due diligence that arose when Mr Ephram 
affected evidence. 
 
So when Mr Ephram does come back to give 
evidence he would deal with those issues.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   But Chair can I take you to Bundle 15C? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle? 
MR KOKO:   15C. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, tell me the point first because I 
might tell you…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   I want to show you paragraph 17.2 of the coal 
supply agreement that specifically tells them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just read it, even if I do not go to it, 
if you read it I know it is there, it is okay. 
MR KOKO:   And Mr Barry, can you take me to the 
contract, you see Chair I am panicking now.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, do not panic.  Okay, leave it to your 
counsel to look for it, let us continue when he has brought 
20 
it he will let us know.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, Mr Barry if you lead us to the main 
contract CSA paragraph 17.3.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, when he has got it, he will let us 
know then we can go to it, in the meantime, we can 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 365 of 413 
 
proceed.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Koko I hope you could 
get the facts right because your own attorneys CDH have 
given the Commission an affidavit.  In 2013…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Eskom’s attorneys, right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom’s attorneys.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not his attorneys. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not his personal attorneys, Chair.  In 
2013 the hardship clause was invoked.  Do you know that? 
MR KOKO:   In 2013? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ’13.  
MR KOKO:   Which addendum? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
This 
is 
from 
Mr 
Rishabun’s 
affidavit…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   No Chair, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read it to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But let him finish because he can 
answer you. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Because I am a bit uncertain exactly 
what clause Mr Koko is looking for. 
20 
MR KOKO:   No, no Chair Mr Barry if you take me to the 
CSA, I will know how to navigate just take me to the CSA. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Now you will find that at page – well it 
is at 516…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry let us have the bundle first 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 366 of 413 
 
and then the page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
ADV BARRY SC:   It starts at 15, 1646. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does Bundle 15 have A and B or? 
ADV BARRY SC:  It is C.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 15C, what page? 
ADV BARRY SC:   Page 1646. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1646, okay, let us get rid of that issue 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is fine, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then do not forget what you were 
on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
born with. 
MR KOKO:   But I am looking for the hardship clause in 
this 17.2, 17.3, no Mr Barry.  Chair, I have 15. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Try 27.  
MR KOKO:   Yes, 27, not 17 I apologise, sir.  It is the 
hardship clause and it says: 
“In entering into this argument the parties declare it 
20 
to be their intention that this agreement shall 
operate between them with fairness and without 
undue hardship to any party and says the provision 
of this Clause 27 shall apply where any new 
situation or circumstances arise which.” 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 367 of 413 
 
And it lists them, and then it says at the bottom: 
“Relevant 
circumstances 
may 
include 
without 
limitation, the imposition of any tax duty, other fees 
by any governmental or other authorising executive 
power, but shall not include any circumstances, 
resulting in TNC being unable to serve coal to the 
export market.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So any reliance by Optimum on the 
international market price of coal, they will lose daylight.  
10 
Now, Chair while we are on this, an arbitration agreement 
was 
signed 
between 
Eskom 
and 
Optimum 
to 
go 
to 
arbitration on the issue on the 12 t h December 2013. 
Now, this is where I am laughing at Mr Seleka when 
he says the arbitration clause was revoked because I will 
take you to the arbitration agreement and now that Mr 
Seleka tells me about CDH Chair, I have dying to deal with 
CDH advice to Eskom I have, because Mr Seleka relies 
only and it is so flawed.   
I listened to the lawyers Chair, I do the right thing. 
20 
So let us go to the arbitration agreement.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us just finalise this, you wanted 
to refer to Clause 27, the hardship clause on the basis that 
there was - that it contains a specific exclusion. 
MR KOKO:    Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 368 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely that you cannot rely on – or 
Glencore/OCM could not rely on challenges arising out of 
exports.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Its involvement in the export market and 
that was the reason which caused it, what is understood to 
be hardship.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And if it went to arbitration, it would 
have to raise this and Eskom would say, but look at this 
10 
clause. MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:  And Chair and the arbitration agreement that I 
will take you to now that Seleka has raised the issue, 
specifically refers to this clause.  We are signing this 
arbitration agreement page 282, this clause.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR KOKO:   So this clause is not revoked, so let us go 
there Mr Barry if you take me there. 
ADV BARRY SC:   That is at 15, 1801. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 15, your mic is not on Mr Barry, 
page? 
ADV BARRY SC:   Bundle 15, page 1801.  
CHAIRPERSON:   1801.  
MR KOKO:   18? 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 369 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   1801.  
MR KOKO:   Right, Chair, this is an arbitration agreement 
that was signed and if you – it was signed if you go to 
1807, it was signed on the 12 t h of December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   By Cliff Decker, the same Cliff Decker and 
Werksman attorneys representing OCH.  Now I have 
learned from my counsel that in arbitration can only 
adjudicate a dispute and a dispute must be defined 
otherwise there is nothing to adjudicate.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you are becoming a lawyer now. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I have learned now, let us go and see 
in this arbitration, what the dispute was in this arbitration 
agreement what the dispute was.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It is recorded as a dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Recorded where?  
MR KOKO:   Page 1802. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, oh Clause 1. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Clause 1.1, it is recorded that a dispute, the 
hardship dispute has arisen between the claimants and the 
defendant, in respect of the claimants saying that they 
have suffered hardship as contemplated in Clause 27 in the 
Hendrina coal supply agreement between the claimant and 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 370 of 413 
 
the defendant, as amended.  As Clause 27 that Mr Seleka 
claims was removed.  So it could not have been removed, 
it is not removed, Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, did I say…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I am sorry you are referring to Mr 
Seleka having said what? 
MR KOKO:   That the hardship clause has been removed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he said it was invoked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Invoked. 
MR KOKO:   Oh, yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he said it was invoked. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, and what happened?  This is the 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine, but the point you 
are making is that the dispute was about the hardship. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the hardship clause excludes the 
reliance on export markets. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair, you will notice and you picked it up and 
I was very impressed when you picked it up, while I was 
sitting at home, you asked the question, why did this 
arbitration agreement exclude coal qualities?  Because this 
is a dispute of hardship only.  It excludes coal qualities, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 371 of 413 
 
there is a reason Chair and I am going to take you to that 
reason.  Mr Barry, if you take me to the second addendum. 
ADV BARRY SC:   Yes, we only received the document 
electronically while we sat here today. So if you go Mr 
Koko to the numbering in the middle of the page, right. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, 
ADV BARRY SC:   And the second addendum is at page 
281 and I will give you the full appellation shortly, that is 
page 1780. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that page? 
10 
ADV BARRY SC:   1780, that is the second addendum. 
MR KOKO:   Ja, second addendum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, have you got it Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, I have got it Chair, if you go to page 
1795. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us start by saying what is this 
document 
starting 
at 
page 
1780, 
the 
document 
for 
arbitration and second addendum to the Hendrina coal 
supply agreement between or amongst Eskom Holdings 
Limited and Optimum Coal Holdings, Coal Mine Holdings 
20 
and Pty Ltd. Okay, right we go to 1795.  
MR KOKO:   1795, the arbitration outcome was signed on 
the 12 t h of April 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Chair…[intervene]  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 372 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you have lost me, Mr Koko. 
MR KOKO:   17…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This was a settlement of that disputes? 
MR KOKO:   This was a settlement of dispute of rights and 
obligations of parties and I will take you through the 
dispute but I just want you to see when it was signed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 2011. 
MR KOKO:   2011, 12, April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR KOKO:   Right, now Chair if you go…[intervene]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying to place this now in terms of 
we have just dealt with the hardship, what dispute is this 
now? 
MR KOKO:   Chair, this is the arbitration just before 
Optimum took over, Optimum, because they keep lying to 
you where they say we have always had a dispute.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   We have always had a dispute since 2006, 
they do not tell you that the historical dispute of 2006 was 
resolved in 2011, they do not tell you that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and that dispute now that hey 
resolve in 2011 was the dispute about coal as well? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, no it was both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both, okay.  
MR KOKO:   So the dispute, the arbitration of 2011 Chair, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 373 of 413 
 
dealt with three issues. One was the quantity and it 
resolved that the annual volumes to Eskom will reduce 
from 6.5million to 5.5million tons, that we find in 3.4. 
The second dispute was on quality and on quality, it 
dealt with only one variable, abrasiveness index and Chair 
I am going to read because this is the most important part, 
let us call it the high-water mark.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Chair, I am going to read…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, this is re-examination.  This is 
10 
essentially re-examination. 
MR KOKO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but it is it is important, you see that 
part in regard to the hardship that Mr Koko pointed out 
about no reliance on export markets.  I think it is very 
important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   Right, page 1787. 
CHAIRPERSON:   17? 
MR KOKO:   Page 1787. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Mr, I have to tell my story and I should not be 
made to wait. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 1787.  
MR KOKO:   It is specifically recorded. It is saved and 
recorded in Clause 3.3. So we have to read this clause 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 374 of 413 
 
which is Clause 3.3 which only applies to abrasiveness 
index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on you talk about save, whatever, 
whatever, I am looking at it, I am looking at 1787 that is 
the heading abrasiveness index, right 
ADV BARRY SC:   It is at the foot of the page, that the 
witness is referring to, sir. 
MR KOKO:   Save to Clause 3.3; 
“There will be no change in the penalty premium 
and rejection regime, which will continue to be of 
10 
force and effect on the basis as set out in the coal 
supply agreement.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not see where you are reading.  
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 3.4.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 3.4.1 at the foot of the page 1787. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you see I think you – oh okay.  Now 
I see, when you say it save I thought that is how the clause 
starts, then it starts with it is specifically recorded. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, so it is specifically recorded that save as 
20 
recorded in Clause 3.3.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   “There will be no change in the penalty, the  
premium and rejection regime, which will continue 
to be enforced and effect on the same basis as set 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 375 of 413 
 
out as a coal supply agreement.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   So the arbitration outcome Chair, says save to 
the abrasiveness index the penalty premium and the 
rejection regime stays the same as in the coal supply 
agreement.  So, there is no – there should be no dispute 
about coal qualities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About? 
MR KOKO:   Coal qualities between Eskom and Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what the premium refers to? 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Quality? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and the rejection regime that 
means 
the 
circumstances 
under 
which 
coal 
can 
be 
rejected.  
MR KOKO:   Ja, so Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should not change.  
MR KOKO:   I do not want to waste your time but in the 
contract and there is another part two of the design of the 
20 
contract.  The only remedy that Eskom has to coal that is 
not compliance is penalties and rejection.  So, Eskom can 
either reject the coal…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or accept it and impose penalties. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, that is the only remedy that Eskom has. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 376 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so, this is saying that there will be 
no change on that. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is in other words, it is in favour of 
Glencore in the sense that Eskom is tied to what the 
position was. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so, Eskom is being told you cannot 
seek another remedy for this situation, these are your only 
remedy. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  Now, Chair, the most important part 
that I did not understand then that OCH really misled 
Eskom and if I had my way I will make them pay.  
Unfortunately, Mr Seleka he does not understand it, but I 
will make him understand it.  It is paragraph 3.42 and 
3.42…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What clause? 
MR KOKO:   Clause 3.42.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   3.42 deals with what we call the deemed 
quality clause in Clause 9.6 because 9.6 says: 
“Unless you serve non-compliance notices within 15 
days the coal is deemed to be compliant.” 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 377 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, Mr Seleka understands that very 
well Mr Koko, he understands that very well. 
MR KOKO:   Let me tell you why he does not understand 
that because this 3.42, it says and let us read it, it says: 
“The parties specifically agree and record that the 
spreadsheet in respect of qualities of coal sold and 
delivered by Optimum Colliery to Eskom exchange 
between parties on a daily basis will constitute 
ongoing compliance with the provisions of Clause 
9.6 of the CSA.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but what does 9.6 deal with? 
MR KOKO:   With the deemed clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the one that you have just read. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, it is a deem clause.  So this remedies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this Clause 3.4. 2 means that, as 
part of the settlement agreement, the parties referred to 
the spreadsheet which deals with qualities of coal sold and 
delivered by OCM to Eskom and it was saying the 
spreadsheet is exchanged between the parties on a daily 
basis.  
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
it 
was 
saying 
that, 
that 
spreadsheets will constitute ongoing compliance with the 
provisions of 9.6 of the CSA. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 378 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, what did that mean, as opposed to 
what was there before the settlement agreement because 
before the settlement agreement as I understand the CSA, 
if Eskom failed to give notice to OCM, they have given us 
coal that is defective, or that is less than or whatever 
quantity. 
If it failed to give that notice…[intervene] 
MR KOKO:   Within 15 days of delivery. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Within a specified period then the 
results would be that it cannot complain later.  
10 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is accepted that the coal was fine that 
is why it did not give that notice. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it wants to indicate that the coal is 
not fine, it must give that notice. 
MR KOKO:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was the position before the 
settlement agreement.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did this clause change that position 
if it did? 
MR KOKO:   So now, this clause says every day, Chair and 
I worked in the laboratory we exchanged spreadsheets for 
the 
coal 
qualities. 
 
So 
this 
clause 
says 
those 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 379 of 413 
 
spreadsheets, constitute compliance.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I mean, compliance in what way?  
Compliance on the part of Eskom to say we are not happy 
with your coal. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, did this clause now say, 
provided that we have exchanged the spreadsheet and if 
the spreadsheet says the coal is not good enough, is not of 
the right quality, then Eskom did not have to give notice in 
terms of the CSA. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So this Clause 3.4.2 change the regime 
in that way. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that if Eskom did not give notice, 
after the settlement agreement, provided this spreadsheet 
had been exchanged, and the spreadsheet indicated that 
coal was defective, then that would be fine.  
MR KOKO:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom could rely on the spreadsheet to 
20 
say, you gave us defective coal. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and well that part has never been 
raised. 
MR KOKO:   Exactly, Chair.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 380 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In evidence, nobody has raised that 
part. 
MR KOKO:   And it was never raised with me by CDH and I 
only learnt it later, when my counsel was arguing with me 
and says, but have you read this and all what CDH raises 
with you, is the next paragraph 3.4.3 which says: 
“If you make a deduction a month in arrears, you 
must give the details of why.” 
But that clause stands on its own, Clause 3.2 does not 
stand on its own, Clause 3.42 deals with 9.6, Clause 3.43 
10 
stands on it is own.  The fact that – and it happens a 
month in arrears only when you make the deduction.  The 
fact that I do not make a deduction does not mean I 
fulfilled them, because Clause 3.4. 2 stands on it is own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So going back to 3.4.2, are you saying 
that the position therefore is that after the conclusion of 
the settlement agreement it would not have been open to 
OCM/Glencore in regard to the penalties claim of Eskom to 
say but you did not give notice as contemplated in the CSA 
within 15 days. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Viola!  Viola! 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Viola! 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because that had bee superseded by 
this ...[intervenes]  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 381 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Viola! 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course if Eskom did not give that 
notice and there was no spreadsheet exchanged Eskom 
would – still would be in trouble. 
MR KOKO:   Yes, but the switches are done every day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Every day? 
MR KOKO:   Ja, every day, every single day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   You go to any power station in fact the 
affidavit of Gert Opperman, paragraph 59, says so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The purpose of the – what is the 
function of the spreadsheet, is it to indicate among other 
things Eskom’s assessment of the quality and quantity of 
the coal so that it indicates to OCM we are happy with your 
coal or we are not happy with your coal? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is part of its function? 
MR KOKO:   That is the only purpose of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the only purpose ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Only purpose of it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words the parties must have 
realised that the question of whether there is – whether the 
coal is defective or not must be indicated on the same day. 
MR KOKO:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 382 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   And Chair while we are on that can we go to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, of course your argument if it 
is correct Mr Koko would mean I suspect and Mr Seleka 
will be paying attention to this, may well mean that when 
Eskom settled the claim of penalties against Tegeta on a 
very low amount compared to the original amount, it could 
not rely on not having given that notice within fifteen days 
to say we had to settle this claim because we were going 
to lose in the arbitration because Glencore was going to 
10 
raise this issue and say where is your notice, you never 
gave us notice.  I am raising that because that is one of 
the issues that ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  Chair it will come, it is in my main affidavit, I 
am saying I settled at 577, based on Clause 9.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well you may be saying that but I 
don’t think somebody else, other people have said that, I 
don’t think Mr Molefe said that. 
MR KOKO:   No, I, we will go to it, I am saying it, I said it 
at 577 on the basis of Clause 9.6 in the absence of those 
20 
notices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in the absence of those notices but 
how would you rely on ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:  But this is my point, and this is my anger now 
Chair at the CDH, I relied on a legal opinion and in the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 383 of 413 
 
memo of CDH of March 2017, which did not tell me about a 
second addendum 3.42 and what it told me was 9.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but then so in terms of what 
happened then and in terms of your understanding of the 
position at that time you relied on the absence of the 
notices. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say now actually the issue of 
notices was neither here nor there. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The issue was in the spreadsheets. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
the 
spreadsheets 
had 
been 
exchanged? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
therefore 
in 
terms 
of 
that 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   And therefore we were ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Eskom was not – had not failed ot 
comply with ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ....anything. 
MR KOKO:   Yes Chair and therefore – Chair this is 
important because I am going to make a motivation to you 
that the R2.1billion was not bogus, it was real. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 384 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Chair please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore the whole amount should 
have been pursued against Tegeta? 
MR KOKO:   Yes!  Yes1!  And should have been pursued 
against Optimum too. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  It was pursued. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was pursued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was pursued against Optimum. 
MR KOKO:   No against Optimum ...[indistinct] lose. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you never – nobody has said that’s 
what you were told against Optimum, you are the first one 
to tell me. 
MR KOKO:  Come again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am saying you are the first one to tell 
me that against Optimum/Glencore you were told you were 
going to lose.    
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   None of the witnesses before you have 
told – has told me that. 
20 
MR KOKO:  But the documents of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What they have said is that they were 
told when they sought to pursue the claim against Tegeta 
...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Ja, but Chair ...[intervenes]  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 385 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   They told you ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   But Chair this is why I had a problem with the 
witnesses that have come before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   I mean Ms Daniels goes an extra mile and I 
have got a document here, she says she was in a meeting 
with Mr Thulangu CDH when they briefed us that we are 
going to lose and we persisted because we were captured  
That is Ms Daniels who says that.  The whole recipient of 
this document of CDH, CDH writes in these documents that 
10 
we are going to lose, CDH says so, he says – they don’t 
say we are going to lose but they seem to be saying y9ou 
are going to have difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Now Chair please then go to page 18 – 
Bundle 15 C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   15 C what page? 
MR KOKO:  1811. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1811. 
MR KOKO:   Right.  Chair 1811 is ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a lighter note Mr Koko why do I 
suspect that after this episode you are going to feel like 
coming back. 
MR KOKO:  Chair I would be happy to come back because 
this is ...[intervenes]  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 386 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughing] 
MR KOKO:   Chair this is – Chair Ms Thuli Madonsela did 
us wrong, she did not look at this evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And she labelled us and not looking at this 
evidence, and the comfort I have is that you are interacting 
with this evidence, therefore you will not conclude that Mr 
Molefe was brought into Eskom to force Optimum into 
hardship when the document speaks for itself.   If Ms 
Madonsela looked at this evidence Chair she would have 
10 
reached a different, she would have cut us some slack, but 
please 
let’s 
go 
to 
paragraph 
56 
of 
the 
– 
page 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am there. 
MR KOKO:   So page 56 ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair just for the record that is an 
extract from the affidavit of Mr Gert Opperman and I am 
not aware that that affidavit is before you in any other 
form, but it is an extract of Mr Opperman, the first page is 
there for purposes of identification, and the last page I 
20 
think for purposes of signature, we didn’t include the whole 
of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I was – hang on second I was still 
asking what document we are dealing with that has got 
Clause 56.  Oh you say – oh you say it’s part of Mr 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 387 of 413 
 
Opperman’s affidavit but you don’t know whether this 
affidavit is already before me? 
ADV BARRIE SC:    Yes, as you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka I know that there is an 
affidavit of Mr Opperman but I don’t know if it is this one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   It is the only one Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I haven’t checked this one Chair but I 
know he has testified ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, no there is an Opperman, there is an 
10 
affidavit by Opperman ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Chairperson this is the only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it the only one, okay, no it is alright, 
okay just read paragraph 56 then. 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph 56 is the coal quality, how qualities 
were managed at Hendrina and it is no different to how we 
managed it everywhere.  Chair one of my sins I was the 
corporate specialist on coal and that is why I am getting so 
passionate about it, I paint my ...[indistinct] on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja., 
20 
MR KOKO:   For the delivery of coal by OCM to – and 
Chair I am going to read this but the most important bullet 
point I am interested in is [i] at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   Well if the others are not 
important go to [i] but if they are important ...[intervenes]  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 388 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes, so the [i] having analysed the coal it 
says the result of the coal analysis are available to both 
Eskom and OCM simultaneously and what he did not put 
there is via the spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR KOKO:   What he did not put there is that the results 
are available simultaneously via the spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, but that is what – that is the 
basis on which he was saying this? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR KOKO:   Right, Chair while we are on that page I don’t 
want to come back to it, in the next page is paragraph 60. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   Now the Optimum and other witnesses have 
really led you astray to want to believe that the CSA of 
Optimum was onerous, was unworkable and the fines could 
not be resolved which was wrong, was a lie, but let me give 
me what the project manager says and that is in paragraph 
60.  I am going to read 59 to 61. 
20 
“In hindsight it became clear that soon after 2012 
refurbishment of ...[indistinct] the recorded size in 
parameters of the quote supplied by the conveyor 
did not meet the contract specifications.  There 
were several initiatives to understand the science 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 389 of 413 
 
and challenges and their – and this included 
assessment 
by 
both 
Eskom 
employees 
and 
a 
consultant ETC.   Eventually on 1 October 2015 Mr 
Jan Hogis from Optima unilaterally decided to 
switch off the secondary crusher at the ...[indistinct] 
point of the Hendrina power station.   When the 
secondary crusher was switched off Eskom noticed 
that 
there 
was 
significant 
reduction 
in 
the 
percentage of points reported in the daily coal 
results sheet.  From October 1, 2015 the secondary 
10 
crusher was never operational and it was clear that 
it had a significant effect on the increase of points 
reported by the two laboratories.” 
In this transcript, page 60 of these transcripts – I forgot 
the date – it says this is how these points were shown in 
October 2015, so the whole story that the fines could not 
be solved and therefore made the contract onerous.  It is 
wrong, the fact is Optimum did not operate the mine 
according to the best practices, the problem of the fines 
was the secondary or the secondary – was the secondary 
20 
crusher 
at assembly point which was solved 
by 
Mr 
Flaggers[?] on the 1 s t of October so there should not have 
been a problem, and here we are short, we are killed, we 
are told names for a mere technical problem that could not 
be resolved. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 390 of 413 
 
 
Chair the issue then becomes how did Tegeta solve 
this problem, so that is another discussion, but all that I 
am submitting to you is that the question of quality at 
Optimum was Optimum, was Glencore/Optimum’s problem 
and that is why I wrote opinion piece which is part of here, 
that they have made their bed, they had to lie on it and 
when they switched off the bed and refused to go on 
arbitration they broke the relationship with me as the 
Group Executive of ‘Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, I mean the – I will hear 
10 
what Mr Ephron will say when he comes here, part of what 
is important is about some of the elaboration that you have 
given.  It seems on the face of this – it seems on the face 
of 
it 
to 
explain 
why 
Glencore/OCM 
did 
not 
pursue 
arbitration to the end, a question that I have raised to say 
if they say they were aggrieved by your – by Eskom’s 
conduct in not agreeing to raise the parts and the 
agreement CSA – the CSA said for that you can go to 
arbitration if you feel any hardship, and there did at some 
stage appear to be going towards arbitration.  Why did they 
20 
not pursue it to the end, so you are saying out of – or what 
you think is they realised because of Clause 27 I think you 
said that they had no reasonable chance of winning the 
application because their problem, they would have to rely 
on the effects on them of export markets, of the export 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 391 of 413 
 
markets, and that clause, ...[indistinct] clause excluded 
that. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is why they didn’t pursue 
arbitration to the end. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And complained that Eskom was being 
hash on them by not agreeing. 
MR KOKO:   Yes.  There’s a second part to your question 
that says when they signed the arbitration agreement in 
10 
December they excluded the coal qualities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   Again they did so because they knew that it 
was dealt with already in the arbitration agreement of April 
2011 and that they will – there’s nothing new but the third 
part that they lied to you about is they told you that we’ve 
got a contract of 40 years and its fixed, the price is fixed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   They lied to you Chair, I won’t go to it, Mr 
Seleka can do that.   The payment clause, the price and 
20 
payment clause is clause 7.  Clause 7.1 says: 
“Payment will be done according to Schedule 3 and 
Schedule 4.”  
I won’t go to Schedule 3 and Schedule 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you might have to because you  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 392 of 413 
 
might explain something that nobody has explained. 
MR KOKO:   Chair I really want to do that, because one of 
the issues I had raised when Mr Brian Molefe referred to 
when 
he 
came 
to 
give 
evidence 
was 
why 
did 
Glencore/Optima agree to a clause that tied them to the 
price for such a long time, why didn’t they raise that issue 
from – why did they agree to that in the first place and Mr 
Brian Molefe’s answer was that they didn’t do due diligence 
and they were – I don’t know whether he said they were 
hoping to use their proximity to Mr Ramaphosa and he was 
10 
not Deputy President at the time, in order to gain some 
advantage but you are saying no, no, no there is a 
schedule 3 and schedule 4 which says something about 
that, what do they say? 
MR KOKO:   Chair the problem with Mr Molefe is that he 
behaves like a Commander, he wants to take responsibility 
for everybody’s problem, he should have easily said that’s 
Mr Koko’s problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR KOKO:   Because – and I have listened to him on many 
20 
occasions, things that he has no personal knowledge of 
that I did he tries to defend, when he should just say but 
this is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko will deal with it. 
MR KOKO:   Mr Koko will deal with that.  Of course I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 393 of 413 
 
discussed it with him, but Chair there is a big difference 
there is a big difference between the owner of the problem 
and somebody explaining to you, especially when the 
explanations happened five years ago, so I think Mr Molefe 
tried 
to 
get 
himself 
...[indistinct] 
but 
Chair 
let 
me 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are we going to find what you are 
looking for? 
MR KOKO:   It is in Gert Opperman’s affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And let’s – we were dealing with that 
10 
just now, what ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   No Chair what we were dealing with Chair is 
one the things I suspected is that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry what bundle was that where 
Mr Gert Opperman’s affidavit is? 
MR KOKO:   15c 
ADV SELEKA SC:    15c Chair. 
MR KOKO:   No, no, 15c is my ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes it has Mr Gert Opperman’s 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but no I just took the pages, so this page I 
did not include, but – oh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay so ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   But I want to read to you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I want to see what you are looking, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 394 of 413 
 
what you are going to read from? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Give us the para number. 
MR KOKO:   Paragraph ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In what bundle first. 
MR KOKO:   Well where is Gert Opperman’s ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair it is – I think he would have 
pulled it out from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it was in this ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bundle at page 1 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we don’t have it here. 
10 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but Chair you need to look at these 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Read it, read it there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have a copy which is not paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay no, read it because you have 
got what you want to read to me, even if I am not looking 
at it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell me ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   It is on page, it is in Gert Opperman’s page 
20 
GJ0184 and it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and what paragraphs of his 
affidavit, I think that would be ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   But it is a ...[indistinct] and then I am reading 
the coal supply agreement, CSE agreement, Clause 7, 7.1, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 395 of 413 
 
it says: 
“The contract price payable for coal to be supplied 
by TNC [and TNC is Optima] to Eskom under this 
agreement shall be determined in accordance with 
the provisions of Schedule 3 ...”  ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you say TNC is Optima? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that refer to ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   ...[Indistinct]  ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the earlier entity. 
10 
MR KOKO:   The earlier entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay ja, no if you say the earlier 
entity Optima’s predecessor I will understand, if you say it 
is Optima ...[indistinct], Optima’s predecessor, but Optima 
took over the rights and obligations. 
MR KOKO:   Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   So the price shall be determined in 
accordance with provisions of Schedule 3 and Schedule 4 
hereto. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The price of coal? 
MR KOKO:   The price of coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And if you go ot Schedule 3 you will find the 
contract price. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 396 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And the – it is on page 138 of Mr Gert 
Opperman’s, GJO138 and then we find in monthly contract 
price payable by Eskom to TNC in terms of Clause 7 of the 
agreement to which this schedule is annexed as Schedule 
3 and shall be determined in accordance with the following 
formula, and it gives you the formula and then in the 
formula there is an ...[indistinct] at A and the ...[indistinct] 
at A is equal to the escalation factor determined in 
accordance with schedule 3 to this agreement.  So there is 
10 
an escalation factor ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is not the same price throughout? 
MR KOKO:   No, no, no, it is not, you were lied to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
MR KOKO:   You were simply lied to, people are just taking 
advantage of you. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Chair the relevant pages of the 
agreement are before you in terms of the bundle C, 15C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  At page 1720. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1720. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes, in Bundle 15C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, right. 
MR KOKO:   Chair we haven’t ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the clause itself which Mr Koko 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 397 of 413 
 
read, 7.1 it is at 16.61. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes the contract price is at 1715 and 
the escalation at the page that I referred you to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja at Eskom Bundle 15C page 17, 270, I 
have seen the heading “escalation factor” and then I see X 
and so on, is it ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE SC:   No that is Schedule 4, so Schedule 3 is 
the one it is before that one, 1715. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, but Mr Koko do you seek to 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR KOKO:   17 Mr Barrie? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you seek to contract price ja is it 
1715, contract price, the monthly price tabled by Eskom – 
that is what you were reading just now Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got that, that’s in schedule 3? 
MR KOKO:   Yes,  yes it is in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that Schedule 3? 
MR KOKO:   That is Schedule 3, what you see in page 
1715 is Schedule 3. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   And then if you go to 74 Chair it will be 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s just finish with schedule 3 if 
we may, the monthly contract price payable by Eskom to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 398 of 413 
 
TNC in terms of Clause 7 of the agreement to which this 
schedule is annexed as schedule 3, and that agreement is 
SCA, shall be determined in accordance with the following 
formula.  P = 8 x [B + C – C + E + F – D] and then it says 
where P, it refers to the monthly contract price payable by 
Eskom,  
[a] the escalation ...[indistinct] determined in accordance 
with Schedule 4 to the agreement; 
[b] the monthly base price; 
[c] the bonus if any payable in terms of Part 1 of Schedule 
10 
1 to the Agreement;  
[d] the penalty if any payable in terms of Part 1 of 
Schedule 1 to the agreement;  
[e] the bonus if any payable in terms of Part 2 of Schedule 
1 to the agreement;  
[f] the consistency bonus if any payable in terms of 
Schedule 2 to the agreement;  
[g] the penalty if any payable in terms of Part 2 of 
Schedule 1 to the agreement. 
 
Yes, and then you say we must go to ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR KOKO:   Chair if we go to page 1720.l 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOKO:   And you see the escalation factor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
MR KOKO:   And you will see that the escalation factor it 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 399 of 413 
 
is – the X here is that [a] that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It says the escalation factor. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The escalation factor is defined in the 
agreement, the agreement to which this schedule is 
annexed as Schedule 4 shall be determined in accordance 
with the following formula, and then there is a formula 
there that is given and the formula involves various 
factors.   It goes up to page 1721. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but the point you are making about 
all of this Mr Koko if I understand well is this, to the extent 
that anybody has said to this Commission or said at any 
time anywhere that the price, the coal price, to which – 
which was applicable when Glencore/OCM commenced its 
contractual relationship with Eskom was fixed and was – 
needed an amendment of the agreement in order to be 
increased 
that 
is 
wrong 
and 
that 
was 
based 
on 
a 
misunderstanding of the CSA agreement read with its 
schedules? 
20 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because in terms of the CSA agreement 
and schedule 3 and schedule 4 when the price could be 
increased in accordance with the escalation regime that 
was provided for in schedules 3 and 4 or schedule 4.   
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 400 of 413 
 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that ...[intervenes]  
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the point you are making? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore insofar as Glencore/OCM 
felt that they needed the price to be increased this is one 
route they could have used? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And their failure to use it must mean that 
10 
they didn’t understand the agreement? 
MR KOKO:   Yes Chair but the dispute notice of July 23 
says in that dispute notice that the escalations are – the 
actual escalations at the mine are higher than what the 
contract says, that is what I say, and my response to them 
is quite simple that – the escalations as we have them is 
an outcome of arbitration of 2011, you have to tell me what 
happened between 2011 April and July 2013, that was not 
part of the settlement agreement.   You have to come and 
tell me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, but now schedule 8 talks about a 
monthly price. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
agreement 
could 
not 
have 
contemplated that there would be a new price every month, 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 401 of 413 
 
so why is it talking about a monthly price? 
MR KOKO:   Because the indexes, the producer price index 
is – you see it is linked to the producer price index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position that the formula used to 
determine 
the 
price 
is 
based 
among 
others 
on 
the 
consumer price index? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that, or you could find that there are 
different prices for different months? 
MR KOKO:   Yes, you’ve got it Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR KOKO:   You’ve got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how could Glencore/OCM not have 
known this? 
MR KOKO:  No they have known it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They knew it?  
MR KOKO:   They were taken Eskom provide and this is 
where I am saying to you Chair I have met these people, I 
have interacted with them, at one point if I was not in a 
business environment I would have reacted badly.  These 
20 
people took advantage of their proximity to Mr Ramaphosa, 
they thought they could come to Eskom and say increase 
the price and we will turn the other cheek.  I mean my – Mr 
Bester when he resigned on the 20 t h of June or 20 t h July 
2015, he says to me these people are in hardship, they are 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 402 of 413 
 
friends of the future President of the Republic, why do you 
want to be on the other side, why do you want to offend the 
future President of the Republic and you will see in my 
emails to DPE to Jewell I said to him I want to keep this 
factual, because in my briefing with him I told him these 
people are touching us with Mr Ramaphosa and they think 
that we must accept and then Mr Jewell ...[indistinct] 
wanted me to write it, I said I am not writing it, but this is 
where 
I 
am 
saying 
Chair 
this 
Commission 
and 
Ms 
Madonsela are caught up between the business interests of 
10 
the former President and the current President and the 
difference with you is that you are following the evidence 
and you will hopefully make your decision based on the 
evidence when Ms Madonsela took the side without looking 
at the evidence. 
 
These guys were so arrogant, they felt entitled, 
forget the contract, we are in hardship, give us the price. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you need to also remember that if I 
recall correctly she seems to have had a shorter time to 
look at these matters than this Commission has had. 
20 
MR KOKO:   Ja, but then she should not have called us 
captured.  We are labelled captured because of her report.   
Mr Koko you are capture, why do you say I am captured, 
because Ms Madonsela said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Well I will Mr Seleka I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 403 of 413 
 
think we need to hear a response from the Glencore/OCM 
side on all of this even if it is by way of responses to 
specific questions on affidavit and I emphasize on affidavit 
or affirmed declaration because there has been a complaint 
that Mr Ephron does not depose to an affidavit, he just 
sends statements.   I have not gone to check whether this 
claim is correct but I know it has been made. 
 
You see Mr Koko one has got to – one has got to 
ask the question why would they – that is Glencore/OCM – 
go to the extent of putting the company on business rescue 
10 
or to the extent of even selling the company or the shares, 
all arising from this if they knew that they could address 
this grievance about price in this way. 
MR KOKO:   Chair they failed in ...[indistinct] they failed in 
...[indistinct] you know what these guys used ot tell me, he 
says Mr Koko who the hell do you think you are, we have 
always got the prices we wanted.   We have always got the 
prices we wanted, why only now because of you, why only 
now, just give us the price we want and I said to them 
Eskom prices we are a reputable business and I go into – 
20 
Chair when I wrote my affidavit I wrote is a ...[indistinct] I 
said 
to 
them 
we 
are 
a 
reputable 
business, 
NERSA 
regulates how much revenue I must get, MYPD3, in terms 
of MYPD3 I have applied for two R255billion, you know 223 
to be exact Chair, R223billion on coal purchases within the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 404 of 413 
 
MYPD3 window, I got R200billion, I am R30billion short so 
if I agreed to your proposal, and Chair you must go to 
paragraph, to MMK50, the last page of MK50 your proposal 
will add R5.5billion to Eskom costs up to the end of the 
contract.  I can afford it but I also  have included – Chair 
let’s go to that, paragraph 26 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just make your point first before we – so 
that I see whether it is necessary.  
MR KOKO:   In the minutes of – in the meeting of IFC 2015 
the IFC, the FD said Government is not going to give us 
10 
money, government is not going to give us money, we are 
not in the position to raise more debt, so if you are an 
executive of Eskom and your CFO in the board meeting and 
it is minuted and it is there Chair, if you don’t go to it now 
because Mr Seleka wants to finish it, I have included it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you know you say that is in what 
bundle? 
MR KOKO:   Bundle 15C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   15? 
MR KOKO:   15C yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   C? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s just see whether we have got 
what page – you want to try and find it? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Mr Koko what document are you looking 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 405 of 413 
 
for? 
MR KOKO:  The minutes of the 26 t h of February 2015.  I 
have seen it.  It’s page 315. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   It is 315, page 315.  
MR KOKO:   No, we don’t have ... 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Bundle 15C at page 1849. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1849. 
MR KOKO:   Chair this is the minutes of the Investment & 
Finance Committee of the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second let me get there.  
10 
Yes.   Yes Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   It is the meeting of the 26 t h of February 2015 
the Board members you see there Chair if you go to page 
1850 and you see the inputs by the FD ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the  highlighted parts starting 
with the FD reported? 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   The FD reported that it was highly unlikely 
that a further equity injection from government to Eskom 
20 
was forthcoming and raising further that was becoming a 
very expensive option, thus the only option for the 
recovery of the additional costs associated with these 
initiatives was for Eskom to approach the Regulator to 
selectively reappoint MYPD3 determination in order to 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 406 of 413 
 
recover that.     
 
So the CFO of Eskom is saying we are not going to 
raise that, we are not going to get equity from government 
so the only revenue to cover any wish list is to go to the 
regulator.   
 
Now Chair the next – no it is 1851 I have already 
highlighted it for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1851? 
MR KOKO:   1851. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I see the highlighted part. 
10 
MR KOKO:   The CE ...[indistinct]  with the package which 
included a tariff increase and equity injection.  Both could 
not be liquidated quickly to assist the cash flow.  The 
Chairman stated that IFC  had to write to the Board to 
request the Board to write to the shareholder and the War 
Room to appraise them of the fact including the fact that 
the EAF, the Energy Availability Fit that was at 70% and 
was still reducing while the cost is increasing.   It was 
reported that it was highly unlikely that the business 
productivity process would achieve a R60billion savings in 
20 
the financial year. 
 
The Chairman recommended that the following 
issues be included in the letter, about the dire Eskom 
financial position.   Use other levers in parallel to find a 
gap that would assist Eskom.   Consider MYPD4 now, know 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 407 of 413 
 
that the government cannot assist Eskom with cash flow. 
 
So if you go to the resolutions – if you go to the 
resolutions, and it is page 1853 of the resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   It says a letter should be prepared from the 
investment committee, investment finance committee, IFC, 
to request the Board to engage the shareholder and the 
War Room to appraise them of the facts about Eskom’s dire 
financial position including the fact that the EAF was at 
70% and reducing and costs were increasing.  Eskom 
10 
would use other levels in parallel to find a gap that would 
assist the cash flow.  Consideration would be given to 
MYPD for now noting that Government cannot assist with 
cash flow.  I will stop there. 
 
So Chair I as a leader as Eskom was faced with a 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja go closer to the mic. 
MR KOKO:   I as a leader of Eskom ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR KOKO:   ...and Molefe was confronted with this really 
20 
to where the Board has resolved that we not going to get 
money from Government, we are not going to be successful 
in raising additional debt to cover the R5.5billion that 
Optimum Mine was going to cost us and the only way is to 
go to the Regulator.  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 408 of 413 
 
 
We did that Chair, we went ot the regulator on the 
30 t h of April 2015 and we asked NERSA to give us 
R52.8billion to cover all these issues, we explained to 
NERSA that if you don’t give us the R52.8billion we will not 
be able to keep the lights on.  Chair on the next page is 
the response from NERSA.  NERSA responds, if I can go to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Their response is dated 8 May 2015 and 
it is a media statement, if that is what you are looking at. 
MR KOKO:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 1854. 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR KOKO:   And NERSA rejects that, NERSA rejects this, I 
heard you but I reject you.  If I cannot find money from the 
government as equity I cannot raise debt and NERSA says 
no I will be foolish to agree to the proposal of Optimum 
that will the business R5.5billion, it will be against the 
PFMA, I will not be able to find it.   Why am I being 
criminalised, why am I being called corrupt for that, why 
20 
am I being called captured for that, and Chair this is the 
point I am asking you, is that we have applied our minds, 
we were not corrupt, we were not favouring anybody, this is 
the 
situation 
we 
found 
ourselves 
in 
and 
Ms 
Thuli 
Madonsela really owes me an apology for doing the right 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 409 of 413 
 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see some of the points you 
raise haven’t been raised by anybody as far as I remember 
Mr Koko.   I have noticed that we are at five to – six 
minutes to ten. 
MR KOKO:   Chair I am happy to come back the next day 
to finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] I like the idea Mr Koko, well I 
don’t know where I will find time because there isn’t, but I 
from my point of view in the light of some of the things you 
10 
have pointed out I will prefer if I could find time for you to 
come back, because it might be important to hear more. 
MR KOKO  Chair I want to – I have got a lot to say about 
the R1.6billion.   I have got a lot to say about prepayment, 
the 650, I have got a lot to say about the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I think we will need to stop for 
today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   We need a separate Commission 
of Inquiry Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is point one, point two, we can 
20 
explore, we can use the issue of – we can use the route of 
written questions and written answers by way of affidavit in 
the meantime, but if I do find a space I am going to what I 
can to assist Mr Koko to come back because this is an 
important part but we just have difficulties with time but I 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 410 of 413 
 
don’t want to say let’s wait for when I find time or not.   I 
would like that questions be formulated and be sent to him, 
that would have been asked and that he responds but if I 
find time he can come and explain and deal with that 
matters even if he has dealt with them in writing because 
sometimes that can have if you have got oral clarification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Barrie you see what has 
happened, so that is what I propose now, that we continue 
with the arrangement of written questions and written 
10 
answers in the form of an affidavit but I do – I will look and 
try and see where we can find time for Mr Koko to come 
back, even if he has to provide the information on affidavit 
because it could make a difference and I am happy that 
from his side he now agrees that if that can be done he will 
be glad to come back. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair in the context of what you 
suggested on Thursday regarding how we will deal with re-
examination and whether that wouldn’t best be dealt with 
on affidavit.  These aspects will – we will deal with that in 
20 
an affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you must just raise your voice, 
the aircon is making a noise. 
ADV 
BARRIE 
SC: 
 
 
 
Ja, 
we 
will 
deal 
with 
that 
...[intervenes]  
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 411 of 413 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the way that ...[intervenes]  
ADV BARRIE SC:   In that sort of format. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  We intend to do it comprehensively. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   As Mr Koko is happy to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  And to respond to questions if they are 
put in writing, in terms of that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, no that is fine.  It is just that 
10 
Wednesday is short notice, there is some space on 
Wednesday but it is short notice, probably you have other 
things also. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I am available Wednesday, is it in the 
evening sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are available? 
ADV BARRIE SC:  Is it in the evening or during the day? 
CHAIRPERSON:   During the day. 
ADV BARRIE SC:  I can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can do it 
20 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, then maybe we should – let’s 
say, let’s confirm tomorrow, is that fine?   So you will get 
confirmation about Wednesday tomorrow through Mr Seleka 
or the Secretariat. 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 412 of 413 
 
ADV BARRIE SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if Wednesday doesn’t happen we 
stick to the arrangement we have agreed to.  Okay, alright.  
I realise that Mr Seleka you have been denied an 
opportunity to say much, but I think that some of the issues 
are 
important 
and 
I 
don’t 
know 
about 
you 
but 
my 
recollection is that some of the points that Mr Koko has 
brought up haven’t been brought up before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   During oral evidence. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So okay let’s stop for – let’s adjourn for 
today so tomorrow one way or another communication will 
need to be given to Mr Koko’s legal team about whether 
Wednesday can happen.   If it doesn’t happen we stick to 
the arrangement that written questions will be put and 
comprehensive answers will be given and by way of 
affidavit but on top of that if I can find time I will try and 
find time for him to come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand Mr Koko? 
MR KOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you to you Mr Koko, thank you to 
Mr Berry and your whole legal team, thank you Mr Seleka 
and your junior and the whole team, thank you to the 
17 MAY 2021 – DAY 396 
 
Page 413 of 413 
 
investigation team, thank you to the staff, the technicians 
and everybody, thank you to all of you for your cooperation 
and for staying until so late. 
 
Thank you very much.   For the benefit of the public 
tomorrow I will hear the evidence of witnesses who come 
from Travel Excellence who will give evidence about travel 
bookings and arrangements that they made for various 
persons at the instance of Mr Salim Essa most of the time I 
think they say and in the evening I will hear the evidence 
of the former Speaker of Parliament, Ms Baleka Mbete on 
10 
Parliamentary Oversight, thank you. 
 
For today we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 18 MAY 2021
