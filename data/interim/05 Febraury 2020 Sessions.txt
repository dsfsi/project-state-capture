PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 5 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mbikiwa, good morning everybody. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Sambo you – the oath you took yesterday 
continues to apply today okay? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes I understand. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS SAMBO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Let us proceed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo before we start could I ask you 
just to move the microphone a little bit closer towards you so that we 
can – we can hear.  Ms Sambo we finished yesterday’s proceedings 
with you explaining the relationship that you had with AAR.  From the 
outset your attempts to secure an agency agreement and their 
reluctance to do so.  If we can then pick it up from paragraph 15 of 
your affidavit and can you just tell us in broad terms after your return 
20 
from the United States how did your – your relationship with AAR then 
develop? 
MS SAMBO:  Okay when I returned from the US on the first to AAR I 
tried several times to contact Ms Cheryl Jackson to continue the 
discussion and trying to probe more for – for us to get an agreement – 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 3 of 180 
 
sort of an agreement with them.  And I was also introduced to Mr Shah 
who was also working for AAR but based in the Middle East and looking 
after Middle East and Africa.  And there were two – when I went to AAR 
I wanted – I talked to them about the components bid that normally 
comes out every five years from SAA Technical.  But as soon as I got 
closer to working with SAA Technical then I also realised that they also 
have quotation systems for consumables.  So on item 15 I think this 
was a quotation for one of the consumables that I sent to Mr Shah to – 
to quote us so that we could respond for the ignitor plugs at SAA 
Technical.  It has got nothing to do with the contracts.  The big 
10 
components contract.  It is a quotation for consumables.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed and what was the – what was your 
proposal as to how at that state your relationship would work? 
MS SAMBO:  No the quotation system is straightforward.  I sent the 
enquiry – they give me a quotation – I put my mark-up and I quote the 
client.  Then if I get the positive response then I would order and 
supply to the client.  But I have never had that relationship with AAR. I 
have never ordered anything from them but for this one yes they did 
quote me but I did not get the – I was not awarded that quotation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Then you speak in your affidavit about your 
20 
efforts to set up a meeting between Mr Shah and Mr Musa Zwane.  Who 
is Mr Zwane? 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Musa Zwane was the CEO of SAA Technical at that 
time. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did you know him at this stage? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 4 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Kindly rephrase your question which stage? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At the point at which you trying to set up a 
meeting between him on the one hand and representatives of AAR on 
the other around January 2013? 
MS SAMBO:  No, no, no I was still trying to get to have a meeting with 
him so that I could know him.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what were you trying to achieve by 
setting up a meeting with Mr Zwane? 
MS SAMBO:  I wanted to introduce AAR indicates that introduce SRS 
aviation and indicate our interest in doing business with SAA Technical 
10 
and for him as the CEO to guide in which is the route that we need to 
take to be able to do that.  And also AAR from the beginning – from the 
first meeting in Chicago they requested that I get a meeting with him so 
that is what I wanted to get an appointment with him so that AAR can 
come and market themselves better.  I did not – I was not technical 
savvy at that time. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we then turn to what you describe as 
the first bid – the first SAAT bid?  And here you describe a tender.  
What was the tender for? 
MS SAMBO:  It was for the supply of aircraft components for various 
20 
aircraft types at SAA Technical. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you say that you downloaded this bid 
document and sent it to – to Mr Shah and Ms Jackson.  What – what 
was your proposal in doing that? 
MS SAMBO:  It was a follow up on the discussion that we want to do 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 5 of 180 
 
business with them and the tender was an open tender.  I downloaded it 
from the SAA website and sent to them and said, now this is the 
opportunity for us to get that deal on the table.  Here is a tender let us 
respond.  If we get it then it will create that opportunity for us to go 
into the next stage of a full partnership or an agency agreement. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you – you say that you then visited the 
AAR offices again in around March 2013.  What was the purpose of that 
visit? 
MS SAMBO:  The purpose of that visit was to show AAR the sincerity 
and the – how – how I really wanted to do this.  How much I really 
10 
wanted to do this.  I used my own costs – at my own time, went back to 
say, here I am I still do believe there is an opportunity to supply SAA 
Technical and then the rest of the continent.  Can we please have an 
agreement in place?  Still I did not get the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you went there had they responded in any way 
to the correspondence you had sent to them alerting them to – to this 
bid? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What had they – what had been their response? 
MS SAMBO:  Regarding the bid Mr Shah then decided to come to South 
20 
Africa to come and work on the bid with me.  So they did positively 
respond.  And prior to that also the Department of Trade and Industry 
at the Embassy in Chicago between 2011 and 2013 they have been also 
probing AAR to engage with me.  So there has been communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after you had sent them the correspondence 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 6 of 180 
 
alerting them to this tender and before you went there in March they 
responded positively in terms of wanting the two of you to work 
together on this bid? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS SAMBO:  Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You say that part of your reason for going 
there was to formalise the relationship between SRS and AAR.  Were 
you able to do that in any way? 
MS SAMBO:  Unfortunately not.  AAR said to me they will sign a 
10 
teaming agreement with SRS when we respond to the bid.  That is 
applicable to the period of that bid.  But there was no long standing 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you went to Chicago in March you said that Mr 
Shah responded and wanted to work with you on the bid.  Was – did 
you – did the two of you do quite some work on the bid before you went 
to Chicago? 
MS SAMBO:  I will need to confirm.  There are details of when Mr Shah 
came to my office.  Can I just find the details to respond to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine ja.  I just want to – to see what 
20 
progress if any the two of you had made before you went to Chicago or 
in March? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo I think paragraph 25 is the one 
you are looking for. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay thank you so much.  Yes Mr Shah came to our 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 7 of 180 
 
offices after I came back from the US.  So they responded positively 
that they would work with me and hence I also went across to Chicago.  
Then when I came back Mr Shah came from Dubai side – from the 
Middle East to then come and work on the response for the bid with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would this mean that the two of you did not work on 
the bid before you went to Chicago in March? 
MS SAMBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No – no you did not or do you mean you did work 
together on the bid before you went to Chicago in March? 
MS SAMBO:  No we did not work on the bid together. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But had they responded to the correspondence 
at that time before you went to Chicago in March? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes they had responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And their response was positive? 
MS SAMBO:  It was positive yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So when you went to Chicago in March did you 
want to concretise the arrangement in the light of the positive 
response? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes because now there was bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  That we could both respond to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  And AAR said yes we will sign a teaming agreement but 
as far as this bid is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 8 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You say that shortly after your trip to 
Chicago you introduced AAR to someone in the Department of Trade 
and Industry.  Can you tell us about that? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes one of the requirements on the bid is for any 
international or multinational company that seeks to get a contract that 
is worth more than 10 million US Dollars then they have a requirement 
to comply with the 30% localisation in a form of NIP which is the 
National Industrial Participation Program.  So that program resides 
within the Department of Trade and Industry and the lady who was 
responsible for NIP – the National Industrial Participation Program was 
10 
Ms Nomvula Tsatsi whom I sent an email to introducing AAR and 
indicating that we responding to this bid and we would like to get more 
information in understanding what the program was all about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Mbikiwa you might wish to just spell that 
surname or for the transcriber or the – Ms Nomvula is it Tsatsi? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Tsatsi that is T-s-a-t-s-i. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just so that the transcribers will not write 
something that we cannot even understand. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And you can do the same for all the names 
20 
that are not – might not be easy to spell if they do not see a document 
where they are written. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo you did – you did at some point 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 9 of 180 
 
conclude an agreement with – with AAR, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes the teaming agreement for this bid. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us about the teaming agreement? 
MS SAMBO:  The teaming agreement was drafted by the legal 
department at AAR Corporation and it was emailed to me.  It was 
talking about us responding to the bid and that – and it was actually 
outlining what their responsibilities would be and what would their 
responsibilities for SRS would be.  I would guess we will see the 
teaming agreement on the evidence.  I do not remember the full 
agreement as it is but we can refer to it. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No sure.  I would like to go there very 
briefly.  Could I ask you to turn to page 76 of your bundle that is at 
Tab9?   
MS SAMBO:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if you turn over the page to page 77 you 
will see under 2.1A that the first of the objectives is the parties agree 
that the objectives of the SAAT program are to work together to 
propose a component SAAT program to SAAT and to consequently 
jointly identify the technical industrial and market requirements for 
such a program.  Can I ask if you just look further down the page at 
20 
Principles of Cooperation? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  SRSA that is SRS Aviation as we have been 
calling it, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 10 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  When it says provides support to AAR in 
winning the SAAT program by providing intelligence, what does that 
mean? 
MS SAMBO:  We really did not unpack it but for me I believed that is 
for me to do market research.  That is what I believed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And from what you have told us so far 
introducing them to NIP – trying to set up a meeting with Mr Zwane 
would it be fair to say that part of your role was to introduce AAR to 
SAA and to the Regulatory Requirements in South Africa? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes that is correct. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we then talk about the – the process of 
preparing that first bid submission. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You did that with Mr Shah you say? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What did that involve? 
MS SAMBO:  It involved the technical aspects of responding to – to the 
bid.  Every bid comes with mandatory requirements and part of the 
mandatory requirements was the submission of all the compliance 
documents from SRS Aviation such as the tax Clearance Certificate, the 
20 
BEE Certificate, the full registration documents from CIPC, the 
Department of Trade and Industry.  And Mr Shah was responsible to 
respond to the technical part of the – of the bid.  Then once we 
compiled the two documents we bounded the document and submitted 
as a joint bid. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 11 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Ms Sambo what was the outcome of that 
tender? 
MS SAMBO:  It was cancelled. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Do you know why? 
MS SAMBO:  Excuse me can I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it cancelled before SRS and AAR submitted their 
bid? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes it was after the closing date.  It was cancelled.  I do 
not recall receiving a formal letter of cancellation until I enquired at 
SAA Technical asking for feedback about the contract when is it going 
10 
to be awarded?  And that is when I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say SS – SRS and AAR had already 
submitted its bid? 
MS SAMBO:  Submitted.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Jointly. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo I think you were looking for the 
correspondence informing you of the – the cancellation.  That is at 
page 91.  And the email starts at the bottom of the page but carries on 
20 
over to page 92.   
MS SAMBO:  Thank you.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Could you go to 92?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  So on the – on the 14 August I received 
an email from Ms Nontsasa Memela and she had cc’d Ms Evelyn [Fallit] 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 12 of 180 
 
who was the Commodity Buyer for this particular contract responding to 
my request for feedback and the email reads: 
“Kindly take note that in light of the current cash flow 
challenges and the drive to significantly reduce 
operational costs.  SAAT is reviewing its major 
supplier contracts hence the decision to exercise its 
option as per Clause 3.2.4 “condition” in the bid 
document to retract the bid process.  SAAT is 
planning to go out and re-advertise the tender as 
soon as all the internal processes have been 
10 
followed 
including 
ensuring 
that 
the 
tender 
requirements and the scope are in line with the long 
term turnaround strategy.  Kindly take note that 
everyone is allowed to bid again.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just tell us what the date of that email 
was? 
MS SAMBO:  The date of the email was on the 14 August 2014. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Ms Sambo you mentioned 
earlier and you say in your affidavit that Ms Jackson put the US 
Consulate in contact with you.  What role did the US Consulate play in 
20 
all of this? 
MS SAMBO:  Okay post submitting the first bid to SAA Technical AAR 
contacted the American Embassy here in South Africa and requested 
them to come and do a due diligence on my company and myself.  And 
the meeting was set up and indeed I was interviewed and interrogated 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 13 of 180 
 
in my office at SA Airways Park. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Ms Sambo you eventually did manage to 
set up a meeting with Mr Zwane, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  That is correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you tell us about that meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  Okay I am trying to find my communication. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You describe it in your affidavit at paragraph 
29. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  On the 16 April 2014 I sent another email to Ms 
Botha.  Ms Botha was a personal assistant to Mr Zwane at SAA 
10 
Technical copying Mr Shah from AAR in the Middle East requesting Mr 
Zwane’s availability to attend a meeting on the 10 May 2014 between 
SRS Aviation, AAR and SAAT.  A copy of that email is attached in one 
of the annexures, Annexure 13.  That meeting eventually was confirmed 
and it took place on a Saturday the 10 May 2014 at one o’clock and the 
venue for that meeting was at Pigalle Village View Shopping Centre in 
Bedfordview.  This meeting was attended by myself, Mr Timothy 
Romenesko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Sambo.  I am sorry Ms Sambo.  Mr 
Mbikiwa it will be important to ensure that as far as possible she is 
20 
able to give her evidence from her own memory except when she has to 
refresh her memory. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Particularly because there are issues about her 
memory so that we know when she is – she cannot remember and she 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 14 of 180 
 
looks at the document because she cannot remember.  But we know 
when she gives the evidence from her own memory. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair.  Chair I have been informed 
that we are having some audio issues with the – with the microphones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Could we adjourn just for five minutes to try 
and sort that out? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In fact it is not transcribing so it is quite 
important that we… in fact it is not transcribing so it is quite important 
10 
that we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That will – recording for purposes of 
transcriptions.  So it is quite important that we adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will adjourn to enable the technicians to sort 
out the technical problem.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All Rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am told the problem has been fixed. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It seems so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but do - do we know how much of the evidence 
that she gave was not captured, because you might have to go back a 
little bit to make sure. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I am told that in fact we - it was 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 15 of 180 
 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - oh.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Even though it was not amplifying the 
sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We did get the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So there is no issue with the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo you were telling us about the 
10 
meeting with - with Mr Zwane.  Could you tell us what - what happened 
at that meeting and - and as the Chair indicated relying as much as 
possible on your - on your memory of events and - and using your 
affidavit if necessary to - to refresh that memory. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  On 10 May 
Mr Zwane came to the meeting and he was accompanied by 
Ms Nomsa Memela who was the General Manager Procurement at SAAT 
- SAA Technical and there were two representatives from AAR and only 
myself from SRS Aviation. 
At the meeting AAR was introducing themselves and the 
20 
products that they offer and the services that they offer and that is 
what the content of that meeting was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how did SAAT receive this presentation? 
MS SAMBO:  They invited AAR to come back and do a formal 
presentation with line managers present at SAAT premises. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 16 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the way that this meeting went was it such 
that SRS and AAR were seen as working together or was AAR taken as 
working on its own? 
MS SAMBO:  At this - at that meeting it - we introduced ourselves as a 
collective.  As AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  In a partnership yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you were treated as such? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  At the meeting.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that meeting.  Ja. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Ms Sambo just remind us.  At this point 
was the tender still pending? 
MS SAMBO:  I do not recall … (intervenes). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Your - your evidence earlier was that you - 
you received notification of the retraction in August 2014. 
MS SAMBO:  I would need to check on the actual tender document.  
The closing date of that bid.  I - I do not recall it right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can check. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  Sorry.  I am not referring to the date 
by which bids had to be submitted … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But at this point a bid had been submitted, 
but there had not yet been any decision. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 17 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I do not - I do not remember. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  The - the - your evidence earlier was 
that the bid was advertised on 3 February - 23 February.  That is on 
paragraph 19 of your affidavit. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Yes and the closing … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You see that? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I see it and the closing date was initially 5 March, 
but was then extended to 30 March as a closing date.  Yes, but the 
formal communication that the bid was cancelled was only received … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We can go to page 9 … 
10 
MS SAMBO:  In - in August. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Page 92 for that. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  In - in August.  That is the date that I referred to 
earlier on which is … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Page 92 and if you - if you then go back to 
91.  You can see the - the date of the email from Ms Memela. 
MS SAMBO:  It was the 14 t h - 14 August 2014.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you and then you described a follow 
up meeting with Mr Zwane taking place in - in June 2014.  What - what 
was the purpose of that meeting? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  During the first meeting at Pigalle AAR introduced one of 
their subsidiaries called Arimar which is a company based in London 
and that company - they had recently bought that company and that 
company what they do.  They have got a software that they use to 
assist airlines to buy their parts and components in a most economical 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 18 of 180 
 
way and also assisting airlines to utilise their warranties, because 
when airlines do not use their warranties for instance an engine 
breakdown. 
It is still under warranty, but instead of using the warranty.  
They purchase a new engine or they lease another one.  It is an extra 
cost and that opportunity call sitting on a warranty is not utilised.  So 
AAR marketed that product as one of the ways they could assist SAA 
Technical to save costs and the way it was introduced to SAA 
Technical. 
It was in such a way that it would not need a bidding process, 
10 
but AAR would come in with Arimar.  Do a full analysis of SAA 
Technical.  See the gaps.  Then show them how much they can save 
from the program and only charge a percentage of the savings.  So 
Arimar’s representative needed to come down from London to come and 
give this full presentation to the line managers. 
So that the line managers would be in line of what kind of 
information is requested to be inputted on the spreadsheet.  So that a 
full analysis could be done.  So that is the follow up meeting that took 
place at SAAT. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you remember what the outcome of 
20 
that meeting was? 
MS SAMBO:  At that meeting Mr Zwane did give AAR and Arimar and 
SRS a go ahead to conduct the analysis.  A spreadsheet was sent to me 
which I then sent to SAA Technical asking for information, but 
unfortunately we did not get a very good response back from the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 19 of 180 
 
responsible line managers.  So that exercise was null and void. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You then deal at - at paragraph 33 and 
onwards with an approach you made to Ms Memela in order to introduce 
SRS as an independent company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well - let us try and let her tell the events as 
they unfolded Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let him - let her tell the events as they unfolded.  
What came next?  After that meeting what happened and so on and if 
she cannot remember she can refresh her memory, but try and let her 
10 
be the one who tells - who tells me what came next - what came next?  
Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair.  Ms Sambo, what - what 
happened after the - the second meeting with Mr Zwane? 
MS SAMBO:  Post the second meeting with Mr Zwane I believed that I 
have proven to AAR that the opportunity indeed exists at SAA 
Technical.  I had already done the introduction to the CEO as they had 
requested and we were already also given an opportunity to do the 
Arimar audit. 
So thereafter I called Cheryl - Ms Cheryl Jackson - back in 
20 
Chicago and tried to negotiate again for my retainer fee, because I 
thought now they can see that I am a serious businesswoman and I 
have already started delivering on the promises that I have made and I 
made that call to Ms Cheryl on 15 July 2014 asking them for a retainer, 
but unfortunately Ms Jackson responded again to say as a woman of 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 20 of 180 
 
colour in the United States of America she is always - she is also faced 
by similar challenges that Black women in South Africa are faced with. 
Where if you are a Black woman in a male dominated industry 
you are not taking seriously.  To be taken seriously you need to perform 
10 times more than you would to be able to hold a position of power 
and be able to make decisions.  So she is struggling with that at AAR.  
So it will be difficult for her to negotiate a retainer fee for me here in 
South Africa and she requested that we continue with the verbal 
agreement that we had in the past.  That I will only get paid once the 
deal is on the table. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the verbal - what were the terms of the verbal 
agreement to which she was referring? 
MS SAMBO:  That was that American Foreign Agency … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  Policy that she showed me that when American 
companies do businesses - business with foreign companies.  They can 
pay up to eight percent of the value of the contract as a commission 
once the deal is concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that - that - so you were supposed to ensure that 
they got the deal? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is AAR? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Through tendering process.  Upon getting a success 
bid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 21 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Then we would look at the value of that contract and then 
I will only be paid up to eight percent.  It was not even specific how 
much … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  For SRS, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  The document was saying up to eight percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maximum eight percent? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So hence I worked so hard … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Over the years to try and get this deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  So that I can ultimately … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of that verbal agreement it seems that 
SRS and AAR would not be partners.  SRS would be like an agent who 
would get a commission for helping AAR to get the bid - to get the 
tender. 
MS SAMBO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding correct? 
MS SAMBO:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  The - the one part is correct, but the other component 
would be SRS was going to be then the BEE partner in the contract.  So 
- so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position that in regard to certain aspects SR - 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 22 of 180 
 
SRS … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could be taken as an agent, but in regard to other 
aspects of the work SRS would be a BEE partner for AAR? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  You remember I mentioned at the beginning that 
part of my responsibility was to do market research for them and make 
sure that they understand how business is done in South Africa.  So 
one of those components was the compliance with Black Economic 
Empowerment. 
So when I went to AAR I marketed my company as 100 
10 
percent Black female owned company that through a bidding process 
there is already an advantage in terms of getting points on the Black 
Economic Empowerment.  So for AI - for AAR not agreeing to pay me a 
retainer. 
That was then going to be substituted by a commission when 
the contract is concluded, but then once it is concluded then still 
participate in that contract now as a BEE partner to AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you and - and your - your retainer 
now having - your request for a retainer now having been refused.  
20 
What steps did you take after that? 
MS SAMBO:  I wanted to make a living and I - I also through my 
engagements with SAAT identified an opportunity of supplying through 
quotation system as I (indistinct) to SAA Technical and met with 
Ms Memela and now introduced SRS Aviation as an independent local 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 23 of 180 
 
company that wanted to become a supplier to SAA Technical. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and as an independent company what 
would SRS Aviation supply? 
MS SAMBO:  Buy and sell.  We would procure the consumables - the 
aircraft parts that they want.  Find a supplier.  Quote the client and 
upon success then we buy and supply the component or the commodity 
to SAA Technical.  Then we invoice and get paid in 30 days. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you say you met with Ms Memela.  I am 
- I am interested in how your relationship with Ms Memela developed 
over time, but at - at this point in time what - what was - what was your 
10 
relationship with her? 
MS SAMBO:  It was - I have known as a Manager at SAA Technical and 
I was regarded as a potential supplier to SAAT. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we move then to the second tender?  
How did the second - the second tender differ from the first one? 
MS SAMBO:  The second tender I do not recall any difference, but it - 
for me it was the first tender reissued. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay and did you submit a bid? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I also worked together with AAR in working on the 
bid.  This time they were more comfortable with working on their 
20 
technical part on their own wherever they were, because it was coming 
back now the second time around.  So they were familiar with what is 
required and on my side as well I compiled all the documents that were 
required and we then jointly submitted the bid. 
With this one they couriered the tender document straight 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 24 of 180 
 
from the US to SAA Technical and I submitted mine in the tender box at 
SAA Technical, but it was the same bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us get the time frames right.  The tender when it 
was issued for the first time and was later cancelled or withdrawn.  
That was 2014 or 2013? 
MS SAMBO:  The tender was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  When was that? 
MS SAMBO:  Advertised in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS SAMBO:  It closed in 2013 … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS SAMBO:  But there was no communication from SAAT for a long 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS SAMBO:  Till in 2014.  I sent an email asking for feedback.  That is 
when I received that feedback from Ms Nomsa Memela from SAAT in 
2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When it was reissued.  When was that? 
MS SAMBO:  It was reissued on 29 October 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and you - you described the process 
of putting together the - the bid and - and AAR being more comfortable 
with the technical stuff.  How - how did the - the two of you work 
together on - on compiling the bid? 
MS SAMBO:  We had a telephone conference.  We had a telecon on 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 25 of 180 
 
various days to discuss the bid. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and describe for us the - the 
telephone call you received from Mr Zwane around that time in 
October/November 2014. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  In - around the November 2014 I received a phone 
call from Mr Zwane remind me of the discussion we had when we met at 
his office where he told me that when I work with international 
companies I need to be very careful in making sure that there are 
agreements in place and that they do not go behind my back to work 
with other people and he made an example about an experience he had 
10 
at that time.  Then when he called me.  He asked me if I am aware that 
AAR is now coming to SAA Technical with a new person called 
Mr Rafique Bagus.  I do not know how - if you - that is how you 
pronounce the surname and he is now in - he has now been introduced 
to him as the BEE partner.  So I said I - I did not know. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you spell that surname? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to help the transcribers with spelling? 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Bagus.  I do not see it on my file and I think it is - I 
think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … (intervenes). 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You will find it - you will find it at paragraph 
42. 
MS SAMBO:  B-A-G-U-S. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and tell us what you did after you 
received this phone call from Mr Zwane? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 26 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I then contacted Ms Cheryl Jackson to find out why she 
came to South Africa and never informed me that she is in South Africa 
and her initial response was that they tried to call me and also sent me 
an email.  Then I said I am looking at my phone.  There are no missed 
calls from either yourself or from Mr Shah. 
I - can I talk to you, because I need to understand who 
Mr Rafique Bagus is and what is the relationship.  Then that is when 
she invited me to come and meet with her at the Intercontinental Hotel 
in Sandton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Let us try and understand this.  You got 
10 
a call from Mr Musa Zwane … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in that conversation that he had with you he 
warned you to be careful when dealing with international companies or 
companies from other countries.  Is that right?  She - he warned you of 
something.  What did he warn you about? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  When I came back from the US in 2011 I 
immediately started making contact with SAA Technical.  That is when I 
got to know that Ms Botha is the PA to Mr Zwane and I requested to 
have meetings with Mr Zwane and one meeting was successful before 
20 
the Pigalle meeting.  I met Mr Zwane in his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you are going back … (intervenes). 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I am going back so that you can understand.  Sorry 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  At this stage I just want you to confirm what your 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 27 of 180 
 
understanding was of what Mr Zwane was alerting you to or warning 
you about. 
MS SAMBO:  He … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we can move on. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  He was warning me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you - if you … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Think he was not warning you about anything.  You 
can say no.  He was not warning me.  This is what the call was about.  I 
just want us to take it from there. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  No.  The - the call definitely was a warning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What is - what was he warning you about? 
MS SAMBO:  That AAR is - has introduced a new BEE partner to them 
at SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  After you had told us about - told me about that 
conversation.  Later on you then said you spoke to Ms Jackson … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she - an arrangement was made for a meeting 
between the two of you. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the airport.  Is that right at the hotel? 
MS SAMBO:  No.  In Sandton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Sandton? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I had not heard you tell me - maybe I missed it.  
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 28 of 180 
 
That how you got to know that she was in South Africa.  Was she in 
South Africa when Mr Zwane called you? 
MS SAMBO: 
 
Yes. 
 
She 
was 
- 
they 
had 
just 
left 
SAAT.  
Ms Cheryl Jackson, Mr Shah and Mr Rafique Bagus had just left SAA 
Technical from a meeting with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is that - is that what Mr Zwane told you as well? 
MS SAMBO:  That is what Mr Zwane told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That they were in South Africa.  They just had a 
meeting and then … 
MS SAMBO:  With SAA Technical … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Where Mr Rafique was now introduced … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  To them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now - now I understand.  Okay.  So you spoke to 
Ms Jackson and she said let us meet in Sandton? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Then you can continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So tell us about that meeting. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  I met with Ms Jackson and Mr Shah at their hotel 
20 
and I confronted them about Mr Rafique Bagus and I requested them to 
explain what was now happening.  Then Ms Jackson … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was in the meeting?  Yourself, Ms Jackson 
and who else? 
MS SAMBO:  And Mr Shah. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 29 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just the three of you? 
MS SAMBO:  Just the three of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay? 
MS SAMBO:  At that meeting Ms Jackson narrated a story to me that 
she was in London at some point at their - at their legal firm called 
Dentons firm for something else, but in the discussion that she had with 
the person at Denton - at Dentons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Dentons.  I think it is Dentons.  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Dentons.  Yes.  At Dentons she indicated her frustration 
in trying to penetrate the South African market specifically with South 
10 
African Airways Technical and the person that she spoke to then said.  
Do you know that we have a branch - Dentons as Dentons?  Dentons 
we have got a branch in Cape Town. 
We will introduce you to the office in Cape Town and see how 
they can assist you in penetrating the South African market.  So that is 
how Cheryl - Ms Cheryl Jackson was then introduced to a gentleman 
called Mr Noor Kapdi who was a - a partner at Dentons firm and 
Mr Noor Kapdi 
then 
introduced 
Rafique 
- 
Mr Rafique Bagus 
to 
Cheryl Jackson. 
So that is what she told me.  Then she further indicated that 
20 
they have engaged with Mr Rafique Bagus and as SAA - as AAR took a 
decision that Mr Bagus was bringing to the table a different strategic 
way of assisting them to get to penetrate the market in South Africa 
and they were looking at - I do not remember if they had already signed 
a consultancy agreement with him or they were still going to sign a 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 30 of 180 
 
consultancy agreement with him, but she indicated to me that Mr Bagus 
is not coming in as a partner to AAR. 
In fact Mr Bagus was told that the BEE partner is SRS 
Aviation.  His was then to - to assist them in forming a broad based 
Black Economic Empowerment strata that will then be able to assist 
them to penetrate SAAT. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did - did Ms Jackson say Mr Bagus was 
or what his background was? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  She did indicate at that time that Mr Bagus was the 
CEO of Alexkor Mine and she would arrange a meeting between myself 
10 
and Mr Bagus.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We - we are now at paragraph 40 of your 
affidavit.  Can you just tell us what - what happened next? 
MS SAMBO:  This introduction to Mr Rafique Bagus happened during 
the time that the second bid was still - we were working on the second 
bid.  So it was - it was between the advertisement and the closing date.  
So in between there that is when the introduction happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You call it a second bid for convenience, but it was 
the first bid reissued as you indicated earlier on.  Is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  On my affidavit Chair we have referred to it as the second 
SAAT bid.  On page 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Of my - yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 31 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja no that’s fine, I just want to make sure that we 
are on the same page, we don’t think there’s a different bid, okay. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes, so from then I received an email that was sent in by 
the Vice – by Mr Robert Reagan from AAR and in that email he was now 
trying to get the perspective or to formalise this working relationship 
now with Mr Rafique now as a consultant and SRS as a BEE partner in 
the submission of this tender and I think – not that I think, I am sorry, 
part of Mr Rafique Bagus’ consultancy was to advise them on how they 
should penetrate I think this market, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this meeting that you had with Ms Jackson and Mr 
10 
Shah in Sandton did it happen before SRS and AAR submitted their 
joint bid to what you call a second tender? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when the second tender, when you submitted your 
bid to the second tender, Mr Bagus had started advising AAR? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he advising AAR, just AAR, or was he advising 
both SRS and AAR as people who were working together? 
MS SAMBO:   He was advising just AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can I go to the correspondence you’ve just 
referred to, it’s at page 144 of your bundle. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Is this the email you were referring to? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes absolutely. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 32 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is – I’m sorry, the email she was referring to 
that she said came from Mr Robert Reagan, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And can I just ask you to read into the 
record the first sentence and the three bullet points? 
MS SAMBO:    
“All, Cheryl, Rahool, Jennifer and I spoke today with the 
following folks about AAR’s pursuit of several business 
10 
opportunities in South Africa, including the recently issued 
RFP for aircraft component support. 
• Rafique Bagus, 
a 
former 
DPE 
official 
turned 
businessman who is acting as a strategic business 
consultant for AAR in South Africa; 
• Spongile Sambu, a South African businesswoman who 
will be our BEE partner on the RFP; and  
• Noor Gabdi, a lawyer with Dentons in South Africa who 
we have retained to assist our business development 
efforts there.” 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   So just explain how these parties were 
going to be working together on a single bid submission? 
MS SAMBO:   Post the introduction a telephonic introduction by Ms 
Jackson there was a conference call between Ms Cheryl Jackson, 
myself, Mr Gabdi and Mr Bagus discussing the bid.   In that telephone 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 33 of 180 
 
call Mr Bagus and Mr Gabdi proposed that AAR partner with Denel 
Aviation as well in responding to this bid because they have a technical 
expertise in this market.   My response was I don’t think that will be 
relevant looking at the requirements of the bid and what I know Denel 
offers as products and services so I suggested that there is not even 
enough time to start creating new relationships to respond to this bid, 
and I advised in that telephone call that the submission of the bid what 
matters there is the price, more than if they bring in the technical 
expertise I have the BEE component which were the key requirements 
of the bid, I didn’t see a reason why Denel would be introduced into 
10 
this bid because the bid was already out and there was enough time to 
interrogate a third party into this relationship, so they – by the time we 
ended that call we had made an agreement that AAR and SRS Aviation 
would proceed as planned in the submission of their bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand how their idea would work of 
bringing Denel into this when Denel is a State entity? 
MS SAMBO:   No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t seem to understand how Denel would be 
brought into the bid.   You also didn’t understand? 
MS SAMBO:   I did not, I did not understand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   In that email can I ask you to go to number 
2, where it says Sibongile advised that SRT will bid on the RFP at a 
loss.  Sorry, are you there? 
MS SAMBO:   Where? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 34 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   It is at page 144. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   At number 2. 
MS SAMBO:   Page 144, number 2, yes? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Sibongile advised that SRT will bid on the 
RFP at a loss, she reminded us that price will dictate the RFP winning 
bid regardless of any political or other connections. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well will you start by telling me whether SRT was a 
mistake, it was meant to be SRS or whether SRT is something else? 
MS SAMBO:   SRT is another company that was based inside SAA 
10 
Technical that was – that I also went to – as part of my market research 
I visited them to understand what they do and if they are responding to 
the bid and the gentleman that I spoke to, if my memory serves me 
well, was Mr Mohamed, I stand for correction, with the surname and we 
discussed the bid, and he indicated that SRT didn’t have the capacity 
that the other bigger players like Lufthansa and Air France and perhaps 
AAR as well so they would bid but they know they would bid at a loss 
because they don’t have the full resources, so from that discussion that 
I had with Mr Mohamed I was then giving them feedback of part of the 
market research that I have done that one of the other bidders is going 
20 
to be SRT and they have indicated to me that they will be bidding at a 
loss, and ja, that’s all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would anybody bid at a loss, do you know? 
MS SAMBO:   He indicated to me that they wouldn’t – they don’t have 
the kind of capacity that airlines like Air France, which was supplying at 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 35 of 180 
 
that time, would have, he indicated that when – should they get the bid 
when Air France leave they are going to leave with everything that they 
have brought into SAA Technical and they will have to start afresh so if 
they need to be a competitive bidder it – they are going to operate on 
the first bid at a loss because they have to capitalise to get the 
business off the ground, that’s what he meant, or that is what I 
understood when he told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words they would have a long term benefit 
later but not immediately? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And in that sentence that you read it is 
indicated that you advised that price would dictate the winning bid 
regardless of any political other connections.   Why did you think it 
necessary to say that political or other connections would make no 
difference? 
MS SAMBO:   Okay, Mr Rafique was introduced to me as somebody 
who is politically connected and that is what he was bringing on the 
table, which I was not, and hence Cheryl said to me I must not worry 
about Mr Rafique Bagus, he is bringing a different strategy consultancy 
20 
into the whole relationship and in the discussion of how we should 
respond to the second bid as stated in my affidavit, is that it came very 
clear that Mr Rafique was proposing that AAR gets a letter of support 
from the Department of Public Enterprises, SAA was still reporting to 
the Department of Public Enterprises at that time and when he was 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 36 of 180 
 
introduced to me he was introduced as somebody who has worked with 
the DPE in the past as the advisor of the former minister Alec Erwin, so 
that whole political, I don’t know if I should call it connection but it is 
what he is bringing in and for me as a business woman I was 
straightforward to say even if you can have those political connections 
if your price is out of place you will not get that contract. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  I see we are almost at 
quarter past eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are you about to move onto something else? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   I am about to move on to something else. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take the adjournment and we will 
resume at half past eleven.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may proceed… 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Miss Sambo just before 
the tea adjournment you were telling us about an e-mail that Mr Reagan 
had sent sort of describing the partnership between yourself and SRS 
20 
Aviation and AAR and Mr Bagus.  Can we pick it up at paragraph 42 of 
your affidavit and can you tell us what happened after that?   
MS SAMBO:  Chair can I please refer to my notes?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Thank you.  Subsequent to that, on the 18 t h of November 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 37 of 180 
 
2014, I met with Mr Gabde from Dentons firm.  The meeting was 
arranged by Miss Jackson, and in our discussions we talked about 
Rafique, who Rafique was and he was trying to make me at ease in 
understanding that Rafique is coming to deliver on a different role than 
I do for AAR.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what happened after your meeting with 
Mr Gabde?  
MS SAMBO:  Post that meeting with Mr Gabde, a meeting was then 
scheduled for me to meet Mr Bagus and the meeting was scheduled for 
me to meet him at his offices in Rosebank at the Alexcor offices and 
10 
that is where we had our meeting. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was the purpose of that meeting?  
MS SAMBO:   The purpose of the meeting was for him in person now, 
to outline to me what his role was at AAR and also that he has been 
told that SRS aviation is the BEE partner for AAR. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And is that what was discussed at the 
meeting?  
MS SAMBO:   That is what we discussed at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of what exactly 
Mr Bagus was going to do at a particular level in advising [intervenes] 
20 
MS SAMBO:   What?  
CHAIRPERSON:  In AAR ...[intervenes].  
MS SAMBO:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was going to be his advices about?  Was it just 
business or was what exactly was he going to advise on that SRS was 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 38 of 180 
 
not able to assist on? 
MS SAMBO:  What I remember very well is that he had already 
indicated to AAR that partnering with SRS Aviation alone is not broad 
enough and at that time it was during the time that the DTI had recently 
announced that when they started with the compliance of BEE it was 
Black Economic Empowerment but they had added another element that 
says, now it needs to be broad, it needs to be broad based black 
economic empowerment and Rafique believed that SRS alone is not 
broad enough for the relationship with AAR.  
 
So one of the tasks that I remember very well, he told me he 
10 
was going to do, is to create a broad-based black economic 
empowerment structure that can work with AAR.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was your response to Mr Bagus in 
this meeting when he described his role? 
MS SAMBO:  I was agreeable to that.  I indicated I cannot block 
anyone if they want to add other partners, especially given that we 
didn’t have the terms of reference, we didn’t have a contract that was 
binding between me and AAR so there was nothing much I could say.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us what happened after your 
20 
meeting with Mr. Bagus? 
MS SAMBO:  Post that meeting with Mr. Bagus I, sorry can I just go 
through and just check my notes?... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you can refresh your memory. 
MS SAMBO:  Thank you.  Okay.  One of the things that happened  post 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 39 of 180 
 
my introduction to Mr Gabde and Mr Bagus is that Mr Shah came to 
South-Africa to me and finalise the bid because the bid was due on the 
2 n d of December if I am correct and he was due to be in South-Africa in 
November 2014.   
 
So I met with Mr Shah as well at his hotel at the Inter-
Continental in Sandton, where; okay, during that meeting he then 
organised another teaming agreement that we were supposed to sign to 
submit the bid, so…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say another.  Was there one that had already 
been signed before? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  When we submitted the initial bid, the first one, we 
signed a teaming agreement and with the cancellation of the bid 
[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You needed to sign another one? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   So, do I understand correctly that it was a 
teaming agreement per bid.  
MS SAMBO:  It was, yes indeed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us about the process of preparing 
the bid with Mr Shah? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Shah came with the technical.  He worked on the 
technical bid, I didn’t work on the technical part of the bid.  Remember 
it was e-mailed to them.  They started working on it.  
 
So, the technical bid is, most of it was done by the people in 
Chicago.  Mr Shah was playing more a role of a business development 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 40 of 180 
 
person 
for 
AAR 
to 
for 
stakeholder 
management, 
relationship 
management, and also making sure that the bid is, is submitted on 
time; that we all work on what we required to work on and it’s submitted 
on time.  So that is what we discussed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And, and what happened after your prepared 
the bid submission? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that, you said Mr Shah was working on 
the technical side of the [intervenes] 
MS SAMBO:  Co-ordinating that they, yes, co-ordinating the technical 
[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And SRS was working on what part? 
MS SAMBO:  With the compliance.  The regulatory compliance 
documents, and your tax clearances, and, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you then submit the bid on time? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, that’s the bid that was couriered from Chicago and 
SRS submitted our portion at the tender box at SAA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and once again still, SRS and AAR submitting 
the bid jointly [intervenes] 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright.  But before the submission of the bid 
20 
was there any other important thing that happened? 
MS SAMBO:  I would need to remind myself, let’s see.  Yes.  According 
to my affidavit on paragraph 51 I was informed by Miss Jackson that 
Mr Bagus had organised a meeting between; organised a meeting for 
AAR to meet the Deputy Minister of Finance in Cape Town.   
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 41 of 180 
 
 
So, so many things happened during the second bid.  The 
State President moved the reporting line of SAA from Department of 
Public Enterprises to Department of Finance.  So, so then Mr Bagus 
organised that AAR now meets the Deputy Minister of Finance in Cape 
Town.  
 
This is what Sharon mentioned to me.  I don’t know if the 
meeting took place or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand what, did she say what the 
purpose of that meeting was going to be? 
MS SAMBO:  To introduce AR [intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the Deputy Minister? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Who was the Deputy Minister at the time? 
MS SAMBO:  It was Deputy Minister Mcibisi Jonas. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Jonas has submitted a statement in 
response to having received a Rule 33 notice.  I would like to take you 
just to the relevant paragraphs of that and to ask for your comment on 
what he has said in reply. If I could ask you to turn to page 546. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, I am. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Are you there?  Okay.  If we can start at 
paragraph 13.  There, Mr Jonas has addressed other matters in his 
affidavit which we will return to later. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But for present purposes if we could start at 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 42 of 180 
 
paragraph 13, and he says  
“As 
regards, 
the 
alleged 
meeting 
with 
AAR 
mentioned in paragraph 51 of her statement”. 
 
That is your statement. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   
“I recall being invited to a dinner by Mr Bagus in 
Cape Town.  Mr Bagus told me that the dinner 
would be with a US based entity which was 
interested in investing in South- Africa.  I attended 
10 
this dinner for a short period of time. Miss Jackson 
was introduced to me and provided me with 
background on AAR and expressed its desire to 
invest in South-Africa. She provided me with 
information about the capabilities of AAR which 
seemed impressive at face value and it appeared 
that AAR maybe able to assist SAA and also the 
potential 
investment 
in 
South-Africa 
or 
collaboration with SAA in Africa would be beneficial 
to the South African economy more broadly.  I told 
20 
her that I was not involved in the management of 
SAA and that she should speak to the relevant 
management of SAA in order to find out about the 
procurement policies which are followed by SAA 
about opportunities for collaboration with SAA.”  
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 43 of 180 
 
He then says:  
“This meeting took place the evening before the 
State of the Nation Address in Cape Town.  The 
following morning, I coincidently met Miss Dudu 
Myeni, who at that stage was the chair of SAA. I 
told Miss Myeni about the meeting which I had with 
Miss Jackson and that AAR appeared to have 
meaningful 
capabilities 
of 
AAR 
and 
maybe 
interested in investing into investment in South-
Africa. However, I also told her that I had said that 
10 
if AAR wished to do work with SAA it should speak 
to the relevant management of SAA directly.  She 
indicated that she would be interested in meeting 
Miss Jackson and I accordingly put them in touch 
with each other.”  
Paragraph 15 
“To the best of my recollection that was the end of 
my involvement in this matter.”  
Miss Sambo do you have any comment on that?  
MS SAMBO:  No. I was not party to this meeting and I was not privy to 
20 
it.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So, you have no reason to doubt what 
Mr Jonas has said?  
MS SAMBO:  No. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So, we have just dealt with the bid, your bid 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 44 of 180 
 
submission, the bid preparation, the bid submission, and this meeting 
which took place in Cape Town.  What happened thereafter?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about in the ...[intervenes].  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In the affidavit we are at Paragraph 52. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay, towards the end of 2014 and 2015 SRS Aviation 
was not active in the activities of AAR at SAAT.  The meetings that they 
were having were predominantly with Mr Bagus so we were not active, 
so I don’t really know what was happening during that period.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat what period that was? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  The end of 2014 and April 2015.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You didn’t have much interaction as SRS than 
with AAR. Is that what you are saying?  
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do know that they were having; AAR was 
having a lot of interaction with Mr Bagus. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  There is an e-mail that Mr Bagus sent to me, 
including other Consortium members where he indicated that he has 
had meetings about five times, or three times, or many times with AAR, 
we will refer to…[intervenes] 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We can go to that e-mail.  It is at Page 163. 
MS SAMBO:  Would you like me to read or give a context? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, is there anything particularly important in the 
contents of the e-mail other than that he mentions that he was having a 
number of meetings with AAR, Mr Mbikiwa? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 45 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, the thrust of the e-mail is that Mr 
Bagus had been meeting with AAR.  There is just one aspect in the 
third full paragraph starting with: “Ät the meeting”.  If you could just 
read the first sentence of that into the record. Starting with “At the 
meeting.” 
MS SAMBO:  Reads into the record. 
“At the meeting in Chicago last week, AAR and 
David specifically requested that Bongani attend 
the meeting with a delegation.”  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And the next sentence, sorry. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Reads into the record. 
“Bongani will be leading the BEE Consortium.”  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Who is the Bongani that is being referred 
to? 
MS SAMBO:  Post the meeting that I had with Mr Bagus at Alexcor, he 
confirmed that he was putting together a broad based black economic 
empowerment structure, and in that structure that is where I saw the 
name and got to know about Mr Bongani More.  I don’t know where the 
structure is on my file. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We will go there in a moment. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  So, Mr More, I didn’t know him.  I saw him on the 
structure,  and I tried to get information about the different people that 
I see on the structure.  But I was particularly interested in Bongani 
because I saw Bongani taking the role that I have been playing all 
along with AAR as a lead BEE partner.   
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 46 of 180 
 
 
And this e-mail clearly indicates that they were in, Rafique and 
the team were invited to go to Chicago and they appointed Bongani as 
a lead for the BEE Consortium.  And in my quest to get the info about 
who Bongani was, during that time I had already known Miss Nontsasa 
Memela for quite some time and we would talk about my relationship 
with AAR; what is happening because now I believe we are 
acquaintances; we could talk about my relationship with AAR and she, 
and I mentioned Bongani and she came back to me saying that she has 
been told that Bongani is ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr More. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Mr More, I apologise Chair.  That Mr More is related to 
the Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr Mcibisi Jonas, and the shares that 
he is holding on this broad based black economic empowerment 
structure, he is holding those shares on behalf of the Minister that is 
what I was told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean on behalf of the Deputy Minister?  You said 
Minister. 
MS SAMBO:  On behalf of the Deputy Minister, I apologise. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Miss Sambo that is the other aspect on 
which Mr Jonas has filed an affidavit ...[intervenes].  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now just to clarify, who was giving you this 
information?  Miss Memela? 
MS SAMBO:  Miss Memela. Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And once again, who was she? 
MS SAMBO:  Miss Memela was the head of procurement at South 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 47 of 180 
 
African Airways Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you to return to Mr Jonas’s 
affidavit and that’s at Page 544 I would like you to go to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Miss Memela tell you where she was getting this 
information from or did you not ask? 
MS SAMBO:  I don’t remember. I didn’t ask. I didn’t get where she got 
it from.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So at Page 544, If I can start at Paragraph 5 
10 
of Mr Jonas’s affidavit, he says  
“In essence, as discussed further below, she 
suggests that I had an undisclosed interest in one 
of the proposed BEE Consortia which was involved 
in AAR.  There is no truth to this allegation 
whatsoever.  There is also no evidence provided by 
Miss Sambo for this preposterous allegation other 
than what is colloquially referred to as double 
hearsay. (It is premised on a statement allegedly 
made by Mr More to Ms Memela and in any event 
20 
Mr More denies ever making such a statement to 
Ms Memela given it the alleged statement is false.” 
If I can then ask you to turn to Page 546 and at Paragraph 12.  
Mr Jonas says  
“I stress in this regard that I have never held any 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 48 of 180 
 
interest whatsoever in any BEE Consortium which 
partnered with AAR either in my own name or 
through Mr Bongani More, furthermore I am not 
related to Mr More.”  
Lastly if we can turn to Page 550, this is a supporting affidavit from 
Mr More which was provided together with Mr Jonas’s. And at 
Paragraph 3 he says 
“In particular I have denied I have ever held any 
shares in any BEE Consortium which was intended 
to partner with AAR Corporation “on behalf’ of Mr 
10 
Jonas.  I also deny having suggested to Miss 
Memela that I would have done so.  I confirm that 
Mr Jonas had no direct or indirect financial or 
ownership interest in the proposed consortium of 
which I formed part.” 
Miss Sambo, do you have any comment in response to that? 
MS SAMBO:  As I have mentioned, I was informed by Miss Memela that 
Mr More is holding shares or on behalf of Deputy Minister Mcibisi 
Jonas. I therefore cannot vouch or deny or agree, but what is coming 
out of this statement is it alleges that I said Miss Noncasa heard that 
20 
from Mr More and its nowhere on my affidavit. I did not say Miss 
Noncasa was told by Mr More that he is holding shares on behalf of the 
Deputy Minister. That is the correction I would like to make. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We have also received a statement from 
Ms Memela which is in support of the cross-examination application. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 49 of 180 
 
Most of that we will get to in due course, but I would just like to take 
you to Page 516. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Paragraph 12 where Miss Memela says  
“The same, Miss Sambo claims in her affidavit that 
I had confirmed that I did not know Mr More but in 
the same affidavit she asserts that I informed her 
that Mr More was standing for Mr Jonas. I further 
deny and refute the allegation as misrepresentation 
of facts by Miss Sambo as I didn’t know Mr More to 
10 
an extent that I would have known such details 
about him.”  
So, Miss Memela denies having told you.  What is your comment in 
response to that? 
MS SAMBO:  Miss Memela did tell me that she has been told that Mr 
More is holding shares on behalf of the Minister. I did not insinuate 
anywhere in my affidavit that Miss Memela knows Mr More. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you so ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  So, what you insist on is that Miss Memela told you 
that Mr More was holding certain shares on behalf of the Deputy 
20 
Minister of Finance at the time [intervenes] 
MS SAMBO:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you say, you never said was that she told you 
that she got that information from Mr More. 
MS SAMBO: Correct. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 50 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can then return, Miss Sambo, to your 
affidavit and pick it up at Paragraph 53. You had just told us that 
between the end of 2014 and April 2015 you had had very little 
involvement.  Can you tell us what then happened in April 2015? 
MS SAMBO:  In 2015 I was informed again by Miss Memela that AAR 
has invited SAAT representatives to visit their facilities in the United 
States and she indicated to me that the people who are invited or that 
would be going to visit AAR was herself, the CEO Mr Zwane, the 
member of the board Doctor Tambi, the Chairperson of the board of 
10 
SAA technical Miss Yakhe Kwinana.  Those are the people that would 
be visiting and to represent the Consortia, the person that will be 
representing the consortia was Mr Bongani More. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it Miss Memela who was telling you this 
information?  
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had AAR not told you anything about this trip that 
was planned by this time?  
MS SAMBO:  No, I confronted AAR afterwards [intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were hearing about it for the first time? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And so, what did you do when you were told 
this information? 
MS SAMBO:  Like I normally do, I called Miss Sheryl Jackson because 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 51 of 180 
 
she was the point of contact between SRS and AAR.  So I mentioned to 
her that I have managed to find out that there is a planned trip and I 
see that I am excluded from the trip and according to the knowledge 
that I have now is that the delegation will be visiting your Chicago 
operations but they will also be visiting your Miami operations, which I 
have never visited but I have visited your Chicago operations twice.  
So, I suggested to her that I would like to be part of the 
delegation that is coming to visit their facilities.  But Ms Jackson 
declined my request indicating that they will have a challenge when 
they transport the delegation between the facilities in Chicago and 
10 
Miami because they will be using their private jet.   
So, I responded to Ms Jackson by saying that I do not need to 
be in the private jet and I do not need to be at the Chicago facilities 
because I have been there.  But I am interested in knowing the Miami 
facilities so I can get myself on a flight from Johannesburg to Miami.  I 
will not be bothering anyone.  Be part of the meeting when they 
conclude the meeting in Miami.  Then I can return back.  And I was 
prepared to finance my trip and but unfortunately, she still insisted that 
I am not required to be there.  So, I did stand down.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What did she say- what explanation did she give for 
20 
the fact that one, they did not include you in this delegation?  Two, 
they did not tell you about it before you heard from Ms Memela? 
MS SAMBO:  She did not respond about why they did not tell me but ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask her? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 52 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, I remember I did ask but she did not respond why 
they did not tell me.  All she mentioned is that according the Broad 
Base Black Economic Consortium structure that Mr Rafiq proposed to 
AAR, SRS was now a component or part of the consortium.  So, for this 
trip they have appointed Mr More to be a lead for the BEE consortium 
and hence I was not required to be there.  So, Mr More indirectly was 
going to also represent me because now according to that structure, I 
am part of the consortium. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you know whether that delegation 
went ahead? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes indeed, the delegation went ahead.  I became friends 
with Ms Memela on Facebook and Ms Memela would then post the 
activities in Chicago.  I had vested interest because AAR is- I regarded 
AAR as a baby that I brought in to South Africa.  So, I wanted to know 
each and everything that was happening and Ms Memela happened to 
be the person that provided the information directly or indirectly.  So, 
through Facebook because now I had a sense of what was happening 
20 
so my natural instinct told me that it is time to start gathering any 
information that I come across that has to deal with AAR because I 
have vested interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that delegation went to Chicago, did those 
who were part of the BEE component- BEE partners for AAR have any 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 53 of 180 
 
discussions about each one’s role and what would happen and who 
would play a leading role and so on?  And was SRS involved in any 
such discussions? 
MS SAMBO:  Not to my knowledge.  I was not party to any discussions 
that planned for the trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Now you mentioned that you learned about 
the trip from Facebook and you have attached to your affidavit some of 
the photographs that you downloaded of the delegation.  The 
unfortunately the attachments to your affidavit are very unclear.  Chair 
10 
they have been blown up in the bundle of Mr Human who will be coming 
tomorrow.  If I could refer you to what is provisionally DD22C.  And if I 
could beg leave to hand a copy of this to the witness because I do not 
think she has it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am just thinking whether you should not have 
made copies of what is in that bundle for me and for her so that could 
be part of this one. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair, we can arrange for that to be 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can do that? 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We certainly can arrange for that to be 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now it might be better that you deal with that 
aspect maybe later. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 54 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  After lunch ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We will return to that.  Ms Sambo then tell 
us what happened after the delegation went to visit the AAR facilities. 
MS SAMBO:  What happened after? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Oh okay.  On the 30 t h of April 2015 Mr Bagus informed me 
that he has been officially appointed as a consultant for AAR and he 
indicated to me that he has had various trips to AAR as well to engage 
10 
with them in the- as part of his role as a consultant for AAR.  He further 
introduced the consortium structure ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is after the delegation had come back from the 
US? 
MS SAMBO:  Sorry, this is before. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Are we in the period before the delegation? 
MS SAMBO:  Before they went. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is my error, I apologise.   
MS SAMBO:  Oh. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If there are events that occurred before the 
20 
delegation actually went but after you were informed that it was going. 
MS SAMBO:  Oh okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Please deal with those. 
MS SAMBO:  One of the distinct things that I remember is that Ms 
Memela requested me to assist her with a visa application because I 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 55 of 180 
 
was- I knew very well what the process was to apply for a visa to the 
United States.  She had never travelled to the United States at that 
time and also she had to apply for an emergency visa because the time 
that she told me that she needed to be- she is going to be part of the 
delegation and the date that was already set for the travel, it suggested 
that she needed to get an emergency visa.   
And a few weeks prior to her request we had discussed that my 
employee was going to go to the US as well but for a different reason 
not at AAR for other businesses and we managed to fast track and get 
the visa speedily.  So, she asked me to assist her in that process which 
10 
I did.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We spoke briefly earlier about your 
relationship with Ms Memela.  How would you describe that relationship 
at this point where you are arranging her visa for her? 
MS SAMBO:  Over a period of time working with her, we became 
friends at least that is what I believe. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us what happened after that.  After 
you assisted her with her visa application. 
MS SAMBO:  They then travelled to the USA and that is when I started 
following up on the activities because I wanted to know what was 
20 
happening in the US.  And that is when Mr Bagus also confirmed that 
he is fully a vested consultant for AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that confirmation come after they had come back 
from the US? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 56 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  No, it was before they left.  So, when I wanted to be part 
of the delegation that was going to the US, I think it was May.  The trip 
was scheduled to be in May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You deal with that at paragraph 65. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So yes, the trip was scheduled to be on the 8 t h of 
May.  So when I wanted to be part of the delegation, I was told that I 
cannot be part of this delegation but there will be a follow up visit to 
AAR in June.  And Rafiq sent me an email suggesting that I plan to be 
part of the delegation that would be going in June. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Alright.  Can we then pick it up at paragraph 
60 and can you tell us what happened after you told that you will not be 
able to join the delegation? 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  I received a call from Ms Memela indicating that 
Ms Kwinana would like to talk to me.  She would like to have a 
discussion with me and she asked for my permission to give her my 
contact details because she wanted to meet with me at my residence.  
So, I agreed.  I said you can give her my contact details and Ms 
Kwinana indeed contacted me.  And we arranged to meet at my 
residence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was her position if any with South African 
Technical at that time, Ms Kwinana? 
MS SAMBO:  She was the chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chairperson of the board. 
MS SAMBO:  Chairperson of the board of SAA Technical. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 57 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, she came to the meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At your residence. 
MS SAMBO:  At my residence, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what happened? 
MS SAMBO:  She came to my residence.  She indicated to me that she 
was planning to resign as the chairperson of SAA Technical and she 
was keen to know more about my relationship with AAR and at that 
10 
meeting she also indicated that when she leaves as a chairperson of 
SAA Technical, she wants to get her hands on other contracts at SAA 
such as the- there was a contract for tyres aircraft tyres, a contract for 
logistics, I cannot remember what else besides the components.  But to 
me she was very clear that she wanted me to introduce her to Ms 
Cheryle Jackson, she wanted to have a direct contact with Ms Cheryle 
Jackson which I gladly gave her the contact details and they started 
talking directly. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What did you understand her to mean when 
she said she wanted to get her hands on those contracts? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask her, what do you mean? 
MS SAMBO:  I do not remember if I have asked her what she meant.  I 
do not know what she meant.  I think she can answer that one herself.  
But she wanted her hands, it is what she told me, on those contracts. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 58 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she asked for a meeting, she came to your 
residence and she wanted Ms Jackson’s contact details which you gave 
her. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have thought that at least you would want 
to understand what the purpose was or what she was talking about 
because it looks like she wanted those contact details so that she could 
achieve what she was talking about namely getting her hands on those 
contracts. 
MS SAMBO:  The meeting with Ms Kwinana was very brief. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how long? 
MS SAMBO:  It is such a pity that we tried to get the time at which she 
came in at the gate and the time that she left but as of today we have 
not received the information because then that could prove my 
statement that the meeting was very brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did you say she came to the gate? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, normally I ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or she got into the house and she had a meeting with 
you or did you both talk at the gate? 
MS SAMBO:  No, she came into the gate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Drove to my residence.  She had a driver.  She came 
inside alone.  We had a very brief meeting where she indicated her 
interest on the components tender and hence, she wanted to talk to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 59 of 180 
 
Cheryle at AAR.  And that she was planning to resign and she wants 
her hands- I was a bit ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  On certain contracts. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I was a bit uncomfortable with that meeting because 
a person of my capacity at that time it was now ringing what was 
happening.  And I did not prolong the meeting.  I did not want to know 
the details of what does she mean, she wants her hands on those 
contracts.  I did not want to really entertain it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, how long do you think the meeting took? 
MS SAMBO:  It was less than an hour. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SAMBO:  I would say ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe 30 minutes?  You are not sure. 
MS SAMBO:  I do not know specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, it is fine.  But it was a short meeting you say. 
MS SAMBO:  It was a short meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And apart from giving her the details of AAR 
was she suggesting that you do anything else to assist her to get her 
hands on these contracts? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  She did ask me if I know anybody who is in logistics.  At 
that time I did not know anyone that I could think of and I indicated to 
her that I would tell her if I know of somebody or I would tell Ms 
Memela because that is the person I engage with if there is anybody 
that I could think of that is in logistics.   
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 60 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And Ms Sambo are you able to place this 
meeting in time at all? 
MS SAMBO:  This is one of the areas Chairperson that I struggle to 
place it in time because there is no written document that will remind 
me of the date at which this meeting took place.  I tried very hard to go 
back in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it before the outcome of the bid of what you call 
the second the tender was announced? 
MS SAMBO:  Was it before? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it before? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  It was- it would have been between the second- the 
advertisement of the second bid and before the third bid was 
advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and does that help at all in terms- does that 
help you at all in terms of months?  And I am taking it that the year 
would have been 2015. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, it was 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The year would be 2015.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of months does that help you at all to 
20 
say it probably would have been around which months? 
MS SAMBO:  Unfortunately, not chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot.  Okay, no that is fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo you say that the purpose of Ms 
Kwinana coming to your house was to ask you to give her details to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 61 of 180 
 
introduce her to Ms Jackson.  Does that suggest at all that it may be 
before Ms Kwinana went on a delegation to meet AAR? 
MS SAMBO:  It suggest that because at that time she did not know Ms 
Jackson.  So, she would not have met Ms Jackson by this time that we 
met.  Because you remember she went on the delegation to the US so 
she would not have asked me for the contact details post the trip.  So, I 
think based on that we can try and figure out when this meeting 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  If we can then pick it up 
10 
at paragraph 61 of your affidavit.  Can you tell us what happened 
thereafter? 
MS SAMBO:  Within a few weeks or a week or so Ms Kwinana gave me 
a call again asking to meet with me and she suggested that we meet at 
the Protea Hotel in Midrand which I agreed to.  I went to Protea Hotel 
and I found her with Dr Tambi, one of the board members at SAA 
Technical.  And when I got to the meeting she indicated that she 
wanted to introduce me to people that she works with and she 
introduced Dr Tambi as an aviation specialist who is part of the board 
at SAA Technical and also she indicated that he is originally from Sierra 
20 
Leone, I think that is what she indicated to me.   
And then she got into the continuation of the meeting we had at my 
house that as she is planning to exit SAA Technical, Mr Tambi is the 
one who will take care of her interest when she is gone because he will 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 62 of 180 
 
remain as a board member at SAA Technical.  And her interest being all 
the contracts that she mentioned she wanted her hands on to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now just to tie that up.  At that stage, at the stage of 
this meeting at the Protea Hotel. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know exactly which contracts she wanted to 
lay her hands on? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, she had already indicated the logistics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  The tyres. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS SAMBO:  And the components. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was in respect of SAA Technical. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now prior to her meeting you at your residence. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you had any interactions with her prior to that? 
MS SAMBO:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the first time? 
MS SAMBO:  That was the first time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know how she got your details? 
MS SAMBO:  Ms Memela contacted me asking if she could give Ms 
Kwinana ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 63 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  My details because she is asking for that from Ms 
Memela, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS SAMBO:  So, I agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, when she came to see you that was the first time 
you had an interaction with her? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and then you had this second meeting ... 
(intervenes) 
MS SAMBO:  Second meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the Protea Hotel. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you were still talking about that one. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how did the discussion proceed after she told you 
what Dr Tambi’s role would be after she had left? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, then she also introduced me to Ms Mdlulwa, Ms Kuki 
Mdlulwa as in Zulu as “Ihashi”.  And I was asking her what is Ihashi 
because as a person that speaks isiZulu as well, I know Ihashi to be 
something else, to be an animal ... (intervenes) 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just say what it is. 
MS SAMBO:  To be a horse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  And she said in her world- she may not have put it in that 
particular words that I am saying but, in her context, ... (intervenes) 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 64 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are paraphrasing. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, in her context Ihashi was a runner.  And I still probed 
further to understand what is a runner and she said a runner is a 
person that is a go in between making deals for her.  Yes.  And at that 
meeting she indicated to me that as part of her interest in the 
components tender which is what- which is where I feature in is that 
she wanted Ms Mdlulwa to go and negotiate on her behalf to AAR that 
she will make sure that AAR gets the contract.   
However, they need to pay them- I will say them because later on she 
quantified who is them, I will come to that now.  That they wanted 100 
10 
million rand to make sure that AAR gets the contract and they want that 
money from AAR.  So Ms Mdlulwa as the Ihashi then she will run to go 
and negotiate and collect the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now at this meeting just tell me all the people who 
were there.  Yourself, Ms Kwinana, Dr Tambi, Ms Mdlulwa. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there somebody else? 
MS SAMBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just ... (intervenes) 
MS SAMBO:  It was just- yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 4 or 5 of you? 
MS SAMBO:  It was just us but can I just also make a disclaimer 
Chairperson.  The people that I remember very well were there is 
myself, Dr Thambi and Ms Kwinana.  Ms Kuki Mdlulwa, I do not 
remember very well that if she was there in person or we discussed her.  
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 65 of 180 
 
That memory is failing me.  I do not remember if she was there in 
person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether Ms Kwinana just talked about her. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where in the Hotel was this meeting held? 
MS SAMBO:  The meeting it was in an open place.  There is a bar on 
the right-hand side as you enter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the ground floor? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  On the ground floor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  There is a bar area or a lounge area as you enter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  And as you enter that Hotel we were on the right-hand 
side behind the wall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, that is where we were sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So, continue with the discussion and tell us 
how the meeting ended. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue how the discussion continued and then up to 
where how it ended. 
MS SAMBO:  That is what we discussed and I left them there being 
confused- for me it became very clear that a corrupt activity is starting 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 66 of 180 
 
here.  I want to correct something I said on my affidavit where I 
indicated- I do not know if Advocate would assist me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Where I said in my affidavit, this is when I realised that 
we are in a corrupt mode.  And I want to take the “we” because I was 
not part of the “we”.  Because the issue of the 100 million and having a 
runner, it was coming from the other side.  I was receiving from this 
side the end.  At that time, I was also very shocked that a figure like 
100 million is just called like that.  That is what a company needs to 
pay for to make sure that they get a tender. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now what – why did you need to know all of this?  
Did you ask, why do I need to – to know all of this Ms Kwinana?  I am 
not – I am not interested in any R100 million why do you need to call 
me to a meeting to discuss this?  I have nothing to say about it.  Where 
do I fissure in?  What is required of me? 
MS SAMBO:  At that time for me I just thought that because I have 
always been the BEE partner for AAR and now she wants to be part of 
what I started with AAR and hence… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you ask her? 
MS SAMBO:  I do not remember if I asked her Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  Why she is involving me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  But all I remember is that she is the one who even said 
from the beginning, Sibongile you are not part of this R100 million.  
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 67 of 180 
 
This R100 million is negotiated for myself and my people inside SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what she said? 
MS SAMBO:  That is what she said to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  That is what she said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so she – she mentioned to you that R100 
million would have to be obtained from AAR? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you must not think that you are part of – you will 
get anything out of the R100 million. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is herself and other people. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Inside South African – SAA Technical? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And what did you say to all of this? 
MS SAMBO:  I had no say Chairperson.  I was just being informed.  I 
just received the information and I was just so surprised that this is 
how things are done.  It was the first time I was face to face with such 
a requirement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  Ever since I started my business as an entrepreneur.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  So for me it was confusing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 68 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  It was extremely confusing.  It was – I was just so 
surprised.  I was so – I do not know the big English words that I can 
use. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  To say [African language]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  You know.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  R100 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  So how did the meeting end – end then?  
10 
Or is there something else important that was said at the meeting that 
you want to tell me about? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So the other people that are part of this R100 
million she indicated that it was Mr Musa Zwane the CEO of SAA 
Technical and Ms Memela at Procurement at SAA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  So then I – after that I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she ask you to do anything or SRS to do anything 
to ensure that this R100 million that she wanted was obtained? 
MS SAMBO:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No? 
MS SAMBO:  It was very clear that the runner is Ms [?] Ndlula. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  No from myself she just wanted Cheryl’s contacts which I 
gave her. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 69 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had given her the contact details for Mr 
Jackson in… 
MS SAMBO:  Prior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the meeting at your residence? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see the question that arises is why did she 
need you to know all of this information if she was not going to ask you 
to do anything and if you are not going to be part to benefit in any way 
or to be asked to do anything for them? 
MS SAMBO:  I was not asked to do anything.  I would plead with the 
10 
Chair that she can answer why she was telling me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  My testimony is that that is what I was informed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  I was not asked to do anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  But I was an informed party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair I am grateful.  Ms Sambo 
are you certain that the figure of R100 million was mentioned at this 
meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  The figure of R100 million was mentioned at this meeting 
and it was repeated at another meeting. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 70 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can I clarify one other thing? Are you 
certain that Ms Kwinana phoned you to ask – ask for this meeting and 
that you did not phone her to ask for a meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  I would not have anything to call her for so she called me 
to the meeting and the context of the meeting was the information she 
was giving to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see why I was asking you whether she asked you 
to do anything at that meeting is that I have not seen her version.  I do 
not know whether her version is here.  But if she denies that there was 
such a meeting she might say, why would I have called her if there was 
10 
no role for her in this whole thing?  It does not make sense.  She might 
say that.  That I called her to a meeting and just told her, I wanted 
R100 million and she was not going to benefit from it.  I was not asking 
her to do anything.  What was the purpose of asking to come to the 
meeting?  Why did I want to tell her about this illegal activity that I was 
about to get involved in? 
MS SAMBO:  They knew I was the BEE partner to AAR.  Though there 
was no signed contract but I was introduced – when we introduced 
ourselves to SAA Technical we introduced ourselves as partners AAR 
and SRS.  Why she decided to tell me she is the one who needs to 
20 
respond.  However in her response to the notice 3.3 is it? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is right. 
MS SAMBO:  In her – okay.  Should I get to that? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just continue to tell me whatever you want to tell 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 71 of 180 
 
me in response to what I am saying to you what she might say.  I do not 
know what she definitely will say.  I am just saying if she denies that 
there was such a meeting.  Or she might admit that there was such a 
meeting but deny that – that is part of the conversation this R100 
million and so on. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes Chairperson it is my word against hers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you.  No – but I was just wanting to 
alert you that you know there is a possibility that they might say but 
there was no purpose on her own version for calling her to the meeting 
because she was not going to be asked to do anything.  But you say 
10 
definitely she – she said what you say she said and definitely the 
meeting did take place? 
MS SAMBO:  She – she did not deny in her response to Notice 3.3 that 
there was a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  In fact on the Notice 3.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  She indicated that she have meetings any way there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  So this proves that I did not call her. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  She called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  She used that place as her office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 72 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  If I could put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  But of course she denied that she mentioned the R100 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  There were no minutes taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  It is her word against mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and even if the minutes were taken probably they 
would not include that. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I think it is an appropriate moment to 
turn to …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless of course we dealing with the other matter 
which I heard what two weeks ago where a lot of minutes were there 
for. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All kinds of things.  Yes okay continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I think it is an appropriate moment to 
20 
go to Ms Kwinana’s response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  She filed a statement in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To receipt of a Rule 3.3 Notice. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 73 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If I can ask you turn to page 502?   
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And at paragraph 3 and she says there: 
“Concerning para 4.1” 
She is referring there to the paragraph numbers in the Notice that she 
received I believe. 
“I do not understand why I would tell Ms Sambo that I 
want to resign and lay my hands on tenders as I 
would not be destitute when I resign.  I was 
10 
operating an audit and accounting firm which I 
started in 1999.  I was operating a property 
development company which I started in 2000 and I 
was sitting in other boards which had nothing to do 
with SAA.  Ms Sambo called me and said she would 
like to meet and greet and introduce herself to me as 
she is doing work for SAAT.  I decided to go with 
Doctor Tambi who was also a board member at SAAT.  
The meeting was held at Protea Hotel which is the 
place that was convenient for Doctor Tambi and I.  At 
20 
the meeting she introduced her company as the only 
black female owned company in aviation and she 
owns a fleet of aircraft that she leases out.  During 
our meeting I learnt that she in fact had a complaint 
against her partner AAR and wanted us to intervene.  
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 74 of 180 
 
She told us that she has been nhashi runner for AAR 
since 2011 without any form of remuneration and now 
they owe her R100 million.  We advised her that 
SAAT cannot intervene in their business as it is 
between them and has nothing to do with SAAT.  I did 
not know Ms Sambo at all before this meeting.  
Reading her affidavit I am convinced that indeed she 
was a nhashi a runner for AAR.” 
What is your response to that Ms Sambo? 
MS SAMBO:  This statement to me has no substance.  It has been very 
10 
clear that I was introduced to AAR by the South African government and 
it was said when I was – when we went to SAA Technical so I cannot 
have been nhashi or the runner that I did not even know that a human 
being can become that runner or nhashi if it directly translates.  The 
definition of nhashi.  I think Ms Kwinana is making allegations that she 
must bring to the commission to prove that I was that nhashi that she 
suggests and she must bring the proof that I demanded the R100 
million that she is talking about.  And she is mis – she misinterpreted 
what SRS Aviation was doing.  I do not own airplanes.  I run an air 
charter company that is fully licenced to operate, manage and lease 
20 
airplanes.  She misunderstood me.  I do not understand where she took 
this I said I own a fleet of aircrafts.  She must bring that proof here at 
the commission. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Did you in the meeting refer to any of the 
difficulties you had been having with AAR? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 75 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I do not – I did not.  I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see she says in her affidavit she admits that 
the meeting at Protea Hotel did take place.  But she says it took place 
at your instance.  You asked to meet with her and she says at that 
meeting you told her about challenges in your relationship with AAR 
and that you said to her you had been nhashi.  You are the – she says 
you are the one who came up with the idea of nhashi.  She says you 
said you had been doing the work and running around but you were not 
paid by AAR and you – you said they owed you R100 million and you 
wanted her or them to intervene in your relationship with AAR. What do 
10 
you say to that? 
MS SAMBO:  She must bring the proof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she says you – that is what you said and you say 
she came and said she want to lay her hands on contracts and said she 
wanted to get R100 million.  Did you say what she says you said? 
MS SAMBO:  This is – this is a very serious allegation that she is 
making against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  And I have always dealt with my partners directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Each time I can – it has been proven as we were going 
through my statement that each time I had a challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  With my partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 76 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I would confront them.  There was no need for me to go to 
her as a Chairperson.  I do not see a link, strategically of anything that 
she would have done for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  I address my issues most in writing and they are on the 
file as proof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Each time I spoke to AAR having a challenge it was 
followed by emails.  There is proof.  This is the only allegation that is 
on top of the table right now with no proof.  And according to me with 
10 
no substance at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbikiwa – Mr Mbikiwa I am sorry.  Does she deal 
with the allegation by Ms Sambo that she came to her house?  I do not 
seem to see that here. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No Chair she does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  She refers to the allegation of wanting to lay 
her hands on contracts which – which Ms Sambo says was said for the 
first time at her house.  She deals with that allegation but she does not 
deal head on with Ms Sambo’s allegation that that meeting at her house 
20 
took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It simple is not dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what paragraph – what paragraph in Ms 
Sambo’s affidavit deals with that meeting?  I just want to see how far 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 77 of 180 
 
that paragraph is from the paragraphs that she is responding to in her 
affidavit Ms Kwinana? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes Chair they are in consecutive 
paragraphs Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja consecutive paragraphs. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  60 and 61. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Paragraph 60 is the – is the meeting at the 
private residence and paragraph 61 is the one at the Protea Hotel in 
Midrand. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Kwinana responds to 61. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she could not have not seen … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is very doubtful Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The allegations in paragraph 60? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is very doubtful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And she has chosen to say nothing about that 
part. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About that allegation. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo one further question on the – on 
both the Protea Hotel and the – the meeting at your – at your 
residence.  Did you – did you tell anyone else about what had occurred 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 78 of 180 
 
at those meetings? 
MS SAMBO:  I had employees yes.  So my employees at that time were 
aware of the discussions that were moving between the different parties 
about this AAR relationship.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you would have said to your employees 
that Ms Kwinana had approached you and said that she wanted to lay 
her hands on contracts and that she was going to use a runner for 
purposes of paying a R100 million? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  This is something that was amazing.  It is something 
that I could just keep to myself.  I needed to talk to somebody to make 
10 
sure that maybe somebody could make sense to me you know.  So yes I 
discussed this with my team. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Chair we have managed to 
obtain those enlarged photographs of the delegation to AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we could beg leave to hand a copy up and 
to the witness?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you marked where they should go into this – or 
you have not marked into this? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We have not done so yet Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if you – would it not be better that you do so 
after marking them so that when you refer to each one of them you give 
the page number that will correspond. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That will correspond to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 79 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To Ms Sambo’s bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the bundle.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Otherwise it becomes difficult. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is fine Chair we will – in that case we 
will address that after … 
CHAIRPERSON:  After lunch ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  After the lunch – lunch adjournment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo if we could pick it up in your 
affidavit at paragraph 66 and this is after your meetings with – at the 
Protea Hotel and at your residence.  Can you tell the commission what 
happened thereafter? 
MS SAMBO:  Please give me a second?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about in her affidavit … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At paragraph 66 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay thereafter Ms Jackson contacted me.  She sent me 
20 
an email and gave me feedback about the recent visit by SAAT at their 
premises that everything went very well and they were – sorry.  And 
that they were working on determining a date when AAR team would 
then reciprocate the visit to SAAT.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Alright and after she told you about the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 80 of 180 
 
success of the – of the delegation what happened then? 
MS SAMBO:  Thereafter I received an invitation from the CEO of AAR 
Mr David Storch 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry to interrupt you that is S-t-o-r-c-h for 
the transcript.   
MS SAMBO:  Mr Storch invited me to a party that was going to be at 
the Paris Air Show in France on the 16 June 2015.  Initially I accepted 
the invitation but as I started unpacking the activities prior to the 
invitation I took a decision not to attend the party.  One of the things is 
I felt they wanted me to be there where they think it is necessary for 
10 
me to be and where it is not necessary for me then I would be 
excluded.  And all along I have been paying my money.  I have been 
using my own resources to introduce them to open opportunities to 
them to teach them about the market.  What is necessary for them to be 
able to do business in South Africa?  I felt very much that I was taken 
for granted and Ms Jackson completely decided to exclude me towards 
the end of 2014 at the beginning of 2015 in the activities surrounding 
SAAT.  And there I am invited to go and celebrate.  So I did not attend 
that invitation.  But when they came back – when they were at Paris Air 
Show it was on the news that SAAT has signed a MOU with AAR.  I sent 
20 
an email off congratulating Ms Jackson and her team in making strides 
in signing a MOU which gave them – which I believe gave them a 
leverage to be able to then do business with AAR or with SAAT.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you remember when the MOU was 
concluded? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 81 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I was not party to it, no. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Do you know anything about what it provided 
for? 
MS SAMBO:  No.  It is – I did read about it but I guess I was not 
interested in it so I cannot put it as my – as my statement.  Here today 
– we can – I guess we can just download and read the MOU.  I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did the signing of that MOU without your 
participation mean for the relationship between SRS and AAR?  What – 
what was the significance of the fact that SAAT has signed a MOU with 
AAR without SARS as you saw it.  What was the significance? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  There was no significance.  They – when I had a 
discussion with Sharon she said this is the work that they have been 
doing in the past year with Rafiek and his team.  So – so it was very 
clear that it is something that I was not party to and I also did not feel 
that I wanted to be part of it.  Hence I congratulated them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The BEE consortium. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you told me earlier on you had been told was 
going to be led by Mr More. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage of the signing of the MOU were you still 
part of that consortium?  Because I understood you earlier on to say 
you were said to be part of that consortium that is SRS? 
MS SAMBO:  That consortium, the structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 82 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  The proposed structure was still on the table with AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  And my engagement with AAR was that I do not want to 
be part of this structure.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  You are welcome to include other people but please leave 
me as an independent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  In this consortia. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  And during the time of the discussion with the consortia 
unfortunately my name still remained within that consortia on paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  There was no formalised – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not want to be part of the… 
MS SAMBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the – of them.  You wanted to remain an 
independent entity. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having a relationship with AAR. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they could have a relationship with AAR if they 
wanted to.  You had no problem. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not want to be part of them 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 83 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair we are close to the lunch adjournment 
and I am almost on a – on a new topic.  There is just one email I would 
like to refer Ms Sambo to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Before we adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo can I ask you to turn to page 
208?  Are you there? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The – there is two emails here.  One is from 
Rahul Shah and then at the top it is forwarded by John Holmes and you 
are one of the people cc’d, do you see that? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you to read just the first two 
paragraphs of the email from Mr Shah? 
MS SAMBO:  Okay the one that says John, Chris and Ken? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That one yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Alright. 
20 
“One of the questions procurement has for Ms Sambo 
and us is about the start date in the event that we 
come to the terms for supporting PBH.  Their 
contract with Air France is ending on June 30 t h.  The 
question posed by them is, if they finalise the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 84 of 180 
 
contract how quickly we get ready and whether we 
will be to support them from July 1 s t.” 
I think there has been some typo errors there. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sure. 
MS SAMBO:  But I think we get the gist 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  What was PBH? 
MS SAMBO:  PBH is the same contracts – they are components 
contracts.  Sometimes it is referred to power by the hour. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And who do you understand procurement to 
be?  When it says, one of the questions procurement has for Ms 
Sambo? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes I was called by their commodity buyer for the 
components contracts Ms Evelyn Fallit [?] and that question was posed 
to me telephonically that, if they conclude the five month’s contracts 
will AAR be ready and be able to commission the contract.  That is what 
20 
it was all about. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  And at what point was the tender 
process at this stage, do you remember? 
MS SAMBO:  No. I think we can just refer to the dates on the contracts 
– on the tender bid.   
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 85 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Alright. 
MS SAMBO:  To confirm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair we will pick this us after the lunch 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will adjourn for lunch and we will resume 
at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Sambo, can we pick it 
up at paragraph 73 of your affidavit and that is where you deal with 
what you have called the third SAAT bid. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you describe for us what this tender 
was? 
MS SAMBO:  This was the third bid that was advertised by SAA 
Technical for aircraft components, because the second bid was also not 
awarded to anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was it withdrawn or was a decision made that 
20 
nobody was good enough for it or what was the story? 
MS SAMBO:  There … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Second - second one. 
MS SAMBO:  There was no formal communication to - from SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they just - you never - you were never told 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 86 of 180 
 
anything until there was what you call the third bid? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  It - it - they cancelled, but they never - they did not 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Explain? 
MS SAMBO:  The - the bid was not formally cancelled.  We submitted 
the bid.  We were expecting feedback, but there was no formal 
feedback that was sent to us.  I do not know.  Maybe they would have 
sent it to AAR and they did not communicate with me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  But to my knowledge and from the communication I have 
10 
with SAAT.  I do not have anything confirming the cancellation of the 
second bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now the third bid was that still the same bid as 
the first and the second? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, but the difference with the third bid is that it was 
only for five months and not five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The previous one was for five years? 
MS SAMBO:  The last two were five years each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last one that happened twice. 
MS SAMBO:  I am sorry Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair in fair - in fairness to Ms Sambo they 
were issued at least with - with separate bid numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, but in substance it was the same thing? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 87 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In substance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same … (intervenes). 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I guess it might be convenient to continue to call 
them first, second and third bid. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say the third one was the same except that 
there was some difference? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it was for five months and no longer for five 
years? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That was the only difference? 
MS SAMBO:  That was the only difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you know why a tender was - was 
20 
issued for only five months? 
MS SAMBO:  We did inquire and we were told that the current tender 
that was running.  It was coming to an end and they needed a 
temporary contract whilst they were working on the new technical 
requirements for the five year bid.  So - so they - whoever was holding 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 88 of 180 
 
the contract at that time. 
The bid was coming to an end and SAAT decided that the 
advertise another one for five months and during that five months it will 
give them time to work on the technical requirements of the next five 
years. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you to turn to the - the email that 
you received sending you the tender document?  That is at page 2-2-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe in - just to make sure we get the timeframes 
right.  This was now around July 2015 when the third tender was 
advertised.  30 July 2015.  Is that right? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  It was on 30 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the closing date was initially 10 August 2015 
… 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this was extended to 17 August. 
MS SAMBO:  17 August 2015.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo, can I ask you to go to page 
2-2-1? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA: 
 
Do 
you 
see 
the 
email 
there 
from 
Mr Robbertse … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To Mr Fiddes? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 89 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Who is Mr Fiddes? 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Fiddes is one of AAR Corporation’s Managers. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can I ask you just to read the very last 
sentence before it says kind regards? 
MS SAMBO:  “All Communications should be limited to the 
Project Manager, myself or to Evelyn Fallit (?) in 
copy.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  I will - I will return to that in a 
moment.  If we can then pick it up at your affidavit at - from paragraph 
75 and tell us what happened after the bid - the - the third bid was 
10 
issued. 
MS SAMBO:  On - okay Mr Leon Robbertse issued the bid and it was 
sent straight to AAR.  It was not on their website as usual and then 
AAR forwarded the bid to me.  Subsequent to that AAR arranged a third 
teaming agreement for this five months bid with SRS.  On 10 August 
2015 Ms Cheryl Jackson came to South Africa and I met with her at the 
restaurant in Sandton and we - we discussed the bid, because they had 
received the bid already - the third bid - and I was - and I wanted to - 
to negotiate with Ms Cheryl Jackson that I do not - when we respond to 
this bid. 
20 
I do not want to be part of the consortia.  I want to remain as 
an independent partner in - in this consortia.  Ms Jackson at the time 
she was also staying at Sandton at Michelangelo.  So our meetings 
would be around where she booked the hotel.  At that meeting also she 
told me that Mr Bagus and Mr More worked very hard in getting them to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 90 of 180 
 
sign an MOU with SAAT. 
The one that was signed at the Paris Air Show and therefore 
Mr - Mr More and Mr Bagus they will form a part of the consortia going 
forward.  Meaning what I was told before.  That Mr Rafique Bagus is 
only a consultant.  On - at that meeting the status quo changed.  Giving 
him an opportunity to now participate on the bid.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What had happened to the fact that - as I understood 
your evidence - after the Paris Air Show you and AAR seemed not to 
want to or you did not want to interact with them, because you were 
aggrieved?  You thought they - they invite you when it is convenient for 
10 
them and they do not invite you when it is not convenient for them and 
- and I thought you - you said that Ms Jackson after that seemed also 
to exclude you or did I misunderstand? 
I got the impression that the relationship between SRS and 
AAR after the Paris Show - Air Show party - was not so good. 
MS SAMBO:  Not - not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I see now you - you are back together.  So what 
happened? 
MS SAMBO:  Oh.  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did I misunderstand something? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Maybe a little bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS SAMBO:  When Mr Rafique and Mr More came to the picture - when 
they started featuring with AAR.  AAR parked me on the side and 
operated with Mr More and Mr Bagus with their strategy which they said 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 91 of 180 
 
it was different from mine and leading up to the Paris Air Show the 
decision I took not to go to the air show. 
Yes.  It was the beginning - it was when I was realising that 
now I am being side-lined.  So I decided that I will not go to the air 
show, but the relationship was not completely strained yet.  I still 
believed that AAR will come back on the table and we discuss how we 
are going to work together going forward. 
Hence I did email them congratulating them on the MOU 
signed and subsequent to that Ms Jackson told me she is coming to 
South Africa.  Let us have a sit down and discuss.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I did not ask you when you told me about 
emailing them congratulating them, but I wanted to find out whether 
that was genuine congratulations. 
MS SAMBO:  It was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or - or whether it was not really genuine. 
MS SAMBO:  It was genuine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  I was congratulating them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Genuinely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Despite the fact that they had done this without your 
involvement? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I am a businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  It was genuine. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 92 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  I congratulated them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  They had reached a milestone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  That is what I saw in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but at that time - am I - am I right to say that 
was still the period during which you felt you were being side-lined? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  It - it was at the beginning of me realising that I am 
actually being side-lined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And so what was the outcome of your 
meeting with - with Ms Jackson what you have described at the 
(indistinct) company. 
MS SAMBO:  And then she - that is when she indicated that Mr Bagus 
is going to circulate a structure that will now respond with AAR on the 
third bid.  The broad based Black Economic structure I referred to 
20 
earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did Ms Jackson say to you at that meeting 
when you said you did not want to be part of the consortium?  You 
wanted to stand alone having a partnership with AAR. 
MS SAMBO:  She insisted that Mr Bagus has already negotiated with 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 93 of 180 
 
AAR that through his consulting engagement that he will create this 
broad based Black Economic Empowerment.  So that is what they had 
agreed upon.  So she did not give me an option to exit from - from the 
consortia. 
It - it was - that is what we want to work with.  The third bid 
we want to submit with one consortium.  Not with different parties.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you then accept that that was the position?  Then 
you would continue with them being part of the consortium.  Even 
though you would have preferred differently. 
MS SAMBO:  I did not accept.  I still pushed for SRS to submit as an 
10 
independent to a point where I indicated to AAR that this consortia you 
are talking about is not formally constituted.  The - the consortium does 
not exist.  It - it is more like a plan that is on the table.  So when you 
submit a bid.  The consortium needs to be registered. 
There needs to be Directors appointed.  Shareholders, 
certificates.  You know.  All the regulatory required documentation and 
the consortia did not have that.  It had not gone to that stage.  So I 
suggested - I was suggesting to Cheryl that they continue bidding with 
SRS as we have been bidding, because the - the company is ready. 
It complies with all the requirements, but that is when 
20 
Ms Jackson said Mr Rafique Bagus and Mr More have worked very hard 
on the MOU.  So they cannot - we cannot leave them out.  They need to 
be part of the submission for the five months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I want to understand what you attitude was 
after she had said that.  Did you leave the meeting …? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 94 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I did not agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you leave the meeting on an acceptance that if 
you were going to be part of the bid as SRS you would have to be part 
of the consortium or did you leave the meeting on the understanding 
that you would submit your own separate bid or did you leave the 
meeting with - on the basis that you would submit something. 
Say to SAAT you were part of the bid involving the consortium 
and AAR.  What was the understanding?  Your - your attitude as you 
left the meeting in terms of where do you feature in this bid. 
MS SAMBO:  We did not have a conclusion.  She understood … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in your own mind? 
MS SAMBO:  I was still waiting to see the structure … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Because I had not received the structure yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS SAMBO:  All I knew is that Cheryl assured me that I am still the 
lead … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  BEE partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  So - so I was still waiting for the structure. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and then tell us what happened after 
your meeting with Ms Jackson at the (indistinct) company? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you refreshing your memory? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes Chair.  I am sorry. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 95 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  I have also - I have already indicated that AAR 
inquired why five months and not five years and the feedback was given 
that the other contract is ending and they need somebody to - to hold 
the contract and then Ms Jackson - then Ms Jackson started you know 
indicating to me that she has been coming back and forth to South 
Africa to try and get this deal. 
It has been a long time.  AAR has spent a lot of money trying 
to capture this market.  You know and get into SAA Technical.  So she 
was frustrated.  She - she also looked very much under pressure and 
10 
she told me that if she does not get this contract this time around.  She 
is going to be dismissed from - from AAR.  That was during the day 
when we met. 
Then later on - a few days after that meeting we met again 
with Ms - Ms Cheryl Jackson at Bukhara Restaurant which was just 
outside Michelangelo where she stayed.  That meeting took place.  It 
was in the evening.  I do not have the specific date, but it was in 
August 2015. 
When we met at - I found her already at the restaurant, 
because she - she called me and she did not sound too good and she 
20 
wanted to talk to me.  So I went to see her.  It was early evening.  So I 
went to see her.  I found her there.  Ms Jackson was drinking.  She - 
she was really frustrated. 
She vented verbally also her frustration about not managing 
to - to get this contract.  Back and forth and - and that AAR is now 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 96 of 180 
 
putting so much pressure on her to get the contract.  So in that state - 
and she insisted that she wanted information from me.  That could help 
them to win this bid. 
So I took it as part of my fact finding or information finding 
for AAR as I have been doing since we started the working relationship 
and giving that I had a very close - now - friendly relationship with 
Ms Nomsa Memela.  Then I called Ms Nomsa Memela at that time.  I 
said here is the situation I am faced with right now at Bukhara 
Restaurant. 
Cheryl Jackson is drinking.  She is so drunk.  She is 
10 
frustrated.  She insists she wants information that can assist her to win 
the bid.  What can we do and then Ms Nomsa Memela invited me to 
come to her in Alberton to get some information.  So I told Cheryl that I 
am going to meet with Nomsa to get some information that can assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ms Memela? 
MS SAMBO:  Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.MS SAMBO:  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Alberton where she was working or was that her 
home? 
MS SAMBO:  Her home. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  But we did not meet at her home.  She directed me to 
meet with her at the Shell Garage as you enter Alberton next to - next 
to SARS Offices.  Before you could proceed to the SARS Offices at - at 
Alberton.  So she came in her vehicle.  I moved from my vehicle.  I 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 97 of 180 
 
went inside to hers and she saved information for me on the memory 
stick which I took and went back to Bukhara Restaurant to Ms Jackson. 
So when I got to - to Ms Jackson at Bukhara Restaurant I 
indicated to her that I do have some information, but I have a problem 
that I have been working for AAR for so many years and you refuse to 
pay me a retainer and you do not want to pay anything.  So for me that 
information was key for me at that time to ask Ms Cheryl Jackson to 
reconsider the decision of not paying me the retainer. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You have referred to information.  What - 
what was the information? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  The information - it was on a memory stick.  It was an 
Excel spreadsheet that contained pricing for - previous pricing for the 
same components bid. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just take us through step by step. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Pricing provided by whom in regard to 
previous bids?  By the entity that had the contract at the time that was 
going to come to an end or by other bidders who had put in bids, but 
they had not got the tender? 
MS SAMBO:  It was - I looked at a - at that spreadsheet.  Scanned - I - 
I basically scanned and I saw the names of some of the bidders like Air 
20 
France which holding the - the contract at that time and Lufthansa’s 
name was mentioned on - on that spreadsheet and I saw - those are the 
two that I remember very well that I saw on that spreadsheet and 
Ms Memela said to me.  Here is the information of the previous bids.  
Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 98 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You say that you - you asked Ms Memela 
whether she had any information for you.  Did - did you ask her whether 
she could give you bid prices? 
MS SAMBO:  No.  I said information.  What information can she help 
with?  Then she said I must come to her, but when I got to her then she 
gave me the Excel spreadsheet which had the prices. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, we have also received a response to 
a Rule 3.3 Notice sent to Ms Memela.  I would like to take you to that 
Ms Sambo. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is at page 5-12 - 5-1-2.  This is - this is 
the relevant part of her - her statement.  It is not an affidavit.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is a statement in support of her 
cross-examination application … 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And at paragraph 8.2 on page 5 - 5-12 - 
5-1-2.  She says … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is - is this an affidavit or just … 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is just a statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A statement.  Why is it not an affidavit or affirmed 
declaration?  Do the rules not require that it should be - her version 
should be on affidavit or affirmed declaration? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, I do not believe so.  I believe that the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 99 of 180 
 
- she has the option to submit an affidavit or a statement, but we are 
just double checking that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found it? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  If you go to Rule 3.4 Chair. 
“An application in terms of Rule 3.3.6 above must 
be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the 
Commission within 14 …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  What rule? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  3.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3.4. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you will see there in the second 
sentence Chair of 3.4 the application must be accompanied by a 
statement from the implicated person respond … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No - no later on there is a rule that says an 
application - where the rules require an application that must be an 
application on affidavit.  I think that is towards the end of the Rules. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You may well be right about that Chair.  I 
believe it is 11.3 Chair.  Rule 11.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
“Wherever these rules make provision for any 
20 
person who applies to the Commission or to the 
Chairperson.  The application must be a substantive 
application on affidavit with a motion.  The affidavit 
must among other things reflect the relevant facts, 
the order sought and the grounds relied upon to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 100 of 180 
 
seek that order.” 
Now she might not have applied for leave to cross-examine 
and just put up an - a statement, but do the provisions have provision 
for just a statement that is not under oath? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  A - a statement that is not under oath as a - 
as a response to a Rule 3.3 Notice Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the Rules make provision for that or is the 
position that people who might not want to go under oath just put - I 
can put up a statement without going under oath or an affirmation?  
Maybe for what it is worth continue … 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And put to her.  Then investigate the issue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, if I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that, because it would better if - if somebody has 
a version.  They put their version under oath or an - an affirmed 
declaration. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and not to challenge somebody’s evidence that is 
given under oath on the basis of a document that is not under oath or 
that is not an affirmed declaration. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let everybody be under oath or affirmed declaration 
for their versions and then let us take it from there.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, are you - are you 
happy for me to proceed to put Ms Memela’s version? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 101 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you can do so for now and then you can 
investigate later on so that, going forward we can look at that. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   So Ms Sambo I was at paragraph 8.2 on 
page 512. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And there Ms Memela says,  
 
“I deny and refute the allegation as false by Ms Sambo, in 
 
that I have never arranged to meet Ms Sambo anywhere 
 
outside SAAT.  I further deny and refute her allegation that I 
 
furnished her with a memory stick containing the identities of 
10 
 
bidders and their bid prices, there is no way that I would have 
 
such information because in my capacity as HOD SCM – 
 
What does that stand for? 
MS SAMBO:   I don’t know. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  “I did not sit on the evaluation team cross-
 
functional sourcing team”. 
 
What is your response to that? 
MS SAMBO:   My response is that I have submitted evidence to the 
Commission that Ms Memela is – the allegation that we never met is not 
true, so the evidence is before the Commission. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Tell us about that evidence? 
MS SAMBO:   What exactly would you like to know? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   What evidence have you provided to the 
Commission in support of your allegation that you met with Ms Memela 
and obtained the flash disk…[intervenes]. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 102 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No she means her oral evidence, isn’t it? 
MS SAMBO:   Excuse me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’re talking about your oral evidence? 
MS SAMBO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is there something else you have submitted in 
support of your evidence? 
MS SAMBO:   I have submitted the actual memory stick. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SAMBO:   Where the excel spreadsheet was saved on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, take it from there. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.  Ms Sambo can you just explain 
to us why you were only able to find the memory stick on Monday night 
when you gave it to the Commission’s investigators? 
MS SAMBO:   When I was initially looking for the memory stick I was 
looking in my office, I was looking at home, I looked everywhere and I 
couldn’t find the memory stick, hence when I was writing my affidavit 
the memory stick was not there and I had put on the affidavit that I 
don’t have the memory stick.  Then on Friday – last Friday, if you could 
please remind me the date? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No it’s fine, last Friday yes. 
20 
MS SAMBO:   Last Friday we – I then had a consultation with my legal 
counsel and the Commission’s investigators and the legal team.  During 
that engagement I was given all the feedback to Notice 3.3 of the 
implicated parties on my affidavit and one of – and all three of the 
statements that I received on Friday, one from Mr Zwane, one from Ms 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 103 of 180 
 
Kwinana and one from Ms Memela, all of them had a personal attack in 
my memory and the medical condition that I dealt with at the beginning 
of my statement and over and above that, Ms Memela denied the 
allegations that I put on my statement and I decided to go an extra mile 
to find this evidence.  So on Friday when I left Sandton from the 
consultation I went home and I then called my ex-employees that I 
worked with at that time and requested them to please remind me, 
because the Commission is sitting on the 4 t h and the 5 t h and this is 
what I’m faced with, I need information.  Please remind me if there’s 
anything that we can take back to the Commission, please assist me.  
10 
Then two of the former employees are in Soweto which is Ms Mazwi 
Sebeko and Samkelsiwe Sebeko, they are cousins and I also invited my 
sister because I worked with her, Thembelihle Twala.  So it was the 
four of us and as we were deliberating that’s where  Mazwi said, I 
remember I have the memory stick, you gave it to me, but I’m going to 
look for it.  So she gave me that undertaking, I went back 
home…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mazwi being one of your former employees. 
MS SAMBO:   Former employees yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MS SAMBO:   Then I went home comforted that we might get this 
evidence that will prove that I am telling the truth.  On Saturday I 
called Mazwi, asking, did you find the memory stick and she said to me, 
no we haven’t found the memory stick yet but I do remember that I also 
gave it to a friend of mine to keep it for me, a lady by the name of 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 104 of 180 
 
Gugu, I don’t know her surname.  So I will try and get it and get the 
memory stick from Gugu.  Then on Sunday when I came back from 
Church I called again to find out if she has the memory stick and she 
said, no she still doesn’t have the memory stick in her possession, she 
will let me know on Monday morning.  Monday morning came and as I 
was about to start a meeting that I had on Monday, then I called again, 
asking about the memory stick and she said to me, they have found the 
memory stick.  Then I arranged one of my current colleagues and asked 
him – his name is Mr Siphiwe Thembe and asked him to go and fetch 
the memory stick for me from Mazwi and then – to go and fetch the 
10 
memory stick because Mazwi said she is going to give the memory stick 
to Shadrack because on that day she was moving houses, from 
Diepkloof to somewhere else I don’t remember where she was moving 
to but it’s easier to access Diepkloof so she will leave the memory stick 
with a gentleman called Shadrack whom I know very well that assist us 
when we move office or move houses, he’s got a van, he is their 
neighbour in Diepkloof.  So I got a text message from Siphiwe because 
I was already in a meeting now, saying I’m struggling to get hold of 
Shadrack, so I immediately sent him the contact numbers for Mazwi, I 
said, please talk to Mazwi because I’m in a meeting.  So I gave him 
20 
both Shadrack’s number and Mazwi’s number to talk to them.  Then 
later on when I checked my messages he confirmed that he found the 
memory stick from Mazwi, then I asked him to take the memory stick to 
a friend of mine who works just outside of Diepkloof, I don’t know what 
that area is called [indistinct] something, just before you go to the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 105 of 180 
 
stadium, who had planned to come and see me after work – when she 
leaves work.  So I asked Siphiwe to take the memory stick and give it 
to my friend Ms Bawinnie Lemalele who was going to bring it with when 
she comes to see me in the evening and that’s how the memory stick 
got to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a long journey. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Quite a chain of custody [laughter]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s try and get going. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair can I say that Ms Hofmeyr, in her 
introduction, explained the process that had happened within the 
10 
Commission, the data forensic team has imaged the flash disk that Ms 
Sambo provided to us, they have advised us that the properties of the 
spreadsheet that is on the flash disk show that it was created – sorry 
last saved on the 3 r d of August 2015 and that the user that saves it was 
Ms Nontsasa Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   There’s an affidavit forthcoming from the 
investigators within DFT…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So those are the technical people who have looked 
at the computers and so on? 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair we’ve also printed a copy of the 
spreadsheet which we’ve included in Ms Sambo’s bundle and perhaps 
we can go there. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 106 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, before you proceed, lets go back to the 
meeting that you say you had with Ms Memela at the Shell garage in 
Alberton, did you say Shell garage? 
MS SAMBO:   Shell garage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes next to…[intervenes]. 
MS SAMBO:   Confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not far from SARS? 
MS SAMBO:   Not far from SARS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, how did it come about that, that spot was 
chosen and who chose the spot as the spot where the two of you should 
10 
meet? 
MS SAMBO:   Ms Memela lives in Alberton, so she’s the one who 
suggested we meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what she told you at the time, that she lived 
in Alberton or is that what you knew? 
MS SAMBO:   No this is what I knew, remember it was over the time 
when I’ve indicated …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You have become friends? 
MS SAMBO:   We had become friends yes, so I knew that she lives in 
Alberton yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but at that time when you met her at the Shell 
garage, had you been to her house or her home already or not really? 
MS SAMBO:   In the past yes, I visited her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had been to her home? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes I visited. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 107 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you know it is in Alberton? 
MS SAMBO:   I know it is in Alberton. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where did she – was she working at the Airport 
where did she work? 
MS SAMBO:   She worked at the Airport at SAA Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the Shell garage was on her way home or was 
that on her way home would that be more or less where she would pass 
if she was going home or not really? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes it is on her way home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was on her way? 
10 
MS SAMBO:   Ja it’s just as you on-ramp. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and where were you coming from, where were 
your offices? 
MS SAMBO:   From Sandton, I was coming from Sandton from 
[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the meeting? 
MS SAMBO:   From the meeting with Ms Jackson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay alright, so you say she was the one who 
suggested that you meet at the shell garage. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But initially she had said at home? 
MS SAMBO:   No she did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I thought you said she said you should come to 
her home but later she changed and said, let’s meet at the garage. 
MS SAMBO:   No, no, no. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 108 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No she said Shell garage? 
MS SAMBO:   Shell garage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Sambo can I ask you 
to turn to page 553. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes I’ve got it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And you’ll see that from 553 to 557 do you 
recognise those spreadsheets? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes I do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   What are they? 
10 
MS SAMBO:   This is the pricing for the component bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that, what are they? 
MS SAMBO:   It’s the pricing for the component bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where did you get it from? 
MS SAMBO:   I got it from Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Through the memory stick?  
MS SAMBO:   Through the memory stick yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, all three pages? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   There are five pages. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Each page represents a tab from the excel 
spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so these are the spreadsheets that you got 
from the memory stick that Ms Memela gave you? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 109 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And Ms Sambo, what did you do with this 
information? 
MS SAMBO:   On the night that I received the memory stick, I didn’t do 
anything with the information but I went back to Ms Jackson and told 
her that I’ve got the information, I’ve got the pricing, I actually told her 
because at that time I already knew, the information is the pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know that from what Ms Memela had told you 
at the meeting at the Shell garage? 
10 
MS SAMBO:   No when she saved the memory stick she opened – it 
was – she was sitting on the driver’s seat when we met…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s what I mean. 
MS SAMBO:   And she opened her laptop…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh she opened it, then you saw? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes, then she saved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes and she said this is the pricing of the last bids, yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   So tell us what happened next, what did 
you do with the flash disk? 
20 
MS SAMBO:   Then I went home – after the meeting with Ms Jackson I 
went home with the disk…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how did the meeting with Ms Jackson end, I 
remember at some stage you said that you said to her you were not 
going to give her the information, you’ve got the information but you 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 110 of 180 
 
won’t give it to her because you want your R100million. 
MS SAMBO:   No I never asked for R100million [laughter]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe you didn’t say that but you said you 
want to be paid. 
MS SAMBO:   I asked her to review her decision or the AR’s decision 
not to pay me my retainer fees for the work that I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry you didn’t say R100million? 
MS SAMBO:   No, no, no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you say how much you believed you should 
be paid? 
MS SAMBO:   No, no we didn’t even talk about the figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, did she refuse to review? 
MS SAMBO:   Well, no she didn’t agree nor did she refuse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja what did she say? 
MS SAMBO:   She was very drunk, I’m sorry to say that, that night she 
was completely drunk that’s when she even told me that she had cancer 
and she had recently divorced, it was a lot of things, so we couldn’t 
have a very constructive discussion.  Then I left, we agreed that we’ll 
20 
meet again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say your meeting with her was in the 
evening? 
MS SAMBO:   It was in the evening, early evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It had started around what time, before you went to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 111 of 180 
 
the Shell garage meeting? 
MS SAMBO:   It would have been around 5h30, 6h00PM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and what time did you meet with Ms Memela at 
the Shell Garage, more or less? 
MS SAMBO:   It could have been around 7h00PM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay and then from there you went back to 
Sandton to do your meeting with Ms Jackson? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then later on you went home? 
MS SAMBO:   Then I went home. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Ms Sambo you did ask Ms Jackson if she 
would pay you, in which case you would give her the flash disk, is that 
right? 
MS SAMBO:   It was not a condition like that, it was asking her to 
review the decision of paying me a retainer because I’ve been doing a 
lot of work and they don’t want to pay me and with the information at 
hand, for me, I thought I would use that as a leverage but not to say 
she is paying only for this information, but for them to review the 
decision of paying me my retainer for all the work I’ve been doing. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Is the reason that you didn’t give her the 
flash disk because she wouldn’t pay you the retainer? 
MS SAMBO:   No. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Why didn’t you give her the flash disk? 
MS SAMBO:   When I got back to her and I started negotiating my 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 112 of 180 
 
retainer – because I have this information now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which she wanted. 
MS SAMBO:   Which she wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SAMBO:   She cried foul saying that in the United States if she 
were to pay me now because I’ve got this pricing information of the bid 
that was running at that time it will be regarded as bribery and 
corruption.  As soon as she said that I said – you know inside myself I 
was like, thank you for opening my eyes I actually didn’t think it was 
bribery and corruption so I’m not going to give you the information, 
10 
that’s how I left with the information. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Ms Sambo do you accept that asking SAAT 
for any tender information while a bid was open was wrong? 
MS SAMBO:   Yes it was wrong, at that time my judgement was 
clouded.  When I was doing it at that time, my judgement was clouded, 
I 
have 
this 
pressure, 
Rafiek 
is 
delivering, his 
making 
those 
introductions, this side I’m being side-lined, it’s like I’m not performing 
and this one is crying foul and I thought, okay let me get this but then 
when I realised that what I’m doing is wrong, I did not give the 
information.  I held the information and hence the memory stick ended 
20 
up, even moving from me to be kept away – far away from me.  So yes, 
I realised it was wrong to take it, I admit it was wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you never gave the information to Ms Jackson? 
MS SAMBO:   No I never gave them any information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 113 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Ms Sambo if we can then pick it up at 
paragraph 83 of your affidavit and just tell us what happened after your 
meeting at Bukhara Restaurant with Ms Jackson?  Sorry that’s on page 
24. 
MS SAMBO:   Okay, you were asking about which element? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   I’m just asking you to tell us what happens 
next, after the meeting with Ms Jackson at Bukhara? 
MS SAMBO:   Oh okay, alright.  So after that meeting at Bukhara I 
received an invitation to attend a meeting now by that group from the 
Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment structure and the meeting 
10 
was scheduled to take place in Cape Town for us to discuss how we’re 
going to respond to this bid.  I couldn’t travel to Cape Town but rather 
requested that, once they are together they can call me so that I join 
the meeting in the form of a teleconference.  During that phone call Mr 
Burgers informed me that they will use my company documents to 
respond on the bid, so when the bid goes in it will still be mentioned as 
AR & SRS Aviation, however I must know that, once we get the 
contract, that structure that was on the table with the names of people I 
didn’t know would kick in.  so I actually taped that discussion because, 
already at that time I was aware of what is the plans and the activities.  
20 
I decided, one, I was with one of my employees and we decided to tape 
the discussion with a recorder.  So Mr Burgers just mentioned this is 
what we’re going to do…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this the telephone conversation or is this now in a 
meeting that you decided to record? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 114 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:   It is in the telephone discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS SAMBO:   I put Mr Burgers on a speaker and [indistinct] had the 
recorder with her, so we recorded the communication.  So – and then 
that’s what Mr Burgers meant – indicated, I didn’t dispute, I just said 
okay and I asked to be excused because I was driving yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And what did you do with that recording? 
MS SAMBO:   That recording unfortunately is one of the things that we 
have lost, it’s something that we are still looking for so if we find the 
recording…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which you might still find. 
MS SAMBO:   If we find the recording we will submit it to the 
Commission, Sumka believes that we downloaded it to one of the 
laptops, the recording but in the laptops that I still have, there’s no 
recording, so yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Alright and what then happened after your 
teleconference which you recorded? 
MS SAMBO:   After that then that’s – excuse me, can I refer Chair to 
my document? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS SAMBO:   Okay on the 13 t h of August we received an email, when I 
say we, myself and other members of the consortium, we received an 
email from Ms Jackson formally indicating that AR will be responding to 
the components bid that [indistinct] emailed to them directly and the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 115 of 180 
 
email sought to formalise that relationship with the consortia.  The 
consortia, at that time – when I look back at the documents, there are 
two different names that were used, there was Africa Aviation and later 
is was called Diza Aviation, the consortia that was formed.  On the 
same day I also received Ms Jackson’s call, asking me if I would be 
able to physically go and submit the tender document when it’s 
completed.  The plan was for them to work on the bid, email it to me 
and then I would go and print, bind and submit.  So at that time I 
agreed, however, before AR submitted the component bid I called Ms 
Jackson and requested that I want to be excluded from this contract 
10 
and the main reasons why I wanted to be excluded from the contract is 
that I was not comfortable with the consortia as I had been discussing 
with Ms Jackson and secondly I didn’t like the attitude from Mr Rafiek 
Burgers who was now instructing me that my company document will be 
use to partner and submit this bid and thirdly because I realised that I 
have information that would potentially have a bad record on my name, 
I decided that I will not give them the information and I will not 
participate on the bid, so I walked away. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And what was the reaction to you walking 
away? 
20 
MS SAMBO:   Sorry? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   What was the reaction…[intervenes]. 
MS SAMBO:   From Ms Jackson? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   From Ms Jackson and AAR to you walking 
away? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 116 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:   Ms Jackson called several times that day, she still 
insisted that I – it was the first time after I had indicated that I am 
walking away, that Ms Jackson offered that AR will pay me my 
consulting fee.  So I said to Ms Jackson it’s too late I have made a 
decision I will not participate, however, I would like us to go back to the 
drawing board, sit around the table and let’s fix this relationship.  For 
now, because the contract is only for five months, I will not have much 
to lose, you can continue with your consortia, I will stand back but let’s 
sit around the table and agree to agree or agree to disagree.  That is 
what I proposed to Ms Jackson.  Then Ms Jackson responded to say, if 
10 
I walk away from the five-month contract, I must know that they will not 
even work with me on the five-year contract, so I still confirmed that 
I’m choosing to walk, so I walked. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did the info, did the issue of the 
information on the flash disk ever arise again? 
MS SAMBO:  On the phone calls when se was offering now my 
consulting fee, she was insisting to call me with the guys who work on 
the technical part of the bid, on a conference call so that I give them 
the information, then I said no.  So that was the end of that discussion 
with the memory stick. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Alright and let’s pick it paragraph 90 of the 
affidavit and tell us what happened after you refused to give the 
memory stick.   
MS SAMBO:  Sorry? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Tell us what happened after you decided to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 117 of 180 
 
walk away and refused to provide them with the information on the 
memory stick. 
MS SAMBO:  No, I decided I did not participate on the contract with 
them, but I still sent e-mails requesting to meet with them when they 
come to South-Africa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you know whether the bid that was 
submitted still contained your Company documents? 
MS SAMBO:  I was in the dark until I received a call from 
Mr Badenhourst, Mr Ettienne Badenhorst.  Can I confirm the name and 
surname? 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At paragraph 96 you refer to Mr Badenhorst.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes Mr Ettienne Badenhorst from Ernest and Young, 
requesting to interview me, because Ernest and Young had been 
appointed to investigate various, to do an internal investigation of 
various contracts within SAA as a whole.  Not SAAT only.  SAA as a 
whole.   
 
So, my response to him was I don’t have a contract with SAA 
or SAAT, why would you want to interview me.  Then he said my name 
20 
feature on the components contract.  Then I indicated that I did not bid 
on their, because he called, when he contacted me there was not, the 
tender had closed but it had not been awarded.  So, it was during the 
process adjudication of that bid.   
 
So, he requested that, if I could come to SAA offices for an 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 118 of 180 
 
interview, so I agreed.  But this time, because I always go alone, I 
decided I am going to take of my employees.  So, I requested 
Miss Sibeko, to attend the meeting with me.  Because I was confused 
why do they need to interview me.   
 
So, we arrived at SAA   He introduced himself again as I have 
indicated.  He interviewed me, and I gave the statement as I am giving 
the statement here to the Commission to the best ability of the memory 
I had at that time, and at that time I still had the recording as well, 
which I have indicated I have, but I have indicated that I am not sure if 
I should give it to him, because I didn’t tell the other party that I was 
10 
recording them.  So I did not give the recording to Ernest and Young, 
but I still had sms or WhatsApp communication between myself and 
Miss Jackson, asking to be released from the bid and all that. 
 
So when we concluded our interview, it is only then that he 
told me that I am being interviewed because AAR decided to still put in 
my documents, because they are Indezar, or Deezar or this other 
company did not have any formalised documents. 
 
They would have disqualified for not having the BEE 
component.  So, it was the first time I realised that AAR proceeded to 
use my documents without my knowledge.   
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  And we can then go to 
paragraph 99 of your affidavit and if you could just explain what 
happened after you met with Mr Badenhorst. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay post the meeting that I had with Mr Badenhorst, it 
was about September 2015.  I was invited by Miss Jackson to come in 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 119 of 180 
 
and discuss the BEE structure in planning for the five-year contract.  I 
was surprised to be invited after I had walked away from ...[intervenes].   
CHAIRPERSON:  Miss Jackson invited you? 
MS SAMBO:  Miss Jackson invited me and said there will be a meeting 
with the members of the Consortia to discuss a way forward in planning 
for the five-year contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this the first contact or communication you were 
having with Miss Jackson since the conversation where she said if you 
walk away you must know that they will, they would not work with you 
on the five year contract, or they had a bit communication in-between? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  I would have to go back to my e-mails and check 
...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure? 
MS SAMBO:  I do believe there was ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Some communication. 
MS SAMBO:  Communication where I expressed my grievance of how 
they managed or mismanaged the whole process of bringing in new 
partners and forcing me to be part of that.  And the whole issue about 
information they want, but now they are introducing the bribery and the 
corruption element. 
20 
 
So, I was not happy about that.  There is a grievance that I 
had sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So I indicated to Miss Jackson that the last time we 
spoke, the discussion was not in a cordial or happy manner, so I would 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 120 of 180 
 
like to meet with her first before going to that meeting.  
 
At that time, she had booked in at the Inter-Continental Hotel 
at O R Tambo.  So, I went in there, it was in the morning, I don’t have 
the exact date, but it was in September 2015.  I went in there, as I went 
in at the foyer, as you are coming or at, what do you call it, a corridor 
but it has got, it is a lounge sort of, I saw Ms Jackson sitting with 
Mr Ndzeku.  That I could recognise because I knew him, and I was 
surprised ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to Ndzeku or the surname for the 
transcription. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, it is N-d-z-e-k-u ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Ndzeku. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes okay. 
MS SAMBO:  So I found Miss Jackson sitting with Mr Ndzeku at the 
foyer and as I came in, Mr Ndzeku immediately stood up and in a very 
flamboyant way, said, hi Miss Sambo, good to see you.  And he now 
tried to introduce me to Sheryl, and say Sheryl this is Miss Sambo, she 
is our bright star in aviation.  If you talk aviation is South-Africa, you 
will hear the name Sibongile Sambo.   
20 
 
You know like, but at that time I am confused, I am trying to 
place Mr Ndzeko and Miss Sheryl Jackson together, and before I could 
even respond much, I just smiled and you know.  Listen to this 
statement. 
 
And immediately Mr Ndzeko offered to explain why he is with 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 121 of 180 
 
Miss Jackson and he indicated to me that he met Miss Jackson on a 
flight from somewhere in the Continent, in our Continent.  African 
Continent.  I don’t remember the Country, but when they met, they were 
introduced to each other by a common friend who was an Ambassador. 
 
I can’t recall which Country he mentioned, and they want to 
import and export coffee.  Basically that is what he mentioned and he 
offered to, and he said good-bye to Sheryl and they were going to see 
other later, and he left because I had a meeting with Miss Jackson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And how did you know Mr Ndzeko from 
before? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Ndzeko was introduced to me by a friend who said, I 
know somebody else who is in aviation.  He is one of the shareholders 
at Swissport, so I would like to introduce the two of you.  So, I was 
introduced to Mr Ndzeku and that was years before the components bid.   
 
That is why I know him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lets get to your meeting with Miss Jackson.  What 
happened? 
MS SAMBO:  At the meeting with Miss Jackson, we both vented out the 
previous experience that we had, and I asked Miss Jackson if  they 
would still consider working with me when the five year contract comes 
20 
out, and she indicated that the people at AAR were extremely 
disappointed with me dropping them at the last minute, the way I did. 
 
So, as she was sitting there at that time she cannot confirm 
whether I would still work with them or not.  But she still invited me into 
the meeting that she planned to have with the members of the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 122 of 180 
 
Consortia and Miss Mdlulwa was going to be at the meeting as well. 
 
So that was the discussion that I had with Miss Jackson.  She 
said, lets see.  Let’s have a discussion, we will take it from there.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did you then go into the meeting with 
the rest of the Consortia? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, I did. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us about that meeting. 
MS SAMBO:  In that meeting it was brief.  We introduced ourselves.  
The people that I remember were in the room was Miss Kuki Mdlulwa 
which was referred to as “ihhashi” previously.  And it was me 
10 
representing SARS Aviation, and it was Advocate Kellerman who was 
representing the Consortia.   
 
She was working with Mr Rafique Bagus.  At that meeting it 
was very straight forward.  Miss Mdlulwa indicated that she  was there 
to come and tell AAR that her people that she is representing which is 
Miss Kwinana and her people at SAAT wants the hundred million from 
AAR to make sure that the get the contract. 
 
And then Miss Mdlulwa also confirmed that the hundred million 
exclude anyone else but for Yakhe Kwinana and her people at SAAT. 
 
And she also indicated that Sibongile we found you here with 
20 
AAR, you will continue your negotiations directly with AAR which I 
agreed to, and then Ms Jackson wanted to know from Advocate 
Kellerman if they also have an advanced requirement, and Miss 
Kellerman was very clear, that no they don’t want any cash upfront but 
they see this as a long term relationship that they can build with AAR. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 123 of 180 
 
 
That is what I remember at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remind me.  Who did, whom did Ms Kellerman 
represent? 
MS SAMBO:  Mr Rafique brothers and the members of that Consortia. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Was she part of the Consortium or was she 
only a representative of, a lawyer for the Consortium? 
MS SAMBO:  My understanding is that she was the lawyer, but she was 
allocated shares, but can we just refer to the structure. 
 
Do we have it in the bundle. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We do have the structure is at page 234. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well if she tells me, or you tell me what her 
capacity was, that would do.  Was she part of the Consortium as well? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I am not sure if she was a shareholder 
of the Consortium.  If you turn to 235 it lists the shareholders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  She is not listed as a shareholder in  
MS SAMBO:  No, she is not. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In her personal capacity or as a member 
...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  As a member of this organisations.  This 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, now is not ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  But at the meeting did she say anything to indicate 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 124 of 180 
 
how she came into the meeting or did she simply say she was 
representing the Consortium? 
MS SAMBO:  She said she was representing the Consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  No, she is actually a shareholder.  If you look at page 
235.  The second last point, it refers to ZK Consulting Services held by 
Zarina Kellerman. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so she was part of the Consortium? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And I see in the shareholding structure, ZK 
Consulting held 8.33 percent of Mzansi Aviation Woman’s Consortium.  
Which in turn held 33.33 percent of the ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  So, Miss Kwinana was not part of the Consortium, 
but as you understood the position Miss Mdlulwa represented her at 
this meeting. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, Miss Mdlulwa yes represented Miss Yakhe Kwinana.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, oh. 
MS SAMBO:  She was not part of the Consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And did Miss Mdlulwa made it clear that was 
acting on behalf of Kwinana.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And the request for a hundred million rand 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 125 of 180 
 
payment, did she make that openly to the whole meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was Miss Jackson’s response to this request for 
the payment of hundred million rand? 
MS SAMBO:  She said she doesn’t have the authority to approve 
anything, she would go back and discuss it with her principals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she the only person representing AAR there? 
MS SAMBO:  As far as I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And how did other people in the meeting 
10 
react? 
MS SAMBO:  Miss Kellerman was very clear that they don’t want any 
cash up front.  They want to have a long-lasting working relationship 
with AAR.  I was on the same boat that, I have been AAR anyway so I 
would like to continue working with AAR as an independent company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Miss Mdlulwa say what the hundred million rand 
was going to be for. 
MS SAMBO:  No, she did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did anybody ask, did Miss Jackson asked her what 
would this hundred million rand be for? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  If you, sorry Chairperson she was very clear that she is 
representing Miss Yakhe Kwinana and Miss Yakhe Kwinana, that is that 
amount that she wants to make sure that AAR gets the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she say that at the meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  She said that at the meeting yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 126 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Miss Sambo we can then turn to the, to what 
you describe at the fourth bid. 
MS SAMBO:  The? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The fourth SAAT bid.  That is on page 33.   
MS SAMBO:  Page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Page 33.  Paragraph 113. 
MS SAMBO:  Sorry I was paging the annexures 33.  Page 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your affidavit.  Page 33 of your affidavit. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, I am going there.  Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you deal there with what you describe as 
the fourth SAAT bid.  Can you describe this tender for us? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lets just finalise on the five month one.  Because I am 
not sure I know what ultimately happened to that tender.  The five month 
one.  You were not interested in it.  You told Miss Jackson and you 
decided to walk away. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether they ultimately got the five-month 
tender.  That is AAR. 
MS SAMBO:  Hey I was no longer part of, of that contract so I didn’t have 
20 
any formal communication indicating whether they got they got the 
contract or not but ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  To this day you don’t know. 
MS SAMBO:  What I know by now.  Now, after effect is that contract that 
contract was also not awarded to any, oh as far as I know it was not 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 127 of 180 
 
awarded to anyone or it didn’t get any feedback whether it was awarded 
to anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  That one I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t know. 
MS SAMBO:  I don’t know.  I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Miss Sambo can you then tell us what the 
fourth tender was? 
MS SAMBO:  The fourth tender was the components bid again, and this 
10 
time around it was the full five year contract and it was an open tender.  
When I saw this tender, as usual I downloaded it, sent it to Ms Jackson at 
AAR and requested that we work together on the bod. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you said earlier on that when you asked her at the 
last meeting or I think you, Mr Ndzeko, where you met Mr Ndzeko.  When 
you asked her whether they would, they could still work with you on the 
five year contract she said she was not sure because other people were 
very disappointed, the fact that you dropped out when they needed you.   
 
Had she in the meantime come back to you, to say whether they 
were prepared to work with you on the five year contract.  By the time 
20 
this tender was advertised? 
MS SAMBO:  Nol.  No there was no discussions, so ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  When I saw the tender, I just downloaded it.  Forwarded it 
to them. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 128 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  As usual ask them that we respond ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  To the bid together.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was the response to that? 
MS SAMBO:  There was no response at all. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us what happened after the RFP was 
issued.  Picking up from paragraph 114. 
MS SAMBO:  Thereafter I received a call from Miss Memela suggesting 
10 
that the Chairperson, Miss Yakhe Kwinana wanted to meet with me 
again and they suggested we meet at the Emperors Palace, because Miss 
Memela was at work, then she quickly pop into the meeting and then go 
back to work.   
 
I agreed to that.  We met at the Spur.  I think it is called the 
Spur Ranch, Gold Rush Spur Steak Ranch inside Emperors Palace.  At 
that meeting Miss Kwinana wanted to know if I have resolved my issues 
with AAR, because at that time they knew that I walked away from the five 
months contract, because I had been talking to Miss Memela.  Yes.  So, 
at that meeting Miss Kwinana also wanted to ...[intervenes].  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just mention this and Mr Mbikiwa you can, well 
you can take it further if you want to take it further and Miss Sambo 
you can comment if you want to comment.   
 
It is possible that she might say that she asked about your 
relationship with them because on her version you had told her at the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 129 of 180 
 
Protea, was it the Protea Hotel meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About your problems with them and asking her to 
intervene, or them to intervene. 
 
I am just saying she might say that is why she asked, because 
you had told her, not because she had had heard from Miss Memela 
about your problems with them 
MS SAMBO:  I would dispute with her in response, because at that time 
I don’t think I had walked away from the bid.  So yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I interrupted you.  You can continue. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So at that meeting Miss Kwinana wanted to know 
the relationship with myself and AAR, if it was still intact, and also 
wanted to know if I have seen Mr Ndzeko with Miss Jackson before this 
fourth bid was advertised.   
 
I have been discussing with Miss Memela as often.  Very often 
about the activities of the AAR, of my relationship with AAR so I 
assumed that she would be privy to that information through 
Miss Memela. 
 
And when I am with Miss Memela or when I speak to Miss 
Memela I would express the disappointment in how AAR has treated me 
20 
in the whole process, and at this meeting Miss Kwinana said she could, 
because at that time I was then told that AAR is partnering with, is 
partnering, Miss Memela had told me that AAR is partnering with 
Mr Ndzeko company.  J N Aviation.   
 
And it is then when I realised why Mr Ndzeko met with 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 130 of 180 
 
Miss Jackson in September at the Inter-Continental Hotel. 
 
So, it confirmed, this meeting confirmed that they were already 
discussing a possible partnership for the five-year contract.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What 
had 
happened 
in 
the 
meantime 
to 
the 
Consortium that was led by Mr Morai? 
MS SAMBO:  It disappeared.  I don’t know what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know when about it disappeared or did it 
disappear when the third tender was withdrawn or cancelled when they 
didn’t get that tender maybe.  You don’t know. 
MS SAMBO:  I have not heard of them since the third bid yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja by the time you saw Mr Ndzeko with Miss Jackson 
you had not ...[intervenes].  
MS SAMBO:  No on that particular day when I saw Miss Jackson and 
...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ndzeko. 
MS SAMBO:  That is when there was that meeting where Miss Kuki 
Mdlulwa was, and Advocate Kellerman was and myself.  That was the 
last time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Consortium was still in place at the time. 
MS SAMBO:  At that time ...[intervenes].  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  It was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 131 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  I just say ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us what happened after your 
meeting with Miss Kwinana and Miss Memela at the Spur at Emperors 
Palace. 
MS SAMBO:  At that meeting it came across as if Miss Kwinana is now 
driving now, it was more like she is control now of who must ultimately 
partner with AAR.  Because at the meeting she called Miss Jackson to 
find out if they could drop Mr Ndzeko and revive my relationship with, 
with AAR.  But there was no conclusion.  There was no conclusion on 
that telephone call, and I don’t remember the other details of that 
10 
meeting, but Miss Kwinana wanted to know if I know Mr Ndzeko. 
 
Because I had mentioned to Miss Memela in our informal 
discussions that I know Mr Ndzeko and I know him running a fuel or 
petroleum company because he had an agency with ENI petroleum 
company from Spain.  And I know him so they wanted to know what is it 
that I know about him and I told them they can Google Mr Ndzeku’s 
information is on Google so yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can then pick it up at paragraph 117 
and tell us what happened next. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  So, in January 2016 Ms Memela contacted me that 
20 
she wanted to have a meeting with me.  She has got information 
regarding the outcome of the bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 4 t h bid. 
MS SAMBO:  The 4 t h bid which she also knew that I did not submit 
because I could not get a partner to with technical expertise to submit 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 132 of 180 
 
the bid with.  So, I met with Advocate Memela in Alberton because she 
lives in Alberton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the same Memela you have been referring to 
throughout your evidence. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, that is the same Memela that I am referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  And she ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say you met with her this time around where, 
where did you meet? 
MS SAMBO:  We met at the Maxis restaurant. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Alberton. 
MS SAMBO:  In Alberton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  I might have the sequence of events ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might be getting that wrong. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but at some stage you met with her in Alberton. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, at some stage I met with her in Alberton.  And she 
indicated to me that the bid was awarded to AAR with JM Aviation.  So, 
I was not- I did not take the news very well.  I actually broke down.  I 
20 
literally broke down so badly that it seemed like I was told the news 
that a very close family member had passed away.  It cut so deep 
inside me.  I could not hide it.  People at the restaurant were looking at 
me, why am I crying so hard.   
And the reason why I was crying is the realisation of I would say 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 133 of 180 
 
feeling and knowing that I have really been stabbed at the back working 
so hard, putting in all my efforts and financial resources  and human 
resources and everything and introducing AAR and going all out for 
AAR and then next thing somebody else just come in like that and they 
are awarded a 1.3 billion rand contract that I worked for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the value of the tender? 
MS SAMBO:  That is the value of the tender that Ms Memela had 
indicated to me when she told me it was awarded and the value was 1.2 
billion.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So, at that time Ms Memela just realised also what 
she has done.  I do not think she expected that I would react in that 
way and she became very defensive in that I was now very hard on her 
wanting to know what really happened.  How did Mr Ndzeku get to 
partner with AAR?  And that is when she indicated to me that Ms 
Kwinana introduced Mr Ndzeku to her and she also asked her to assist 
Mr Ndzeku in preparing the bid ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is the she, who is the her now?  
MS SAMBO:  Oh, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is Ms Kwinana?  Who is Ms Memela? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Ms Kwinana the chairperson of SAA Technical requested 
Ms Memela the Head of Procurement the South African Airways to 
assist Mr Ndzeku from JM Aviation in preparing for the submission of 
the bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  This was- this you were told by Ms Memela at 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 134 of 180 
 
this meeting at your second meeting that you have told me about in 
Alberton. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us just go back a little bit.  That meeting, 
who requested that the two of you have a meeting?  Was it Ms Memela 
or yourself? 
MS SAMBO:  Ms Memela, she wanted to break the news to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she would have known that you had not been part 
of those who put in a bid.  You did not put in a bid. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why would she have wanted to have a meeting to 
break the news to you? 
MS SAMBO:  Because she knew how hard and how much I really 
wanted this components business ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  This particular job. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  And because we have developed a friendship in the 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  So, we were talking about anything and everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS SAMBO:  So, she felt that- she felt she needed to tell me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She needed to tell you. 
MS SAMBO:  Before I could hear it on the news. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 135 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, it continues.  So, she was surprised that you 
reacted to this news the way you did.  You cried and so on. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and what did she say?  You said she became 
defensive.  What did she say? 
MS SAMBO:  Ja.  Yes Chair, because now I was questioning her role in 
all this.  Then that is when she indicated that Ms Yakhe Kwinana the 
chairperson of SAA Technical had requested her to assist Mr Ndzeku in 
10 
preparing for the bid and for the bid submission.  And also, she told me 
that Mr Ndzeku also requested her because she is an advocate by 
profession, asked her to assist in their joint venture- the joint venture 
between JM Aviation and AAR Corporation.  So, to prove what she was 
telling me then she emailed me the emails that I am now talking about 
on page 34.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The email was to prove what? 
MS SAMBO:  To prove to me that she was assisting ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ndzeku. 
MS SAMBO:  That she assisted, yes, Mr Ndzeku.  She initially sent in 
20 
the joint- the draft joint venture agreement which was sent to her to 
assist and that documentation.  And then later on she also forwarded a 
trail of emails that were going forth between- back and forth between 
AAR, JM Aviation and her.  So, she emailed to me that trail of emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now after the meeting?  After the meeting in 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 136 of 180 
 
which she broke the news to you. 
MS SAMBO:  I would have to confirm the exact ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sequence. 
MS SAMBO:  Sequence yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but at some stage. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, this is the area where the sequence is ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is problematic. 
MS SAMBO:  Is problematic in that the content is correct but the 
sequence could be disjointed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, it may assist if we actually go to the 
emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go to the emails yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can go to page 367.  Ms Sambo who is 
that email in the middle of the page from? 
MS SAMBO:  This was from Ms Nontsasa Memela dated the 23 r d of 
January 2016 and it was sent to my iCloud account. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay and then the email that she is 
20 
forwarding to you, who is that from? 
MS SAMBO:  The email subject was the draft proposal and Ms Memela 
had received it on the 14 t h of January from Ms Khosi Sokhulu from JM 
Aviation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can you read the contend of the email? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 137 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Hi coz, so here is the latest proposal.  Please let me 
know if it is acceptable. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if we can turn ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe she can read the Ms Sokhulu’s email 
address there into the record.  Just read that email address from Ms 
Sokhulu it indicates the- her connection with the JM Aviation entity. 
MS SAMBO:  The email address is khosi@jmaviavtionsa.com 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if you turn over two pages to 369.  This 
10 
is the attachment to the email. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you read what its title is in the middle 
of the page there? 
MS SAMBO:  I see the AAR logo and the JM Aviation logo and the title 
is Proposal for South African Airways.  This AAR Proposal Outlines 
Components Support for SAA Technical Fleet of Airbus A390s, A320s, 
A330, A340 and Boeing 7373 Aircraft. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Can I then ask you to turn to 
page 339?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The proposal starts at 369. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to where does it go?  Do you want her to identify 
up to what page it goes? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  Can you identify the last page?  Just 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 138 of 180 
 
before the tab that says 44. 
MS SAMBO:  It goes to- okay, which page numbers ... (intervenes) 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You can give us the page number in the 
bundle.  It starts ... (intervenes) 
MS SAMBO:  In the bundle not ... (intervenes) 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It starts on page 369, where does it finish in 
the bundle? 
MS SAMBO:  At 442. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so that, all those pages that is the proposal.  Is 
10 
that the proposal that was sent to Ms Memela in terms of the email we 
looked at a few minutes ago to- from Ms Sokhulu of JM Aviation?  Is 
that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then all this was sent to you by Ms Memela. 
MS SAMBO:  Ms Memela, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To show that she had been involved in assisting JM 
Aviation. 
MS SAMBO:  For me that is what I believed at the time when I received 
given the context of the discussion, I had with her. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can just turn to the other email that Ms 
Memela forwarded to you.  That is at 339. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 139 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  This email it came from Ms Nontsasa Memela on the 
23 r d of January 2016.  It was sent to my iCloud email address and the 
title- and the subject was Joint Venture Draft Agreement. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you and who was it sent by? 
MS SAMBO:  The trail of emails shows that the initial document came 
from Ms Khosi Sokhulu from khosi@jmaviationsa.com and it was sent to 
Ms Nontsasa Mememla on her iCloud account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give the date and the time of the email that was sent 
to Ms Memela. 
MS SAMBO:  The date is the 14 t h of January 2016 at 16:01:34 PM. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  So 4 PM, half past 4 PM. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you can you read that email for us 
please? 
MS SAMBO:  Hi cousin, this is the first draft of the JV so far.  Jules did 
a quick review and noticed the following; 
1a.  ‘i Agreed participation JM 5% AAR 95% then there is a 6 
participation interest JM 5% AAR 95%. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You can pause there Ms Sambo.  Do you 
know what the relationship was between Ms Sokhulu and Ms Memela? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  No, I did not know the relationship.  I just saw the cousin, 
cos on the trail of emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was going to ask you to confirm that the “Hi coz” 
that you read earlier on was a reference to cousin.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes, the first one it a ... (intervenes) 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 140 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a short version. 
MS SAMBO:  Short version coz. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  But the second one is in full cousin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know who Jules was?  That the one you have 
just read refers to Jules having done a quick review and noticed certain 
things. 
MS SAMBO:  No, I do not know Jules. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The allegation that Ms Memela told you that 
she has been asked by Ms Kwinana to assist JM Aviation with its bid is 
one that she that she has responded to in her statement.  If I can ask 
you to turn to page 512.   
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And at paragraph 8.3 she says upon 
realising that Ms Sambo had no knowledge of what is expected of her 
of a local black owned company regarding supplier development, I 
20 
forwarded her a draft copy of JM Proposal that was sent to me to guide 
them on supplier development.  Since supplier development was a new 
program to all the local black owned companies therefore it was my 
duty to guide all black owned local suppliers specifically on the part of 
supplier development and Ms Sambo is well aware of this fact.   
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 141 of 180 
 
BBBEE and supplier development were part of my business score card.  
Since Ms Sambo had expressed her intention to either approach Air 
France and or Lufantsa as their local black owned company, I saw it fit 
to forward her a draft from other black owned companies to guide her 
and ensure that she knows what role she would play as their BEE 
partner.  There is absolutely nowhere in the track changes of the draft 
proposal that was sent to her where it shows that I had worked or 
commented on their proposal.  As the intention was merely to guide 
them on the supplier development part which I also did for others- I will 
pause there and ask you to comment on that Ms Sambo. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  I would- I find her statement is not authentic because at 
the time that I was dealing with SAA Technical and trying to do 
business with AAR, during that same period I was the Deputy 
Chairperson of the BBBEE Charter Council for the whole Department of 
Transport.  And there is no way I would not have- I would not 
understand the requirements of the BBBEE score card.  So, I would 
argue this.  I think Ms Memela- would not I think let me pause there.  
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well I see Mr Mbikiwa that she seems to- Ms 
Memela she seems to say she is not giving her full version here.  She 
20 
reserves the right to give her full version somewhere else.  That is not 
good enough. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If she has a version, we must have the whole version 
here. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 142 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, unfortunately she has been summons 
to appear on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Which gives us the opportunity to ask her to 
confirm under oath this version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And to ask her the remainder of her version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is Wednesday today.  If there is somebody 
representing her, she must get here with a full version.  I do not want 
piecemeal versions.  Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If I can continue with that paragraph.  From 
where I was sitting there was no conflict of interest on my side as I did 
not sit on the committees that were doing the valuation and the voting 
for the suppliers.  I was surprised when I learned from her affidavit that 
she had twisted the facts to fit her personal agenda.  I also only realise 
now that the reason Ms Sambo is presenting all these false allegations 
against me is because I refused to help her with prices and other 
tender information when she needed it for AAR in the past.   
20 
And when she saw the draft from JM, she conveniently assumed I may 
have assisted them with information that would help them to win.  This 
allegation is far from the truth and she knows what I said when I 
forwarded her that draft.  It was for her to have an informative BEE info 
when she approaches the multinational companies.  Ms Sambo is fully 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 143 of 180 
 
aware that I assisted all the Black owned companies including herself 
but I had since noticed that she suffered from an extreme case of self-
entitlement.  When she does not get what she wants, she uses exactly 
what one had used to assist her against you.  What is your response to 
that portion of her statement? 
MS SAMBO:  Her statement has got a lot of personal attack which I do 
not want to respond to.  She must come and clarify what does she 
mean when she said, I have requested pricing from her in the past.  
She must bring that evidence to the Commission that I have indeed 
asked her for pricing in the past besides the USB.  So, and she says 
10 
she refused so this is a personal attack.  She says I have a self-
entitlement.  She must define and give a full version of what does she 
mean about this self-entitlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are being given an opportunity to respond to 
her version and take this opportunity to respond to her version in so far 
as she may be saying things about you or against you that you say are 
not true. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you say I cannot respond to the particular 
allegation because I do not understand what she means.  You may say 
20 
so but everything that you understand, particularly if you say it is not 
true what she is saying, you must take this opportunity to deal with it. 
MS SAMBO:  Thank you Chair.  The allegation is not true and her 
allegation is full of personal attack ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just because I have interrupted you.  Just go back to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 144 of 180 
 
say which allegation that she is making against you that you say is not 
true so that we understand. 
MS SAMBO:  All the allegations she refers to on paragraph 8.3 that we 
are dealing with right ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja of the statement. 
MS SAMBO:  Of her statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  The 8.3 that we are dealing with right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  That she merely forwarded the information to assist me in 
10 
understanding supplier development.  And I am saying the statement is 
not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Because at that time I understand supplier development 
very well.  As a Deputy Chairperson of the BBBEE Charter Council for 
the Department of Transport, that was our responsibility to actually 
draft the new code for the entire transport sector.  So, what she is 
alleging here, it is not true.  And I am going to confirm that in one of 
the SMSs that we are going to deal with, where she was going into the 
meeting and she was asking me for the information of supplier 
20 
development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mbikiwa just make sure that you take those 
important parts of her version, Ms Memela’s version and make sure you 
put that to her. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 145 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that she can deal with them properly. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because on her own she might not be able to deal 
with all of them. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  Ms Sambo can I ask you to respond in 
particular to the allegation that Ms Memela refused to help you with 
prices and other tender information when you needed it for AAR in the 
past. 
MS SAMBO:  The only time I have asked Ms Memela for information, it 
was on the night that I had a meeting with Ms Jackson at Bukhara and I 
10 
subsequently met with Ms Memela and she saved the information on the 
memory stick for me.  And I came back with the information.   
There has never been any other time that I have requested her to help 
me in any way with information related to any bid besides that 
information.  And I have already submitted the prove to this 
Commission so I would expect Ms Memela to also perhaps submit her 
prove that she did not give me any information. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then Ms Sambo at 8.4 and I do not- I am 
not going to read the whole paragraph but the key allegation that Ms 
Memela makes is that she denies the allegation that she ever told you 
20 
that Ms Kwinana had asked her to assist Mr Ndzeku and Ms Sokhulu to 
prepare a winning bid.  What is your response to that? 
MS SAMBO:  This one Chairperson there is no written prove so it is her 
word against mine except that she forwarded the emails that proved 
that she actually did communicate with Mr Ndzeku or Ms Sokhulu, with 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 146 of 180 
 
Ms Sokhulu in particular from JM Aviation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, I see that we are approaching 4 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I think we must finish with Ms Sambo. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have not moved with the kind of speed that I 
would have like. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is my fault Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think we are not left with much. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, let us try and finish. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  There is not much in the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Then there is something that Ms Sambo just 
referred to which is a set of WhatsApp messages that she has provided 
to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Which are in her bundle but not in her 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Which makes it quite important that we deal 
with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In some detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us do that. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 147 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can pick it up back at your affidavit Ms 
Sambo from paragraph 121.  Tell us what happened after you were sent 
those emails by Ms Memela?  Sorry, that is on page 35, paragraph 121 
on page 35. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  On page 35.  Can you repeat your question 
please? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am just asking you to tell us what – what 
happened next in the chronology after you were sent the emails by Ms 
Memela?  After she forwarded you the emails that had been sent to her 
by JM Aviation? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Oh yes I just safe kept the information.  I made sure that 
I am keeping this information in case I need it one day.  And the next 
time I talked or used the information was on the 15 March 2017.  AAR 
was attending AAR, SRS, SAAT and a whole lot of organisations that 
deal with maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircrafts.  There is a 
yearly conference called the Africa MRO Conference.  So AAR was 
represented, I was there.  In that meeting I met with Ms Cheryl Jackson 
again still you know expressing how I felt and how she treated or 
managed our relationship but she was adamant that they were 
disappointed when I walked away and that is where the umbilical cord 
20 
was cut basically with SRS.  There was – at the – in attendance there 
was also a lady called Donna Dahlia Maluleke who was working for the 
Embassy in Chicago in 2011 when I was introduced to AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I just want to try and locate what you are 
testifying about now in terms of time.  Is this a meeting with whom, 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 148 of 180 
 
where, when that you are now talking about? 
MS SAMBO:  This was at the conference at – which was at the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What conference was it I may have missed that?  
What conference was it? 
MS SAMBO:  There was a conference at Emperors Palace from the 13 
to 17 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20? 
MS SAMBO:  2017.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  And… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Long after the five … 
MS SAMBO:  Long after… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five year – yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Long after the – even the award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Yes.  That meeting there was a lady who used to 
work for the Embassy in Chicago Mr Donna Dahlia Maluleke that knew 
me and also knew Ms Memela and the rest of the team.  Post to her 
resigning at the Embassy she went to join AAR as an employee for AAR 
but she was not working on the components deal.  But she is somebody 
20 
that I would talk to as well with my frustration because she was there 
from the beginning and she joined AAR.  And what she did during that 
conference she tried to intervene to get myself and Ms Nontsasa to sit 
down and talk about what really happened with the AAR contract.  So 
On that day of the 15 March that is when for the first time I disclosed to 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 149 of 180 
 
Ms Maluleke that I have this information that Ms Memela forwarded to 
me that suggested to me that she knew what was happening. She 
assisted JM Aviation in preparing the bid.  And she came – she is the 
one who told me that JM Aviation was awarded the bid.  So I was not 
happy with that and Donna then – Ms Maluleke then tried to intervene I 
think that is what Advocate Mbikiwa wants to get to now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I do not think I understood how your meeting with 
Ms Memela ended in Alberton on the day that she broke the news to 
you of the award of the tender.  I remember that you said that you cried 
and people were looking at you at the restaurant and she – she was 
10 
surprised at your reaction and ultimately she gave you the information 
to – which showed that she had been involved in assisting JM Aviation. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not remember that you – you told me how 
that meeting ended. 
MS SAMBO:  I was so hurt Chairperson.  I had to be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you… 
MS SAMBO:  There was no further discussions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could not – you could not have… 
MS SAMBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any proper discussion after that? 
MS SAMBO:  No.  No.  The… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how did she feel with you deciding to leave Ms 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 150 of 180 
 
Memela? 
MS SAMBO:  She – you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  She understood that you were distraught? 
MS SAMBO:  She – she understood absolutely.  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Subsequent to that was there regular 
communication between the two of you because I understand that up to 
that point you had become friends? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did your friendship continue beyond that meeting? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It continued? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes thereafter we started to speak in general.  I went into 
depression and I would still tell her that I am in and out of hospital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  And if there is a discovery at hospital I would even share 
with her that this is now the new discovery.  You know I am going to do 
this operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  So there was – yes there was that communication 
between the two of us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you feel let down in any way by her role in the 
awarding of the – of this tender? 
MS SAMBO:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why? 
MS SAMBO:  Absolutely.  Because I knew that Ms Memela had her best 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 151 of 180 
 
interest at heart to see me succeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  And I knew how hard she tried to introduce me to even 
other international companies to – to partner with me.  So in this 
journey Ms Memela has always been there.  You know she became a 
friend and when AAR was turning their back on me she was there to say 
try Air France maybe Air France will give you an audience.  She took it 
upon herself to make introductions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  And with that I completely believed that sincerely Ms 
10 
Memela wanted me to succeed in this industry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  But at the same time in our discussions she appeared to 
have found herself in the middle of a – I could call it a place – a hard 
rock and a hard place because now she has me this side.  An 
entrepreneur who really wants to break through this industry and really 
wants to work and I am really putting the entire effort.  And on this side 
here is the force that says you know help this one.  You know and to a 
certain degree I felt – I do not know how to explain this but it was 
confusion.  It was heart break.  It was feeling of betrayal.  It was a 
20 
whole lot of things. And therefore immediately I could not just walk 
away from her.  I remained and we had communication because I 
wanted to understand to the T what really, really happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is it that you – that she did which you – you 
saw as her letting you down or betraying you or betraying your 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 152 of 180 
 
friendship with her? 
MS SAMBO:  The emails that she forwarded that she indeed assisted 
JM Aviation.  Because at some point she said she does not know Mr 
Ndzeku.  At some point she was – that is the discussion we were 
having.  She was saying she does not know him.  And then later on she 
indicated that Ms Kwinana introduced Mr Ndzeku to her and also asked 
her to assist Mr Ndzeku. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but why did you not accept that as true namely 
that she was asked by Ms Kwinana to assist Mr Ndzeku and that is why 
she was assisting? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  I am not – I am not disputing it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to understand what it is that she did that 
made you feel she had betrayed you?  Because you are saying… 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were friends and you are saying you believed 
that she had your best interest at heart and she was trying to assist.  
She said well if AAR is treating you like this maybe try Air France and 
so on.  So now the tender had been awarded to JMV and AAR. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she told you what had happened.  What is it that 
she did that made you feel she had betrayed you? 
MS SAMBO:  I just felt she was sitting in a position of power as the 
Head of Procurement and she was there at the meeting in Pigalle when 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 153 of 180 
 
I introduced AAR and she was there seeing me in and out with AAR at 
SAA Technical and I – and thereafter we also developed a friendship 
and we could talk about this deal.  And at that time I believed sitting at 
the position of power she could have – I am not saying it was her 
responsibility but she was sitting at a position that she could still have 
advised AAR better.  I am not saying it was her responsibility and that 
is how – that is how I feel.  I am not saying that is what she was 
supposed to do.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she was not AAR’s advisor as well, is it not? 
MS SAMBO:  No she was not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  She was not.  Hence I am saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it is true that she had been asked by Ms 
Kwinana to assist Mr Ndzeku or JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you still – and she complied.  Let us assume 
she complied would you still feel that she betrayed you? 
MS SAMBO:  I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Okay no that is fine.  I just want to – to try and 
understand your own perspective. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also I do not know that I understand completely 
why she would have given you the emails that she gave you because 
she said to you she had been asked by Ms Kwinana to assist JM. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 154 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aviation. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she told you that. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not believe that and she had to prove it and 
why would she have felt she needed to prove it by way of giving you the 
emails? 
MS SAMBO:  I do not know.  But she proved the – excuse me.  She 
qualified her statement Ms Yakhe Kwinana asked her to assist JM 
Aviation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  And she actually did assist them and she forwarded me 
the proof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you… 
MS SAMBO:  So I – I think she… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you say when she told you that she was asked 
by Ms Kwinana to assist JM Aviation and when she told you that she did 
actually assist JM Aviation she did not think that that would hurt you?  
20 
Because I get the impression that that is part of what hurt you.  
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you must tell me if my thinking is not correct? 
MS SAMBO:  No definitely.  Yes indeed I was hurt by all the activities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 155 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Including her participation in – in assisting JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but you are not saying that she was showing 
you all of this because she wanted to hurt you in any way? 
MS SAMBO:  No I do not think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not what you are saying? 
MS SAMBO:  No, no, no.  I do not think she wanted to hurt me in any 
way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  I think you know as a friend now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe she was being candid with you about her role. 
10 
MS SAMBO:  She was – yes, yes.  Because she has been from the 
beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and you said… 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was shocked or she was surprised as to your 
reaction when you cried, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she might not have thought that whatever role she 
played might hurt you? 
MS SAMBO:  I do not think she was aware that I was already slipping 
20 
into the depression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  Because remember AAR had already cut me off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  They did not submit the bid with me. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 156 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  At that time already it is hurting so badly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  After working so hard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  And with her confirming that they went in with JM Aviation 
and now thinking about seeing Ms Jackson with Mr Ndzeku at the lobby 
at International – Intercontinental Hotel at OR Tambo now playing back 
everything it became very clear to me that – that I would get hurt.  That 
you know – the whole process was just so wrong. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  It was just so wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be – would it be correct or would it be – ja 
would it be correct to say your reaction was more about the reality 
which you were now seeing which she had told you effectively that you 
really had lost out and not so much what her role was in that? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be – would that be fair comment? 
MS SAMBO:  That will be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fair comment. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  A fair comment Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hence the fact that afterwards your friendship still 
continued, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 157 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  At some point I needed to – to separate her as a 
Procurement Manager at SAAT and her as my friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS SAMBO:  And hence we continued with the text messages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you did have some sense of feeling that she 
had betrayed you but I get the impression you cannot put your finger to 
exactly what it is that you say she did that showed betrayal. 
MS SAMBO:  To a certain extent I – I believed that in her personal 
capacity, in her own accord the way I know Ms Memela without being 
influenced by anyone she would not have done that to me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And that should go … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should go a long way. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In saying to you even if you do not like the fact that 
she played a role but you understand… 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The circumstances under which she played that role? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Sambo there are just 
two further aspects I would like to deal with before we get to the – the 
Whatsapp messages.  The first is this meeting with Ms Memela.  I just 
want to clarify the – the date of it.  You say at paragraph 125 that it 
was in early 2016 and I just want to check that you are sure of that 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 158 of 180 
 
because the evidence that we have got and that will be led tomorrow 
suggests that the award was only made in May 2016? 
MS SAMBO:  Then this would be incorrect Chair.  Can I request to – to 
correct my affidavit?  I guess it is one of those areas that I could not 
place when in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  If you – if you – if what you wrote is 
what you believed was the correct date at the time that is fine.  You are 
clarifying that you would accept the other date now. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the commission’s legal team and your legal team 
10 
will look at whether – at the possibility whether you should file any 
supplementary affidavit to clarify that. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then the last aspect Ms Sambo is at 
paragraph 128 of your affidavit.  Can you just describe what Ms Memela 
has said about Ms Tshabalala? 
MS SAMBO:  I verbally told Advocate Memela that I was going to 
institute legal action.  She informed me that she did not work alone in 
assisting AAR with the bid submission and that she worked with Ms 
20 
Princess Tshabalala who was the senior manager… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry Ms Sambo.  I think you – there 
is something that I am – you must have said before you come to that 
point.  You now say you told her there was to be action.  You are going 
to institute action.  Had you come to the decision to sue anybody and if 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 159 of 180 
 
so who was it and when did you come to that decision? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Upon realising that – oh post my meeting with Ms 
Memela where she – she indicated that the bid is now finalised and it 
was awarded to JM Aviation in partnership with AAR.  This is when I 
believed that I have a valid legal case to institute legal proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Against?  Or you did not know who against at that 
time or you were advised subsequently?  I just want to get that picture 
before you come to talking about Ms Tshabalala. 
MS SAMBO:  That I would institute legal action against her Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Her alone or? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  At that time… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you thought at that time? 
MS SAMBO:  The evidence that I had in my possession is what she has 
sent to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes then continue.  You then told her you were 
going to sue her, is that right? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell us – tell me about that and how that issue 
20 
moved forward? 
MS SAMBO:  Sorry.  The legal action also was going to be instituted 
against AAR on the basis of a verbal agreement that I believed at that 
time would hold water. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would this – would this be an action for 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 160 of 180 
 
damages, financial loss, for money that you thought should have been 
paid by AAR to you for the work you had done and or for the role that 
Ms Memela had played in the awarding of – in assisting JM Aviation. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that what it was going to be about? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
MS SAMBO:  And in our discussion Ms Memela indicated that she did 
not work alone to assist AAR in preparing for the bid submission and 
that she specifically mentioned Ms Princess Tshabalala who was the 
10 
senior manager Supply Chain Management at South African Airways 
Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what did Ms Tshabalala say to you? 
MS SAMBO:  One day I went to SAA Technical now as one of the 
suppliers on the day to day quotation system to meet other suppliers 
and she saw me in the corridor.  Then she requested me to step into 
her office she wanted to talk to me.  And this is when she told me that 
Ms Memela indicated that I want to take legal action against the whole 
process that took place with – until the award of the contract to AAR 
20 
and JM Aviation.  And in that meeting she mentioned to me that I must 
remember that she – I must – well I did not know but she told she was a 
single mom and she needed the job.  So if I sue anyone she is going to 
lose her job.  And Ms Memela had promised them that they will be paid 
money once JM Aviation in partnership with AAR received or have 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 161 of 180 
 
received – once the award was given to AAR and JM Aviation then they 
will be compensated for assisting them in submitting the bid. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And this is another aspect in respect of 
which Ms Memela has filed a response.  It is not necessary for us to go 
there but basically at paragraph 8.9 of her statement she denies ever 
having told Ms Tshabalala or any of her staff that Mr Ndzeku or Ms 
Kwinana had promised them money.  And she suggests that the fact 
that you say but money was never given is questionable and shows that 
there was no money that was ever promised or discussed by anyone.  
What is your response to that? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  I have email – sms messages where Ms Memela is 
confirming the allegation I have against her.  I can try and find the sms. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Well I would like to turn to the sms’s next so 
let us go there. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We can start at 522.  Ms Sambo can you just 
start by telling us what – what these messages are? 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  There are two sets of messages. Ms Memela had 
two phones and we would send – if I remember very well one was a 
20 
business phone and another one was her personal phone.  I stand for 
correction on that one.  But generally we would talk as friends.  The 
sms’s or the Whatsapp’s that I managed to retrieve from my phone only 
starts in 20 – mostly they are in 2017.  I do not know if there is any…. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The messages start at – at 517 if that is 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 162 of 180 
 
helpful.  That is the first page of the messages. 
MS SAMBO:  I just want to check the dates of the mes – okay yes 
thank you.  So – so the sms’s that I have span through from the 17 
November 2016 which was way after the contract was awarded to – to 
AAR and JM Aviation.  In the messages there is a combination of our 
friendly messages and at some point there are messages from the 15 
March 2017 that now have got some allegations against me. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry I did not mean to interrupt you. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So just to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought we are going to the message that 
10 
confirms one of the allegations you have made against her.  Let us get 
there.  Ms Mbikiwa let us get to that one. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I am not sure which specific message 
Ms Sambo is referring to 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja which one did you have in mind? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Do you have a particular message in mind? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell us what the allegation you make against her and 
you tell us that – what she said in the message to you which you say 
confirms the truthfulness of that allegation?  Then we can go and look 
for the message. 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Then please remind me Chair which element of my 
affidavit we were talking about at that time?  Because there is so many 
things… 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We were talking about Ms Tshabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm ja. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 163 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS SAMBO:  About Ms Tshabalala yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You had said you were going to sue … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So I would like to find that SMS where she referred 
to - to Ms Tshabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember what she says in the message 
about Ms Tshabalala? 
10 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or what - what do you - what she says in the 
message. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  Basically on 15 March … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  That is when for the first time I told Ms Maluleke that I 
have got all these emails that are implicating Ms Memela that she 
forwarded to me and I want to take legal action and Ms Maluleke in turn 
went to Ms Memela to tell her that I have got information against her.  
That I want to open a legal case on, but on the messages she is 
20 
alleging that I said I will go to the newspapers and - and this and that, 
but I remember I wanted to open a formal legal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember what she said which you say 
supports … 
MS SAMBO:  Yeah. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 164 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your allegation?  What did she say in the message as 
far as you can recall? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  As far as I can recall she indicated on the WhatsApp 
message.  Once she realised that I have that information against her.  
She then indicated that if I think I am going to destroy her.  I must 
know that I will not be destroying her alone.  I will be destroying her 
and other people and she mentioned the names. 
She mentioned Ms Princess Tshabalala and she mentioned 
Mr Zwane - the CEO. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we - can we turn to page 5-3-2?  Chair, 
10 
the - the message is at the bottom of that page.  5-32.  Are you there 
Ms Sambo? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I am here. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And if you go right to the bottom. 
MS SAMBO:  Oh.  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Who is that a message from? 
MS SAMBO:  The message is from Ms Nomsa Memela.  It was sent to 
me on 20 March 2017 at 21:44:19 at night. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just - just for context can you - can you 
read the message just above at five past three on 20 March at 15:05? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Okay.  At 15:05 on 20 March 2017 Nonsa Memela sent me 
a message saying: 
“I just had a meeting with Donna …” 
Donna referring to Ms Maluleke. 
“…for two hours.  This is really disappointing …” 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 165 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Let me try - I am sorry.  Let me try and 
see where you are?  Are you at 5-3-2? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  5-3-2 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about on the page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Halfway - halfway through the page.  The - 
the - you will see the time stamp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Yes.  I see. 
“I just had a meeting with Donna.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Yes.  Continue. 
MS SAMBO:  “This is really disappointing and discouraging.  
Let us meet when you are free.  (African word).” 
Meaning I will hear from you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then can we go to the message that you 
were going to read?  The - the one at 944. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  So it says: 
“I want to tell you …” 
20 
That is the second sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one at 21:44? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At 21:44. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo, can I ask that you read the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 166 of 180 
 
whole message into the record.  It is just that we … 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Because you have provided these messages 
… 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To the Commission quite late. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  They are not part of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO: 
 
Okay. 
 
This 
is 
a 
message 
that 
came 
from 
10 
Ms Nomsa Memela.  So she said meaning so Donna said - Ms Maluleke 
said. 
“By the time you got to her …” 
Meaning Ms Maluleke. 
“…you were ready to show her the information that 
…” 
I was ready to show Ms Maluleke the information. 
“…which made her uncomfortable …” 
Her - yes.  I will - I will just say once now that is Ms Maluleke. 
“…uncomfortable 
because 
she 
started 
asking 
20 
herself if you had shown it to someone else.” 
She is referring to the emails that Ms Memela emailed to me. 
“You were even contemplating to call City Press to 
give them the info.  Now my sister all I want to 
know is when did this become about me?  When did 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 167 of 180 
 
I become your sudden enemy?  Apparently you said 
to her I am the one who forced you to not work with 
AAR.  I was on speed dial, because every decision 
you took it was my advice.  Hibo.  I was really 
shocked.  All I ever did for you was to help.  Even 
the info that you are using now was sent to you in 
good faith to help you.  Even before that when you 
wanted price info for Cheryl.  I gave that to you …” 
Can I say something about that? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Just get to the end of the sentence and then 
10 
… 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
“I - I gave that to you as I never thought you would 
one day plan to use it against me.” 
Here I believe she is referring to the USB that on her notice 
on the response on the Notice 3.3 she denies to giving me, but on the 
SMS she agrees. 
“Even when you asked about the fuel info - the fuel 
in you …” 
I think it was: 
20 
“…the fuel - if you were in the waiting list I took a 
photo for you and sent it to you on WhatsApp.  Now 
how did this change and be about me?  I want you 
to be - to believe honest with me and tell me when 
did I ever wronged you to an extent that you will 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207

vouch to destroy my career.  What did I promise 
you?  Was I not the one who kept on asking you to 
have a contract with AAR and you promised me that 
your lawyer was working on it?  I even offered to do 
it for free.  Is - is the fact that AAR also started 
working with Bongani and Rafique also my fault.  
Did I introduce them as well to AAR?  My sister I 
feel so betrayed right now.  My willingness to want 
to help you as my Black sister is turning on me now.  
I remember when I was questioned by the accused - 
10 
when I was questioned by the auditors, because I 
was fighting for you to get business at SAAT and 
they accused me of having personal interests 
because everywhere I went I mentioned your 
company.  I want to tell you - I want to - I want you 
to tell me why is this now my fault.  I had to tell the 
CEO, Yakhe and Princess, because as much as you 
would think you destroying me.  They will also get 
affected.” 
You want me to reads? 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If you just pause … 
MS SAMBO:  (Indistinct). 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Pause there and explain that last message, 
because I think that was the message that you wanted to refer to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 169 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That was the portion that you wanted to 
refer to. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  This - I wanted to prove that Ms Memela indicates 
that I am lying on her response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS SAMBO:  On the Notice 3.3 she denies having worked with 
Ms Kwinana, the CEO and Ms Princess Tshabalala and I just wanted to 
give this as evidence from her text message to me.  To prove that I am 
correct in my statement. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  Please continue from where you left 
10 
off. 
MS SAMBO:  “They also want a meeting with you.  Maybe you 
will be able to tell them why is this all my fault now.  
What kills me is even if you would have gone to the 
Hawks or City Press I would have defended you.  I 
would not even had suspected you.  How do I trust 
you now going forward, because you were laughing 
with me and I only find out now that you see me as 
an enemy that should be destroyed?  I broke all the 
rules for you Sibo.  I brought you in for - at the - at 
20 
Lawrence office for you to prepare for logistics.  I 
demanded (indistinct) to make sure (indistinct) be 
your partner.  I was accused of eating from your 
pocket, because I was preaching to everyone who 
cared to listen that you deserve to be on top of the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 170 of 180 
 
list.  How did it get to this where you see me as 
your enemy?  (African word) I would not worry if 
this was just about me, but many people were 
involved in this who have no idea what you are 
planning.  I told you about Sis D that she wanted 
me to help A J Walters to win, but I could not and 
now I am an enemy.  I understand her, but you it is 
a pill that I find difficult to swallow.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I pause you there Ms Sambo? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Who is Sis D? 
MS SAMBO:  At the time of the message I believed that Ms D - she was 
referring to Ms Dudu Myeni. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what is the reference to Ms Myeni want 
you to help A J Walters to win? 
MS SAMBO:  No.  She was telling me that Ms Dudu Myeni wanted her 
to assist A J Walters also. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and what is that a reference to? 
MS SAMBO:  Meaning?  Sorry.  Maybe I do not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words … 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What is she …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know what Ms Memela was supposed to help 
A J Walters to get or to win?  Was it a tender? 
MS SAMBO:  Oh.  It is the components bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same one that …? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 171 of 180 
 
MS SAMBO:  The same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same one that you are talking about? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  The components bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Please go on. 
MS SAMBO:  “I understand, but you is a pill that I find 
difficult to swallow.  I did not hide anything to you.  
I was very transparent with you, but our meeting at 
10 
night I did not have all the information at that time.  
Let me know if I should call all of them in this 
meeting or you will talk to me.  Just imagine if 
Lauren were to spill the beans about giving us that 
money we shared.  How would you feel about that?  
Imagine if Musa were to tell all that you called him 
to meet at the garage and you asked him the prices 
for the components.  Yes.  He was disappointed, but 
he kept it to himself.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I pause you there Ms - Ms Sambo? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What is the reference to? 
“If - imagine if Lauren were to spill the beans about 
giving us that money we shared.” 
MS SAMBO:  Lauren - I think she meant a lady called Lorraine Pillay.  
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 172 of 180 
 
You remember I indicated earlier in my statement that they asked me 
Ms Memela and Ms Yakhe Kwinana asked me if I know anybody on the 
logistics side.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang - hang on.  Is she not going to implicate people 
who might not have been given 3.3 Notices? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us not do that.  If she needs to come back 
later.  Let those people be given notices first. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  If there is something she wants to still 
10 
read that does not implicate people who have not been - who have not 
been given 3.3 Notices.  That is fine, but … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, the - the other references in the - in 
the WhatsApp’s that I was going to take you to would involve some 
level of implication for others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So - so we will - we will save that for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Another time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sambo you understand why I am not allowing you 
to proceed? 
MS SAMBO:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because as I understand the position you gave 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 173 of 180 
 
these emails to the Commissions Legal Team late … 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they would not have notified people who might be 
implicated in this email exchange or in these emails. 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That their names would be mentioned in your 
evidence in these circumstances and that should be done first before 
we get - we get there.  So you might be asked to come back at a later 
stage. 
MS SAMBO:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS SAMBO:  Understood. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, the last aspect is the Facebook 
photos that we have tried repeatedly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To - to get into an acceptable form.  If I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If I could hand this up.  What we have 
managed to do Chair is to take the blown up versions and paginate 
them in accordance with Ms Sambo’s bundle to be inserted at the back.  
20 
It was not possible unfortunately for us to simply insert them where 
Ms Sambo’s photographs were, because the - the enlargement affected 
the - the pagination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the pagination which appears here belongs to 
this bundle? 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 174 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It belongs to this bundle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ms Sambo, can I ask you in that - the - 
those pages you have just been handed? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you go to page 5-6-8? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Are these the photographs that you 
downloaded after Ms Memela went on the delegation? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can you read what her post is together 
with those photographs? 
MS SAMBO:  “We about to be jetted to Indiana Police inside 
the jet.  The airhostess serving us with one of our 
pilots.  Map behind me of where we were and food 
that we were served.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then if you can turn to page 5-70 and if 
you can read that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I take it that - that there is some significance in 
these photos?  Some - there is something important about - about what 
20 
is shown. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair.  In the course of tomorrow’s 
evidence and  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Friday’s evidence one aspect we will 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 175 of 180 
 
traverse is whether the gifts and gratuity that was obtained on this trip 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Was permissible in terms of the South 
African Airways Policies at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in relation to this witness is - is there something 
important? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, we can deal with it with the next 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The reason we are dealing it with - with 
Ms Sambo is because she downloaded the photographs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she mentioned them? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she confirms that she downloaded them that 
might be enough. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is probably enough.  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You - you confirm that? 
MS SAMBO:  Yes.  I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that is pages 5-5-8 to 5-7-3?  Is that right? 
20 
MS SAMBO:  I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair that - that concludes my questions for 
Ms Sambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 176 of 180 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  There - there is something that Ms Hofmeyr 
needs to communicate just to conclude the proceedings very briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but nothing to do with the witness? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Nothing to do with the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Ms Sambo, thank you very much for 
coming to give evidence.  We appreciate it. 
MS SAMBO:  It is my pleasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You probably will be called to come back and deal 
with the matters that are dealt with in some of the emails that could not 
be dealt with, because relevant people have not been given notice yet 
10 
… 
MS SAMBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But thank you very much and you are excused. 
MS SAMBO:  It is a pleasure.  Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, just in the moments 
break there between the questioning and your excusing of Ms Sambo.  
Her legal representatives have indicated to me that there are two 
matters that they would like to clarify in re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I wonder if you would like to do that before I 
deal with the procedural matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if she is going to come back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe they should re-examine when she comes back 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 177 of 180 
 
and she has finished everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather than do it in piecemeal.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you for that direction Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I am - I am taking a moment simply 
because at 3:53 this afternoon … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Secretariat received a - a communication 
from Ms Memela that she has requested be brought to the attention of 
the Commission.  I would like in fairness to her simply to read it in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then to make one or two submissions from 
the legal team in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Memela has written to the Secretariat to say 
the following: 
“Dear Secretary and the Legal Team, I have just 
20 
learned that it was announced on today’s hearing 
that I will be appearing on the Commission on 
Friday.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “I confirm that I have only received 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 178 of 180 
 
summons on 3 February 2020 and I did write to the 
investigating team that I will be meeting my lawyer 
to respond to the summons regarding appearing on 
the Commission.  As I strongly believe that I am not 
the relevant person to appear especially on the 
matters listed in the summons.  They were the 
decisions of the Board.  I have since written a 
statement addressing those items and I have never 
agreed to appear …” 
Apologies.  That is what happens when you are working with 
10 
a screen that you do not touch all the time.  She says: 
“I have since written a statement addressing those 
items and I have never agreed to appear on the 7 t h 
as it was announced today on TV.  I have made an 
application to cross-examine Ms Sambo and I will 
still 
make 
an 
application 
to 
cross-examine 
Mr Human when I respond to the Rule 3.3 Notice.” 
That she received in respect of him. 
“I therefore request that such announcement be 
corrected until my lawyer responds to the summons.  
20 
I hope you find the above in order.” 
Chair, so the request was that it be communicated.  It has 
been communicated.  Chair, our submissions are as follows:  we submit 
that Ms Memela’s failure to agree to appear is irrelevant.  Ms Memela 
has been served with a summons and it is a criminal offence under the 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 179 of 180 
 
Commission’s Act not to appear after having been served with the 
summons from this Commission. 
We will of course take into account any representations that 
she provides to the Commission and - and address them before you.  
Probably if we only receive it tomorrow at the commencement of - of 
Friday’s hearing and it is our proposal that Ms Memela appear on 
Friday to deal with any application that she wishes to bring in relation 
to that summons so that it can be properly ventilated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if she has been served with a summons that says 
she must appear before the Commission on Friday.  Then she is obliged 
10 
to appear before … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Commission on Friday unless she has good 
cause not to do so.  In which case she cannot just stay at home.  She 
needs to take steps and I am sure her legal representatives will advise 
her what - what to do if she has good cause not to appear and she will 
put up her application to achieve a result in terms of which she would 
not be required to appear on Friday, but until the summons is withdrawn 
or set aside it would remain as obligatory on her to - to appear or to 
initiate proceedings that would ensure that she does not commit an - an 
20 
offence on Friday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  She - she is not represented.  None of the 
lawyers here represent her? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not as I have it today.  No. 
05 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 207 
 
Page 180 of 180 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  No.  That is - that is fine.  Okay.  We - 
we are going to adjourn then and tomorrow we will start at 10 o’ clock. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 6 FEBRUARY 2020
