PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 12 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning 
everybody.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Chairperson the first 
business of the day is Mr Gigaba and his Counsel are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think it was indicated yesterday that 
the hearing of his evidence would be postponed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I assume you want to set a date or 
address him and his Counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I assume you have briefed them – his 
legal team about the – the discussion yesterday in their 
absence? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I think they are aware of the 
discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are aware of it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I had a brief discussion with Mr 
20 
Solomons I cannot say that I acquired – it was very lengthy 
I hope I conveyed to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That Mr Gigaba would not be giving 
evidence today. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 4 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that he will be setting another 
date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  We have taken longer with 
previous witnesses than was anticipated and we are now 
on Friday having had – having heard only two witnesses Mr 
Myburgh is that right from Monday?  We have had only two 
witnesses? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because I – I think that is correct.  It 
seems like a lot more but it has only been two yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so the – we find ourselves at the end 
of the week with more witnesses who were scheduled to 
give evidence this week.  We had a discussion in your 
absence yesterday with regard to what should happen 
whether it should be Mr Gigaba who would take the witness 
stand this morning or Mr Singh and it seems that we should 
that 
Mr 
Singh 
take 
the 
witness 
stand 
this 
morning 
particularly because we are aware that there are some new 
developments which Mr Gigaba might wish to have time to 
look at so that when he takes the witness stand he can 
20 
deal with all matters including recent ones. 
 
So – but I said arrangements should be made for 
you to be here this morning so that we should not just 
discuss in your absence and finalise things and we should 
hear if you have anything to say but that is what we 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 5 of 145 
 
propose to do. 
 
Counsel for Mr Gigaba would you like to say 
something?  You can speak from where you are if your 
microphone is working and that is convenient otherwise 
you can go to the podium after they have sanitised. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  Chair we could – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  First good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning to you. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  Yes, no the only thing we would like 
10 
to add is we appreciate we will not be heard today – this 
session he had kept himself available this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  We are not sure what the new 
developments are but we – we trust we will be timeously 
advised of – of these new developments so that we can 
respond in terms of 3.3 if necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  3.3.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  And – and then also we had received 
kindly from evidence leader Myburgh SC an email on the 
3 r d of March which set out fairly the areas that he intended 
to cover and the material that we would need to apply our 
minds 
to 
in 
order 
to 
prepare 
Mr 
Gigaba 
for 
that 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 6 of 145 
 
examination which we have obviously done. 
 
 
If there is material to be covered on the next 
occasion we would kindly ask that he then communicate 
with us in writing as to what these other areas are so that 
we can proper prepare and then whenever Mr Gigaba is 
then to be expected if those dates could be arranged with 
myself and my junior Advocate Gumbi within reason I mean 
we are not – but within reason I mean we are not going to 
– to – the commission has got its work to do within reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  That is all I have to say.  Thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine.  I said developments 
maybe that is not the right term but Mr Myburgh would 
share with you what I am talking about.  Maybe it is just a 
matter not a development.  But thank you for your 
cooperation we – I appreciate that it is not the best 
arrangement where you wait for a whole week you have a 
legal team ready and then you are not able to be heard.  
But obviously we are just trying to do the best we can in a 
20 
very difficult situation where there are very serious time 
constraints.  So we – we appreciate your cooperation. We 
are going to fix a date soon.  The approach we adopt is 
that if we are going to fix a date that we think is within a 
short space of time we will – the legal team will negotiate 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 7 of 145 
 
those dates but if we think we are giving you reasonable 
time we will just fix the dates.  But I have no doubt that all 
attempts will be done by everybody to try and make things 
happen.  Thank you for your understanding. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  No thank you Chair and we 
appreciate the work the commission does and we continue 
to offer our cooperation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Okay.  To the 
extent that you may need to be excused you are excused. 
MR SOLOMONS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson the next order of the 
day is the evidence of Mr Singh.  Might I just say this?  On 
Wednesday we received a short supplementary affidavit 
from Mr Singh but it included over 400 pages of annexures 
pleadings in a series of civil claims.  Yesterday we 
received a 70 page supplementary affidavit from Mr Singh.  
We also received three emails that may impact upon the 
proceedings today.  And then this morning we received 
another 30 page supplementary affidavit from Mr Singh 
20 
together with what I understand is an expert report. 
 
Now we need to make our position very clear we are 
not objecting to this in fact up until today and I hope it 
continues we have had a very constructive relationship 
with Mr Singh and his legal advisors for which we are 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 8 of 145 
 
thankful.  But you will appreciate Chair that we need to 
consider 
this 
new 
material 
simply 
with 
a 
view 
to 
determining what should be left out today and what should 
be dealt with next time.  We hope that that is something 
that we can do in half hour or an hour but I think it would – 
it would be appropriate if we could be afforded that time 
otherwise I might start dealing with issues that give rise to 
objections and we go around and around the mulberry bush 
I am very sorry to ask but if we could have maybe a half an 
hour adjournment I think it probably speed up things. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think that is fine.  I am sure they 
have no problem ja – we are at about twelve minutes to ten 
shall we make it half past ten – half past ten? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry.  Ja half past ten.  Okay.  
Okay we will adjourn until half past ten. We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that help Mr Myburgh. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, Mr Singh is legally 
represented.  I wonder whether you would like his counsel 
to place herself on record before we proceed further? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 9 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Anneline van den Heever.  I 
represent Mr Singh on instructions of Mr Tshepo Mathopo 
of Mathopo Attorneys.  He is sitting next to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think administer the oath, registrar, or 
affirmation.   
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Anoj Singh. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   No, Ma’am. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
WITNESS:   I do. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 10 of 145 
 
ANOJ SINGH:  (d.s.s) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You may be seated 
Mr Singh. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
further 
to 
our 
discussions.  What we have decided is that for the 
purposes of today’s evidence, we will ring fence and not 
deal 
with 
the 
acquisition 
of 
the 
locomotives. 
 
The 
relocation of the OEM’s, the issues in relation to the 
transaction 
advisors 
and 
consultancy 
contract 
but 
effectively 
we 
ring 
fence 
everything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
10 
locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is also, Chairperson, an 
agreement that – and we will not refer to certain limited 
documentation and that we will not refer to one or two 
specific affidavits.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we then intend to deal with 
today is, of course, something to that three topics relating 
to Mr Singh’s personal circumstances.  We will explore any 
20 
relationship that he might have had with the Gupta’s.  We 
intend to deal with Witness 3, the driver.  We intend to deal 
with certain contextual topics, like, the MDS, BADC and the 
Delegation of Authority. 
 
Then we will leave out the locomotives and we 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 11 of 145 
 
will then to auxiliary things, like for example, the Neotel 
contracts, the Manganese Expansion Project, Mr Gama’s 
legal fees, Abalozi and that sort of thing but you are not 
going to be hearing anything about the locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  That will be 
dealt with at some other time? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, once we have had an 
opportunity to look through the affidavit and then we will 
come and deal with that specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry to interrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I have indicated to Mr Myburgh 
that my client does not intend to do any opening statement.  
He does, however, a remark that he wish to make before 
the proceedings commence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And the remark will not implicate 
anybody? 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, it does not implicate 
anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay alright. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, is this the right time for him 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 12 of 145 
 
to do that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have discussed this with my 
learned friend.  I am satisfied that he does not intend to 
implicate anyone.  So we are happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Subject to your direction for him to 
do that now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  So the remark 
relates to me, like, to make an opening statement.  We are 
10 
in possession of the Chairman’s ruling in this regard and 
given the fact that we need to comply with your ruling, we 
have not been in a position to submit the opening 
statement to you as required in the ruling.  We would, 
however, like to place on record that we would like to make 
certain 
comments 
at 
an 
appropriate 
time 
during 
the 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me make sure I follow that.  You 
would like to make some statement at some stage during 
the proceeding? 
20 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not today? 
MR SINGH:   Not today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Some stage? 
MR SINGH:   At some stage. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 13 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay after I have been given the 
documents? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.  Okay. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chairperson.  
Chairperson, 
Mr 
Singh’s 
various 
affidavits 
appear 
in 
Transnet Bundle 5(b) and it is marked Exhibit BB-23.  
There are a series of four affidavits in that bundle which I 
would ask you to admit and I will deal with each of them in 
turn.  Mr Singh, could you please ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  Registrar.  Yes, 
Mr Myburgh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   There is file that I need which apparently 
is not here but that is not a file that you would have known 
about.  I am sure there is another one but I just want one 
on which I have worked which will be much more... to look 
at that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we can proceed in the meantime.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh,

been 
deposed 
to

467.  Would you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   I do so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And would you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of this affidavit? 
MR SINGH:   I do so sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, may I ask you to admit 
10 
Mr Singh’s affidavit that commences at page 436 as Exhibit 
23.3.1?

MARKED AS EXHIBIT 23.3.1 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Just a point of correction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   The date is 2021 and not 2020 
as Mr Myburgh indicated. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay what is the correct date? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 15 of 145 
 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
The 
correct

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no.  That is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, if you can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on.  Oh, I think there are 
two affidavits following each other. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I will come to the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, could I ask you, please, to 
turn now to page 469? 
MR SINGH:   I am there sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There you will find another affidavit 
that runs from 469 through to 484. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it appears at 484 and hopefully I 
will get the year right this time.  It was deposed to on the 
2 n d of February 2021.  Do you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir.

accuracy of this affidavit?

the supplementary affidavit commences.  It is relatively 
short.  It runs up until 1051. 
MR SINGH:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It contains a large number of 
annexures, pleadings in a number of cases.  Those 
annexures run all the way up to 1430.  Can I ask you to

20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon.  It is in fact 1506.

FURTHER SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT OF ANOJ SINGH 
10 
IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB-23.7 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Singh, I would like to 
just start out by asking you one or two questions about 
your personal details.  Am I understanding correct that you 
were the acting CFO of Transnet for a period of time? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   2009 to 2012? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you were then appointed as the 
CFO of Transnet, as I understand, on the 1 s t of July 2012.  
20 
Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you then continued in that 
position until you moved to Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 19 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When was that move? 
MR SINGH:   On the 1 s t of August 2015. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you initially seconded to 
Eskom? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that secondment took up or took 
place on the 1 s t of August 2015? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As we understand it, Mr Molefe’s 
secondment to Eskom preceded yours by three or four 
10 
months.  Does that accord with your recollection? 
MR SINGH:   I am not exactly sure of the number of months 
but he preceded mine. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
And 
prior 
to 
Mr 
Molefe’s 
secondment, I take it that you then reported to him in his 
position as the Group Chief Executive? 
MR SINGH:   Of Transnet, that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And after he was seconded to Eskom before 
you were seconded, you reported for that short period of 
20 
time to Mr Gama? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Singh, what are your qualifications? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I hold a Bachelor of Accounting 
Degree from the University of Durban Westville at the time.  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 20 of 145 
 
I also hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting from the 
same said university ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Speak up a bit Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, I am sorry sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I am sorry.  Mr Singh, one other 
thing.  Perhaps I should have told you before.  I will ask 
you the questions, if you can direct your answers to the 
Chairperson? 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is more important for him to hear 
than me and I am sitting closer to you. 
MR SINGH:   That is right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So let us start again.  Your 
qualifications? 
MR SINGH:   So I hold a Bachelor of Accounting Degree 
from the University of Durban Westville at the time.  I also 
hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Accountancy from the same 
said university.  And I was for a period of time admitted as 
a Chartered Accountant at South African Institute of 
20 
Chartered Accountants until, I think, December 2010(?) or 
so. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 And 
so 
just 
from 
a 
broad 
perspective.  What is that you did before you took up the 
position as CFO of Transnet or acting CFO of Transnet in 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 21 of 145 
 
2009? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chairman, I was – post obtaining my 
degrees at the University of Durban Westville, I served a 
traineeship with B Origin Technology(?) for a period of 
three years.  I stayed with the firm, thought, for around 
four years.  Post that, I took up a position with the Spar 
Group in KZN until 2002.  In 2003, I relocated to 
Johannesburg and took up a position with the then 
Spoornet which was, obviously, a division of Transnet as a 
Senior 
Manager 
or 
a 
position 
as 
Senior 
Manager, 
10 
Corporate Financial Services.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just one other introductory point.  
Are you in a position to be able to confirm that after you 
moved to Eskom, your successor was Mr Pita as the CFO? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could we turn to the topic of your 
relationship, if any, with the Gupta’s.  Could I ask you, 
have you ever had an occasion to go to the Saxonwold 
residence of the Gupta’s? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I did on occasion had opportunity to 
20 
go to the Gupta residence.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And when you say on occasion.  How 
many occasions? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the reasons for my visit to the 
Gupta residence was based on culture reasons.  There 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 22 of 145 
 
were religious functions that were held.  In the Indian 
community, you are normally invited to these functions and 
based on my availability, I would on occasion... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, the first question I asked 
you is.  On how many occasions did you go to the Gupta 
residence? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would have to hazard a very, very 
wild guess and I would think that it is probably, I think less 
than ten times.  Probably less than ten. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I am sorry.  Perhaps I did not get 
10 
the first part of your answer.  I recall you saying you attend 
religious functions.  I think you mentioned that you also 
had occasion to go there for other reasons? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Cultural. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, I beg your pardon.  Culture. 
MR SINGH:   Culture and religious. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Religious.  Oh, yes, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Cultural and religious...  So those – 
that was the cause of you going to the Gupta residence 
20 
and you say you estimate about ten times? 
MR SINGH:   Ten times would be the maximum.  It is 
probably less.  Between five and ten.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And over what period ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Over what period?   
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 23 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we are asking the same question, 
ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over what period? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, my first interactions with the Gupta 
family would have been as a result of attendance to the 
TNA Breakfast which Transnet would have sponsored.  So I 
assume it would be that period of time which probably 
would have been around 2011/2012... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   In terms of timing.  And then I would assume 
infrequently in between from that period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   My association was not very intimate.  I 
mean, for example, I did not...  Sorry sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, was not? 
MR SINGH:   Very intimate with the family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   I knew them.  I knew of them.  My...  For 
20 
example, I did not attend the wedding, for example.  The 
Gupta wedding or the Sun City wedding.  So from that 
perspective I did not see any need for me to... myself with 
them or for them to do the same with me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you started going there in 2011 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 24 of 145 
 
or 2012? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir.  My association with them? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   The first time I met them was as a result of 
the TNA Breakfast which I would assume started around... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you continued to go there 
occasionally.  Up until when? 
MR SINGH:   I would again hazard to give you a guess.  I 
would say probably 2015 or so, 2016 or so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what caused you to stop going 
10 
there in 2015 or so? 
MR SINGH:   At that point in time, there were all of these 
allegations and all of these media speculation relating to 
the family at the time and not that I believe that any of the 
speculation or issues relating to our relationship between 
mine and theirs is irregular but I just thought at that point 
in time it would be prudent to not visit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now did you have occasion to 
reciprocate?  Did you ever invite the Gupta’s out for dinner 
or to your house or was it only you going to theirs? 
20 
MR SINGH:   No, sir, I did not invite the Gupta’s to my 
house. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And which member of the Gupta 
family would you interact with on these occasions that you 
attended the Saxonwold residence? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 25 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the religious functions were 
attended by a number of people and this is normally the 
case.  So I had occasion to meet Mr Athol Gupta, 
Mr Rajesh Gupta,  Mr AJ Gupta as well, not... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And let me then turn to...  Well, 
perhaps I could just ask you.  These cultural and religious 
functions that you attended, would they typically be after 
hours, on the weekends?  Obviously, on any particular 
religious day. 
MR SINGH:   Well, the ones that come to mind is obviously 
10 
the 
Diwali 
functions 
and 
the 
Diwali 
function 
would 
depending on when the occasion of Diwali would fall in 
the...   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Did you, Mr Singh, have 
occasion to visit the offices of Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I did have occasion to visit the – 
not enter into the offices of Sahara but I certainly knew 
where Sahara Computers was.  I did visit the – how can I 
say – the entrance of the office in that my current wife 
used to work for Sahara.  So on occasion, I used to either 
20 
pick her up... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you say your current wife worked 
at Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   For what period of time was that? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 26 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   I would think that it would have been 
sometime in 2014 or so, I think that she would have started 
there or 2013.  I am not too sure of the date.  And then, 
she left, I think in 2015. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
So 
she 
worked 
there 
for 
approximately a year? 
MR SINGH:   A year and a half or so if not two. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And just so that I understand your 
evidence.  Do I understand that you would go there to fetch 
her.  I mean, you say you did not go into the office. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, I would go to fetch her or I would drop 
her off. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  So you never, if I understand 
your evidence correctly, you never entered the offices of 
Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then Mr Essa.  Did you have 
occasion to meet him? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I met Mr Essa on probably one or 
two occasions at his request and it was for the purposes of 
20 
just 
having 
a 
discussion 
associated 
with 
business 
opportunities that he may have had in relation to Transnet 
but it was of no interest to either of us and that was the 
end of that relationship. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So where did you meet with Mr Essa 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 27 of 145 
 
on these one or two occasions? 
MR SINGH:   I do not – because it was a relatively long 
time ago.  So I do not remember exactly where but it would 
have – it was certainly not at the Transnet offices.  So it 
would have been an outside venue.  I am not sure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps Melrose Arch? 
MR SINGH:   It may have been. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say that these one or two 
meetings occurred at Mr Essa’s request? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To discuss, if I my note of your 
evidence is right, business opportunities at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now what sort of things did you 
discuss there with Mr Essa during these one or two 
meetings? 
MR SINGH:   At that time, I think he – I am not too sure 
what the exact details of those discussions were but as I 
said, Mr Chair, the discussion actually never went any 
further than those one or two meetings.  So I did not really 
20 
pay any attention to any issues that emanated from these 
meetings. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But can you not recall the topic or 
content of the meetings? 
MR SINGH:   If I recall correctly, Mr Chair, it would have 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 28 of 145 
 
been what Mr Essa would have been involved in at the time 
and how he would have probably in wanting to provide 
services to Transnet...  And I can only conclude that given 
the fact that he was not actually involved in much Transnet 
related 
business 
at 
the 
time, 
we 
never 
pursue 
the 
discussions any further. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
So 
what 
business 
did 
you 
understand Mr Essa to be involved in? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, at that time, I think he was looking 
at opportunities in oil and gas if I recall correctly.  
10 
Opportunities in terms of being able to supply same to 
Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what company did Mr Essa 
purport to work for or represent? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not recall those details. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I would like now, please, to take you 
to the evidence of Witness 3.  If I could ask you, please 
Mr Singh, to turn behind you and to pull out Bundle BB-
14(d). 
MR SINGH:   You said little D? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry, you said little D? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   BB-14(d). 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if I could ask you, please, to 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 29 of 145 
 
turn up page 122? 
MR SINGH:   Are you doing the red numbers, sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think there is only one number.  Ja, 
if it – there is only one number.  So I think I have referred 
to the red ones here, yes. 
MR SINGH:   122? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   122. 
MR SINGH:   I am there sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Singh, no doubt you had 
careful regard to this affidavit and the evidence of Witness 
10 
3? 
MR SINGH:   I have sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the affidavit deals - has two 
parts to it.  Firstly, it deals with Mr Gigaba and the CPO 
services rendered to him and then in the second part if I 
could ask you to go to page 127, it deals with the CPO 
services rendered to you and that runs from page 127 
through to 132, five pages or so. 
MR SINGH:   I note that, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now perhaps before I take you to the 
20 
content of this affidavit and we may go through it on a 
paragraph 
by 
paragraph 
basis, 
what 
is 
your 
overall 
response to the evidence of witness 3? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, when we first heard of witness 3 it 
was actually via the media, so the Commission was not 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 30 of 145 
 
gracious enough to advise us in advance that witness 3 
was going to testify in this matter so we were relatively 
perplexed by his evidence and concerned by his evidence 
given the inferences and the allegations that he levied 
against us, against me. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, but my question was, what is your 
overall response to the content of his evidence? 
MR SINGH:   In dealing with the fact that we were 
relatively concerned – well, not relatively, very concerned 
about the allegations contained in his affidavit.  I studies 
10 
his affidavit quite closely and found that his evidence was 
really not very credible and spurious in nature and hence 
my level of concern was relatively diminished and I also 
had opportunity to have been forewarned about this 
affidavit by witness 3 himself probably, I would say – in 
timing-wise I am not too sure but I think probably six to 
eight months in advance and this had originated in a 
telephone call that I received from witness 3 that basically 
described the fact that he was requested to provide an 
affidavit or provide evidence or testimony regarding his 
20 
activities with me as the CPO or close protection officer 
that he was and he did reference individuals at Transnet 
that 
were 
pressurising 
him 
to 
provide 
this 
type 
of 
information and he also referenced the Commission or the 
investigators of the Commission and so I then asked – I 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 31 of 145 
 
said so, witness 3, what type of information are they 
looking for?  And he then did not directly reference the 
visits or the alleged visits, all he said was you know what 
information they are looking for.  And I then said okay – 
sorry, again, I said witness 3, but that is of no issue or 
concern, you are employed by Transnet, if there is an 
official request that Transnet is making of you, you should 
comply and again, the Commission is a legally constituted 
body, if there is a need for you to provide any information  
please do so and, at the end of the day, whatever 
10 
information that you provide to them, as far as it relates to 
our activities, you and I both know that the information 
they seek does not exist because I have never taken you 
and if I had gone there on my personal account, it has got 
nothing to do with you, so please provide whatever 
information you are required to do so.  And he then said  - 
he sought assurance from me if that was really what I 
wanted him to do and I said yes, please proceed.  He said 
listen, they are looking for log books, they are looking for 
the information from his cell phone , they are looking for 
20 
information from, you know, car tracking system and again 
I said, witness 3, to the extent that that information exists, 
please provide it to the Commission or to Transnet 
because you are under an obligation to do so and if it is 
that there are issues that emanate there from for me, I 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 32 of 145 
 
have the obligation to deal with that, not you.  So that was 
the context behind me also being perplexed by the affidavit 
that I then was provided with from the Commission in that 
the discussion that – the telephonic discussion that I had 
with witness 3 vis-à-vis the affidavit that was then provided 
was completely – how can I say, completely different, so – 
but that is the context behind which I viewed the witness 3 
affidavit. 
 
In addition to that, Mr Chair, the reason why I 
believe that witness 3’s affidavit and testimony is a 
10 
complete fabrication, there are no objective facts that he 
actually relies on to be able to make the allegations he 
does.   
 
Conveniently, there are no log books, when patently 
from witness 1’s testimony there was a requirement to 
maintain log books.  Mr Chair, log books cannot be 
dismissed as a mere piece of paper.  Mr – I am sorry, 
witness 3, did not report to me within the Transnet 
structure, he reported into the general manager of Group 
Security.  So these log books and time sheets and all of 
20 
these administrative pieces of paper would have been 
required for witness 3 to justify any claims of overtime, any 
claims of working over the weekend, any issues relating to 
incidents 
that 
may 
have 
happened 
with 
the 
official 
Transnet vehicle, so it is very curious for me to understand 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 33 of 145 
 
that these documents actually do not exist because they 
had to exist.  Transnet was subject to internal and external 
audit 
processes, 
these 
documents 
must 
have 
been 
reviewed, they must have been filed somewhere.  In 
comparison, witness 1 was very diligent in keeping this 
document.  So that is relating to the log books. 
 
Mr Chair, if you look at one occasion that he 
describes, 
he 
describes 
an 
occasion 
where 
I 
was 
summoned to the Gupta residence, or he alleges that I was 
summoned to the Gupta residence, via a telephone call 
10 
that I received.  According to him, I visit the residence, I 
am there for about an hour or so, I think, according to his 
affidavit, I come out and I am irate and I use certain 
vulgarities and he then proceeds to drive me home  But 
curiously Saxonwold to my home is probably less than 10 
kilometres and in being in this irate state he then says I 
fell asleep in this space of 10 kilometres.  That does not – 
it is inconceivable that I would fall asleep in an irate state 
in a space of less than 10 kilometres. 
 
So, Mr Chair, those are aspects of this affidavit that 
20 
was issue for me.  In addition to the actual studying of the 
affidavit itself, we had occasion to view the cross-
examination of witness 3, which was led, I think, on 
Monday – I may be incorrect in the day.  But again, under 
cross-examination, Mr Chair, witness 3 did not really – 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 34 of 145 
 
well, did not perform well in that his evidence, I think in my 
view, was completely dispelled. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now, Mr Singh, you filed four affidavits 
in this Commission which the Chairperson has admitted 
and we have another one which is in the process of being 
processed and will be admitted.  Can you point out to me 
where do you deal in the series of affidavits with the 
evidence of witness 3? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we deal with the evidence of 
witness 3 in the latest affidavit that we have commissioned 
10 
this morning. 
ADV MYBURGH:   This morning?  So is that then the first 
time that you have dealt with the evidence of witness 3? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Why did it take so long? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I mentioned originally, we were 
not provided with the affidavit of witness 3 by the 
Commission prior to this testimony.  Subsequent to that we 
did have access to the affidavit at the Commission.  Upon 
analysis of that affidavit my legal team and myself had 
20 
engaged with the Commission on a number of occasions 
trying to obtain the affidavit that was actually admitted into 
evidence on the day that witness 3 actually testified 
because the affidavit that was provided to us was actually 
deposed to post a date on which witness 3 testified. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 35 of 145 
 
 
We also had concern in that the testimony that – or 
the transcripts and the testimony that he had led was in 
some instances inconsistent with the affidavit that we had 
been provided with so we were trying to ascertain which 
version of the truth was actually the truth, was it the 
affidavit 
that 
was 
entered 
into 
the 
records 
of 
the 
Commission, was it his transcripts or was it the affidavit 
that we were actually provided with post the testimony of 
witness 3? 
And, Mr Chair, just for the record, we still have not 
10 
been 
provided 
with 
the 
requested 
document 
or 
an 
explanation as to why this was the case but nonetheless, 
notwithstanding that, we have provided the response to the 
Commission in our very last affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And just to confirm, you were asked to 
respond to the evidence of witness 3 in a Regulation 10.6 
notice dated the 12 November 2020.  Would you confirm 
that? 
MR SINGH:   I do so. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you did so this morning? 
20 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  Now just so we understand this, 
Mr Singh …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, the issue of 
documents that he says have not been provided to them, 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 36 of 145 
 
do you know anything about that, but he says in relation to 
witness 
3 
there 
are 
still 
some 
documents 
that 
the 
Commission has not provided to him. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I think that the issue of witness 3 – I am 
not sure if that is what Mr Singh is saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That he still does not have the 
documents.  Mr Singh? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Mr Singh, did I misunderstand you?  
I though you said in relation to witness 3 there are still 
10 
some documents that you have not been provided with by 
the Commission. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   We still await the affidavit of witness 3 that 
was admitted into the records of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that you say – or that was 
admitted on the date he testified? 
MR SINGH:   He testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Because the affidavit that we were provided 
with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was after. 
MR SINGH:   Was dated after. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 37 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   The date on which he actually provided 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you have been waiting for that 
for quite some time? 
MR SINGH:   Indeed so. 
ADV MYBURGH:   As I understand it, that was subject to a 
moving that you made, Chairperson, in relation to further 
redacting and the like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let – well, sometimes what I know 
and what the legal team knows and what the investigation 
10 
team knows are different things because I am the last one 
to know certain things because of the way the Commission 
works.  The investigators will have information, then that 
information will go the legal team, things will come to me 
only when they are ripe for that but as far as I know, there 
ought to be only one affidavit relating to each one of the 
three witnesses except for any supplementary affidavit that 
may have been provided by anyone to them but the ruling 
of course was to the effect that their affidavits should be 
redacted but I – if it is the same – if it is a redacted 
20 
affidavit of the previous affidavit then there should not be a 
problem and, in any event, somebody should be able to 
explain to Mr Singh’s team, legal team, if the position is 
simply that the affidavit that was given to him had to be 
redone.  It was still the – it was the previous one but 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 38 of 145 
 
maybe had to be redone and deposed to afresh after – for 
purposes 
of 
redaction. 
 
Mr 
Pretorius 
should 
know 
something about that. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, I have a ruling that deals with that.  
Perhaps I can share that with my learned friend during the 
break but to answer your question directly, Chairperson, if 
I could ask you perhaps to turn to bundle 5B, to page 414, 
there you will see at paragraph 1.17 that Mr Singh was 
asked to respond to witness 3’s affidavit dated the 14 
September. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That affidavit was provided and that is 
the affidavit that finds its way into bundle BB14(b) that I 
am questioning him about now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   If there is any other issues in relation to 
that we will sort that out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think it is something that should – 
can 
be 
sorted 
out, 
there 
may 
be 
just 
some 
I 
misunderstanding and maybe your junior might, while you 
20 
are busy, try and get whatever clarification is necessary 
including speaking to the evidence leader at the time, Mr 
Pretorius, and then sharing information with Mr Singh’s 
legal team.  There may be just some I misunderstanding. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Could I please, Mr Singh, just take you 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 39 of 145 
 
back to the evidence that you gave?  Do I understand you 
to have said that witness 3 conveyed to you that he was 
being 
placed 
under 
pressure 
by 
Transnet 
and 
the 
Commission to provide an affidavit?   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, my recollection of the conversation 
was as Mr Myburgh has outlined. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And do I understand your evidence then 
to say or least what you are inferring is that the product of 
this or this affidavit, which you say is false, is the product 
of that pressure?  Is that essentially what you are telling 
10 
us?  Is that how would describe the falsity, on your 
version, of this affidavit? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that would be one of the reasons, 
as I have testified, the conversation and the conclusion 
that witness 3 and I had regarding the discussion was that 
we were of one mind that he needed to comply and there 
would be no issues because the factual nature of the 
allegations did not exist and that was the conclusion of the 
conversation, is he never took me to the residence.  So 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your suggestion that to the extent that 
in his affidavit witness 3 talks about taking you to the 
Gupta residence, one, that is false and two, it must be that 
he has given that false evidence because of the pressure 
that he says was brought to bear upon him by Transnet 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 40 of 145 
 
people and Commission people? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So I assume you must then deal with 
that issue of pressure in the affidavit you filed this morning 
when dealing with witness 3? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we do not go into the detail in the 
affidavit relating to the pressure, it was a discussion that 
counsel and I had and we have decided to provide the 
information that we have provided in the affidavit. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes but the nub of your case is the 
pressure which you do not deal then with the nub of your 
case in your affidavit. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of the reasoning behind 
the exclusion from the affidavit is as follows.  Counsel had 
requested 
that 
I 
provide 
the 
details 
of 
the 
alleged 
telephone call.  I am terrible with dates so I do not actually 
remember the dates and the times of these things and 
given the fact that we wanted to be completely and utterly 
factual we thought it best be dealt with in this forum. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   So in your affidavit do you mention 
anything about the telephone call that you had with witness 
3? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you have said you mention nothing 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 41 of 145 
 
about the pressure. 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So then perhaps I can ask you why – 
why did you never make application …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not mention the telephone call 
that you had with witness 3 and you do not mention the 
pressure in your affidavit, may I know what is – whether in 
your affidavit you say what reason witness 3 had to 
10 
effectively falsely implicate you in visits to the Gupta 
residence? 
MR SINGH:   We do deal with that, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You deal with it, ja, but it is different 
from pressure and the telephone call conversation. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we do not allude to the telephone 
conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   The pressure was a discussion that emanated 
from the telephone discussion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So as a result both of those matters do not 
find its way into the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Chairperson, I do not know if you do 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 42 of 145 
 
intend to take a tea adjournment this morning but it does 
strike that perhaps we need to put this affidavit before you 
even informally, it will then be formally introduced at 
lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But it is only a page and a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  I was undecided 
about taking the tea adjournment because we had that 
time. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it fine with everybody if we skip the 
tea adjournment?  Mr Singh, is that fine with you? 
MR SINGH:   No problem with me, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Counsel? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   No problem, Chair, we can go 
ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   So if I could perhaps ask my learned 
friend if she has got another copy of this affidavit that we 
could then hand up to you but on the basis that it would be 
20 
formally introduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In due course. 
ADV MYBURGH:   After lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, if I am just given 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 43 of 145 
 
an opportunity I will see if I can find… 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, ja.   Are we going to 
continue in the meantime or we will wait for – oh, there it 
is.  Registrar …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes, Chairperson, I have got a 
copy for yourself and I have got a copy for the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Chairperson, subject to your direction, 
could we simply refer to this as for present purposes Mr 
Singh’s affidavit, it was deposed to on the 12 March 2021, 
10 
which will be admitted into evidence I would imagine after 
lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I tend to refer him only presently to 
paragraphs 143 to 152, the last two pages of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we can refer to it as the 12 March 
2021 affidavit of Mr Singh, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Thank you, Chair, thank you.  Mr Singh, 
you have a copy? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir, I do. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Before we get to this affidavit of yours, 
can I ask you – I mean, in the light of this telephonic 
discussion that you say you had with witness 3 and the 
assumption that pressure was brought to bear on him, why 
did you not exercise your right to cross-examine witness 3? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 44 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   Sir, again, the discussions between the legal 
team and myself regarding this matter of cross-examination 
was communicated to the Commission and again emanated 
from the. let us call it, I misunderstanding, as you put it, 
Mr Chair, relating to the versions of the affidavit that we 
needed to be able to understand whether we would need to 
cross-examine or not at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So if we have regard then to your 
affidavit – and you will bear with me that I have not studied 
this so perhaps I am doing it for the first time as we go 
10 
through.  So perhaps we could just go through each 
paragraph, it is not very long.  Now paragraph 143: 
“I wish to briefly comment on the evidence of 
witness 3 and the subsequent dated affidavit by 
witness 3 provided to my legal team.” 
And then you say – you deal with this issue of the affidavit 
and the like which you have already addressed, which we 
hope to clarify with your legal representative and you then 
say at 145: 
“I thus comment on the affidavit so provided and the 
20 
evidence hereinafter.” 
146: 
“I deny the allegation contained in his affidavit and 
the evidence he provided the Commission regarding 
my visits to the Gupta residence in Saxonwold with 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 45 of 145 
 
specific reference to paragraphs 37 to 45.  In 
addition to the aforesaid, I deny that allegation that 
he took me to the Knox Vault subsequent to visits to 
the Gupta residence, paragraph 41 to 43.” 
147: 
“I further deny the fact that I collected any money 
from the Gupta residence as alleged by witness 3.” 
148: 
“It is inconceivable that I would expose myself to 
taking cash from a bag “that was stacked with R100 
10 
and R200 notes” from him to buy lunch and thereby 
compromise myself.  Regards the bag received at 
the Three Rivers Lodge, I wish to state again that it 
is inconceivable to suggest that I would in full view 
of a large contingency of Transnet employees meet 
these persons of Asian descent in the conference 
room during working hours thus again compromising 
my integrity and expose myself in such a manner.  
The Commission should note that these breakaway 
sessions 
was attended by a large number 
of 
20 
employees at any given time and had free access to 
the conference room and parking.” 
150: 
“There is no confirmatory affidavit attached to his 
affidavit which can confirm the allegations made by 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 46 of 145 
 
witness 3 such as Molefe’s driver.” 
151: 
“There was nothing sinister in my visit to Sahara 
Computers as I did not attend any meetings as 
alleged by witness 3.” 
And then you say at 152: 
“Lastly I wish to state that witness 3’s performance 
under cross-examination proved that he is not a 
reliable witness and the Commission cannot rely on 
his evidence.” 
10 
That is your response, is it? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like you may have been 
mistaken, Mr Singh, in saying that in the affidavit you do 
give a reason why witness 3 would falsely implicate you in 
these visits.  Of course I am only looking at it as Mr 
Myburgh is reading, I do not know if I have missed 
anything.  Other than denying that what he has said is 
true, I do not seem to have picked up any specific reason 
that you may be advancing why he would fabricate all 
20 
these stories. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair, I may have I misunderstood 
your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Question, yes. 
MR SINGH:   But if that was the question then I do agree 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 47 of 145 
 
with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   That affidavit does not contain that [inaudible 
– speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is alright.  Thank you, Mr 
Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Thank you.  Well, let go then to the 
affidavit of witness 3 and can I take you to page 127 of 
bundle BB14(d).  I want to pick up, Mr Singh, at paragraph 
29, under the heading CPO services to Anoj Singh.  Are 
10 
you there? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, I am. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Witness 3 says: 
“During January 2014 I was a security manager to 
provide security services at Transnet Offices in the 
Carlton Centre.” 
Would you agree with that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair as I testified witness 3 did not 
actually report to me directly.   He reported to the General 
Manager, Group Security and would have then been 
20 
deployed to me, from the Security Department, so the date 
on which he actually would have started at Transnet I 
would not be able to confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 30: 
“After some time, I received a call from witness 1, 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 48 of 145 
 
we informed me that Tolka had assigned me to the 
office of the Group Chief Financial Officer, the 
GCFO to perform driver and CPO duties for Anoj 
Singh, I occupied this position during July 2014” 
You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I confirm that witness 3 did perform 
driver and CPO services for me, I do however, dispute the 
date of July 2014.  My recollection would have been that 
that date would have been closer to around March 2014.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   2014? 
10 
MR SINGH:   2014, the reason therefore, Mr Chair that I 
mentioned is that there was a particular incident that led to 
CPO services being provided to myself, and it was the 
incident related to actually not to me it actually related to 
Mr Brain Molefe at the time, and he was travelling home 
from a meeting which was relatively late in the evening, 
and he had occasion to travel on the N1 and he was 
passing under a bridge, and there was a stone that was 
then thrown onto the car from the bridge above.  
And this obviously perplexed Mr Molefe and the 
20 
next morning, he called me and he said, listen this was the 
incident that happened, and he does not know why this 
happened.  But at the end of the day, he was concerned for 
his and our security, and we were at that point in time 
negotiating the local contracts.  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 49 of 145 
 
And that is why it actually sticks in my mind, and 
that was the reason why witness 3 was then allocated to 
me for security reasons at that time, which followed this 
incident that occurred to Mr Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you have it as him having started 
to provide those services in about March of 2014? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And continued up until when Mr 
Singh? 
MR SINGH:   He would have continued until I – well 
10 
actually I think he continued a month into my secondment 
to Eskom, if I recall correctly. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that takes us into? 
MR SINGH:   Let us say, end of August 2015, give or take. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph 31 witness 3 
says: 
“On a normal working day, I used to pick Singh up 
at his home in the morning at around 6:30 in 
Wendywood and from their driving to the Carlton 
Centre after work I would drop him off at his home 
20 
again.” 
You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At paragraph 32: 
“During the course of the day I would drive him to 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 50 of 145 
 
meetings or to whichever destination he would 
instruct me to, Singh’s personal assistant would 
usually provide me with his meeting schedule for 
the following week on a Friday afternoon.” 
You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would confirm that he did drive me 
to meetings, I am not too sure about the arrangements he 
had with my personal assistant.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 33: 
“It sometimes happened that his meetings lasted 
10 
until late in the evening, which caused me to arrive 
home after 22h00 or even later.” 
Comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair on occasions if we had client 
dinners or the like yes, it would occur. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 34: 
“During the period to which I was assigned as CPO 
for Singh, I can recall that I used the following two 
Transnet vehicles to transport him on official duties 
namely a white Mercedes Benz C220.” 
20 
He gives the registration number. 
“And secondly a white Mercedes Benz E350.” 
And he gives the registration number, do you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   I do, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 35 he says: 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 51 of 145 
 
“I kept logbooks of trips undertaken with the 
aforementioned two vehicles, used logbooks were 
given to witness 1 for safekeeping.” 
You want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair as I mentioned, I think the 
issue of the logbooks is actually quite an important one, 
especially given the context that he raises in at paragraph 
33, given the fact that he admits that he used to work 
overtime.  And the fact that these logbooks do not exist, 
creates a problem for us to be able to verify his version of 
10 
the allegations.  
In addition to that, Mr Chair, I find it strange that 
witness 3 will be very diligent to keep the log books that he 
refers to, but do not or was not able to save that log books 
that were provided to him by witness 3 that relate to 
myself. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then he says a 35.1: 
“I 
have 
subsequently 
attempted 
to 
obtain 
the 
logbooks for these vehicles in order to substantiate 
the trips undertaken for Singh but was informed that 
20 
the logbooks could not be located.” 
You already addressed that. 
MR SINGH:   I think we have addressed that, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “In instances – at paragraph 36, 
Singh  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 52 of 145 
 
would drive to the office with his private vehicle, a 
blue BMW M3 on Monday mornings and on Friday 
afternoons, he would travel home with his vehicle. 
The vehicle would be parked in the basement of the 
Carlton Centre during the week.” 
You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   I confirm that, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Now Singh’s visits to the Gupta  
residence and Knox Vault.” 
What do you know about Knox Vault, what is it? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair it is an organisation or business or 
company that provides vault services. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if we thinking of the same thing 
I see it there opposite the Killarney Mall at the old 
American embassy I think it is. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 37: 
“During the period of performing CPO duties for 
Singh, I transported him to the Gupta residence in 
Saxonwold Drive in Johannesburg on more than 10 
20 
occasions.  None of these meetings were prior 
scheduled or recorded in his diary.” 
Now that you deny. 
MR SINGH:   I deny it, I do deny that, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So do I understand your evidence 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 53 of 145 
 
correctly you say witness 3 never took you to Saxonwold? 
MR SINGH:   No, he did not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Those ten odd occasions or 
approximate ten odd occasions that you went there, would 
my understanding be correct you attend cultural and 
religious functions you would have driven in your own car?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I see that I think in a paragraph 
that Mr Myburgh is still going to come to if I am not wrong, 
that witness 3 when he estimates how many times he took 
10 
you to the Gupta residence and he also refers to ten.  He 
says, he thinks he must – but he says more than ten times, 
you said he must have gone there for cultural/religious 
function maximum ten times, it is just interesting that you 
used ten and he uses ten. 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair if you had to look at the detail 
of witness 3 transcripts, he actually vacillates between 
five, ten, seven, 12, so I would not place any reliance on 
the ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I see he uses six or seven in 
20 
relation to the visits to the Knox Vault but maybe some 
where he also uses another number other than more than 
ten in relation to the visits to the Gupta residence. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is somewhere. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 54 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   In my assessment, I am also taking also from 
his transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   And the responses that his provided in that in 
that testimony itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, of course you also vacillate on 
the number of times you went to the Gupta residence to 
attend - and I do not mean that in a pejorative way, but you 
say five, ten, ten maybe more maybe less. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Well it is over a period of time, so yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, absolutely, at paragraph 38: 
“Upon arrival at the Gupta residence I parked the 
vehicle in the parking area inside the premises and 
I would wait in the vehicle for him to return. The 
meetings usually did not last longer than 20 to 30 
minutes.” 
I take it that all of this is then denied? 
MR SINGH:   I deny those. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   39: 
20 
“After each of the meetings, Singh would usually 
appear from the residence with a sports bag, which 
appear to be full. I suspected that the bags 
contained money, Singh would knock on the boot of 
the vehicle and I would open it from the inside, he 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 55 of 145 
 
would then put the bag in the boot.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I deny the allegations contained in 
paragraph 39 where it relates to the bag, witness 3 fails to 
describe the bags or the colour of the bags or even provide 
any details relating the bag. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Singh how does that help 
you, you say it did not happen at all. 
MR SINGH:   No, no that is why I am saying, that is why I 
am saying it did not happen because it fails to provide any 
10 
evidence and to suggest why it happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would a better description of the 
bag change your defence? 
MR SINGH:   Not it will not but it would at least add some 
credibility in terms of what he was trying to achieve. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, at paragraph 40: 
“My suspicion that the bags that Singh collected 
from the Gupta residence contained money was 
confirmed when on one occasion I opened the bag, 
which he had he had earlier collected from the 
20 
Gupta residence inside the boot of our vehicle to 
give me some money to buy lunch.  He opened the 
bag, when he opened the bag, I could clearly see 
that the bag was stacked with 100 and 200 notes.” 
I think this is something you have dealt with in your 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 56 of 145 
 
affidavit. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, and for the record, I also deny the 
contents of paragraph 40. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   40? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, the one that you just read and again, Mr 
Chair if on witness 3’s version, I was providing money for 
him to buy lunch, which I occasionally did and it was not 
only for him, it was for the office staff.  There was no need 
for me to go and access money from this bag. 
I had access to money from my wallet, I could have 
10 
gone to the ATM, I could had another, a number of 
alternatives to be able to do that.  Why would I access 
money from an alleged bag in his presence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us assume like all of us, well, 
maybe not all of us but some of us there are occasions 
when your wallet does not have enough cash and you need 
to pay for something or to give somebody a certain amount 
and you look at your wallet and it has got too little in it. 
If that was the case and you knew there was a bag 
in the boot that had cash.  Why would you have to drive to 
20 
an ATM instead of using the cash that is in the boot? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again, if I was making the offer to 
him, as he suggests, and it was an offer, it was not an 
obligation, I would not offer if I did not have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but on his version, you had money in 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 57 of 145 
 
the boot, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   I agree Mr Chair but on his version as well he 
suggested that I offered this money for him to buy lunch.  
In my case, I am saying there was no obligation for me to 
offer this lunch, so if I did not have the cash on me, there 
was no need for me to do it or access the money in the 
boot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the cash is in the boot one would - 
assuming his version is correct for purposes of this 
argument.  I do not understand why you would not have 
10 
said oh there is not enough money here and then use the 
money in the boot. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, with all due respect I think the 
version is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no it is one thing to say the version 
is not correct but I thought you were attacking it on the 
basis that this version, you know, has this flaw I would not 
use cash in the boot, I would use cash in my wallet, if I did 
not have enough cash in the wallet or enough cash then I 
would not offer the lunch.  
20 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir, I would not offer it if I did 
not have it in my wallet, I would not offer lunch.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Now, before we get 
to this issue of Knox Vault’s.  Did you have a safety 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 58 of 145 
 
deposit box at Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how many did you have? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that exact number I do not recall, 
but it will probably be four, maybe four to five. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how large were these safety 
deposit boxes that you had four of?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you went presumably and can 
you estimate for us, show us? 
10 
MR SINGH:   There were varying sizes, there were one’s 
that were probably this big…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So would that be say 15 centimetres 
by 40 centimetres, 60 centimetres? 
MR SINGH:   Probably I mean, they were relatively thin, 
this wide. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Please, can you speak close to the 
mic?  
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir they were relatively thin.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  
20 
MR SINGH:   And they were long. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then long, and the other one? 
MR SINGH:   There was also a one that was relatively 
long, but also relatively deep.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there was a bigger one.  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 59 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say relatively long, are we 
talking 90 centimetres a meter? 
MR SINGH:   No, I think the length of the boxes were the 
same is just the depth was bigger. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So how high what was the depth of 
the second box 30 centimetres, 40 centimetres. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it half a metre? 
MR SINGH:   No Chair, it is probably 30 centimetres. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 30 centimetres, is that more or less 
10 
about the length, what is the length…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of a ruler. 
MR SINGH:   Of a ruler, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say the height was about 30 
centimetres? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the depth? 
MR SINGH:   But when you say depth? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The height would be the depth. 
MR SINGH:   I think all of them were all the same size, I 
20 
think all of them were the same size. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what would you estimate that? 
MR SINGH:   As we said it was probably…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   60? 
MR SINGH:   Probably not, it was probably 50. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 60 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So 30 by 50, somewhere along 
there., sorry if need to take you back.  So that was the 
safety deposit box two, the first one you said was smaller 
than that. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry Sir, I am saying there were probably 
four to five of them, I do not know the exact number of how 
many were big and how many were small.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   But I do recall that they were varying sizes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us go - alright, so you had 
10 
four boxes of varying sizes, you have described the one 
size to us, 30 by 50, and did you have all four boxes at the 
same time? 
MR SINGH:   On occasion, I think they probably would 
have been there at the same time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how much did you pay now to 
rent these four boxes from Knox Vault on a monthly basis? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would not recall that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well are they - you would 
presumably be able to estimate, is it expensive to hire 
20 
these and especially four of them? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, they - I mean, the cost is relative 
given the fact that the nature of the reason for having the 
boxes is security or safety and so on, I mean at the end of 
the day in terms of quantum, I would think that they were 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 61 of 145 
 
not more than R2 500,00 a year or R2000,00 or R3000,00 a 
year. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A year? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   R2 500,00 not a month? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Singh…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Each. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Each? 
MR SINGH:   H’m 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Per year? 
MR SINGH:   As I said I do not recall this Chairperson, I 
am probably estimating and probably badly so.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bur you are going to come back and 
give evidence presumably this is something that you could 
look into for us and perhaps look at your records, and then 
determine what it is that you paid.  
I mean, I presume you conclude a contract with an 
entity like Knox Vaults.  It is quite a serious thing to hire 
your safety deposit box presumably there is a lot of 
20 
protocol and paperwork, is that so? 
MR SINGH:   Yes it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And for how long did you then have 
these four safety deposit boxes at Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   I am not too sure exactly when they were 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 62 of 145 
 
there from, but in I would say 2016 or ‘17 I stopped using 
the services of Knox Vault. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what years did you have these 
boxes? 
MR SINGH:   Probably from 2013 I would say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Until 2016, did you say? 
MR SINGH:   2016/2017.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, and what is it that you did 
with these boxes, why did you need four of them? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, they were basically for safety and 
10 
security purposes well in South Africa, you really require 
safety and security at least, at any given point in time.  
They 
were 
to 
store 
valuables, 
jewellery, 
documents, 
anything that we thought that we need to store and that is 
it basically. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And cash? 
MR SINGH:   There was an occasion to store some cash. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How much cash? 
MR SINGH:   I would be speculating.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what was that answer?  
20 
MR SINGH:   I said, I would be speculating if I was to 
estimate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would - I guess maybe one could 
ask, what kind of amount do you recall having deposited 
there at some or other stage? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 63 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   I would say that I think it is probably in the 
region of maybe at any given point in time, maybe a 100 
000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what would be the biggest amount 
that you even deposited there that you can recall? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, this would have been an 
accumulation over a period of time, so it would have been 
relatively small amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Small amounts? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the R100 000,00 might have been 
the biggest or not - you do not know? 
MR SINGH:   I really do not recall Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there could have been an amount 
higher than that or lower? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright and the period when you 
kept – you had these boxes there would it have been from 
when to when if you are able to say? 
MR SINGH:   I think I responded to Mr Myburgh probably 
20 
between 2013’ish to 2016/17’ish.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no I may have missed that, okay 
thank you Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Mr Singh, I am not 
familiar with this sort of thing.  I have a safe at home, just 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 64 of 145 
 
explain to me what it is that you needed to - why did you 
need four of these boxes?   What is it that you were 
keeping in these four boxes? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the four boxes is easy to explain. 
There was a box for each one of the members of the family 
in terms of being able to access the requirements, 
whenever we needed something for someone.  So it was 
jewellery for, let us say he wife then it was in a box, 
documents was in a separate box and alike. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to speak closer to the mic. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why was it not sufficient to keep 
those things at home in a safe, a typical safe? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I mentioned, the safety situation 
in South Africa was is - was an is a serious concern for 
everybody, and as I mentioned before, I was deployed with 
a close protection officer for safety and security reasons.  
In addition to that, or again, for safety and security 
reasons there was security guards that were deployed at 
20 
my home by Transnet.  So from that perspective, safety 
and security was a serious concern. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how often would you go then to 
Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   Not very often, sir. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 65 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What do you mean by that? 
MR SINGH:   Maybe once a month, maybe once in two 
months. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Once a month, so approximately 12 
times…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, that was a yes, I think you 
nodded. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That will not be recorded, so I think your 
answer was yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that would be 12 times or so a 
year, is that right?  
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then what caused you to give up 
these four safety deposit boxes in 2016 or 2017. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think it was – it coincided with my 
suspension at Eskom and I needed to access – well not 
having a salary beyond that, it was obviously going to be a 
20 
problem to maintain these boxes, and that also coincided 
with my ex-wife and family moving to Durban and living in 
Durban.  So we needed to access the information and the 
documents and stuff that was stored for them.  So that was 
then the reason for us to give up the boxes. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 66 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you going to provide details of 
the rental costs of these boxes when you come back? 
MR SINGH:   To the extent that I can retrieve the 
information I will do so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You could also make inquiries via 
Knox Vault.   
MR SINGH:   That is what I plan to do.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so let us go to paragraph 41 
then: 
“In a few instances after this…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Myburgh so going back to 
the rent you paid for these boxes or each one of these 
boxes per year.  Would it be fair to say, if you were paying 
I think you said about 2000 something rand for each per 
year.  So it would be 2000 something times four? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that that is what you would pay for it, 
so it was probably between eight and R10 000,00. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I said I was qualifying that by 
saying it might be that that approximation might actually be 
20 
very wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I accept that I just wanted to - so 
that is what more or less you think you were paying as rent 
for the boxes annually. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So just so that we have it on the 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 67 of 145 
 
record your estimate, as you sit here now, is these four 
boxes did not cost you more than R10 000,00 a year for all 
of them? 
MR SINGH:   As I recall, yes which might actually be very 
wrong, as I said, 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Singh, do you want to revise 
that figure or is that the best you can do?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think maybe for the purposes of 
today, I think it is probably best for me to reserve comment 
in terms of what the value is until I actually engage and 
10 
find the appropriate number else we would be pickling.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us then go to paragraph 41: 
“In a few instances after visits to the Gupta 
residence, Singh would instruct me to drive to Knox 
Vault at the corner of Riviera and River streets 
across the road from the Killarney Mall.” 
Is that the same Knox Vault that we have been speaking 
about? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Singh would then take the full bag  
20 
from the boot of our vehicle and go into the Knox 
Vault building whilst I would wait for him in the 
vehicle in the parking area.  After a few minutes, he 
would return to the vehicle and I could see that the 
bag that he carried was now empty.  I suspected 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 68 of 145 
 
that Singh had deposited the contents in a safe at 
Knox Vault.” 
You want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as we have discussed, I deny this 
allegation by witness 3. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did witness 3 ever take you to Knox 
Vault? 
MR SINGH:   No, he did not, sir 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ever talk to him about your 
deposit boxes at Knox Vault? 
10 
MR SINGH:   No, I did not sir and I think maybe Mr Chair 
just to give the Commission some background or my nature 
Mr Chair I am a relatively private person and you will 
notice as well that from witness 3 testimony, I normally 
used to take my car, private car to work on a Monday and 
then take it back on a weekend.  Now that was the reason 
for that was that so I have my weekends to myself.  
So witness 3 would not have for example driven me 
on a weekend to anywhere, maybe there was one or two 
rare occasions when that was required, but by and large, 
20 
that never happened.  So from a perspective of him taking 
me to deal with my private affairs, whether it be visits to 
the Gupta residence or whether it be to Knox Vaults or 
whether it be to - anything that I deemed private I would 
not use witness 3 for any or any transitory source for that 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 69 of 145 
 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would not discuss personal or 
private …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …matters.   So as far as you know he did 
not know that you had these deposit boxes at Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright Mr Myburgh. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Yes 
just 
to 
pick 
up 
on 
the 
Chairperson’s question then you never spoke to Witness 3 
10 
about you having a – a facility at Knox Vault – where does 
he come up with this from? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I am just as startled as you as to how 
he comes up with this allegation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Singh it should be quite a 
coincidence it seems that you had a series of boxes at Knox 
Vault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you went there once a month. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You went there once a month, you did 
not tell you say your driver about this but somehow he 
20 
comes up with this paragraph 41 it seems quite coincidental. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You see how it – how it looks I mean. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I will – I will afford… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on one second.   
MR SINGH:  I will afford… 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 70 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He comes up with his version which you 
say is a fabrication.  It includes going to the Gupta 
residence, those visits and it includes him saying on certain 
occasions he will take you to Knox Vault.  Now I assume 
there are a number of businesses which do the same 
business as Knox Vault.  He says he would take there to say 
that is fabrication but on your version it so happens that 
indeed you do have not one box – deposit box but four at 
Knox Vault.  It so happens on your version that actually you 
do visit – you did visit Knox Vault regularly once a month 
10 
your estimate.  On your version it must be such a 
coincidence. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is what Mr Myburgh is raising 
with you. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes certainly Chair.   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if I again can follow a response? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair my – my under – my – my view in 
terms of witness 3’s testimony regarding the Knox Vault 
emanates from again an issue that was raised from the 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 71 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:  I had occasion to read in the media that the 
commission had taken possession or in some way, shape or 
form got information relating to the fact that certain 
individuals implicated in state capture had boxes at Knox 
Vault and the person in question then had legal issues with 
the commission and therefore there were legal outcomes 
associated there from. 
 
So again Mr Chair the issue of Knox Vaults and 
Witness 3 as it relates to myself could have only emanated 
from the commission itself visa vie those issues that existed 
10 
within the commission and the knowledge the commission 
had relative to any individuals that had boxes at Knox Vaults. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying somebody within the 
commission must have told Witness 3 to say that he used to 
take you to Knox Vaults because that person in the 
commission was aware that somebody else had kept deposit 
boxes at Vault Knox is that what you are saying? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in terms… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying he was spoon fed by 
somebody in the commission to make this false allegation 
20 
against you? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that is my assertion because as we 
have been discussing with 00:04:31 thus far as I said his 
entire testimony is a relative fabrication and at the end you 
asked me the question why would he fabricate and I have no 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 72 of 145 
 
idea why. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you think – you think there is 
somebody in the commission who just had something against 
you so much that they would ask somebody to falsely 
implicate you in these visits to Vault Knox – Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair the only thing that I know is that the – 
the commission was in possession of a list of individuals that 
did have boxes at Knox Vault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MR SINGH:  Subsequent to that I then get this affidavit that 
10 
effectively implicates me in alleged wrongdoing visa vie 
Knox Vaults coming from Witness 3.  Under the let us say 
the pressure that had come from as he described it either 
Transnet or the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Just before we move 
on can I ask you this?  You say at a point in time you might 
have kept up to R100 000.00 at Knox Vault you recall that 
evidence? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Where did that money come from? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair there was a number of sources I think 
the – from time to time had occasion to be involved in a 
family business.  I did in some instances engage in gambling 
from now 00:06:13 I did gamble in casinos and occasionally 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 73 of 145 
 
house raising.  I did also do some consulting work visa vie 
financial consulting.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Some moonlighting? 
MR SINGH:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  For cash? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  While you were the Group Chief 
Financial Officer of Transnet? 
MR SINGH:  Sir and it was maybe the – the activities that I 
describe was probably in leading up to the Chief Financial 
10 
Officer position as well as 00:06:53.  The fact that I was 
Chief Financial Officer of Transnet at the time obviously 
gave me exposure and because of that exposure and 
because of the experience that I had gained at the time yes 
people were interested in what I knew. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well you were appointed as the Chief 
Financial Officer on the 1s t of July 2013 and you as I 
understand it took up a facility at Knox Vault in 2013, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  The – the investigator that the 
commission’s investigator that was involved in relation to the 
Drivers has just sent me a Whatsapp to say and we can 
confirm this if necessary that the commission learnt about 
Knox Vault from Witness 3.  The first time the commission 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 74 of 145 
 
heard about Knox Vault I do not suppose you can comment 
on that? 
MR SINGH:  I cannot comment on that Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the – I mean the effect of what Mr 
Myburgh is putting to you is that contrary to what you say 
because you – you were suggesting that it would only have 
been after… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  Chairperson  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  I am sorry you can finish.  You 
10 
can finish then I will deal with an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you must tell me if you cannot 
hear me.  What Mr Myburgh is putting to you based on what 
the investigator is saying is that contrary to what you are 
saying which is that the commission Witness 3 must have 
been given information by somebody in the commission 
about Knox Vaults and your involvement with them.  The 
information that he is putting to you is that the investigator is 
saying actually the person who – from whom the commission 
heard for the first time about the Knox Vaults was Witness 3 
20 
so which suggests it seems to me that the discovery of the 
individual or individuals that you were talking about in 
respect for whom there was – there were legal proceedings 
and so on came either at the same time or after but Witness 
3 was the first person to tell the investigators about Knox 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 75 of 145 
 
Vaults and so on. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  Chairperson  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  If you are finished at this stage 
I.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  I wish to raise some concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  By the statement that comes 
from Mr Myburgh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  First of all this version is not 
under oath we do not know who the investigator is and if it is 
correct what Mr Myburgh is suggesting I would have thought 
that that would form part of Witness 3’s affidavit or the 
evidence that he gave.  All we would have been provided at 
some stage with an affidavit by the investigator stating same 
and 
that 
of 
course 
in 
return 
would 
have 
had 
legal 
ramifications 
pertaining 
constitutional 
rights 
to 
privacy 
etcetera.  So at this stage I want to almost go to the point 
20 
where I say I object to this line of – of questioning.  I do not 
think it is fair to the witness more so having regard to the 
fact that it comes via a Whatsapp message from an unknown 
investigator with the greatest of respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think that – I think that things happen 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 76 of 145 
 
in this way because Mr Singh is making this allegation for 
the first time that the commission – somebody in the 
commission must have fed this information to Witness 3.  But 
what would be legitimate is for you to say the investigator 
who has given Mr Myburgh the information should go on 
affidavit under oath to pro – I think that would be legitimate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think I had mentioned that of course 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    It is not just a Whatsapp Mr Pierre 
Leonard is sitting in the gallery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And sent it to me he would be in a 
position to confirm that immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But if you want an affidavit DCJ of 
course we would do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it would be provided.  But as I say you 
know I think Mr Singh is making this allegation for the first 
20 
time.  If the – if he had made it before I am sure the legal 
team would have explored the option of getting an affidavit 
from the investigators. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  Chairperson thank you very 
much.  Just one further issue we might be on different pages 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 77 of 145 
 
but I could not see what Mr Singh said as an allegation made 
as such I saw it as an inference that he drew from 
information that he got.  But I will leave it at that for the 
point I need – I am thankful I think if the information is 
supplied under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVEER:  We can then prudently and 
properly deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no that is fine.  Okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  And then at paragraph 42 
10 
the – Witness 3 goes on to say: 
“To the best of my recollection I had taken Singh to the Knox 
Vaults on six or seven occasions after visits to the Gupta 
residence.” 
So on his version the majority of times that you went to the 
Gupta residence you would then go to Knox Vault, you want 
to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  I deny that allegation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Incidentally Mr Singh perhaps and I am 
sure we can get the exact distance but how far is it from 
20 
Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s to the Knox Vault?  Not 
far? 
MR SINGH:  Probably say it is five kilometres. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  How long would it take you to drive 
there? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 78 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:  Five minutes you know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Five or ten minutes.  Do you know of 
any… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry.  Just remember Mr Singh 
nodding is not good enough. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if you want to say yes you just say yes. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Five or ten minutes.  Do you know of 
10 
any equivalent facility closer to the Gupta residence? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then just one last question on this.  
You say you had occasion to go to your safety deposit boxes 
once a month, why? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I cannot recall the exact details I said 
it was an approximate once maybe twice a month – sorry 
maybe once a month or maybe once in two months but I 
cannot recall the exact details of why I would visit these 
boxes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  At paragraph 43: 
“It should be noted that we never discussed what happened 
at the Gupta residence or what the bags that he collected 
from the residence contained or the reasons for visits to the 
Knox Vault.” 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 79 of 145 
 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I have testified we have never 
discussed any issues regarding to Knox Vaults and in terms 
of the visits to the Gupta residence as I testified he has 
never taken me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 44: 
“I furthermore recall a day sometime in 2015 when I was 
driving Mr Singh to a scheduled meeting on the way he 
received a call on his cellular phone.  After he had finished 
the call he instructed me to divert from my route and 
10 
immediately drive to the Gupta residence.  I could hear that 
there was some panic in his voice.  We consequently rushed 
to the Gupta residence and on our arrival Singh got out in a 
hurry.  I waited in the parking area for approximately an hour 
and a half for him to return from the meeting.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I have dealt with this paragraph in my 
testimony I deny it and I find it relatively conspicuous that in 
the next paragraph he basically says I fell asleep. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That you what? 
20 
MR SINGH:  That I fell asleep. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  In the next paragraph. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let us get to the next paragraph.   
“When Singh returned from the meeting at approximately 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 80 of 145 
 
17:30 he appeared to be nervous and stressed.  When he got 
into the vehicle he said F that thing.  He then instructed me 
to drive him home and turn off the radio. Shortly thereafter 
he fell asleep.  This was unusual behaviour from him.” 
What do you say? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair this is – this is the paragraph that I 
had referenced previously.  It is – it is for me it is 
inconceivable that I would be in an irate state, get into a car, 
listen to the radio and fall asleep within a distance of – 
travel distance of less than twenty minutes at 5:30 in the 
10 
afternoon. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Witness 3 himself as you say says 
it was unusual. 
MR SINGH:  But I am saying to you it is unusual from a 
perspective that I would fall asleep.  I would not fall asleep. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is what he says. 
MR SINGH:  So why would I fall asleep if I was irate Sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You accept though this is unusual 
behaviour if it happened? 
MR SINGH:  For me yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And he himself says it is unusual. 
MR SINGH:  Well if it happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  And I am saying it did not happen. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So let us then deal with the 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 81 of 145 
 
Three Rivers Lodge.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So he must have on your version he must 
have sat down and fabricated all of these stories you went to 
the Gupta’s, you went in, when you came back he was upset 
and then got into the car said put off the radio and then fell 
asleep.  He must have sat down and say how am I going to 
frame Mr Singh, fabricate a story and he went to this extent 
of all of these details? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if I again may offer my view? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:  In this regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  If you look at in my view what Witness 3 is 
trying to allude to or infer from this is that I was under 
instructions of the Gupta’s.  So soon as they phone I would 
go.  Because he said this was unscheduled – we changed 
direction from a scheduled meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Based on a phone call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but that does not necessarily mean 
20 
you were instructed.  You might have decided. 
MR SINGH:  No, no indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the call. 
MR SINGH:  I am saying his inference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 82 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:  I am saying his inference is – is such that I 
would have left whatever meeting we were going to which 
was Transnet business and deal with this matter whatever 
the matter was.  And having gone to that meeting dealt with 
the subject matter of that meeting, whatever the subject 
matter of that meeting was created me to be in a state of 
anxiety.  Then fell asleep.  Right.  If you then go to 
Witnesses – Witness 3’s testimony relative to Mr Pita you 
find the same inference that he draws.  That they were on a 
way to a meeting Mr Pita gets a call and there they reverted 
10 
to Saxonwold.  So in my view again I would suggest that it is 
probably the reverse coincidence that I am going to fold in 
terms of saying but it is coincidental that two CFO’s of the 
organisation gets the same call and they act in the same 
way.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think the question that was posed to 
you by the DCJ if I could just pick up on that?  I think why 
would the driver – firstly – first of all from you have said you 
seem to have had a good relationship with this driver.   
20 
MR SINGH:  Indeed Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In fact on your version he tips you off 
about the fact that he is going to give an affidavit against 
you. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair he did not tip me off that he was going 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 83 of 145 
 
to give an affidavit.  He sought my guidance in terms of what 
he should do and again I have a view about that but if you 
would like it I can give it to you but I do not know but no, no 
he does not tip me off. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I am sorry.  Was he not saying 
whether he would have said he had been approached by 
Transnet or had been approached by the commission or he – 
whether he was saying he was volunteering to give some 
information to the commission but was he not in effect 
10 
saying I may soon be making a statement or affidavit to the 
commission that may talk about when I was driving you.  
Well in effect was he not saying that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I do not think the context of the 
conversation was in the – in the light of him tipping me off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  It was more in the light of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Asking for guidance. 
MR SINGH:  Asking for guidance of what should be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
MR SINGH:  And – and that is the context in which the 
conversation then happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you had a good relationship 
with him. 
MR SINGH:  Ja I had a cordial relationship with him. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 84 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you did not have something negative 
to say about you why would he have called you on your 
version? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair again I will be called on to – to give 
you my view in relation to this matter.  It was also a very, 
very strange occurrence for me and the reason why it was 
strange it is for a couple of reasons. 
 
The first reason is the fact that I do not normally 
answer phone calls that I do not know who they are from.  
10 
Lately it has been from the media so hence I do not answer 
those calls but anyway it was an 012 number that – it was 
landline number from which he had called on the day and the 
reason for me to having answered that landline call and not 
knowing who it was that I had occasion to be in a meeting in 
Pretoria. And the individuals that I was meeting in Pretoria 
on the day was actually a bit delayed.  So I – my view was 
this 012 number was them that was calling to say that they 
are a bit late and they will be there or something like that. 
So when – when the call – when I eventually answered the 
20 
call it was then Witness 3 and so that is the second reason 
why I found it strange.  One was that I answered the landline 
number 
but 
then 
it 
was 
Witness 
3. 
 And 
then 
the 
conversation went on as I suggested.  Now in my conspiracy 
theory, my 00:23:34 based on the evidence that I have led 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 85 of 145 
 
here in terms of how and why Witness 3 has done what he 
has done in my view it is not inconceivable that Witness 3 
was probably attempting to tape the conversation to be able 
to understand what would I say when I was approached 
regarding 
the 
visits 
to 
the 
Gupta 
residence 
and 
is 
involvement therein.  But as I said in the – my responses to 
him were cordial, it was basically to say Witness 3 you – 
Witness 3 you are under obligation to do certain things 
please continue to do it as you are required to do so.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we must take a five minutes 
10 
adjournment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Mr Singh I just got two 
more questions before we go to the Three Rivers Lodge.  
Can you think of why Witness 3 would frame you given the 
20 
constructive relationship that you had with him? 
MR SINGH:  It baffles me Sir I have no explanation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And perhaps one other question.  If he 
wanted to frame you he seems to have come up with a very 
elaborate and detailed version, why? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 86 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair I am sorry Mr Chair the only view 
that I have in terms of a reason why Mr – I am sorry Witness 
3 would undertake such an exercise is if he was fearing for 
his job or was under duress relating to his employment at 
Transnet.  That is the only reason I can prefer at this stage.  
In terms of the detailed nature of his evidence if he was as I 
have suggested been influenced by either Transnet or the 
commission 
investigators 
then 
he 
would 
end 
up 
with 
relatively compelling and detailed account of his version. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as far as Transnet is concerned is your 
version that for the Witness 3 to frame you like this it must 
mean that somebody or some people at Transnet must have 
put pressure on him to say things about you that he told 
them were not true. 
MR SINGH:  Chair I did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he – he – they put pressure and he did 
this because he thought his job would be in danger. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair you will – I did not hear for a period of 
time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Let me repeat.  So I am asking 
whether what you are saying is that insofar as Transnet is 
concerned Witness 3 would have framed you like this if 
somebody at Transnet or some people at Transnet put 
pressure on him to falsely implicate you even if he told them 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 87 of 145 
 
that these things that they would have said he must say 
about you did not happen. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Mr Singh the bags 
received from men of Asian descent at Three Rivers Lodge 
paragraph 46 at page 130. 
“During July of 2014 the Transnet Executive 
Committee attended a week long strategy 
session 
at 
the 
Three 
Rivers 
Lodge 
in 
10 
Vereeniging.” 
Would you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I do not have direct recollection of the 
date but I do concede that we did have breakaways as the 
[indistinct] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  47 
“I dropped Singh off at the venue early in the 
week and picked him up on the Friday 
afternoon again.” 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if we did have these breakaways that 
20 
would be the way that it would happen. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  48 
“While I waited for Singh on the Friday 
afternoon to finish the session I noticed four 
men who appeared to be from Asian descent 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 88 of 145 
 
(they 
looked 
like 
Chinese 
men 
to 
me) 
standing around a Hyundai H1 vehicle in the 
parking area.  Two of  the men appeared to 
be busy with a conversation on a cellular 
phone.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I do not recall his giving evidence 
relating to something that he had seen.  I have no comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  49. 
“The next thing I noticed how the two men 
10 
(who spoke on the cellular phone) took two 
luggage bags from the vehicle. One black the 
other one maroon and went inside the lodge 
area 
where 
the 
executive 
management 
meeting was held.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair again he is relaying events that I have 
no recollection of or first-hand knowledge of. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At 50. 
“At around 15h00 I received a sms from 
20 
Singh 
requesting 
me 
to 
come 
to 
the 
conference room where the meeting was 
held.  As I entered the room the two men who 
took the luggage bags into the lodge were in 
the room together with Molefe and Singh.  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 89 of 145 
 
Singh pointed to the maroon luggage bag and 
requested me to take the bag to our vehicle. 
I took the bag and put it in the boot of the 
vehicle.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I deny this allegation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if you had a bag with you in the 
conference room that you wanted to be put in the boot of 
your vehicle would you typically contact your driver and ask 
him to help you? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair typically that would not be the case.  I 
would not have a maroon luggage bag in the conference 
itself.  The conference room itself would be for obviously an 
EXCO break away or whatever the agenda for the day was 
so that bag would be a work bag so it would contain work 
related information. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So that is – that is not what I am 
asking you Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am asking you take a typical work 
20 
day; you have a bag. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  With you at a conference centre. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you want it to be put in the boot of 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 90 of 145 
 
your vehicle my question is would you typically contact your 
driver you knew that he is in the parking lot to come and 
fetch the bag to put it in the vehicle? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Not you would go and do that yourself? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well you heard the evidence for 
example of Mr Molefe when he was sitting in the Carlton 
Centre conference centre or room and he did not have his 
cell phone with him and it was in the bag in his office he 
10 
contacted his driver to go fetch the cell phone.  You used the 
drivers on a more limited basis. 
MR SINGH:  As I testified Sir I said I normally try and keep 
myself private so to the extent that I will have the ability to 
do stuff I do it on my own. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you telling the Chairperson that if 
you had a bag in a conference room and your driver was 
outside in the parking lot with your car you would not get his 
assistance to take the bag and put it in the boot you would 
walk that way yourself out of the conference room? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir because in all of my instances all my 
bags are trolley bags so I will it myself.  Even on travels if I 
travel with a bag I take my bag myself. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright Mr Singh.  So he says that at 
50.1: 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 91 of 145 
 
“That I need to mention that the bag was 
really heavy however I did not know what it 
contained at the time.” 
The next sub-paragraph. 
“I 
recognised 
that 
the 
bag 
– 
sorry 
I 
recognised that the bag as one of the 
luggage bags that the Chinese men had 
earlier taken into the meeting room.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Chair I deny these two paragraphs. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“While I was seated in our vehicle waiting for 
Singh after putting the maroon luggage bag 
in the boot of the vehicle I saw Molefe’s 
driver; (I cannot clearly recall if it was 
Witness 1 or a colleague) putting a black 
luggage bag from the same lodge venue to 
the 
vehicle 
that 
was 
used 
to 
transport 
Molefe.” 
Want to comment on that? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I cannot comment on this as he does 
not refer to me in any way. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But a very detailed version again is it 
not? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think as Mr Myburgh has pointed out 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 92 of 145 
 
that Mr Molefe did use his drivers in a certain way I think he 
has testified to that and Witness 3 would have known that.  
So it is not unusual behaviour for Witness 3 to have given a 
statement like this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry that was not my question.   
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It is a detailed version that he is 
putting forward in this affidavit. 
MR SINGH:  I agree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Correct.  51.1 
10 
“I recognised this bag as the other bag which 
the Chinese men had earlier taken into the 
meeting room.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  As it relates to the inference that these bags 
were related in – to me in any way I deny that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So that was a Friday I take it what 
would happen is you have explained is he would drive you 
back to the Carlton Centre, you would get into your blue 
BMW M3 you would go home for the weekend and you would 
20 
bring your blue BMW M3 back to the Carlton Centre 
basement on a Monday.  Is that right? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At paragraph 52. 
“The next Monday Singh drove to the Carlton 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 93 of 145 
 
Centre with his BMW M3 he left the vehicle 
in the basement for the week.” 
That would be consistent with what you have said correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“That Friday afternoon I was about to take 
Singh’s vehicle to the car wash.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  He would occasionally do that.  I am not too 
sure if it was exactly in this instance but he would 
10 
occasionally do that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you could have a nice clean car? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Over the weekend as we all enjoy.   
“As usual I checked that there was no 
valuables – that there were no valuables in 
the boot that could go missing.” 
You accept that he would usually do that before taking your 
vehicle to be washed? 
MR SINGH:  I do not recall him actually returning any 
20 
valuables to me at any given point in time when he took the 
cars to the carwash. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well perhaps it is because there were 
not any before this incident. 
MR SINGH:  Well there may have occasion to leave stuff in 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 94 of 145 
 
the car like all of us do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay.   
“I ope – as I opened the boot I saw the 
maroon bag that I had collected from the 
Three Rivers Lodge the previous Friday.  
When I picked up the bag I realised that it 
weighed less than before.  I opened the bag 
to see what was inside and I noticed a 
couple of rolls of R200 notes.  I sms’d Singh 
and informed him that the bag was still in the 
10 
car.  He immediately came down to the 
basement and collected the bag from me.” 
You want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  I deny the contents of this paragraph. 
ADV 
MYBURGH SC:  
Now 
did 
you 
and 
your driver 
communicate by way of sms? 
MR SINGH:  Probably Whatsapp but very rarely. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
But 
would 
you 
communicate 
electronically in that way it would be easier than phoning the 
man? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Well the reason why we would communicate 
either in Whatsapp or sms is because of the fact that I would 
be in meetings. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes absolutely. 
MR SINGH:  So it would be easier for us to communicate in 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 95 of 145 
 
that way. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And he would not want to disturb you? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that was the mode that you 
communicated with one another typically? 
MR SINGH:  Typically if we needed to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Of course he says that he received a 
sms from you at the Three Rivers Lodge to come to the 
conference room. That would be how you would contact him 
and … 
10 
MR SINGH:  Well in that case I would have just called him 
on the phone because I would not have been engaged in any 
activity.  It was obviously under his version it was the end of 
the day.  So there was no formal meetings that were un – 
that was being conducted.  So I would have called him. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr – Mr alright.  I suppose it must 
be quite difficult to work out when one would sms someone 
and when one would phone them.  I mean all of us work with 
this all the time. 
MR SINGH:  Mr – well Mr Chair in my view if I was busy I 
20 
would either sms my PA or Whatsapp my PA or Whatsapp 
Witness 3 - Witness 3.  But else I would either pick up the 
phone and discuss issues with my PA or alternatively call 
Witness 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we must take the lunch break.   
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 96 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We will adjourn until two. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh, 
could I ask you, please, to go to page 131 of Exhibit BB-
14(d)?  The ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry, 131? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, the statement of Witness 3. 
MR SINGH:   I am there sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to deal with what Witness 3 
says under the heading, Visits to Sahara Computer Offices.   
“I came prepared. 
That I provided CPO Services to Singh.   
I took him to the Sahara Computer offices in 
Midrand on a number of occasions to attend 
meetings.   
I do not know with whom he met as I always 
20 
waited for him in the vehicle in the parking 
area...” 
 
You want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I deny this comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say you went there but you did 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 97 of 145 
 
not go inside? 
MR SINGH:   No, not for meetings. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  You know who owned 
Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who? 
MR SINGH:   It was the Gupta family. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you know who worked in these 
offices? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, did any of the Gupta’s worked 
there?  Your now wife worked at Sahara Computer ’s 
offices. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know which any of the 
Gupta’s worked in those offices? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not but I am assuming that 
some of them would have been there.  The family would 
have been there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, I omitted to say, today we 
will not be able to go beyond four o’clock as we normally 
do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is a relief Chairperson.  
[laughs]   
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 98 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  And ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   And we are quite happy too 
Chair.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  So maybe around 
quarter to ten to four we can adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, if you go over the page to 
paragraph 54: 
10 
“On a few occasions he would instruct me to 
drive to Sahara Computer ’s offices after hours 
where he would pick up a close friend. 
I would usually drop them off at his close 
friend’s residence in Midrand...” 
 
Do you have any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   As I have stated before.  Ms Naicker(?)who is 
now my wife.  That is who he is referring to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at 55: 
“It seems the close friend initially worked for 
20 
Transnet. 
 
She 
was 
later 
employed 
at 
Sahara...” 
 
We have dealt with that. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, just a few general questions.  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 99 of 145 
 
You have read this whole affidavit? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have noticed, no doubt, that 
Witness 3 implicates Mr Gigaba, yourself and Mr Pita. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In different ways and to different 
degrees, correct? 
MR SINGH:   I would agree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we go to Mr Pita.  You would have 
read that Witness 3 says at paragraph 62, when talking 
10 
about Mr Pita’s meetings at the Gupta’s, that: 
“I 
did 
not 
see 
him 
returning 
from 
these 
meetings carrying any bags...” 
 
But then at 63, he goes on to describe the cash 
delivery at Knox Vaults in very much the same terms as he 
described yours.  Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   I do sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you have any idea how Mr Pita, 
your successor, that came to have a facility at Knox Vaults, 
at least on this version? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would not able to explain that.  
However, I did allude to the fact that the coincidences 
between the similarities of Witness 3’s allegations between 
myself and Mr Pita is quite stark.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mister...  Chairperson, I had just 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 100 of 145 
 
been advised that an urgent technical break for five 
minutes is required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  We will take a 
short adjournment. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Singh, I wanted to 
end off by just asking you this.  Can you think of any 
reasons why Witness 3 would potentially put his life in 
10 
danger by fabricating this version? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, at this stage, I do 
not want to object but it is, with the greatest of respect, an 
unfounded statement that is put to the witness and for him 
to answer that cannot be fair in any form or manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know if Mr Myburgh had 
finished his question or proposition.  I...  Do you want to 
repeat it Mr Myburgh?  Let me hear what it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to ask Mr Singh as to 
whether he could think of any reason why Witness 3 might 
20 
potentially put his life in danger by fabricating a version 
against Mr Singh.  That is all that I wanted to ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, my objection is to 
the first part of the question.  It is a bit of a loaded 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 101 of 145 
 
question and especially in the manner in which it is put to 
the witness.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   As you yourself said on many 
occasions, you are here to interrogate the veracity of some 
– we cannot just make statements where we have no 
factual foundation for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let me put it this way.  Mr Singh, 
you have said that you and Witness 3 had – were on good 
terms, a very good – had a cordial relationship.  Is that 
10 
right? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know of any reason why he 
would want to portray you in such a bad light with regard to 
the Gupta family, your alleged relationship with them and 
say that you visited them and came out with bags, I think 
he says and you must just correct me if I am missing on, 
which later on I think he says he, at least on one occasion, 
found that money and that you – he visited with you or you 
visited Knox Vault when in fact there was – there were no 
20 
such visits at all?   
 
Or is the answer the one you gave earlier, 
namely, you think that somebody within the Commission 
fed him information and influence him to falsely implicate 
you in this.  There may be somebody in Transnet pressured 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 102 of 145 
 
him to make these false allegations against you? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, my response would be that my view 
in terms of the motive behind Witness 3’s allegations or the 
motive behind his allegations could only stem from the fact 
that he was concerned about job security. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   And bow to the pressure that he alluded to 
that he was under in the telephone call with myself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Uhm.... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And maybe if you do have a name 
or names, do not mention them now.  Maybe you can look 
at – we can look at the names later.  Is there somebody at 
Transnet that you think would really want you to be falsely 
implicated by Witness 3 in things that you were not 
involved in?  Do you know somebody who would really 
desire that at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not have a name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have a name? 
MR SINGH:   I do not have a name. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And I do not think I will ever come up with a 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Because I am not in the business of 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 103 of 145 
 
speculation or tarnish somebody’s credibility and images. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But as you will see, Mr Chair.  In the course 
of leading the evidence to the Commission, you will find 
that there will be a continuous – how can I say – 
challenging of the evidence presented to drive a certain 
narrative. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   Who and why that was done, Mr Chair, I do 
not know.  I do not wish to know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   But my obligation to you is to come here and 
point out these difference and to the extent I can and to 
the best of my ability and so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know whether Mr Myburgh you... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No.  May I just have two more 
questions...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m, h’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, could I ask you, please, to 
go to page 135, paragraph 72.1 where Witness 3 says that: 
20 
“I am concerned about my own and my family’s 
safety and security, specifically during and 
after my testimony...” 
 
I presume you cannot comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   I cannot to the extent that I never threatened 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 104 of 145 
 
Witness 3 and I will never do so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then one just last thing.  It came 
to light in the Commission’s proceedings earlier this week 
and you might have read about this, that there was 
allegedly an attempt on Witness 1’s life.  Did you read 
about that? 
MR SINGH:   I did sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Could I ask you then, 
please, to turn to... 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair.  Are we done with Witness 3, 
10 
sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, we are done with Witness 3. 
MR SINGH:   I just wanted to make a comment on your 
general ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sure. 
MR SINGH:   ...analysis of Witness 3’s statement in its 
entirety.  Mr Chair, I would just like to point you to 
paragraph 20 of his affidavit which is on page 125.  And it 
relates to the period when Witness 3 was providing 
services to Minister Gigaba and you will notice that it is 
20 
the period between July and December 2013.   
 
If you then move on to page 126 at paragraph 
22, one would then note that Witness 3 is waiting in a 
vehicle at the residence and describes certain individuals 
that he sees at paragraphs 21.1, 21.2, 21.3 and 21.4.   
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 105 of 145 
 
 
Mr Chair, my point that I would like to try and 
make here is.  As it relates to Mr Molefe and Mr Ngubane, 
in my view, I think they are public figures and Witness 3 
would be able to recognise them in 2013. 
 
My personal view is, in 2013 I did not know who 
Mr Matshela Koko was.  I only really got to know him or if I 
saw him in this room, I would not have not recognise him in 
2013.  Equally so, Mr Chair, Ms Linda Mabaso the former 
Chairperson of Transnet.  I did not know.  I do not know 
until she was the Chairperson of Transnet because she 
10 
was ostensible not a public figure.   
 
The reason why I raise this is because Witness 3 
recognises these people way back in 2013 yet these 
people become public figures in 2015.  So it is just another 
anomaly that I thought I should bring to the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you raise the question how he may 
have known ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   How did he make this connection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...all of these people? 
MR SINGH:   People at that time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  H’m.  You are obviously not in 
a position to positively say he did not know them then but 
you are just raising an issue to say it would be interesting 
to know how he knew people that, as far as you are 
concerned, were not in the public eye? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 106 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   Especially, Mr Chair, and in particular 
Ms Linda Mabaso 
because 
he 
refers 
to 
her 
as 
the 
Chairperson of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was she not the Chairperson of 
Transnet at the time? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She became ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   She became Chairperson of Transnet 
sometime, I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   After? 
10 
MR SINGH:   After in 2015 or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay.  Was that the only point? 
MR SINGH:   Chair, that was my only point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay thank you, thank you.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am going to come back to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it might be useful to get Witness 
3 to comment on the point raised. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe by way of an affidavit. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, I am going to come back 
to the evidence of Witness 3 and I am going to come back 
to the allegations that you went to the Gupta’s, the 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 107 of 145 
 
allegation that you collected money and that you deposited 
it at Knox Vaults, once I have completed my examination of 
you and dealt with the transaction advisors, the awarding 
of tenders, et cetera.  I will come back to that at the end.   
 
If I could ask you, please, to turn back to your 
exhibit, BB-23(a). 
MR SINGH:   Can I return this stuff? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The driver ’s you can put away, yes.   
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
at 
some 
stage 
you 
10 
intimated that Mr Singh’s affidavit for today might be 
admitted after lunch or something? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It has been included in your bundle 
now, DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  You wanted it to be admitted 
as an exhibit? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now or later?  As long as you do not 
forget this.  You might do it later if that is convenient. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  My junior will remind me.  
20 
Perhaps we could that just before we break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am indebted to you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, could I ask you to turn to 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 108 of 145 
 
the second 10.6 Directive that was issued to you?  That 
you will find at page 420. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   420 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And at 421, you see you were told to 
deliver within seven weeks of receipt, thereafter the 
Secretary or acting Secretary of the Commission at the 
address given, et cetera, the declaration in which you 
specifically address your involvement or you knowledge of 
10 
the following.  Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if I could ask you then to turn to 
page 425 amongst the issues that you were asked to 
address under that head at the foot of the page, paragraph 
1.12.  Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   I do so sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you were asked to address the 
frequency 
and 
reasons 
for 
visits 
to 
the 
Saxonwold 
residence of the Gupta family. 
20 
MR SINGH:   I do so sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now let us turn to your answer.  That 
you will find at page 1500.  And if I can direct your 
attention, please, to paragraph 300?  You will see under 
the heading at para 1.12.  Do you see that? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 109 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say at paragraph 300: 
“The only person/witness that places me at the 
Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s is Witness 
3. 
In respect of Witness 3’s evidence, I wish to 
state that I deny his assertion that I visited the 
Gupta residence as alleged. 
I do not believe that a finding can be made 
that he is a credible witness, especially, based 
10 
on his performance under cross-examination 
on Monday, 8 March 2021...” 
 
301: 
“Moreover, I wish to point out that there is no... 
of 
objective 
evidence 
to 
substantiate 
his 
allegation 
pertaining 
to 
my 
visit 
to 
the 
Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s” 
 
302: 
“Insofar as I might not have been made aware 
of 
any 
other 
persons 
making 
similar 
20 
allegations.  I will deal with same if and when 
the Commission produces the evidence in this 
regard.” 
 
303: 
“I do not believe it is fair to ask me to answer 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 110 of 145 
 
to 
unsubstantiated 
allegations, 
speculation 
and innuendo.” 
 
Right?  That is what you said, correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where do you tell the Chairperson 
you are under a summons about the frequency and reasons 
for your visit to the Saxonwold residence? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, I do not understand your question sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You were asked, in what was a 
summons, to tell the Commission about your frequency and 
10 
reasons for visits to the Saxonwold residence. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do not do that.   
MR SINGH:   I guess it is an omission sir but I made full 
disclosure to you which I apologise for sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, you were issued with a 
summons to answer that question and you land up saying 
at 303: 
“I do not believe it is fair to ask me to answer 
to 
unsubstantiated 
allegations, 
speculation 
20 
and innuendo.” 
 
What were you talking about there? 
MR SINGH:   This is the allegations relating to or the 
inferences that I drawn as it relates to individuals that 
visited the Saxonwold residence. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 111 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But why...  Well, why did you not tell 
the Chairperson, because of course, we are not dealing 
with Witness 3 there.  You were given a 10.6 to deal with 
Witness 3.  And then you were asked about the frequency 
and reasons for your visits.  Why did you not in this 
affidavit, if you were going to be completely transparent, 
why did you not simply tell the Chairperson what you said 
when I started asking you questions?   
 
And I asked you, how many times did you go 
there and why did you go there.  Why did you not put it in 
10 
your affidavit that:  I went there about ten times to attend 
religious and cultural functions.  Why did you not say that? 
MR SINGH:   As I said, Mr Chair, I think it was omission on 
my part which I apologise for. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No.  An omission on your part? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one gets the impression from your 
answer here that it was not an oversight on your part, not 
to give this information because you had been asked to 
indicate how many times you may have visited the Gupta 
20 
residence and what the reasons were for your visits.  Your 
answer seems to object to being asked those questions.  
You say: 
“I do not believe it is fair to ask me to answer 
to 
unsubstantiated 
allegations, 
speculation 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 112 of 145 
 
and innuendo.” 
 
But you are simply being asked to the extent you 
may have visited the Gupta residence:  Tell us how many 
times and what were the reasons?  That is what you had 
been asked.  And your answer seem to be:  Do not ask me 
about that.  You accept this interpretation of your answer? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, again, I do not 
wish to object but I think the answer in the affidavit must 
be read in the context of who he responds to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   It is not like it is suggested by 
Mr Myburgh that he responds – that response relates to the 
frequency of the visits to the Gupta residence.  I think the 
witness tried to make that point and say:  I deal with this in 
relation to the heading that is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, but the – this is a directive.  It 
seeks certain information and in his answer he does say ad 
paragraph 1.12 of the Regulation 10.6 Directive.  Is not an 
answer to an affidavit.  It is a question that is being put by 
the Chairperson to – through a directive to get information 
20 
as part of the Commission’s investigation.  You understand 
that? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to say anything about my 
interpretation that your answer to – seems to be:  Do not 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 113 of 145 
 
ask me about that. 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, perhaps I could just ask you 
one more question.  If you read 300 to 303. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that is a fact, is, you are telling 
the Chairperson that you have never been to the Gupta’s. 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, if you read it, you say: 
10 
“The only person who places me there is 
Witness 3 and he is not to be believed...” 
 
So the net effect is, you did not go there.   
MR SINGH:   No, sir, I would not.  If that was the case, I 
would not have led the testimony I led. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually...  I am sorry.  Actually, 
Mr Singh, if you will look at paragraph 301.  You say: 
“Moreover, I wish to point out that there is 
no... objective evidence to substantiate his 
20 
allegation 
pertaining 
to 
my 
visit 
to 
the 
Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s” 
 
That seems to me to be saying:  Any allegation 
that I visited the Gupta’s is not substantiated.  As opposed 
to saying:  Look, I have been to the Gupta’s but not under 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 114 of 145 
 
the circumstances that he says I went there.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I might be misunderstanding you 
but I think the response in paragraph 301 relates to the 
allegations that he was making to my business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Yes, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, I am sure you accept that 
it would have been better for you to say:  Well, I deny the 
allegations that I visited the Gupta residence under the 
circumstances that he outlines but I did go there for 
10 
cultural occasions and for religious occasions.  So visiting 
there is not denied.  It is visiting there under the 
circumstances that he gives that is being denied.  I am 
sure that would have been much better, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   I concede that that would have been a better 
way to contextualise the subject Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Now, DCJ, whilst we 
are in this file, we were at page 1500.  Could I ask you... 
Perhaps I should just deal with the affidavit now because it 
20 
is in the same file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, ja.  That is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, could you please go to 
page 1507? 
MR SINGH:   1507? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 115 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   1507.  There you will find an 
affidavit.  If you go to page 1 – of yours – go to page 1539.  
That is the signature page and it contains as series of 
annexures that run up until 1563.  Would you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if you go back to page 1539, 
would you confirm that you swore to this affidavit on the 
12 t h day of March 2021? 
MR SINGH:   I do sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I presume earlier this morning? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And would you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of this affidavit? 
MR SINGH:   I do so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, if I 
could ask you, please, to admit Mr Singh’s affidavit that 
commences at page 1507 as Exhibit BB-23.8? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Anoj Singh’s affidavit starting at page 
1507 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as 
Exhibit BB-23.8. 
20 
ANOJ SINGH’S AFFIDAVIT STARTING AT PAGE 1507 IS 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB-23.8. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Singh, on these ten 
or so occasions that you went to the Gupta residence, who 
did you see there? 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 116 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, other than the family that was 
present and other invitees, no one of significance or that I 
recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, did you, for example, see 
Mr Molefe there?  By his own admission, he went often 
including to family functions. 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  You cannot recall anyone that 
worked at Transnet there on those ten occasions? 
MR SINGH:   Not off hand Mr Chair.  As I said it was 
10 
probably ten occasions over a period of five to six years.  
So I do not... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Alright.  I want to turn to 
another topic and that relates to the Manganese Expansion 
Project.  Can I ask you please to turn to Transnet Bundle 4 
behind you and Exhibit 19? 
MR SINGH:   [Indistinct] [speaker moved away from 
microphone] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody must just help the witness, 
please. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Someone will help you now. 
MR SINGH:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You might wish to repeat the bundle 
Mr Myburgh.  I think your attorney might not have heard it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Transnet Bundle... [speaker moves 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 117 of 145 
 
away from microphone – unclear]  At page 31. 
MR SINGH:   The black numbers sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So this is the affidavit of 
Mr Henk Bester.  You will recall that at the time he worked 
for Hatch Consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 21 or 31? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I had.  I wanted to go to 31 but then 
I see that inadvertently went to start at the statement.  it 
actually starts at page 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So you will go to 31, that is 
10 
where your questions ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have 31. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.   
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   24.  It starts at 24. 
MR SINGH:   The black numbers? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   BB-19.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, use the black numbers.  Check on 
the spine whether it is the correct one. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, BB-19.  I can see it from 
here.  It is the next divider.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us start afresh.  Mr Singh, the 
first thing is to check if it is the right bundle and you will 
see that on the spine where it says, this one is Transnet 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 118 of 145 
 
Bundle 4.  Transnet Bundle 4.  And then you will go to the 
right page. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think the right page 31.  Have you 
got it? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it, the black 31? 
MR SINGH:   So we are going to 31 sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Are we going to 31? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You – this is the affidavit or 
statement 
of 
Mr 
Henk 
Bester. 
 
You 
have 
read 
it, 
presumable and you have read it carefully? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have noted that there are 
many references to you in this statement? 
MR SINGH:   Correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have noted as well that he 
20 
alleges that you attended a meeting together with Mr Essa. 
MR SINGH:   I do so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to then deal with those 
passages if I could? 
MR SINGH:   Sure. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 119 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The first paragraph where you are 
implicated is paragraph 23 at page 31.  And he says that 
on the 26 t h of July, I met with Rudi Basson, Transnet 
Capital Projects... [audio recording ended] ...time to inform 
him of the visit that I had from Padayachee and Reddy and 
the apparent insight they seem to have into Transnet 
matters as outside companies. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair.  I apologise for interrupting 
Mr Myburgh but I seem to have a cramp. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
10 
MR SINGH:   I seem to have a cramp on my leg.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   Is it possible to just take a break? 
CHAIRPERSON:   A break? 
MR SINGH:   Two minutes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us adjourn for five 
minutes.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you feeling better, Mr Singh? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Thank you, Mr Chair, I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, let us continue, Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So, Mr Singh, we were 
at page 33 of Transnet bundle 4A, EXHIBIT 19.  Sorry, 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 120 of 145 
 
page 31, paragraph 23.  So I am going to fast-forward just 
a little bit.  What Mr Bester says is that he has a meeting 
together with Mr Basson and Ms Strydom, this is what he 
says at 23.  At 24 he says that: 
“Basson told me that Singh wanted a confinement 
approval condition included which stipulated that 
PM Africa and DEC would from part of the SD 
component for phase 1.  According to Basson, him 
and Mr Gerhard Bierman, CFO of TCP told Singh 
that it would not be advisable to stipulate specific 
10 
companies to be used in SD initiatives.  Basson 
said that this condition was subsequently dropped.” 
Do you have any comment on that paragraph? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, firstly, in terms of paragraph 24 we 
note 
that 
there 
is 
no 
confirmatory 
affidavit 
that 
is 
submitted of Mr Basson to this extent.  In addition, Mr 
Chair, Mr Basson does correctly state that the stipulation 
as suggested by Mr Bester was in fact dropped. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the question is what do you have 
to say about the statement by Mr Hank Bester that Mr 
20 
Basson told him that you wanted the confinement approval 
condition included which debated that PM Africa and DEC 
should form part of the SD component.  You have said that 
there is no confirmatory affidavit by Basson, is that where 
you stopped or you would say yes, I know about that, I did 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 121 of 145 
 
speak to Basson or you say you did not say that to 
Basson? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the context behind this issue 
emanates from the fact that the issue of SD and SD being 
supplied with – or empowerment, as you would describe it, 
was a particular problem within the environment within 
which Mr Basson and Mr Bierman operated.  They operated 
in a division of Transnet called Transnet Capital Projects 
and Transnet as an state owned company has an obligation 
and it is contained in its, you know, shareholder compact 
10 
with the Minister and so on in the corporate plan as well 
but 
it 
would 
advance 
the 
empowerment 
and 
supply 
development objectives and this comment was made in that 
context primarily because of the fact that the Transnet 
Capital Projects, as the name suggests, was involved in 
construction-related activity and one of the issues that was 
highlighted 
relating 
to 
empowerment 
and 
supply 
development 
was 
that 
Transnet 
Capital 
Projects 
was 
relatively lagging behind because of the specialist nature 
of the work that is conducted by the construction company 
20 
or the engineering consultants.  So in this case, Mr Chair, 
we are talking about the manganese expansion project.  
Now the manganese expansion project after the locomotive 
project was probably one of the biggest projects that 
Transnet would undertake.  It was, I think, in the region of 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 122 of 145 
 
about 20 billion if I am not mistaken in terms of the 
estimated total cost of the budget. 
 
So we really saw this as an opportunity to be able 
to drive supply development using this project as it relates 
to the size and the magnitude of the project.  So this is the 
context within which this request was made from a 
procurement procedure manual perspective which is the 
document that guides the procurement within Transnet it 
would not allow it.  So from that perspective it was used as 
an example for Mr Basson and Mr Bierman because Mr 
10 
Bierman was the Chairperson of the acquisition council at 
Transnet 
Capital 
Projects 
to 
be 
able 
to 
explore 
opportunities, options, alternatives, to be able to improve 
TCP’s SV scores, to enable them to be aligned more to our 
targets and also then try and transform the engineering 
and the construction industry space as it relates to supply 
development. 
 
So it was not a direct instruction to say listen, you 
must do this.  As Mr Basson concedes that once Mr 
Bierman and Mr Basson had briefed me regarding their 
20 
deliberations, the idea was brought.  The issue was, I was 
trying to convey to them the seriousness with which they 
need to look at this aspect to allow us to be able to meet 
Transnet’s objectives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so the answer is yes, you did 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 123 of 145 
 
make that statement but you are saying you are providing 
the context with which you made. 
MR SINGH:   Context. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so a hearsay and a lack of a 
confirmatory affidavit is a non-issue because you accept 
you said this, this is what you wanted. 
MR SINGH:   As to whether I said it to Mr Basson or Mr 
Bierman, that I am not too sure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, Mr Bierman, we know that he 
put in an affidavit and he deals with it as well. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So just that we understand this, you 
wanted a confinement approval condition, you must correct 
me if I am wrong, included which stipulate that PM Africa 
and DEC  should from part of the SD component for phase 
one. 
MR SINGH:   No, that I deny, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, what did you want? 
MR SINGH:   As I have explained, Mr Chair, I wanted them 
to explore opportunities, alternatives of methods to enable 
20 
Transnet Capital Projects to meet its mandates as it 
relates to transformation and supply development.  As an 
example, I said why do you not explore this? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You would accept that it would be 
improper to impose on someone like Hatch the appointment 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 124 of 145 
 
of particular SD partners. 
MR SINGH:  Yes, I will.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So let us go to paragraph 
25. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I should say this in fairness 
to you, Mr Singh.  You see, when you said Mr Basson had 
not provided a confirmatory affidavit it came across as you 
were denying, you were going to dispute that you made 
that statement …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Chair, I dispute the context of the 
10 
statement that I requested DEC  to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Or to be SD partners of Hatch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   My view has always been site development 
partners are the choice of the main contractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then at 25: 
“Later that same day I received a call from Basson,  
says Bester who requested that Hatch sign an MOU 
20 
with PM Africa and DEC.  Basson did not give me a 
reason for this request and I would be speculating if 
I were to say I knew the reason.  I can only imagine 
that there must have been pushback when he 
informed Singh of what I had told him about 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 125 of 145 
 
Padayachee and Reddy approaching Hatch.  Singh 
must have insisted that the MOU be signed.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I deny this allegation and on Mr 
Bester ’s own version he is speculating as to what the 
reason could be.  Secondly, as Mr Bester already conceded 
in paragraph 23, which I was led on, the requirement was 
not even enforced. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you accept though or do you 
dispute that Mr Bester was requested to sign an MOU with 
10 
PM Africa and DEC? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I cannot comment, I was not party 
to those discussions between Mr Bester and DEC  or PM 
Africa.  I do not recall this request, the request never came 
from me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then let us get to paragraph 29 at 
page …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   I think also, Mr – sorry, sorry, just one further 
comment.  Mr Chair, at the outset I would like to draw the 
Commission’s attention to one fact.  These interactions, 
20 
whether it be Mr Basson with Mr Bester and Mr Bester with 
Ms Strydom because I am sure we are going to led with Ms 
Strydom’s evidence as well, is highly irregular in its nature 
because these things actually happening, as the Chair will 
see, these things are happening as a tender process of the 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 126 of 145 
 
provision of these EPCM services unfolding.  It is highly 
irregular for Mr Bester to engage in this type of behaviour 
equally so for Mr Basson and for Ms Strydom given the 
positions that they have in the project.  Mr Bester would 
have reported to Mr Basson as a Transnet equivalent.  Ms. 
Strydom was the project manager relating to the MEP,  
project, the manganese expansion project.  So they had 
very senior positions and for them to be interacting with Mr 
Bester, a potential service provider on these matters 
during a live procurement process is highly irregular. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, Mr Singh, perhaps I could just 
ask you to keep that bundle open and move to Mr Bester ’s 
affidavit – sorry, Mr Bierman’s affidavit.  This is Transnet 
bundle 4, EXHIBIT BB21.   
MR SINGH:   I am there, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I ask you please to turn to page 
928?  Just in relation to your evidence that you were not 
proposing specific SD partners, you would have seen at 
paragraph 18 at 928 that Mr Bierman says that he gave you 
feedback via a Whatsapp.   
20 
MR SINGH:   Indeed, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it says: 
“Anoj, on manganese confinement, my procurement 
team wants to strangle me.  The view is that be 
designating 
a 
specific 
company 
as 
SD 
of 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 127 of 145 
 
subcontracting 
the 
process 
will 
fail 
fairness 
transparency 
and 
equitable 
test. 
 
We 
have 
considered options and investigated this previously.  
It would be great to do this but we are not allowed 
to.  If Transnet chooses to go this route we will still 
have to apply this consistently.” 
Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   I do, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Does it not appear from that 
Whatsapp that you were proposing specific SD partners? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Again, Mr Chair, it comes back to the issue of 
me requesting a principle to be explored or alternatives to 
be explored and later on you will see that there is a long 
Whatsapp message from Mr Bierman again dealing with 
this topic.  But again from that Whatsapp message you will 
see that the issue that was being discussed was an issue 
of principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the question is whether when you 
read paragraph 18 of Mr Bierman’s affidavit with the 
quotation of that message, you say a Whatsapp message. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot hear me? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You see, I am used to a 
situation where my – everybody hears me because my 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 128 of 145 
 
voice is rather loud but lately there have been complaints 
that I cannot be heard, so - okay.  No, I was saying Mr 
Myburgh’s question to you was whether you do not concede 
that a reading of paragraph 18 of Mr Bierman’s affidavit 
with that quotation of a Whatsapp message you do not 
concede that appears that you had spoken to him about 
designating a specific company as a subcontractor or SD, 
Just from the message in that paragraph. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, this again refers to a principle, 
correct?  It does not mention them by name. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the second sentence says: 
“The view is that is that by designating a specific 
company as SD or subcontracting the process, the 
subcontracting 
process 
will 
fail 
fairness, 
transparency and equitable test.” 
That sentence comes after the first sentence where he 
says” 
“Anoj, on manganese confinement, my procurement 
team wants to strangle me.” 
MR SINGH:   Agreed, sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do they want to strange him?  It 
would seem on the face of it that it is because of the view 
which is contained – which he refers to in his second 
sentence because of the view that a specific company must 
be designated as SD or subcontractor.   
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 129 of 145 
 
MR SINGH:   I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Since he is writing to you… 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It gives the impression, prima facie at 
least to me that he is writing to you because you are the 
one who may have wanted that a specific company be 
designated as SD.  So the question from Mr Myburgh was 
whether you do not concede that a reading of this message 
such as that. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I concede that after the reading the 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The second sentence. 
MR SINGH:   The first sentence of that [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] which says: 
“After concluding our profile of the two companies.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Which I will assume is DEC and there is one 
other, I cannot remember its name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So now you concede what? 
20 
MR SINGH:   That there was a request from me to co-hire 
two companies. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, I see.   Mr Singh, can I just 
perhaps – I meant actually to start out by asking you more 
general questions.  Was there a time when you were 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 130 of 145 
 
employed 
as 
Transnet 
where 
you 
became 
at 
least 
suspicious of the fact that this SD partner, provision for SD 
partners was being exploited and manipulated? 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall the exact events. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but you have no doubt reflected 
carefully on your time at Transnet, backwards, not so? 
MR SINGH:   You mean since I have left? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And in terms of how things have now 
unfolded? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Okay, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have paid attention to 
evidence that has been given.  Do you have any sense at 
the time that there were problems with SD partners and 
that they were being used in an irregular way? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir, I do not think I can agree with you on 
that one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I am not asking you to agree, I 
am asking you did you have a sense, did you have any 
20 
suspicion that SD partners were being used in an irregular 
way? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now in relation to this affidavit of Mr 
Bester, as I understand it you want to essentially delete 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 131 of 145 
 
your involvement …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say you were not involved, I 
mean essentially when you take issue with the places 
where you refer to. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But you accept from an overall 
perspective this reflects a very serious situation, does it 
not, of an abuse of the SD partner process.  
MR SINGH:   On whose – on whose side, sir? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What Mr Bester ’s version. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the actions of DEC or the actions 
of Transnet or the actions of Hatch? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think Mr Myburgh what he is asking 
is when you say – when you ask him whether he does not 
accept that this evidence reflects very – reflects an abuse 
of the system, I think he wants to know abuse by whom.   I 
think you wanted to know abuse by whom?  Is that right? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, yes, exactly, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well certainly by the SD partners. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of I cannot comment on the 
actions of DEC or any other SD partner that I have not 
engaged with but certainly the environment is one where 
people would ordinarily understand that there are projects 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 132 of 145 
 
that are about to be launched by Transnet, whether it be 
locomotives, whether it be the manganese expansion 
project, the port expansion project, pipeline project and 
they know when these, you know, RFPs go out into the 
market and they engage actively with potential service 
providers and that is as far as I know as to how this 
industry operates.  Like in all industries maybe there are 
people 
that, 
you 
know, 
are 
unscrupulous 
and 
would 
probably use it for other purposes but if you look at this 
specific example, this specific example, as we, from a 
10 
Transnet perspective, we wanted to advance the objectives 
of enhancing the SD criteria and we achieved that.  Hatch 
was appointed, they agreed to a 50% threshold and it came 
with 
an 
opinion, 
so 
from 
Transnet’s 
perspective 
we 
achieved all of the objectives that we wanted and it was a 
desirable outcome for us as Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Whilst we are in the Bierman file, if 
you still have it there, could you turn to page 935 please? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Here you see that Mr Bierman send 
20 
you, it seems, a profiling of DEC, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what you wanted him to do, 
to profile this particular SD partner. 
MR SINGH:   And apparently one other. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 133 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Alright, if we go back then to 
paragraph 29 at page 33 of bundle 4A. 
MR SINGH:   This is Bester. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So paragraph 29, on or about 1 
August …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, we are going back to Mr 
Bester ’s one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Bester ’s affidavit, yes. 
MR SINGH:   The paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   29. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    
“On or about 1 August I received a call from 
Padayachee who indicated he would like to see me 
again.  We agreed to meet on 5 August 2013.  At 
the meeting Padayachee and Reddy advised that 
the confinement approval was imminent but Hatch 
needed to sign an addendum to the MOU that Hatch 
had 
amended. 
 
Before 
confinement 
could 
be 
finalised it was clear that they were not happy with 
20 
Hatch’s proposed amendments, I understood this to 
mean that either Singh would not approve the 
confinement 
in 
order 
for 
Molefe 
to 
give 
final 
approval.  Alternatively, both Molefe and Singh 
would not give the necessary approvals.” 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 134 of 145 
 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I deny the allegations contained in 
this paragraph, it is clearly and patently obvious that Mr 
Bester is speculating again.  He does not – when he is 
confronted by Padayachee and the other gentlemen he 
does not enquire from them as to why they say this, so he 
is now professing and spurious allegation that implicates 
myself and Mr Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so let us then go please to 
paragraph 35. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, we need to just give some 
context to this.  At paragraph 34: 
“On the morning of 7 August Gray and I met with 
Strydom at Woodmead to advise her more fully of 
the situation.  This resulted in Strydom calling 
Sisheke(?), general counsel for TFR at the time.  
Sisheke requested that we, Gray, Strydom and me 
come to the Carlton Centre immediately to brief her.  
We met Sisheke at the Wimpy at Carlton Centre and 
20 
provided her with a full debrief of what had 
transpired up to date.  Sisheke indicated that Hatch 
had done the right thing to elevate the matter to 
TFR. 
 
We 
showed 
the 
Sisheke 
the 
proposed 
addendum by Mr Padayachee and Reddy which she 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 135 of 145 
 
photographed 
using 
her 
iPad. 
 
Sisheke 
then 
indicated that she will inform the right people at 
Transnet and that Hatch should take no further 
steps.  She further advised that Hatch should send 
her in due course an affidavit via email to a private 
Gmail 
account 
setting 
out 
exactly 
what 
had 
transpired.” 
35 – so that is the background. 
“However, I was later informed by Strydom that the 
matter was elevated to Singh who considered the 
10 
matter closed and that no further action is to be 
taken.  This was the same message that Strydom 
told me received from Bouwer.” 
Do you want to comment on that?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again I would just like to highlight 
that it is again very irregular for now not even Mr Bester 
but Mr Gray, who is even more senior than Mr Bester, to 
engage in again these discussions with Ms Strydom during 
a period of time when this is a live procurement event that 
is being conducted, every single Transnet tender that is 
20 
issued with a qualification or a highlight or emphasises the 
fact that if they are any issues relating to any irregularities 
that anyone finds whether it be on the employer ’s side, 
whether it be on the employee’s side.  When I say 
employer, employee, I am talking about it in EPCM terms.  
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 136 of 145 
 
They are compelled to report this through the Transnet tip-
off anonymous hotline. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, assuming you are right, I 
mean, do you think that adds or subtracts from this 
version? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you think it adds or subtracts 
from Mr Bester ’s version? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, it subtracts from Mr Bester ’s 
version 
because 
he 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
appropriate 
10 
procedure to use. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But he is nevertheless telling his 
story, Mr Singh, and perhaps I could just ask you – you 
have already given us that version, you have told us of the 
irregularities, can you now deal with paragraph 35 where 
you refer to? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I have not mentioned any 
irregularities that involve myself. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, no, no, I am not suggesting that. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you have told us about how you 
think Mr Bester conducted himself in an irregular fashion.  
MR SINGH:   Yes and I am highlighting it now that even the 
more senior person in Hatch is engaging in the same 
activities. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 137 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Deal with paragraph 35. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, okay, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is late on Friday but really the 
purpose of this is for you to answer the paragraphs where 
you are implicated. 
MR SINGH:   Well, that is the reason I go back to 34. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Is that the avenues that Ms Strydom was also 
aware of was that she should have followed the Transnet 
trip-off anonymous hotline.  There is a record of this, it is 
10 
outsourced, it was outsourced I think Deloitte or one of the 
companies to be able to take record of these things, there 
was complete – there was a complete policy in how these 
issues must be dealt with.  So if this complaint, as it is 
recorded in paragraph 35, for example, reached the tip-off 
anonymous 
hotline, 
that 
tip-off 
would 
have 
been 
automatically escalated to Mr Molefe and escalated to the 
Chairman of the audit committee. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you please to answer 
paragraph 35? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Based on what I have said, I am responding 
to paragraph 35 by saying I do not believe that that was Mr 
Bouwer ’s response. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What about yours? 
“However I was later informed by Strydom that the 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 138 of 145 
 
matter was elevated to Singh who considered the 
matter closed.” 
That is really what I am trying to ask you to deal with. 
MR SINGH:   But that is my point, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
MR SINGH:   If there were irregularities that they were 
responding to… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   They would have not raised it with me, I was 
the one that was implicated.  There would have been 
10 
alternatives that they would have explored, which is the 
tip-offs anonymous hotline.  Ms Strydom has access to Mr 
Gama who is her direct report. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who it was raised was Sisheke the 
general counsel of TFR. 
MR SINGH:   Exactly, so that is my point, if she did not get 
an appropriate response and this which is being elevated 
to me, the implicated person, and me making a decision 
about what implicates me and closing the matter in my view 
in an inappropriate response, so she would have went and 
20 
elevated it to Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Singh, is it true or is not 
true that the matter was elevated to you and you were 
going to consider and you consider the matter closed? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that matter was never elevated to 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 139 of 145 
 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, perhaps I could deal just 
with one more paragraph.  At 47 please at page 41, 
paragraph 47. 
MR SINGH:   47.  Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“To the best of my knowledge says Bester – sorry to 
my recollection the meeting with Pita which was set 
up to include Singh was held on 22 October 2013.   
10 
I annex a meeting invite from Pita as HP14.  This 
meeting was attended by Graham and me and 
started almost an hour late after Singh had not 
arrived.   Pita said that Singh requested that he 
speaks to us as he, Singh, was busy, but we could 
see him, Singh, pacing up and down in his office 
and even pass us on his way to the restroom.” 
Do you have anything to say about that.    
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair again I do not have a direct 
recollection of this meeting, but I assume that the meeting 
20 
did occur, because Mr Bester attaches a meeting invite for 
that meeting.  Given the date of this meeting in the 
procurement – in the timeline of the procurement events 
that was being, that was unfolding, in terms of the award to 
Hatch, I can only understand that this meeting was not for 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 140 of 145 
 
us to discuss DEC and whether they included or excluded.  
This 
meeting 
was 
particularly 
called 
for 
Hatch 
to 
understand the need for us to meet a 50% SD special and 
for them to actually agree that the 100 or 150million or 
200million premium that they had included in the tender all 
that criteria was unacceptable.  And that is the reason why 
Mr Pita, who was the Chief Document Officer at the time, 
attended that meeting. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You feel you have answered what I 
put to you? 
10 
MR SINGH:   You asked, you read this paragraph and you 
asked me my thoughts.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, thank you.  And then finally 
can I just take you please to page 44, so ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry page 44? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, we can fast forward as lot of 
this, paragraphs 54, 55, 56  your name is mentioned but 
effectively what is contended is that Mr Reddy must set up 
a meeting with you, and I want to get to that meeting, 
paragraph 57.    
20 
“On my arrival at Melrose Arch as I walked towards 
the restaurant I was met by a gentleman who 
introduced himself as Mr Salim Essa.  He said that  
he was there to meet with us as part of the 
discussion with Singh and needed to see if the 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 141 of 145 
 
restaurant is clean.  I asked him where Mr Singh 
was and he said he will call him when he, Essa, is 
ready.  I asked Essa whether he himself works for 
Transnet and he responded that he is “doing a lot of 
things” or something to that effect of I have a lot of 
businesses. 
 
He 
clearly 
had 
no 
intention 
of 
answering my question in detail.  I was surprised at 
the time but as soon as Essa called Singh arrived a 
few minutes later.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Again Mr Chair I deny 
the allegations contained in this paragraph as it is made by 
Mr Bester and I do so for the following reasons.  Mr Chair 
as 
Mr 
– 
or 
Advocate 
Myburgh 
has 
introduced 
this 
paragraph he makes reference to 54, 55, and 56.  These 
paragraphs need an understanding of how this meeting 
came about, so by and large on Mr Bester ’s version this 
meeting came about as a result of the fact that Hatch was 
having 
problems 
in 
settlement 
of 
their 
invoice 
with 
Transnet Capital Projects.  At the time Transnet Capital 
20 
Projects was involved in the new market project pipeline 
project and those are the invoices that they had a problem 
being settled.  I don’t recall the exact issue, I do not recall 
the fact that they were not paid, but that is what Mr Bester 
says.    
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 142 of 145 
 
 
Now there is two issues, the first issue is Mr Bester 
in terms of his title was a director for Rail, now why would 
a director for Rail try and settle ostensibly pipeline 
invoices, which I would assume within the Hatch hierarchy 
would be dealt with by somebody else.   
 
So he references two other colleagues of his that 
were invited to this meeting.  He does not attach any 
meeting 
invites 
for 
these 
two 
individuals, 
as 
in 
an 
organisation as big as Hatch you would expect that these 
things would happen as a matter of course through invites, 
10 
or emails.   He did attach in the meeting with Mr Pita as we 
just heard a meeting invite.  He does not attach the same 
here. 
 
Secondly ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think you mean thirdly. 
MR SINGH:   Thirdly he attends the meeting on his own 
initiation, on his own, allegedly with the CFO of Transnet 
discuss disputed invoice.  For a person that is emanating 
from the Rail business unit to discuss disputed invoices 
related to a pipeline project without the benefit of any 
20 
finance people from Hatch. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Singh did you attend the 
meeting with Mr Essa or not? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Myburgh I have denied the allegations in 
its totality and I am explaining to you why I have done so. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 143 of 145 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well perhaps we should first start 
with that.   He says that the meeting was called, Mr Essa 
was there, Mr Essa called you arrived at the meeting. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I deny that the meeting was called.  
I deny that Mr Essa was there.  I deny that I met Mr Bester 
for the reasons he sets out, for the reasons that I 
indicated.  It is even further very spurious or again it 
questions Mr Bester ’s objectives or character, having 
highlighted all of the issues that he highlighted in terms of 
manner 
in 
which 
he 
was 
dealing 
with 
him 
on 
the 
10 
confinement matter he now seeks assistance from Mr 
Padayachee to be able to resolve a problem for him, and 
you will see Mr Chair as we go through Phase 2 you will 
find a similar problem in that the same, very same DEC 
that Hatch is now complaining about is included as part of 
Manganese Phase 2 as a sub-contractor and that is after 
two 
additional 
interactions 
with 
Mr 
Essa, 
or 
related 
interactions with Mr Essa. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairman I see that it is ten to 
four, if this is an appropriate time to adjourn ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   To adjourn, ja no I think let us adjourn, 
Mr Molefe is done except a very limited portion of his 
evidence that we must still deal with then Mr Singh still 
has quite a lot to deal with. 
 
What is your estimate of how much time you would 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 144 of 145 
 
need with Mr Singh ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About two days, okay, no that is fine.  I 
will try and two days somewhere. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And please Chairperson don’t forget 
about Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes Mr Gama too, and what is our 
estimate? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think he could also be two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two days, okay, I will have to do a 
10 
miracle and find ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are flexible and I am sure we 
can convince our opponents to sit at night and to get 
squeezed into those night sessions if that would be more 
convenient for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, no, no I think everybody is 
cooperative about the evenings as well.  Counsel for Mr 
Singh? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson as far as possible 
we will definitely cooperate – you might not be aware 
20 
sometimes there is prearranged meetings but we will deal 
with it as they come up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay no that is fine.  I am sure it 
is the same with you Mr Singh?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
12 MARCH 2021 – DAY 360 
 
Page 145 of 145 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, I will try and make sure the 
dates are sorted out as soon as possible. 
 
Thank you to everybody, we will adjourn for the day, 
just for the benefit of the public on Monday there will be no 
hearing but on Tuesday and the days after that next week 
there will be evidence relating to Eskom. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
