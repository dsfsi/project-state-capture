PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 10 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am sorry we have had some few 
minutes delay but let us – let us continue.  Mr Molefe good 
morning. 
MR MOLEFE:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oath you took two days ago will 
continue to apply – affirmation I think it was. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Good morning Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Good morning Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yesterday we were on the point of 
ending off the topic of the 100 locomotives.  I just want to 
take you if I may back to the Fundudzi Report.  This is at 
Bundle 6 could I ask you to turn please to page 160. 
CHAIRPERSON:  106? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  160 Chairperson – 160. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  0 – okay.  Is that on Bundle 5? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 6 okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Are you there Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 4 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I just want to direct your attention 
please in closing to – to two paragraphs under the heading 
Conclusion that being Sub 4 and Sub 5.  Paragraph 
5.8.29.4 reads there: 
“Transnet would have saved R1.2 billion if it 
procured a 100 locomotives from the Mitsui 
at R3.188 billion than procuring from CSR 
at R4.4 billion.” 
You want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes this is – this does not compare with 
10 
base price.  It compares the total price which includes the 
other things that I talked about yesterday that are based 
on assumptions 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right. 
MR MOLEFE:  So in fact what that could be is just a 
difference in the different assumptions on hedging, forex 
and so on. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then they go onto to conclude in 
the next sub paragraph: 
“Molefe and Singh failed to conduct a 
20 
cost/benefit analysis when a decision to 
change the locomotives from the 19E Mitsui 
locomotive to the 20CSR locomotive was 
taken.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 5 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja I do remember Chairperson that in the 
memo it refers to the – the project continuing to be NPV 
positive which means that the net present value of the 
acquisition would be positive.  I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The net value of the acquisition would 
be? 
MR MOLEFE:  Net – NPV Net Present Value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  The acquisition would be positive which 
means that it has a positive value to Transnet.  NPV is – ja 
10 
it is a calculation that people make in the financial markets 
to determine 00: 03:33 and investment decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  So generally as a rule a negative NPV 
means you should not do the investment. A positive NPV 
means that you can do the investment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  In fact I think in the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the memorandum. 
MR MOLEFE:  In the memorandum or … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to … 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot remember exactly what it is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Molefe can I ask you is that – 
is the conclusion here does it not go beyond that?  In other 
words you – you – it seems frail to conduct a comparison 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 6 of 258 
 
between the one and the other.  I understand your point 
about the NPV we are going to deal with that perhaps in a 
different context with other people. 
MR MOLEFE:  But it acknowledged that the NPV was 
positive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well if you say that was in the 
memorandum then I will take your words for it but what I 
am looking for here is was there a time where you actually 
did a cost benefit analysis as between the two possible 
deals? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson when you do cost benefit 
analysis there are things like accounting costs and so on 
that are comparable.  But the total – the true cost benefit 
analysis includes things that cannot be quantified in rands 
and cents and these are the considerations that we made 
for example that the locomotives were failing – then the 
three locomotives were failing.  And there is no value that 
is put to that although in the end they will have a cost.   
So that was not the value of the failing locomotives 
is not built into a cost benefit analysis like that  So in the 
20 
end a cost benefit analysis – an accounting cost benefit 
analysis is just a guide.   
In the end you have to go with what you think would 
be in the interest of the company. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now we undertook yesterday to add I 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 7 of 258 
 
think it was 10 pages of documents that you provided to us 
to the bundle.  We have done that but if you could please 
go to Bundle 5 that is your exhibit; Exhibit 22. 
MR MOLEFE:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now if all the administration has 
worked out correctly if I could ask you to turn to page 114.  
Are you in the right file Mr Molefe?  Bundle 5 Exhibit 22. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  My – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what you will find directly after 
10 
114 is a series of documents marked 114.1 – I think you 
may have them there in front of you.  114.1 running 
through to 114.10 do you have those documents? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So these are the documents you gave 
us yesterday. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You recognise them? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what we have done is we have 
20 
added them so they follow directly after your affidavit, you 
see that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would you like an opportunity to 
address the Chairperson on the significance of these 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 8 of 258 
 
documents?  Are there any particular portions that you 
wish to draw to our attention? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson these documents indicate 
the – the correspondence between Transnet Engineering – 
sorry TFR Engineers detailing the failures of the Mitsui 
locomotives. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry I cannot hear you Mr Molefe. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Detailing 
the 
failures 
of 
the 
Mitsui 
locomotives. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  So these different matters and the tables 
that show the instances where the Mitsui locomotives had 
failed in – in the period preceding our decision to do the 
award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your evidence that these were brought 
to your attention before you made the decision to change 
and go with CSR as opposed to Mitsui? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes they were brought to my attention at the 
time but I have recently been able to get these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  That actually show. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. And when we say they were 
brought it might be that it is the problems that were 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 9 of 258 
 
brought or it is the letters giving you – telling you about 
the problems. 
MR MOLEFE:  No, not the letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the letters. 
MR MOLEFE:  In fact that the locomotives had been 
failing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Sorry I just for some 
reason am not picking you up clearly.  Did you say the 
locomotives had failed? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  They were failing yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Failing the Mitsui locomotives.  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if I understand your evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:  Failing means break downs. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No I understand. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As I understand your answer to the 
Chairperson you say that – these documents bear out the 
fact that there was that problem and it was something that 
20 
you knew of at the time. 
MR MOLEFE:  It was something that was brought to my 
attention at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  And they all relate then to 
that topic and issue? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 10 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Generally relate to that topic yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  I would like then if I may to 
turn to a different topic now and that is the procurement of 
the 1064 locomotives.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Molefe I would – I just want 
to sketch some of the evidence that has been given so that 
we can get to the point where I can ask you a few 
questions around this.  
What we have heard and a lot of evidence has been 
10 
given about this was the building of the initial business 
case for the 1064 locomotives and ultimately it would 
appear from the evidence that a final business case was 
adopted by the board on the 25 t h of April.   
Does that accord with your recollection? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it may be a little bit onerous but 
I want to take you to the business case and then to the 
board resolution just so we can place those two documents 
on record and then I will ask you some questions from 
20 
there. 
 
I have asked my colleagues to fish out for you two 
files.  I hope that they have managed to find Exhibit 
BB4(b).  And could I ask you please to turn to page 
FQC402. 
 
You 
will 
see 
that 
this 
is 
an 
attachment 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 11 of 258 
 
incidentally to Mr Callard’s affidavit and it reflects there 
procurement of 1064 locomotives for General Freight 
Business dated submission 25 April addressed to Transnet 
Board of Directors.  And it also titled Procurement of 1064. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Keep your microphone on Mr Molefe at 
all times. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It kept… 
MR MOLEFE:  So it is the file that keeps it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Procurement of 1064 locomotives for 
10 
General Freight Business final version. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now if I could ask you just to keep 
your finger there and then turn all the way to page 516 that 
seems to be the end of the business case.  FQC516.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What I note there is that this 
business case was not signed – this version by you, Mr 
Singh and Mr Gama.  Do you recall signing the final 
version of the business case? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja I think that if the business case was 
presented to the board it must be the final – the signed 
version must have been presented to the board. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Could I ask you then please 
to go to the beginning and then go to page FQC405.  I will 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 12 of 258 
 
take you to the last paragraph of that page.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It says: 
“The 
risks 
that 
are 
inherent 
in 
a 
procurement event of this nature had been 
identified and litigation strategies are in 
place.  Accordingly it is recommended that 
the 
1064 
locomotive 
business 
case 
be 
approved with estimated total costs of the 
acquisition of R38.6 billion as per the 
10 
corporate plan.” 
And it is what is in brackets that as you know has become 
contentious.  So the ETC is R38.6 billion as per the 
corporate 
plan 
(excluding 
potential 
effects 
of 
forex, 
hedging, forex escalation and other price escalations.) 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You would confirm that that was then 
contained in the final business case. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now if I could then ask you – you can 
20 
perhaps keep that open so that we know what the wording 
is.  Could I ask you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I thought that was 405 – 2405 
is that correct? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  FQC405. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 13 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes – no I can see where you are 
indeed.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if I could ask you please Mr 
Molefe to go to Bundle or Exhibit BB4(f).  I think that is 
also been taken out for you.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And BB4(f) is divided into two parts; 
point 1 and point 2 I would like you to go to the first part 
and turn to page YIL23.  It is part of the annexures to Mr 
Laher ’s affidavit or statement. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if we all on the same page what 
you find there is a certified exert from the draft minutes of 
the special meeting of the Transnet board held on the 25 t h 
of April and you will see there 6.1 Procurement of 1063 
locomotives for the TFR General Freight Business resolved 
that the board approved the following: 
The 
business 
case 
for 
the 
acquisition 
of 
the 
1064 
locomotives or TFR’s General Freight Business at an 
estimated cost of R38.6 billion as per corporate plan (and 
20 
the same wording then as the business case excluding 
potential affects from forex hedging, forex escalation and 
other escalations. Confirm that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes and just to add that I presume that they 
were approving the signed document. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 14 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  Which – which I do not know if Transnet 
still has the signed document but that is the document that 
was approved. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You mean the signed business case? 
MR MOLEFE:  The signed business case. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright we will have a – we will have 
a look for that but I assume you must be right that if it was 
presented as you say. 
MR MOLEFE:  Exactly. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And adopted at the board it would 
have been signed. 
MR MOLEFE:  Would it have been – it would have been the 
signed version ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We will – alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  So all I am saying is I do not know if what 
you have just seen now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Is an earlier draft. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  That was not signed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes but the point is it includes the 
same bracketed phrase. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes that – it includes the R38.6 billion yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay. So you know what the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 15 of 258 
 
controversy is in relation to that bracketed phrase? 
MR MOLEFE:  The R38.6 billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  I mean the controversy is that it 
is alleged by some and we will come to the evidence that 
actually the business case in support – in support of the 
R38….. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look this side Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes  I just wanted to hear properly from his 
eye Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I know ja. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So the controversy is and we will 
come to the evidence in a moment that there are some 
witnesses who maintain that the business case ETC 
estimate of R38.6 in fact included hedging and escalation 
costs – did not exclude it.  You know that controversy? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Now what I just want to put 
to you is that in 2018 after these events Mr Laher and Mr 
Moola do you know those gentlemen? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  They were requested by the GCFO. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  to undertake an investigation to 
determine whether the business case ETC estimate of 
R38.6 included hedging and escalation. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 16 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And they were assisted by Mr 
Callard. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ant the conclusion that they came to 
was that the business case and ETC estimate in fact 
included those two things – did not exclude it.  We heard – 
we heard. 
MR MOLEFE:  Was that – was that their conclusion? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well you have heard that evidence 
10 
and you know of it. 
MR MOLEFE:  Come again. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That was their conclusion yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And what was the amount that they 
calculated to 00:19:22 ETC with that exercise? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I get a sense you know the answer to 
that question. 
MR MOLEFE:  Huh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I get a sense you know the answer to 
that question? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay what is it? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson let me – let us just cut to the 
chase.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 17 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Let us cut to the chase. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes absolutely. 
MR MOLEFE:  And just explain what happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson when a procurement of this 
nature is done because we saved an estimate how much 
we think it will cost to buy locomotives and these are big 
numbers.  So the number that you come out as an – with as 
an estimate you can assume that from a negotiation point 
of view that is going to be the base.  That is going to be 
10 
the minimum from which you move from.  And that number 
even if you confidentially take it to the board it is going to 
take – to come out – it is going to – to go out into the 
market.  So this number – the R38.6billion was an – a 
desktop estimate.  It was not even arrived at by doing a – 
by phoning suppliers around and saying how much do you 
think you will sell us a locomotive for?  It was the desktop 
estimate but it had to be a conservative desktop estimate.  
You can imagine Chairperson if we had gone out with an 
ETC of R50 billion we would have ended up at 75 in the 
20 
purchase.  So the ETC was R38 billion it is not a price, it 
was an estimate; a desktop estimate that was done at 
Transnet.  Now people say that the price increased from 
R38 billion to R54 billion.  That cannot be true because the 
R38 billion was not a price.  It is like if you want to buy a 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 18 of 258 
 
car and you budget R100 000.00 and you want to buy a 
specific car.   And then when you go out to go and buy the 
car you find that it is R160.000.00.  Do you say therefore 
that you have just incurred an additional R50 000.00 in 
buying the car?  Just because you estimate your budget 
was R38 billion or the budget that – that you knew would 
become public was R38 billion.  So – so let us start there.  
We went out on tender with an ETC of R38 billion.  The 
tenders came back. When they came back they were 
nowhere near R38 billion.  When – when actually we put 
10 
together – in my affidavit I actually detail this.  If I can go 
to my affidavit?  So we went out with R38 billion and the 
market came back with another number.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think you might be looking for page 
38 Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  38? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is his affidavit on Bundle 5? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle 5. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes 39 page 39 paragraph 55.  The – the 
price that we went out with was in fact R38 billion.  The 
suppliers came back with a number.  In fact that was 
between 38 and 49.  I am just surprised that I did not catch 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 19 of 258 
 
it here.  But it was about 43 of 44 the number.  I am 
surprised that I did not write it down here.  And that was 
their offer when they submitted the tenders.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the offer of who? 
MR MOLEFE:  The bidders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  And so for the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they all more or less around that 
figure would you say? 
MR MOLEFE:  Around 43 – 43 – 44. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja that was the number that they gave 43 – 
44 that was the number that for the first time we saw what 
the market was prepared to pay and it was not 38 billion.  
And that number does not represent an increase from 38 
billion it was what the bidders said they could pay.  So now 
they submitted their tenders and they were evaluated and 
after 
they 
were 
evaluated 
the 
– 
there 
was 
further 
negotiation and the biggest thing in the negotiation was to 
fix the price so that there are no escalations.  After those 
20 
negotiations of hedging and so on and so forth the final 
price that the bidders were prepared to pay was 49 billion.  
To that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually the – the final price that they 
would want Transnet to pay… 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 20 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  That said – sorry that the bidders were 
prepared … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja not the other way around. 
MR MOLEFE:  They were prepared… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To accept. 
MR MOLEFE:  To pay with their locomotives for the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well it is English Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes it is English Chairperson.  But the final 
price that the bidders were prepared … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To accept. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  To receive for their locomotives was R49 
billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  49? 
MR MOLEFE:  49 billion – 49.547. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you moving away from 43 – 44? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja it increased from 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  43 – 44 it increased from the original tender 
price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  The price of their tenders.  If you look at 
paragraph 57 I show you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no let me just – let me make sure.  
First you say Transnet made an estimate. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 21 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the estimate was 38.6billion. 
MR MOLEFE:  38 billion that was desktop estimate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The tenders came in. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the prices were … 
MR MOLEFE:  Higher than… 
CHAIRPERSON:  43 – 44 thereabouts. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are now saying the final price… 
MR MOLEFE:  After negotiations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  After negotiations  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume that that is because – because 
when you negotiate one would have thought that you would 
be wanting to bring them down from 43 – 44. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume that maybe it is because it took 
time and they – there was escalation or how did – how did 
you do so badly instead of bringing them down you 
00:26:38. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So I was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Allowed them to go up. 
MR MOLEFE:  I was not part of the negotiating team but 
the biggest issue in the negotiations was you must give us 
a price that will not change over 7 years.  So you cannot 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 22 of 258 
 
come back and say there was forex, there was this there 
was this it must be fixed price. And for giving us a fixed 
price they wanted to be paid more and that was in my 
understanding 
that 
was 
the 
main 
component 
of 
the 
increase and they took it to 49. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That or they would do – that would 
explain the increase from 43 – 44  
MR MOLEFE:  To 49 
CHAIRPERSON:  To 49. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because now you were speaking of a 
fixed amount over 7 years. 
MR MOLEFE:  Over 7 years yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  And then on top of that – that was what was 
going to be paid to the bidders.  On top of that Transnet 
decided to add onto that price.  It is money that is not 
automatically payable.  It is called a contingence.  So we 
went to the board and said the price is 49 but we would be 
allowed an additional 10% for unforeseen things that 
20 
during the procurement we may require in the locomotives.  
It is like a contingency.  I think it is standard practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that not undermine the whole idea of 
a fixed price? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 23 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They bought the idea of a fixed price to 
have certainty. 
MR MOLEFE:  No the – contingency is – no that there was 
a certainty on what we had agreed on there was a 
certainty.  But then unforeseen is I do not know like what 
but unforeseen things, acts of God things like that were to 
happen or whatever could happen that we would have a 
10% contingency.  Now this is – this is standard practice in 
projects like this that when you have a project amount you 
add onto it a usually 10% contingency.  So if for example 
10 
the procurement even if everything was fixed and so on 
came to not 49. – 49. 547 but came to 50 or 51 that would 
be covered by the contingency.  So it was approved up to 
54.  So it is 49 up to 54 the 10% is a contingency.  Now 
Chairperson in paragraph 57 I show you the summary of 
the per unit price from the bidders.  So the pity that this 
does not translate to the multiplied by the number of 
locomotives but the price per locomotive – the price per 
locomotive at – at submit – at the time of submitting the 
bid from CSR was for example 32.46.  The final price after 
20 
negotiations was 50.48 it increased by 18.02million per 
locomotive.  The increase from Bombardier was twenty 
...[audio cut] million per locomotive, increase.  GE was 
9 million per locomotive and CMR was R 12.42 million per 
locomotive.  So if you take the BAFO multiply by the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 24 of 258 
 
number of locomotives, you will come to the number that I 
am talking about, about 43.  And then if you take the final 
price multiply by the number of locomotives, you will come 
to 49.547 billion. 
 
So there is no one, Chairperson, who sat in a 
room and just increased the price from R 38 billion to 
R 54 billion, costing the taxpayers 15 billion.  Nothing like 
that happened.  It is a fundamental misunderstanding of 
the process and what happened, which is why I could not 
understand that MNS does not understand it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  I think you have 
explained how the price increased but that was not what I 
was dealing with at all. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I did not explain the...  Well, the ETC is 
not the price.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I understand that Mr Molefe but 
there are two different things.  The first issue that should 
be determined is whether in truth the Business Case 
included hedging and escalation or whether it excluded it 
20 
as was represented to the board.  That is what I am 
dealing with now.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are then going to deal after that 
with the increase in the ETC.  Do not worry.  We will come 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 25 of 258 
 
to that but perhaps to just locate my question better.  
Could I ask you to go to Exhibit BB-4(f)?   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Laher ’s exhibit.  I think I have 
take you there a little bit earlier.   
MR MOLEFE:  BB-4(f).  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And the first part point 1 to 
page YIL-17.   
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, Chairperson, if you may indulge?  You 
have asked me a question that I did not answer actually.  
10 
Mr Callard made a calculation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   So did Mr Laher and it is in my, I think it is 
in my affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you could stick with this for a 
moment?  I am taking you to the actual foundation of 
documents. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And Mr Molefe, if I could just ask 
you?  We are dealing now with whether there was a 
20 
misrepresentation of the ETC in relation to excluding 
hedging and escalation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In the Business case. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 26 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In then initial Business Case. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come in time to how 
the ETC increased, as you have explained. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now at paragraph 66, and I take you 
here because I do not want us to misunderstand one 
another and I want to ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Page 17? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 17, paragraph 66. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“In January 2018, Mohamed Moola, Executing 
Manager of Finance Capital Programme and 
I... [that is Mr Laher] ...received a request 
from the then GCFO, Gary Pita, by the TFR 
CFO, Ms Kolane, to confirm that they have a 
Business Case pricing included or excluded 
forex hedging and escalation costs...” 
 
But that is the first controversy here. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“Upon consulting with Francis Callard, ex-
Transnet 
employee, 
who 
was 
key 
in 
the 
original Business Case calculations. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 27 of 258 
 
In January 2018 and reviewing the Business 
Case calculations, Moola and I concluded that 
the Business Case calculations actually did 
include forex and hedging costs...” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“...and that the recommendation within the 
R 38.6 billion Business Case to the board in 
April 2013 (that the ETC excluded these costs) 
was incorrect...” 
10 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that is what I am asking you 
about.  They came to the conclusion that was submitted to 
the board was incorrect.  Now what is your answer to that? 
MR MOLEFE:   The R 38.6 billion? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  The exclusion, the bracketed 
portion, they concluded was incorrect. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So my question is.  If they say the 
R 38.6 billion included the forex and hedging costs.  What 
20 
portion of the R 38.6 billion was the forex and hedging 
costs?  And on top of that.  What were the assumptions 
behind the correlation ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...of those costs? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 28 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...because forex and hedging costs, as I 
pointed out yesterday, depend on – because their future 
based on ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...your view of what is going to happen on 
the future are very difficult to estimate going forward.  So, 
ja, if they excluded or included, if they did make a detailed 
calculation.  What portion of it was this forex and hedging 
costs ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But let us just ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...on the R 38.6 billion? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay but you accept that is what is 
recorded as the conclusion here?  I understand what you 
are saying ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   That may be ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   That may be their conclusion but from 
where I was sitting ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   ...the figure was R 38.6 billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   They would go out on tender.  They would 
come up with numbers.  We would negotiate and that will 
be the final price. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 29 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but from where you were sitting 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...did the initial Business Case 
include or exclude hedging and escalation? 
MR MOLEFE:   There was no calculation made of exactly 
how much the forex and hedging ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did it include or exclude it? 
MR MOLEFE:   There was an assumption that they would 
be there. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it included it? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But it was represented to the board 
that they were excluded.  That is the whole point.  That is 
the whole controversy.   
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, from where I was sitting, the 
figure was R 38.6 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Including? 
MR MOLEFE:  The 38 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Point 6. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  The ETC was R 38 billion that we went to 
the board with.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but his question is and my 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 30 of 258 
 
understanding is that you have answered but he just wants 
to make sure is that.  His question is whether that estimate 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  The passage from the Business Case that 
we read ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Included. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...said it excluded ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  ...forex.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what was your understanding? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, my understanding, to put it goodly is, it 
did not really matter.  So the Business Case says it 
excluded.  That was the R 38 billion excluded.  That is 
fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure how...  It is rather 
surprising to me if you say it did not matter whether it 
excluded or included because I would have thought that it 
could significantly – it could make a big difference in terms 
20 
of your budgeting and how much you could be talking about 
and it might be... 
 
My assumption is that it would be important to 
know whether - when you as the management say to us as 
the board, if I was in the board, when you say your 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 31 of 258 
 
estimate of what Transnet is going to pay is R 38.6 billion. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you taken that count all risks?  We 
know that it is an estimate but you have taken account 
everything that you should take into account?  And if you 
say:  Look, well, it excluded this cost....  Or do you say we 
included?   
 
Certainly, I would want to know whether it is 
excluded or included because then I can decide what is the 
reality I must work on in terms of the amounts.   
10 
 
Because if those costs are bound to come in, 
maybe I may as well make whatever decision on the basis 
that this 38 is quite low, you know, in terms of reality 
because those costs will come in at some stage.   
 
So I am just saying, I would have expected that 
it should matter whether they are included or excluded.  
The board should know. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  You see, Chairperson, what we are 
trying to determine here is whether the R 38 billion was a 
perfect number, whether it was a number that reflected, 
20 
really, that what you are trying to determine.  Ja.  I am 
saying it did not and it did not have to.  Ja.  It was a 
number that we would go out to market with.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:  The number that reflects reality is the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 32 of 258 
 
number that bidders come back with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  That is what happens.  The rest of the 
things, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:  Once person can say this locomotive is 
R 20 million 
and 
another 
says 
this 
locomotive 
is 
R 25 million.  The difference in the five million can be 
justified using a myriad of reasons.  At the end of the day, 
the question is, the price of the locomotive is what they put 
10 
to you as and if they are willing to pay for it.  That is the 
final...   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:  If they come up with a number for the price 
of a locomotive that we are not willing to pay, there is no 
price.  If the bidders looked at our R 38 billion with or 
without forex hedges and so on and other things...  
 
We could have put in the cost per screw that is 
in every locomotive, the cost per wheel of a locomotive, 
the cost per steering wheel, the cost of a breaking system, 
20 
the cost of...   
 
So we could have detailed it.  At the end of the 
day, what matters is, is the number at the bottom and it 
was R 38 billion.  So it had forex.  The Business Case says 
it did not.   
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 33 of 258 
 
 
So what I am saying is.  This exercise of 
determining whether the R 38 billion included or did not 
exclude forex hedging.  It does not matter.  What matters 
is, what were the bidders willing to pay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Myburgh will continue with his 
questions but let me put this to you at a, maybe a principle 
level or a general level.  If I am going to drive from Durban 
to Johannesburg ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I am a former Chief Group Executive 
10 
of Transnet ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  You are you going to drive? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  I am going to drive. Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Durban to Johannesburg. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And not go by train. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  It might not matter how much 
petrol I will have to put in and the tolls, how much I will 
have to pay in terms of toll charges but for somebody else, 
20 
if you tell him only about – or her about only the petrol, the 
cost of petrol for that trip and you do not tell him what – 
that there are toll charges that will have to be paid and so 
on and so forth.  It might make a big difference to that 
other person but maybe not somebody else. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 34 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, Chairperson, so when you are going to 
drive from Durban to Johannesburg.  What are the costs?  
So it is petrol. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And tolls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And what else? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know if there is any but 
those are definitely. 
MR MOLEFE:  Those are the costs, né? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  So there is wear and tear of your tyres. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  There is the cost per kilometre of running 
your engine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  There is the oil. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Even if it is just a small amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Right?  And then in – on the way, your car 
maybe chipped, the windscreen maybe chipped.  There is 
the damage to the paint.  Even if it is small, that is a cost, 
right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 35 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   So what I am saying is that, at the end of 
the day, the question is.  Are you willing to pay R 500,00 to 
travel from here to Durban or are you willing to pay 
R 1 000,00.  That is what matters.  But going – being 
productive and saying:  Ja, but you did not take into 
consideration the costs of the damage to the paint.  I 
mean, as you have just demonstrated.  Even the cost of 
the tyres was not factored into your own calculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  And what I am saying is that, the bottom line 
10 
is.  What are you prepared to pay to travel from here to 
Durban?  Prepared to pay to travel from here to Durban, 
even when you do not know what the costs of the wear and 
tear of the tyres are.  And I am saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But the cost of the wear and tear of the 
tyres might be a long-term thing but in the example I am 
giving you, the issue of the toll charges will have to be 
paid. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Petrol, you must have money for petrol. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might arrive in Gauteng without 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...your ...[intervenes]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 36 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  So those are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you do not tell the person about 
the charges for the toll, you know, it seems to me that that 
would be critical but you might say ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You might say the example of the toll 
might not fit into the locomotives.  I am not sure 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in terms of these costs. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   See, you are elevating the hedging costs to 
the price of the toll. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
that 
is 
why 
I 
am 
saying 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   There are things like the hedge of costs 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...are like the wear and tear ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...of the tyres. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   And the oil and other things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   So at the end of the day, Chair, you can go 
and see the car hire companies.  They charge different 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 37 of 258 
 
amounts per kilometre for hiring their cars.  So if you were 
to ask:  How do you arrive at this amount?   
 
They would show you different methodologies.  
And the methodologies are infinite of how those amounts 
are calculated but at the bottom of it, it is just a gut feel.  
It is just a gut feel Chair.  What matters is, how much are 
people willing to receive for a locomotive and how much 
are you willing to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe, before 
10 
you 
engaged 
in 
answering 
questions 
as 
by 
the 
Chairperson.  I think that the record will reflect that what 
you said was this.  From where I was sitting, I assumed 
that the Business Case included hedging and escalation.  
Do you recall saying that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I did so but the Business Case, as you 
pointed out, had then corrected me, said it excludes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But what that reflects ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   What that reflects is that that was not 
uppermost in my mind. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am not worried about ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   What was uppermost in my mind was, what 
will the bidders be willing to pay? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 38 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   And to receive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that you understand, please.  
Is, that is not what we are trying to determine, to use your 
language.  At the moment, I am exploring with you an 
allegation, as you know, that you misrepresented the 
Business case to the board.   
 
And the allegation, as you know, is that you 
misrepresented the ETC to the board when saying it 
excluded hedging and escalation when it in fact included it 
10 
and it seems to be me that you made that concession 
earlier in your evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay Chair, I may well have, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do not want to change your 
evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do not want to change your 
evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   I tried to explain Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   ...that this thing that you are going on 
about was from where I was sitting not an important issue.  
I think we are nit-picking about the wear and tear of the 
tyres, really ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let us come to the importance 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 39 of 258 
 
of that. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...in the trip from Durban to here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  I will come to the 
importance of it because it becomes more apparent.  So 
when Mr Callard and Mr Moola say that they reran the 
numbers and they came to a conclusion that the original 
Business Case included forex and hedging, you would 
agree with that. 
MR MOLEFE:   No.  You see, this is exactly my point. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   So there was a Business Case of 
R 38 billion.  Mister...  Is it Laher? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Moola and Laher. 
MR MOLEFE:   Laher? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
MR MOLEFE:   Recalculated it and came to a calculation of 
R 43 billion, is it? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, they did not Mr Molefe.  You 
really are...  If you bear with me what happened.  You see, 
these people were asked to two things. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
ADV 
MYBURGH SC:   
Firstly, they 
were asked to 
determine, did the original Business Case include hedging 
and escalation.  And you have excepted it did.  Then what 
they were asked to do, is they were asked – and Mr Laher 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 40 of 258 
 
deals with this:  We were also requested to recalculate the 
ETC in the Business Case adjusted to factors for which we 
now know ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...i.e. contract delivering... exchange 
rate, et cetera. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then they came to that figure.  
And that related to whether the increase from R 38 billion 
to R 55 billion was justifiable but what they were first ask 
10 
to do is to determine whether the initial Business case of 
36.8 billion included hedging and escalation.  And you 
have accepted that it did.  So I presume, you do not take 
issue with that part of the evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And what is also important 
is.  Dr Fine of McKinsey gave evidence before this 
Commission.  Did you have occasion to hear or learn of his 
evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  So on Day 322, the 
10 t h of December 2020, Mr Fine was examined by my 
colleague, Mr Chaskalson ...[intervenes]  
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
But 
I 
was 
issued 
with 
a 
3.3 
or 
...[intervenes]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 41 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, no. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...I was not implicated?  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am going to read to you what 
Mr Fine said. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At line 20.   
“There are a couple of point I just want to 
stress up front.  McKinsey predominantly was 
involved 
in 
the 
Business 
Case 
and 
that 
Business Case did confirm Transnet’s numbers 
10 
of 38.6 billion including, and to be precise, 
including 
foreign 
exchange 
and 
including 
escalations...” 
 
You would agree with that evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then, of course, importantly is 
the evidence of Mr Choubey.  Perhaps we can go that and 
no doubt you will agree with it as well. 
MR MOLEFE:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That you will find, and we have been 
20 
to one of these reports yesterday.  Could I ask you, please, 
to go to Exhibit BB-8(b). 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if I could ask you, please, and 
this is again something divided into two parts. We are 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 42 of 258 
 
dealing with part 1.  And if I could ask you...  Well, let us... 
in fact, let us go to page 1.   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There you will find the affidavit of 
Mr Choubey.  And if I could take you, please, then to page 
7 at paragraph 4? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Summary of findings, 4.1: 
“I 
concluded 
from 
the 
investigations 
on 
acquisitions of the 1064 Locomotives that: 
10 
1.1. The variables and assumptions used to 
model 18 April 2013 Business Case were 
reasonable. 
1.2. The 
ETC 
of 
R 38.6 billion 
included 
escalation and foreign currency exchange 
rate 
hedging 
costs 
and 
was 
an 
acceptable estimate for the total cost of 
acquiring the locomotives...” 
 
Now you have accepted that, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then he goes on to deal with 
another question and that was that the 41% increase in the 
ETC from R 38.6 billion to R 54.5 billion was not in its 
totality justifiable.  Now that is a different question which 
we are going to come to. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 43 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   No, not only that.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   It displays mister...  What is his name?  
Choubey? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Choubey. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Mr Choubey’s lack of experience. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...and unprofessionalism. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, fair enough.  We are going to 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Because he says the increase in ETC from 
R 38.6 billion 
to 
R 54.5 billion 
was 
not 
justifiable.  
R 54.5 billion is not ETC.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  We are going to come to that 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   So those two numbers, R 38.6 billion is 
ETC.  R 54.5 billion is something else. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   R 54.5 billion is based on what the bidders 
gave us as prices. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...he is comparing things that a person with 
a minimum of understanding of finance ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...should not be comparing. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 44 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But the only point is.  I am still 
dealing at the moment with the first question that he was 
asked to examine and there it seems to be common cause 
between us.  So let us then go forward in the chronology.  
We know that on the 23 r d of May 2014, you and Mr Singh 
and Mr Gama recommended to the BABC that there should 
be an increase in price.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   We recommended that there should be an 
increase? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now we are getting to the 
10 
23 r d  of May 2014.   
MR MOLEFE:   Can I see that recommendation? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I could ask you, please, to go to 
page...  Ah, sorry.  To Exhibit BB-4(b).   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think we have looked at it already.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the page. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Exhibit BB-4(b).  And I would like to 
take you, please, Chairperson to page FQC-714.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this was the memorandum that I 
was referring you to.  714.  It is to the Board Acquisition 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 45 of 258 
 
and Disposal Committee and it is from yourself.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, sorry.  Are you not there? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you there Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you, please – you can 
keep your finger there, but can you turn forward to page 
FQC-731?  It is signature page. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   731. 
MR MOLEFE:   731? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, 731. 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is recommended by Mr Singh, 
Mr Gama 
and 
you 
in 
turn 
and 
you 
signed 
on 
the 
23 r d  of May 2014.  Is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you then to turn back to 
page 714? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Seven...? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   714. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you read what the purpose of 
your 
memorandum 
was, 
into 
the 
record, 
please?  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 46 of 258 
 
Paragraph 1. 
MR MOLEFE:   To note the reasons for the increase in 
ETC? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  That is A.  And B? 
MR MOLEFE:   “To request that the... is recommending an 
increase in the ETC from 1064 to... from R 38.6 billion to 
R 54.5 billion.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what the purpose was, to request 
a recommendation of an increase in the ETC.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So perhaps Mr Choubey is not as 
incompetent as you thought. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  I just saw that too. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 Alright. 
 
Let 
me... 
let 
me 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   But can we clarify one thing?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I first go to what was 
recommended and then I will give you the opportunity.  I 
20 
just want to finish off this document. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you go to page FQC-731. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There, it is recommended that, at 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 47 of 258 
 
108, paragraph B, the BABC ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...recommends an increase. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The estimated total cost ETC for the 
acquisition of the 1064 Locomotives, Transnet Freight 
Rail... R 38.6 billion to R 54.5 billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  What is it that you wanted to 
explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that.  I think Mr Myburgh – to Mr 
Choubey, you need to say exactly what you meant. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am going to come back to Mr Choubey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well maybe that might be too far. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   In fact what Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What all three of us know nothing about. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, about the ETC increase and ETC, I 
think that is what you were talking about. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, Mr Choubey was asked to 
determine whether the increase in the ETC was reasonable 
and justifiable and that was the correct question to be 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 48 of 258 
 
asked based on this memorandum submitted and approved 
by 
or 
recommended 
by 
Mr 
Molefe. 
 
Chairperson 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe we were at cross-purposes 
and 
both 
of 
you 
may 
indicated 
if 
I 
misunderstand 
something.  Mr Molefe had criticised Mr Choubey for 
talking about an increase of ETC from 38.6 billion to 54 
point whatever on the basis that 54 point whatever billion 
was not …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   The ETC. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The ETC.  So but this memo here that 
has got his signature also talks along the same lines.  That 
is that we were all talking about. 
MR MOLEFE:   Except that in substance the 54.5 billion is 
not an estimate, it is the outcome of negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, you were making the point.  
My understanding was simply that you were saying he was 
– well, firstly, using wrong language because 54 is not 
ETC.  But two, you were saying that it reflected a 
fundamental I misunderstanding on his part. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So at this stage I am simply saying 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps, Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at least the language seems to be 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 49 of 258 
 
same as in your memo.  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, perhaps, Chairperson, our using of 
that same language in this memo reflects a similar 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Error. 
MR MOLEFE:   Amateurism. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, I think that is fair enough. 
MR MOLEFE:   That we also heard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is fair, that is fair enough. 
MR MOLEFE:   But the substance, the substance is that 
10 
the difference between the 38.6 billion is that the 38.6 
billion was an estimate of what the trains would cost, 54 is 
the actual cost.  So actually on reflection this should not 
have been crafted as an increase in ETC, it was to say that 
we had budgeted to spend 38.6 billion, the reality is that 
the trains are going to cost 54.5 billion after the bidder 
submitted the price and after negotiation.  And I think what 
the memo tries to capture is the differences that led to the 
increase of 54.5 billion or rather 49 because 5 million of it 
is contingency.  Ja, so the main drivers are what is 
20 
captured in the memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
MR MOLEFE:   So – and these main drivers were the 
outcome of negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Is it a convenient time to take the tea 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 50 of 258 
 
adjournment, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are – we still have five minutes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if you want to use that. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes.  Without wanting to be uncharitable to 
you, Mr Molefe, do I understand you now to say that insofar as 
there was amateurism it was now on your part, not on Mr 
Choubey’s part. 
MR MOLEFE:   All of us. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So let us then have a look at the reasons 
10 
for this increase.  This is at page FQC 714.  Executive 
summary, paragraph 2: 
“In summary, the increase in the ETC of 15.9 billion 
can be attributed to the following.” 
And you will see there that there are four or five different 
reasons.  Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And the one causing the greatest increase 
in the ETC was risk mitigation, forex and escalation.  Do you 
see that? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And do you understand the controversy, 
controversy is that was actually included in the initial business 
case. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 51 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you accept then that that accounted for 
59% of the increase? 
MR MOLEFE:   Forex and …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Escalation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Escalations are functions of assumptions that 
change with time even with the people that are calculating it.  
So if I was to ask you if they were included in the 38 billion, 
how much was it and what were the assumptions? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Can we turn to the next page? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   Page      FQC 715, background. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Paragraph 14. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now perhaps one gets a better sense of the 
problem: 
“The acquisition of the 1064 locomotives was approved 
by the board of directors in April 2013 at a cost of 38.6 
billion. This excluded the following costs.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Hedging and escalation.  In other words, 
what is presented to the board is that this massive change in 
the ETC is attributable by and large 59% to the fact that we 
initially excluded these costs and now they are being included, 
which you accept is wrong.  Your own case is they were 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 52 of 258 
 
included initially.  Do you see the problem, Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  Okay, so then comes the issue of 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, can I make a point? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   With the different assumptions that are being 
made on the calculation of this ETC.  The fact of the matter is 
that there was a calculation of billion with or without correct 
hedging and assumptions and so on, there was a figure of 38 
10 
billion.  Then Mr – is it Laher, was asked to calculate ETC.  So 
he calculated ETC and came to about I think 43 billion, 
thereabouts.  He says in his evidence that I recalculated it and 
this is what I arrived at and then Mr Callard also made a 
calculation of the ETC.  I not sure what his assumptions were 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes but, Mr Molefe, what you, with respect 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I am trying to – I am trying to… 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am sorry, carry on. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   So they were actually of the ETC, so these 
three calculations are based on the first figure.  So the first 
one is 38 billion unless this agreement or a controversy or 
representations or misrepresentations that it did or did not 
include hedging.  So that was 38 billion.  Mr I think Laher 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 53 of 258 
 
calculated to 43 billion.  Mr Callard made a calculation of 
the ETC.  So what he did is he went back to the desk and 
recalculated the ETC and his figure was 45 billion and the 
final figure was 49 billion.   
All I am trying to say, Chairperson, is that in the 
calculation of these ETCs, the negotiations and so on, you 
are bound to come up with different numbers.  But that was 
not the point of executive decision, executive decisions 
are can you live with what the bidders are prepared to 
receive and if you look at the paragraph 7 of this memo, it 
10 
says: 
“The NPV of the business case remains positive at 
11.68 billion and 49 billion.” 
So the NPV remains positive at 49 billion.  From and 
executive decision point of view that is sufficient to tell us 
whether or not to proceed with the negotiated 49 billion 
plus contingencies or not.  That is the decision-making 
process in a transaction like this.  We hardly ever got into 
– or at least at the level of the CEO, into the pedantic 
calculations of the assumptions behind forex escalations 
20 
or not.  What we want to know is, 49 billion, is it fixed, 
does it have a positive NPV? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, is this an appropriate time now to 
take the tea adjournment. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 54 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea adjournment.  We – 
I am just going to add another five minutes in order to 
attend to somebody.  We will adjourn, we will resume at 
twenty five to.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Thank you.  Mr Molefe, we were dealing 
10 
with FQC page 714.  Are you still there, in EXHIBIT BB4(b).  
I think you probably have it in front of you there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that so I can check whether I 
have got it here. 
ADV MYBURGH:   EXHIBIT BB4(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  I have got it. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And page, Chairperson, FQC 714. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   It is your memorandum to the BADC, do 
you have it? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I just want to turn to one other thing.  If 
you go to page 717, you see at paragraph 23 says: 
“The increase in the ETC of 15.9 billion is due to the 
following reasons.” 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 55 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I just want to drop down to (d), we have 
already dealt with others.  (d) says: 
“The cost of reducing the batch size.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And it cross-refers to item (d) of table 2.  
Could I please take you to that, it is over the page at FQC 
718. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you will see that if you look on the 
right hand said then you will see a letter d and on the left of 
that it talks about batch pricing adjustment, then you get d 
and the amount attributable to that is 2.7 billion.  Do you 
confirm that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  Now what we know – so this is a 
memorandum to the BADC which you sign on the 23 May. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Would you agree that on the same day 
20 
you made the same recommendation to the board of 
directors in another memorandum. 
MR MOLEFE:   To reduce the batch price. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   To reduce the batch, the batches. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 56 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, you made exactly the same 
recommendation that you made here to the BADC at page 
714. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Running through to page 731.  You made 
the same recommendation to the board. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Let us go to that document.  That 
document you find in another file, Mr Choudey’s file.  
BD8(b). 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now that file is divided into two parts, we 
are dealing with part 1, so it’s EXHIBIT BD8(b.1).  Could I 
take you please to page – these are red numbers on the 
right hand side page 165. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright, could I just ask you to confirm that 
this is the same memorandum. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   165, it runs through where it is signed at 
20 
182. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright and then I would just ask you to 
confirm that on the 28 May 2014, a few days later, the board of 
directors in fact approved your recommendation. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 57 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Perhaps I could take you to the Fundudzi 
report, that is in bundle 6.  If I could take you please to page 
184. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it bundle 6, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, bundle 6, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And page 184 did you say? 
ADV MYBURGH:   184, correct.  If I could ask you, Mr Molefe, 
please to have a look at the heading towards the middle of the 
page, Board Meeting on 28 May and there at paragraph 
10 
5.9.12.7: 
“On 28 May the board noted the reasons for the 
increase in the ETC and approved an increase in the 
ETC for the acquisition of the 1064 locomotives for 
GFB from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion.” 
Do you confirm that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Except, Chairperson, the use of ETC in 
all these documents is unfortunate.  The 54.5 billion was not 
an estimate, it is what the negotiated actual price was, 49 
billion plus 10% contingency of 5 billion.  So it is really not an 
20 
increase, the 64.5 billion is the negotiated price for the 
locomotives and the negotiations had different aspects to 
them, 
different 
things 
that 
were 
negotiated 
during 
the 
negotiations that came – that brought the amount to 64 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course what you sought to do 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 58 of 258 
 
through these two memoranda, one to the – is it the BADC? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the other to the board, was you sought 
to explain to them how come there was such a big gap 
between the ETC of R38.6 billion that you had told them about 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   And the actual price. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the actual price. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you sought to explain that. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in doing so you brought in the 
issue of these costs. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And said they had been excluded when 
in fact they had been included.  It think that is where we 
are. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   So, Mr Molefe, I just want to put it to you 
20 
that on your evidence then it seems there is a further 
misrepresentation made to the board because you represented 
the [indistinct] increase in the ETC, you did not represent that 
it was the contract price. 
MR MOLEFE:   But it is the contract price. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 59 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes but you are not listening to my acuity, 
please.  On your own version there is then a misrepresentation 
to the board, another misrepresentation. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
I 
doubt 
if 
anybody 
understood this, even the use of the ETC to mean that the 
54 billion was an estimate, it was the negotiated price, it 
was the price that we were going to pay for the 
locomotives. 
ADV MYBURGH:   so your answer is that – well, do you accept 
that 
it 
is 
a 
misrepresentation 
or 
not? 
 
You 
made 
a 
10 
recommendation.  On the basis of your recommendation it was 
then 
approved 
in 
the 
exact 
terms 
where 
the 
board 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, it would be a misrepresentation if there 
was anybody in the board who thought that we were still 
trying to estimate.  We were not trying to estimate, this 
was the actual cost, the use of terminology is unfortunate.  
But from the board’s understanding I am confident that the 
board understood this to mean this is the price that we are 
going to pay for the locomotives. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Where did you tell the board that you had 
already concluded the contract. 
MR MOLEFE:   The negotiations, the negotiations were 
concluded at this point. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright, now …[intervenes] 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 60 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Myburgh seems to establish 
whether in the memorandum you told the board that the 
negotiations had been concluded, this was going to be the 
price.  You must tell me, Mr Myburgh, if I understood your 
question. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, correctly reformulated, thank you, 
Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:   Now, Chairperson, I would have to go and 
look at the point exactly when the board was told that the 
10 
negotiations were concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Could I ask you then to turn back 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe – I am sorry – are you going to, 
among other things, look at the memo to see whether that 
point was made or you are saying no, I did not make that point 
in the memo but the board had been told at some stage before 
the memo that the negotiations had been concluded? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja,. Either at some stage or in the memo, I 
20 
am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   I will have to go look exactly when the 
board was told that this was [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 61 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine, I just wanted to 
be sure.   
MR MOLEFE:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] the 
price. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to be sure whether as far as the 
memo is concerned there is an acceptance that is not there but 
you will check somewhere but you are saying you will check in 
the memo and you will check elsewhere.  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH:   Thank you.  Mr Molefe, could I please ask 
you to go back to Mr Choubey’s file, EXHIBIT BB8(b.1)  Now 
10 
if you please to page 36, Mr Choubey deals with the 
increase in the ETC from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion and 
ultimately you will see that if you go over the page to 
paragraph 9.52 he says: 
“Our finding was that the increase argued for in the 
memorandum to the board...” 
This is yours. 
“...was unjustifiably high.” 
Own emphasis.  And then he deals with the reasons for the 
increase in the STC and he deal with – the ETC, I beg your 
20 
pardon, deals with all of them.  If you go, for example, to 
page 38, risk mitigation, forex and escalation, Transnet 
engineering contingencies, he deals with batch pricing. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Page 40 he deals with build-up to the ETC 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 62 of 258 
 
of 54.5 million (sic), he looks forward, he looks backwards.  If I 
could ask you to have a look at, for example, page 646, 
forward escalation, how did I arrive at the escalation costs, 
foreign codes and hedging costs again at 47.  How did I 
compute the FX hedging costs at 48.  Deals with contingencies 
and then this is his conclusions …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   And he is talking about his own 
calculations, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Can I ask you please to go – because that 
is what your – you convinced the board to approve, he is 
10 
dealing with their approval.  Now let us go to the conclusion 
please. 
MR MOLEFE:   On page? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Page 50.  He concludes that: 
“The 
deterioration 
and 
economic 
conditions, 
inflation in foreign currency, warranted an increase 
in the ETC of 38.6.” 
So he says it should have gone up. 
“An increase of 15.9 billion...” 
Which is what you sought approval for. 
20 
“...was, however, not justifiable.  Barring the 
additional 
costs 
that 
come 
from 
Transnet 
engineering opine that an 11% in the ETC from 
36.6 billion to 42.8 billion would be reasonable 
allowing for the Transnet engineering cost of 2.6 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 63 of 258 
 
billion, an 18% increase in the ETC to 45.4 billion 
would have been reasonable.” 
So what do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, so this was Mr Callard’s calculation. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I beg your pardon? 
MR MOLEFE:   This was Mr Callard’s calculation. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, no, this is not Mr Callard’s calculation, 
this is Mr Choubey the expert’s calculation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And we are going to come to Mr Callard.  
10 
Can you please just direct your attention to this? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I will take you and I know you want to refer 
to Mr Callard or Mr Laher.  We will go there and I am asking 
you please to address this conclusion.  What do you say, is it 
like what you said yesterday that this is an art and not a 
science? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, exactly. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay.  Anything else to add to that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, if you look at my affidavit, so 
the original ETC calculation was 38 billion with – or 
without some of the assumptions that it had made.  In 
January 2018, paragraph 59 of my affidavit, page 40, it 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 64 of 258 
 
says: 
“January 2018 Mr Francis Callard reviewed and 
recalculated the ETC.  His revised number was 
40.457 billion.” 
And this is in the statement of Mr Yusuf Laher.  And then 
this number of Mr …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Cavil. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, of Mr Callard.  Was further revised by 
a group of Transnet professionals to 45.8 billion.  Now 
according to Mr Laher, this amount was 3.747 billion lower 
10 
than the original contracted price.  So this amount is 3 
billion less than the 49 billion.  So the ETC was 
recalculated by Mr Callard to 40.457 billion, Mr Laher 
calculated it to 45.8 billion and then Mr Choubey gave 
another number. 
ADV MYBURGH:   45.4 billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   45.4 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think you must just repeat that, 
you were too far away from mic that last sentence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Choubey came to a number, 45.4 billion.  
20 
I think this demonstrates my point that this was not a 
science, this is a – the oddest number, none of them is 
wrong, they just used different assumptions.  They just used 
different,  assumptions.  The question is, Chairperson, and 
in fact there is a document that has also come to my 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 65 of 258 
 
attention in the last week that I did not include which is a 
presentation that Mr Callard made when he was calculating 
his amounts and I will make it available to – in a 
presentation called – entitled – the presentation has been 
compiled to present work done to date into the data analysis 
investigation of the 1064 locomotives deal at Transnet.  It is 
intended 
to 
solicit 
buy-in 
for 
the 
approach 
and 
methodologies proposed to facilitate discussion work-in-
progress. 
 
Mr 
Callard 
observes 
in 
a 
slide 
in 
the 
presentation that: 
10 
“The 
original 
case 
was 
based 
on 
high 
level 
assumption for price escalation and changes to 
forex.  He also says there were not detailed 
supplier quotations and thus –supply quotations and 
thus are not at the same level of detail as the data 
received post RFQ hence direct comparison to the 
original business case is not possible.” 
This is what Mr Callard says in a presentation on the 22 
October 2018, a position that I agree with but my point was, 
there were several calculations that were made and to 
20 
demonstrate my point, there is not one calculation – two 
calculations that came up with the same number of the ETC.  
They had ranged from 38 billion to 45.something billion.  
Right?   
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 66 of 258 
 
 
If you are the CEO, a reasonable CEO, that has to go 
out to my board.  Which number do you go out with?  Which 
number do you permit to be a known number that you are 
prepared to pay and I will argue 38 billion, that 38 billion is 
what we are prepared to pay for the locomotives?  That is 
the number that we went out with because I went to the 
board by putting it in the business case that is the number 
that we were indirectly communicating.  I talked about some 
time ago a negotiation tactic.  If you are going to – if you 
know that you are going to negotiate and granted, these 
10 
calculations were not there but if they had been made they 
would have come with different bundle.   
 
The 38 billion was a reasonable number to go out 
with.  These calculations just show that in fact at 49 billion 
we were not so far off the mark.  The increase was in fact 
not 16 billion.  If you take – even if you take the average of 
the three numbers and calculate the difference or if you take 
the range or the midpoint or whatever of the three numbers 
that were calculated because in valuations actually you do 
not use one number, you use a range.  
20 
So if this was to be taken as a range, the increase 
from the business case to – or the estimated total cost to the 
actual number, at worst was about 3 billion.  At worst was 
about 3 billion and yet – and so and the 3 billion was an 
outcome of negotiations. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 67 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   So if I could just take you if I do not mind 
to…[intervenes] 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Chair?  Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Mr Molefe referred to a document that he 
has recently come across, I want to confirm that during break I 
brought this to the attention of Mr Myburgh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   And would appreciate it if it find its way 
into the bundles of the Commission.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   This is a presentation that was prepared 
by Mr Callard. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, we gave the same undertaking as we 
did yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Once we have a copy we will attend to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Perhaps I could just ask my learned friend if 
he has an electronic version of it if he could in the interim 
20 
send it to my junior and we will process it perhaps at lunchtime 
even. 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Chair, I want to confirm that I have 
already sent to Ms Lee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 68 of 258 
 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So can I – Mr Molefe, let me take you to Mr 
Laher’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is to whose affidavit? 
ADV MYBURGH:   That is where you get your figures from that 
you have been speaking about.  Go to EXHIBIT BB4(f) 
please?  BB4(f).  Pardon, page YIL18.  Now you will see at 
paragraph 69 at the top. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Callard’s figure of 40.457 billion 
excluded the impact of using Transnet engineering.  Do you 
see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Choubey’s figure, if you excluded 
Transnet engineering, as you know is 42.8.  Do you see 
that?  Do you know that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Choubey’s figure and perhaps I could 
ask you, you have still got his affidavit open in front of you. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Choubey’s figure when excluding 
Transnet engineering is 42.8. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Do you see that?  Not vastly different, is it? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 69 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And then you see Mr Laher’s calculation, 
paragraph 
70, 
of 
45.8, 
that 
now 
includes 
Transnet 
engineering.  Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And do you see that Mr Choubey, he comes 
to almost exactly the same figure, 45.4 billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So maybe it is more of science that it 
appears. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   No, he demonstrated very well but the 
different assumptions lead to different outcomes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes.  Now – the outcomes are not that 
different, that is the point that I make, Mr Laher and Mr 
Choubey, they are very close to one another. 
MR MOLEFE:   They are not there, they are not – okay, 
they are close, I agree, they are close but being close – 
you see, if it was a science it would be precise. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But you are so far out, Mr Molefe, that is 
the problem. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   No but that is, as I was saying earlier, that 
is the number that you would go out with.  If I had to 
choose between …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   You were so far out. 
MR MOLEFE:   On the low side, yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 70 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, what did you recommend to the board 
and what did they accept, an increase in the ETC to what? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, the acceptance of the negotiated price 
at 49 billion …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, that is not what they did, Mr Molefe, 
that …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   But I say it as unfortunate use of 
terminology to call it ETC.  That was a price that was 
negotiated. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Do you understand that you are attributing 
10 
and talking down to an unfortunate change in terminology what 
might amount to almost R10 billion? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know if there is a dispute that the 
49 billion or the 54 billion was the price that was a 
negotiated price of the locomotives. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I think I am going to leave this topic, I need 
not to examine you any further over it.  I want to talk about 
batch pricing.  Now we have seen that 2.7 billion of the 15.0 
billion increase was attributable to batch pricing. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Could I just take you please to the MNS 
report? 
MR MOLEFE:   What is batch pricing? 
ADV MYBURGH:   We are going to go to the MNS report. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay.   
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 71 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   Would you please go – and this is in 
bundle 5. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now perhaps to answer your question so 
that we know exactly what I am dealing with, could I ask you 
please before we get to that document to go back to bundle 
BB4(b).  That is your memorandum to the BADC. 
MR MOLEFE:   BB4 little b? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, BB4b, and if I could ask you to 
turn to the table which we have gone to already, at 
10 
F2C718. 
MR MOLEFE:   What is the number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   718. 
MR MOLEFE:   This is 71? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   718, seven hundred and eighteen. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you will see we have already 
dealt with this on the left hand side of the capital letter D 
in the middle, that pricing adjustment for reduction of batch 
size to 40%/60%.  You see that?  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There was a reduction of the size. 
MR MOLEFE:   There was a reduction of? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of the size of the batches. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 72 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, now if you could then go as I 
had asked you to do, to the MNS Report at bundle 6. 
MR MOLEFE:   Bundle 6? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 6 next there.  Now, what 
MNS do at the foot of page 332 is they quote…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry; at what page did you say? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 332. 
CHAIRPERSON:   332. 
MR MOLEFE:   So what is the red page number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do not worry about that it is very 
10 
confusing, just stick to the black ones, alright 332 on the 
left hand side. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not have that or number 6, so are 
looking at file number 6? 
CHAIRPERSON:   File number 6, just look at the bundles 
in front of you, bundle 6 on the spine and then the one 
below that, bundle 6 on the spine.  
MR MOLEFE:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, looks like they found it, or is that 
a loan, is that loaned to him or is it his?  Okay, page 332 
20 
you said Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I just want to place on record 
one thing at the foot of the page Mr Molefe, are you there 
332? MR MOLEFE:   332, what is the page number at the 
top? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 73 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   332. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh 332. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Black numbers? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to read into the record 
where they say paragraph 4.1.11 under the heading batch 
pricing, Section 3.1 of the RFP relating to the acquisition 
of the 465 diesel and 599 electric locomotives, read as 
follows quote: 
10 
“Transnet requires flexibility in exercising options 
for the acquisition of the locomotives, these options 
may include suspending or postponing the delivery 
of the locomotives until a later date or changing 
quantities. Transnet however does not expect to pay 
a price premium should it excise any of these 
options.” 
Would you agree that that was the clause in the RFP? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, that was in the RFP. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I then ask you please to go to 
20 
the Fundudzi Report in the same bundle at page 186.  Can 
I draw your attention then to another issue?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It relates to 186 paragraph, third 
paragraph from the bottom 5.9.12.12.  There they talk of 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 74 of 258 
 
the Transnet delegation of authority framework approved 
by the Board on 29 August and effective from 1 September 
states that quote: 
“Increasing ETC a project already approved by the 
Shareholder 
Minister 
must 
be 
reported 
to 
the 
Shareholder Minister if the increase is in excess of 
15%.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would you accept that? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, was this increase – well I 
presume you will accept that there was an increase of more 
than 15%? 
MR MOLEFE:   Except I would not have called it ETC.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   I would not have called it ETC, but yes, it 
was more than 15%. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   However, you see it, it was a lot 
more than 15%. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, was that reported to the 
Shareholder Minister? 
MR MOLEFE:   Not that I am aware of. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you not ensure that that 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 75 of 258 
 
happened? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot recall the reasons why it was not 
reported, or if it was in fact reported or if there was any 
communication by the companies to the Minister about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that we understand it, whose 
responsibility ultimately would it had been to report this 
increase to the Shareholder Minister? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, this would have come out of a Board 
decision, right.  I suspect maybe company secretariat. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not you? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Maybe it was me, I am not sure 
Chairperson.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But this is not a secretarial issue is 
it, I mean, it is a very important issue. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. it would have been me Chairperson. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   It would have been me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, now could I take you please to 
page 326.  
MR MOLEFE:   But that issue, that we have just come back 
20 
from what…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you please go to page 326 of 
the same bundle? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At paragraph 3.3.6 there is reference 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 76 of 258 
 
to Section 54.2 of the PFMA, there is reference to the MOI 
and the DOA and at paragraph 3.3.8 it is: 
“The finding is that the failure to seek approval from 
the Ministerial Shareholder was in contravention of 
the PFMA, the MOI and the DOA.” 
Do you want to comment on that?  
MR MOLEFE:   No.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When were the - on a different topic, 
when were the locomotive supply agreement signed? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, I just want to - when we refer 
10 
to the batch pricing, and the section that you referred to in 
the PPM, that says that the batch pricing should have been 
included, 
as 
I 
indicated 
throughout 
the 
negotiation 
process, there are teams that include Transnet legal and 
Transnet, audit, internal audit.  
They were in fact part of the negotiations and they 
sat in the negotiations, something like that should because 
it is detailed, should and would have been picked up by 
them, and failure for them to have picked it up at that level 
before they moved on to the next stage during the 
20 
negotiations, I think something to the effect that while you 
are negotiating, you must know that you cannot pay for 
batch prices.  
But what came back from the negotiations was that 
part of what we need to pay for is batch pricing because 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 77 of 258 
 
we will reduce the batches and so I just wanted to point 
out that that was a failure at that level during the 
negotiations of the batch prices.  
On the matter of the PFMA it is a compliance issue 
and Transnet had the compliance, legal and compliance I 
think to the extent that in this transaction, we were - it was 
not compliant because it had to be reported to the 
Shareholder Minister, this should have been pointed out 
and rectified at that point.  
But the correct people to advise and tell us to be 
10 
compliant would have been legal and compliance.  They 
would have – and in fact I think legal was part of the 
negotiations when they saw that this would trigger reports 
to 
the 
Minister, 
I 
think 
there 
should 
have 
been 
a 
recommendation to report the matter to the Minister 
because I think that although the chief executive takes 
final responsibility. is final responsibility there.  
It is not possible in a complex organisation like 
Transnet who keep a tab on every little thing one relies on 
the advice and the recommendations from the different 
20 
divisions to look at compliance contract.   Now I expressed 
surprise 
yesterday 
today 
about 
the 
master 
services 
agreement that it had been done that I was not aware of.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I mean, I suppose what is 
important is you have accepted now that batch pricing and 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 78 of 258 
 
the splitting of batches was wrong, and you say it should 
have been picked up by…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I say it may have been wrong, perhaps 
when the people that were at the negotiations come here 
and explain exactly what happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well they have been here, you 
see, that is the thing I want to get to if you do not mind.  
So what Mr Laher says and in fact there is a transcript of 
this exchange…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   So Mr Laher was from which department? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Laher was in these negotiations. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, which department? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He was; he was part of the 
locomotives…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but from where did he work at the 
time? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe, I do not know the answer 
to that, can I just tell you…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Molefe, the Evidence Leader ask 
questions and you respond, then where it is necessary to 
20 
get 
clarification 
on 
his 
questions, 
you 
can 
ask 
for 
clarification. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If it is important, Mr Laher was from 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 79 of 258 
 
the finance department, he said he was a chartered 
accountant or he is a chartered accountant here, and he 
was part of the negotiating team.  Now, I understand there 
was a locomotive, negotiating team and then there was a 
Steering Committee, is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And who comprised that Steering 
Committee? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, it was a team from different parts of the 
organisation, but it included an assurance team, and the 
10 
assurance team included people from internal audit and 
legal, and the point that I was making was that this 
particular issue should have been picked up assurance. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come to it. 
MR MOLEFE:   And so Mr Laher, I am not aware that he 
was in the assurance team.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me just cut to the chase now. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you not part of the locomotive 
Steering Committee, you Singh and Mr Gama? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I was that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, so what…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   But I was not in the negotiating team. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but who was in the negotiations 
was Mr Singh.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 80 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, and Mr Laher worked together 
with Mr Singh. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, so let me tell you what Mr 
Laher ’s evidence is Mr Laher says to Mr Singh - there is a 
transcript of this: 
“That batch pricing is contrary to the RFP, we 
cannot do this not at this late stage, because then 
we should go out to tender again because the RFP 
10 
did not provide for it.” 
Mr Laher told Mr Singh that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, if you do not mind just bear 
with me.  Did Mr Singh bring that to your attention?  
MR MOLEFE:   No.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so that is the issue of batch 
pricing.  Now, when we get to the Ministerial authority or 
approval, do I understand that you can get that ex post 
facto, do you need to get approval before the increase and 
20 
the contract or can you just increase it and get approval 
afterwards? 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh it is possible to get it ex post facto.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is it possible? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 81 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But should it be got before or after? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, if it is obtained ex post facto, it has 
the same effect as it has been obtained before. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what about if the Minister says 
no, I do not give approval? 
MR MOLEFE:   Then there is a problem. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well that is why presumably, it 
is wise to do so beforehand. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, it is a problem if it cannot be obtained 
ex post facto, but once it is obtained ex post facto, it is 
10 
quantified. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but that did not happen here, so 
there remains a very serious…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, you were just asking, I suppose 
theoretically, in the effect of ex post facto approval. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Molefe you were the Group 
Chief Executive Officer, you proposed a massive increase 
in the ETC.  Did you not know that you had to get 
Ministerial approval?  
MR MOLEFE:   Well, I cannot recall what my state of mind 
20 
was at the time.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I knew maybe it slipped maybe, I cannot 
recall what my state of mind was at the moment, what I am 
pointing out is that perhaps the legal department or 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 82 of 258 
 
compliance should have then said, oops, we’re missing a 
spend[?], we need to get approval from the Minister.  
You know Mr Myburgh the increase in ETC, well 
what is now called the increase in ETC, was from 
R38billion to R54billion, but we also know that the ETC 
was recalculated by even Mr Choubey. 
So, Mr Choubey’s calculation if it is to be accepted 
or Mr Laher or the adjusted calculation by Mr Laher and Mr 
Callard, so if we take those calculations and say, the 
R38billion calculation was wrong it should never have been 
10 
used.  
The real calculation would actually be R45billion 
thereabouts and that the increase in the real ETC, would 
have been about R3billion, and that is what they say even 
in the MNS Report, so they say that had the R38billion 
been calculated properly, it would in fact have been 45 and 
not 38.  
But Chairperson, I submit that the R38billion was 
convenient and necessary, from a negotiation point of view 
because if we had gone out with a R45billion known figure 
20 
that that is where we are starting, we would have paid 
more. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Molefe…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   We would have paid more than R49billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I could take you back to my 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 83 of 258 
 
question.  In relation to Ministerial approval, I take it you 
would accept that if legal and compliance failed to obtain 
Ministerial approval, you as the group chief executive must 
carry that can, it is not something that you can just palm 
off 
to 
legal 
and 
compliance 
you 
bear 
the 
ultimate 
responsibility obviously. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I will carry the can, however, I submit 
that it was not done intentionally, or out of malice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But how does one forget, sorry I 
suppose we lucky to have someone like you here to help us 
10 
with this.  Once you - you talking about billions of rand’s.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How does one forget to get 
Ministerial approval for an increase of billions of rand’s?  I 
mean, yesterday, you pointed out to me just how much a 
billion or two or three is with reference to Transnet’s 
profits and turnover.  How does one forget or not insure, 
perhaps that is a better way of putting it, that this 
regulatory compliance is achieved? 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I am human Chairperson. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, let me go to something - 
would you also then accept that if the Chairperson finds 
that batch pricing was contrary to the RFP and ought not to 
have been allowed, that you must carry the can ultimately 
for that as well. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 84 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, ultimately, I am the chief 
executive and I should take responsibility.  However, I will 
hasten to mention that none of these things that happened 
here 
were 
happening, 
because 
it 
was 
a 
deliberate, 
intentional outcome that we did not have Ministerial 
approval that batch pricing is included.  
 
I was actually, I would be at pains to explain that in 
terms of our there was a failure in our system.  In a sense 
that during the assurance process, these things should 
have been pointed out. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it that when you – when Transnet 
teams, different teams, certainly the Group Chief Executive 
Officer handles a matter as big as this somebody would be 
tasked with the function to say please highlight to all 
concerned…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   …what requirements or hurdles needed 
to be taken care of, before this whole thing can be 
successful. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I would have thought that in such a 
– there would be such a document and somebody would 
have said, hang on at this stage, we will need to get 
Ministerial approval.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 85 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept that that is what one 
would expect?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but would you say it was not done 
in this case?  
MR MOLEFE:   No, that is why I was explaining yesterday 
that in a procurement process like this that I gave, so it is 
supposed to be a gain that was not supposed to be open if 
the batch pricing was not correct.  
Where assurance was supposed to say, you cannot 
10 
proceed because you have included batch pricing and you 
are 
not 
supposed 
to 
include 
batch 
prising, 
but 
the 
assurance report, and I would be interested to get the 
different assurance reports at the different gain, including 
right at the end, where the contract was signed.  
Because even as we are going to sign the contract, 
the assurance people are supposed to say, go ahead and 
sign, and I believe that there are reports, the assurance 
report that said everything was fine.  
But it would be interesting from an investigation 
20 
point of view to find out at this different level, what did the 
assurance people say?  Did they not pick these things up, 
and was there at any point where for example, I was told 
everything is fine, go to the press announcement and sign 
the transaction.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 86 of 258 
 
So that is my point that between internal audit, 
compliance legal that there was assurance.  In fact, on a 
transaction like this we even require external assurance, 
and I cannot remember what all external assurance took, 
but as far as I remember, assurance given otherwise I 
would not have moved on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Can I take you still in 
bundle 6 please, to page 289, you see there that at the top 
of 289, this is from the MNS Report?  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They deal with members of the 
Transnet Locomotive Steering Committee in 2014.  I will 
just ask you to confirm it was you, Mr Molefe, Mr Singh and 
with three others? 
MR MOLEFE:   And then there was a sub-committee of that 
steering committee, and that was you, Mr Gama and Mr 
Singh. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say you were not present in 
20 
the negotiations; Mr Singh we know was would you confirm 
that?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And would he report back to you on 
the progress of the negotiations? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 87 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, he would inform me of what is 
going on in the negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you expect him to do that 
honestly and faithfully?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And Mr. Gama, was he part of the 
negotiation? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did he also report back to you? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, they both came and reported to me 
10 
what was happening. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I doubt that you would have 
expected him to do so honestly and faithfully as well, 
obviously? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, we know from Mr Laher that it 
took quite a long time to compile these memos that were 
presented to the BADC and the…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Before we move on, what is not clear in this 
list of people are the assurance - exactly who the 
20 
assurance people were because it is finance and technical, 
but I submit that there was legal and internal audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was? 
MR MOLEFE:    Legal and internal audit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, would assurance always be the same 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 88 of 258 
 
departments or units, or it could change depending on the 
subject matter? 
MR MOLEFE:   They give different types of assurance, as 
assurance from a legal point of view that everything is fine, 
then there is assurance from an internal audit point of 
view, that everything is fine.  For example, when the 
tenders are submitted, and they must be submitted at 12 
o'clock. Somebody from internal audit says the tenders 
were submitted at 12 o'clock, those that arrived at five past 
12 were…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were excluded. 
MR MOLEFE:   …were excluded.  So and that is an 
assurance that opens the next day. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  I am sorry, I need just to 
retrace my steps and please forgive me if it is something 
that you have already answered.  Did you know that you, 
did you yourself know that you had to get Ministerial 
approval? 
MR MOLEFE:   Actually, we had obtained Ministerial 
approval at the beginning of the process.  So Ministerial 
20 
approval had been obtained before, perhaps maybe what 
went on in my head was we do have Ministerial approval to 
do this.  
The thing that fell between the cracks was the fact 
that the increase in the price from what was the approved 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 89 of 258 
 
ETC to the final price required Ministerial approval, that is 
perhaps, what fell between the cracks of that we should 
have been advised on. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but that is not what I am asking 
you.  Did you know that you had to get Ministerial approval 
for the increase?  I mean, the falling through the cracks is 
not what I am looking at, did you personally know that you 
had to get approval? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did know?  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I knew that we had to get approval for 
the 
transaction. 
 
We 
did 
obtain 
approval 
for 
the 
transaction, what we however failed to do at the end is to 
get approval for the increase. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you got approval for the 
transaction originally, were you involved in that process? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I was involved.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you sign off the documents as 
their group chief executive? 
MR MOLEFE:   Actually, I cannot remember how the 
20 
approval was obtained as to who in what form the request 
went to the to the Minister.  I do not know if it went under 
my hand or under somebody else's hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But such a request I would imagine it 
would have to go under your hand or the Chairperson but 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 90 of 258 
 
not somebody junior to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, it would be - actually, I think it may be 
the Chairperson’s hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, now let us just deal with one 
or two other things.  We know that CSR, they were 
awarded 359 of the 1064 locomotives, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I ask you please to go to page 
... 14 of Bundle 6.  And could I just direct your attention to a 
10 
finding made by MNS at paragraph 2.5.2 are your there? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It says and I think we have touched on 
this already.  
“Mr Sharma the Chairperson of the BADC and Essa were 
business associates through inter alia the business 
interest they had in various companies.  Mr Essa on 
behalf of one of his companies Tequesta concluded a 
business development service agreement with CSR Hong 
Kong on 18 May 2015.  Salient terms of the business 
20 
development agreement state that  
1. Tequesta was appointed to provide advisory services 
and particular assist CSR Hong Kong to secure the 
current electric locomotive tender and revenue will 
2. In return Mr Essa would get paid 21% of the contract 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 91 of 258 
 
value concluded with Transnet.” 
That was what the research showed.  Would you know 
anything about that? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you know anything about links 
between Mr Sharma and Mr Essa? 
MR MOLEFE:  No 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if you had known of them what 
would you have done? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well I did not know of them. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  My question is if you had known what 
would you have done? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know what I would have done at the 
time but I did not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  I want to turn now to another 
topic because finally we leave the locomotives and the 
transaction advisors around the locomotives.  Can I just ask 
you when – when those memoranda to the BADC and the 
board were prepared – just bear with me for a second.  And 
those – those memoranda we have seen – we have looked at 
20 
them they were – they were approved or recommended in 
May of 2014, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can you recall whether or which 
consultants gave input into – into the increase in the ETC? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 92 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  My understanding is that the increase was an 
outcome of the negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But can you remember who the … 
MR MOLEFE:  So you asking who was advising? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  I actually cannot remember who was advising 
the negotiating team. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you do not know whether this was 
10 
a point at which Regiments were on the scene to the 
exclusion of McKinsey or – you do not have a clear 
recollection of that? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I cannot recall what was… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Can we please then turn to 
another topic and that relates to the Neotel contracts. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now let me just before I take you to 
the relevant documents and I suppose it is refreshing that 
here we talking about something else now.  I know that you 
20 
have dealt with this in your affidavit but I just ask you to 
confirm this before we go to the controversy.  Mr Molefe on 
the 31s t of October 2013. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ms Chetty was then she was the acting 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 93 of 258 
 
Group Chief Executive. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And she awarded a contract to Neotel, 
is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then you reversed this decision 
and we will come to the reasons why and  you appointed T-
Systems in a memorandum dated the next month 20 
November, correct – 2013?  Is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You did that without consulting with Ms 
Chetty, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you would have seen that she 
says well all your reasons for reversing her decision was 
bad. 
MR MOLEFE:  She says what? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  She said all of your reasons for the 
reversing her decision were bad, you have seen that right?  
You have seen her affidavit. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja I cannot recall exactly what the reasons 
were according to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you looking for her affidavit?  Are you 
looking for her affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I am just putting away that file. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 94 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh okay no I thought you – you wanted to 
check something before responding to the question. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja let me just – I just trying to 
paraphrase things. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because we are not – we obviously we 
do not have a lot of time left. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Over.  So she says that all of your 
reasons for reversing her decision are bad.  I am going to 
10 
come to your – your position now.  Mr Volmink you would 
have seen also says your reasons for reversing the decision 
were bad.  Mr Van der Westhuizen also gives some evidence 
about this. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What we know then is about six 
months later on the 6t h of June 2014 after opinions had been 
obtained from the senior counsel and well I understand your 
external auditors you then revoke your decision. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes on advice. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So tell us then why you 
changed and revoked Ms Chetty’s award to – to Neotel in 
favour of T-Systems.  Why did you take the contract from 
Neotel and give it to T-Systems?  And you dealt with it in 
your affidavit.  You – I am happy if you go there. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 95 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja there was – there was in fact a letter that I 
wrote or a memo that I wrote to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To where you gave reasons? 
MR MOLEFE:  That gave reasons yes.  To – to I think it was 
to Mr Singh – it was one of those instances where I wrote a 
memo downwards to say I do not agree with your decision 
and these are my reasons. And the reasons were that Neotel 
was the incumbent.   
Neotel while they were working on Transnet systems 
that is where they were working – what they were working on 
10 
we had had a breach of the firewalls under their watch which 
had cost us some kind of embarrassment because we do not 
know what information was taken out of the Transnet 
systems.   
There had been security cameras that had been 
installed at the ports that were not working – it was 
embarrassing because in terms of our membership of 
international ports organisation these security systems were 
supposed to have been working and Vodacom had been for 
the same tender and had lost but now Vodacom was in the 
20 
process of buying Neotel.   
So I then said this is like giving the tender to 
Vodacom because they have bid and they have lost and now 
they are buying Neotel.  We have to understand this 
transaction between Vodacom and Neotel.  You – how do you 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 96 of 258 
 
award a transaction to a company that is publicly on sale?  
Because the sale could come with its own uncertainties and 
could result in things that were envisaged in the tender 
being very different to the outcome.   
So those were my reasons.  Incidentally when Mr – 
Ms Chetty also awarded the tender she wrote by hand on her 
memo of award that Neotel must give us some assurance 
relating to the Vodacom transactions which in my opinion 
meant she had put a condition precedent to the award that ja 
we are awarding but they must first do this.   
10 
So she did that on the 31s t.  And I said for these 
reasons I feel that we need a new incumbent because of the 
failures that had happened under Neotel.  Of course internal 
audit and legal after I had written that memo came back and 
said your reasons do not hold water.  This tender has been 
awarded – oh and then I recommended that the second 
company on the – on the recommendations should be 
awarded the tender.  Internal audit came back and legal and 
they said no you cannot do what you are trying to do reverse 
the transactions it was a recommendation to give it to T-
20 
Systems.  You cannot do what you are proposing to do.   
And they also have opinion of senior counsel who 
also said that it could not be done.  And I agreed and I even 
said well at least I have told you my concerns about why we 
doing this thing.  If things happen in the future with Neotel it 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 97 of 258 
 
shall be recorded that I did not come back from where I was 
and just promised them the decision that I thought was 
00:11.12 
so 
that 
is 
what 
happened 
with 
the 
matter 
Chairperson. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Molefe you did not need senior 
counsel to tell you that you cannot just simply take away a 
contract that had been awarded to Neotel and just give it to 
T-Systems. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
No 
my 
interpretation 
– 
my 
layman’s 
interpretation was that the condition. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There was no condition she had issued 
a letter. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja which is why I needed senior counsel’s 
opinion.  Maybe you did not need senior counsel’s opinion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You did not what? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is may – which is why maybe I needed to 
be told by senior counsel. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You did not need to be told – I mean 
she had issued a letter of approval. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In favour of Neotel. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I mean just to make this very simple 
here is a woman who was acting in your position. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 98 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  She awards a contract to Neotel does 
all the paperwork, signs all the letters, properly appointed.  
You come along a month later without even talking to her… 
MR MOLEFE:  No, no not a month later. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well – she – she awards the contract 
on 31 October. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We have gone through the chronology.  
On 20 November – okay not a month, three weeks later. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You simply take away that contract 
from Neotel and you give it to T-Systems. 
MR MOLEFE:  My recollection is that it was conditional.  I 
thought it could be done because I had concerns and I – I 
tabled my concerns. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright well let us go to – let me go to 
Ms Chetty, her affidavit.  I think this is a new file BB6. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You have it? 
MR MOLEFE:  BB6.   Yes.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so if we have a look at page 88 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  SC88 that is your – I think it is the 
memo that you speak about. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 99 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This is on 20 November this is the 
reversal, correct. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This is quite a long memo and contains 
a lot of quoting you see at pages 89, 90, 91. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let us get to the meat of it that is at 
92.  You say at paragraph 7 and it is eloquently written. 
“I have the following specific concerns with 
your recommendation and responses to me 
10 
including responses” 
Etcetera and you set them out a, b, c, d, e. 
“Counterparty risk and alienation of state 
assets. 
Concentration risk as Transnet is Neotel’s 
largest client. 
BBBEE partners. 
Information 
Security 
incident 
and 
CCTV 
camera exposures.” 
And then you go and articulate each of those points.  
20 
Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And the balance of this. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you then conclude that due to the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 100 of 258 
 
above you were – you effectively revoke then the award and 
you appoint T-Systems we see that at the foot of page 92. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes I also saw that this network is at the 
heart of the Transnet business and I am of the view that 
awarding the business to Neotel will expose Transnet for 
unnecessary risk. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  And then what you also did at 22 
at page 94 is you say: 
“I approve that the R248 million be taken into 
consideration.” 
10 
Right so let us just understand what that means. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go to – back to page 93 and 
paragraph 21 at the foot of the page. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“Post the close of the final offers being 
submitted 
T-Systems 
indicated 
that 
they 
unfortunately due to the strict timeline set by 
Transnet only managed to get confirmation 
20 
from their shareholder on certain pricing 
elements and that they would be in a position 
to reduce the price submitted a week before 
by a further R248 million.” 
And you then say: 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 101 of 258 
 
“I approve the R248 million or that the R248 
million be taken into consideration.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As part of T-Systems best and final 
offer.  Is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Even though they did not make that 
offer? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes they had indicated that they would – had 
to reduce their price by R248 million 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We are going to come to that.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember not to speak to far from the 
microphone. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh ja.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can you just point out to us where in 
this memorandum do you refer to the fact that Ms Chetty’s 
approval of the contract contained a condition precedent? 
MR MOLEFE:  In my bundle. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No in this memorandum?  These are 
your reasons for setting aside Neotel and awarding it to T-
20 
Systems where do you see reference here to her approval 
having contained a condition precedent that you have 
spoken about? 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh the fact that I may not have mentioned it 
in this – in this memorandum does not mean that it did not 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 102 of 258 
 
exist. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I see.  But in your evidence unless I 
misunderstood you it seems to me that that was the core 
issue. 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Not alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  The core issue where the risks to the – so I 
mean there is – there is a different pockets of looking at this. 
The first one is that I had real substantive concerns with or 
without the – the condition precedent.  So the first one was 
10 
but how could we give this tender to these people after these 
risks that we know about? 
 
The second one was could it be done?  And I felt that 
because of Ms Chetty’s award was not full and final I do not 
know how to put it was not – was not unconditionally final 
that there was something else that needed to be done.  I do 
not know how to put it in words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja you say the condition precedent 
that was understood to be there. 
MR MOLEFE:  That was understood.  Yes.  Yes.  Means that 
20 
there was a window to actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get out of the… 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  And in fact that – that condition 
precedent that she put in expresses one of the fears that I 
had that this company was being sold.  And so – and so I 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 103 of 258 
 
thought that it was possible to reverse this from where I was 
sitting – from purely a business point of view.  However I 
was later to be proven otherwise by legal and internal 
auditors. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so… 
MR MOLEFE:  And Chairperson it is worth noting that when I 
was advised that what I sought to do here could not be done 
I did not resist I accepted it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well I mean did you have an option Mr 
Molefe? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  No I had no opinion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You did not have one. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right. So could we go then please to 
Ms Chetty’s affidavit at page 6. 
MR MOLEFE:  The option that I had was to behave like a 
bull in a china shop and this is what I did not do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At page 6 of her affidavit SC006 
paragraph 17 she says: 
“Mr Molefe provides the following… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  Same file what 
page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 6 Chairperson SC6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay I have got it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  She in paragraph 17 addresses each of 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 104 of 258 
 
your reasons.  Counter risk and alienation, concentration 
risk, BBBEE partners, information security, CCTV issues and 
then at paragraph 18 she refers to a particular document and 
she says that clearly indicates that the possible price 
reductions could not be taken into account as the final 
pricing had already been submitted.  Mr Molefe could not 
approve that the price reduction be considered as part of T-
Systems best and final offer as this prejudices the other 
bidders and is not considered fair and transparent.  And what 
she refers to there as annexure SC3 that you find at page 
10 
37. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just bear with me for a moment 
because I want to just get a – she refers to a Tear Report T-
e-a-r and what that stands for is a Tender Evaluation and 
Recommendation Report that you find at page 23 could you 
turn there please?  So this is a formal report that is being 
produced and if I could take you to page 37 you will see that 
the last third of the page between the second and third 
schedules. 
20 
“After 
conclusion 
of 
the 
normalisation 
process a final clarification session was held 
with the three bidders to double check if they 
had not admitted anything in their price.  
Bidder 5 who was T-Systems indicated during 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 105 of 258 
 
discussions that their joint venture partner 
may be able to negotiate optimisation with its 
shareholders which will result in an overall 
reduction of R248 million on the tendering – 
sorry the tender pricing. Bidder 2 and 3 also 
indicated minor possible price changes which 
would have resulted in slight adjustments in 
the final commercial proposals” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
10 
“I know as an indication of the pricing 
changes if the R248 million possible price 
reductions were to be taken into account in 
this project even though it is not possible 
since the final pricing had been submitted.” 
You see that that is the Tear Report. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  But if you go to page 43 of that Report. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  You will see that Ms Pillay did not approve or 
not disapprove.  She did not approve it and that was – it was 
20 
sent to her – the last person to sign – signed on the 31s t of 
October so I do not know if there is another report where she 
actually approves this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We can have a look into that but Mr 
Molefe once parties have submitted their final pricing. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 106 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  No I am not … 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  During a tender … 
MR MOLEFE:  I am not disputing that I am just saying … 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Cannot – you know that you cannot do 
this. 
MR MOLEFE:  She had not – she had not approved this 
transactions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But that does not answer the issue that 
I am putting to you.  I mean you know surely that when 
parties tender… 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr – Mr – Mr Myburgh you are going back to 
this patronising you know thing.  I would really – I really do 
not like it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay well let me ask you this. 
MR MOLEFE:  That you are being presumptuous think that I 
know things and patronising me in the process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let me put my question this way.  
Did you think well presumably you thought it appropriate to 
allow someone a price reduction outside of the tendering 
process?  Did you think that was (talking over one another). 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Well I thought it was possible. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But how? 
MR MOLEFE:  But then I was wrong. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  I was wrong however what I am pointing out 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 107 of 258 
 
now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Is that this report that you are referring to 
was not approved by Ms Sharla Chetty on the 31s t of 
October. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But that does not detract from the 
concession that I think you fairly made. 
MR MOLEFE:  It does not… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Does not detract from the concession 
that I think you fairly made. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  No it may indicate to the fact that perhaps 
this was not this transaction had not been finalised and 
awarded as it should have been. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I could I suppose take you to Mr 
Volmink’s affidavit but I do not suppose it is necessary 
because I think you accept that ultimately the award in 
favour of T-Systems was irregular and needed to be 
reversed. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes I accepted that a long time ago.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Correct. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  I accepted it at the time when internal audit 
and legal. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Came to me and said Mr Molefe we cannot do 
this and I accepted it and I then said we should proceed with 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 108 of 258 
 
the award to – to Neotel the incumbent.  Although I had – I 
had my own from a business point of view I had reservations.  
I accepted the advice that I was given that what I sought to 
do was impossible.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  Mr Chairman I see it is one 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. Let us take the lunch break 
then and we will resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, 
before lunch, we were dealing with Neotel/T-Systems.  I 
have referred you to the evidence of Ms Chetty here who 
has spoken about Mr Volmink.  I would like, for the first 
time, 
to 
take 
you 
to 
the 
evidence 
of 
Mr 
Van 
der 
Westhuizen.  That evidence you will find at Exhibit BB-7.  
There are a number of files.  It is BB-7(a).   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if I could ask you, please, to 
turn to page 7? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Van der Westhuizen, incidentally, 
is a Chartered Accountant and at material, it appears to 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 109 of 258 
 
have been an Executive Manager, Office of the Chief, 
Information Officer.  Now at paragraph 23, he refers to a 
meeting.  He says: 
“During November 2013, I was called to a 
meeting with Mr Molefe...” 
 
And he cites certain other people and he says at 
paragraph 24: 
“When we arrived at the meeting, we were 
requested by Mr Molefe’s personal assistance, 
if I can recall correctly, to hand over our cell 
10 
phones to her before we entered his office.  
We all did so.   
I find the request to hand over my cell phone 
to be strange due to the fact that I have 
attended 
at 
least 
one 
other 
meeting 
in 
Mr Molefe’s office on which occasion I was not 
requested to hand over my cell phone...” 
 
Do you want to just comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I have no comment Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did it happen or not? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   It did happen. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did ask him to hand over his cell 
phone? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 110 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I wanted to discuss this tender of 
Neotel and T-Systems.  They were IT people and it is 
known that it is possible to listen to meetings through the 
cell phones of people or the meeting could be taped(?) by 
one of the participants.  I did not want that... for security 
reasons.  Security of information reasons. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   For information leak purposes? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  At paragraph 26: 
“Molefe indicated that he did not support the 
10 
recommendation to issue a letter intent to 
Neotel as the preferred bidder and he intended 
to award the tender to T-Systems as he was of 
the 
view 
that 
the 
R 248 million 
discount 
offered by T-Systems (refer to Annexure H3) 
was valued and should have been taken into 
account. 
 
He 
also 
advanced 
other 
considerations...” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson, that was not the main 
reason for the R 248 million.  The main reason was the 
20 
issues that I advanced in my memorandum.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then he says over the page at 
paragraph 27: 
“I did not agree with the reasons advanced by 
Mr Molefe during the aforesaid meeting in this 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 111 of 258 
 
regard, one, even if the R 248 million discount 
offered by T-Systems was taken into account, 
T-Systems would still only have been the 
second best bidder...” 
 
He says at sub-2: 
“I informed the meeting that the objection by 
Mr Molefe that there should be concentration 
risk or there would be concentration risk at 
Transnet, 
as 
Neotel’s 
largest 
client, 
was 
without merit...” 
10 
 
He says: 
“I explained X, Y, Z...” 
 
And then sub-3: 
“Mr Molefe further informed the meeting that it 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
one 
of 
Neotel’s 
reportedly 
partners 
or 
shareholders 
which 
contained an allegation that Neotel was busy 
diluting its shareholding...” 
 
Et cetera.  Do you want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I have a very vague recollection but I 
20 
think, I may have referred to the fact that there is a 
corporate action.  A corporate action was this sale of...  
No, from corporate action was a sale of – not Neotel 
actually, the other one, T-Systems.   
 
Actually, this paragraph does not make sense, 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 112 of 258 
 
but what I do recall is that there was a discussion of the 
corporate action involving...  No, the incumbents.  Who 
was the incumbent again?  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are looking for the company who 
was ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   They had awarded the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Neotel? 
MR MOLEFE:   Neotel, yes.  It is Neotel, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And then below that, 
paragraph 28: 
“I then realised that my objections are not 
being well-received.  I remember feeling at the 
time 
that 
for 
me 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
verbalisation 
of 
my 
objections 
would 
be 
tantamount to professional suicide. 
In simple terms, it felt that I would be placing 
my career at risk if I did not shut my mouth 
there and then. 
20 
Upon this realisation, I did not take any further 
active participation(?) in the meeting...” 
 
Would you like to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I cannot comment on that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if you go to paragraph 33, he 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 113 of 258 
 
says – and this is at page ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   However, Chair, I would say that there is – 
the feeling that he had that his career would have been in 
jeopardy was misplaced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   Because what subsequently happened is 
that, I was advised by people who were junior to me to 
proceed with what we are doing and I listened.  So it was 
in the spirit of collaborative management.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So could I, please, take you back to 
10 
page 5 at paragraph 15? 
MR MOLEFE:   15? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 5, paragraph 15. 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At paragraph 15, Mr Van der 
Westhuizen sets out that there were five bidders who 
submitted proposals.  We know one was Neotel and then 
we also know one was T-Systems.  That was number 5 – at 
15.5.  And you see there, T-Systems South Africa (Pty) Ltd.  
It was a bid made in collaboration with Broadband Infraco. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We can now go to paragraph 33 at 
page 9.  He says: 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 114 of 258 
 
“I wish to highlight the fact that the T-Systems 
tender was submitted in collaboration with 
Broadband Infraco. 
The company registration document for the 
latter company shown that Salim Essa was a 
Director of BBI and resigned as a Director on 
14 October 2010...” 
 
I will show you now but that should be 2014. 
“My understanding is that BBI is a state-owned 
entity and it was tendering with T-Systems...” 
10 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chair.  I knew that Broadband Infraco 
was a state-owned entity. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I did not know that Salim Essa was a 
Director of Broadband Infraco. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I take it that you will not...  I 
can take you to Exhibit BB-7(b) at page 348.  If you want, 
it is the Supra record.  Could you go there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Which one?  BB-7? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   BB-7(b). 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you could turn, please, to page 
348? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 115 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is a CIPC company search.  If you 
turn to page 349, you go to the foot of the page and then 
you count up ten lines from the bottom.  So from the 
bottom up, you will see reference twice to Mr Salim Essa 
and you see that he resigned on 14 October 2014.  So at 
this time ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   The 10  on the top? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   From the bottom, count up 10.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make a note just below 
2010 at page 9 where 2010 is given instead of 2014 to 
10 
refer to that bundle and that page Mr Myburgh.  So that 
would be bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, I beg your pardon.  It is 
Bundle BB-7(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 349. 
CHAIRPERSON:   349.  No, okay that is fine.  If previously 
know ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am sorry, DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you referring to the error in the 
date? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I beg your pardon.  So that is 
Mr Van der Westhuizen’s affidavit.  Have you ...[intervenes]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 116 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I got it.  I just want to refer to make 
a reference to the bundle where there is the resignation 
document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so that is what I have given 
you.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is what you have given me?  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The page was 349, hey? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Your junior could check if 
10 
no supplementary statement or affidavit was previously 
made by Mr Van der Westhuizen to correct this, it will be 
good if we could get a supplementary statement that can 
be slotted in behind his affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We will do that DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Molefe then, at the time that 
you were dealing with the Neotel/T-Systems issue, you 
accept that Mr Essa was a Director of Broadband Infraco?  
MR MOLEFE:   I did not know that. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, no.  I am asking you, do you 
accept that he was a Director of Broadband Infraco? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, from the information that is here.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Whilst dealing with Mr Essa. 
Perhaps I can turn to a different topic and that is – and I 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 117 of 258 
 
suppose importantly, it also still deals with T-Systems but 
this is the cession from T-Systems to Zest Galore(?) 
[00:12:52].   
 
Now what the evidence shows is that Transnet 
appointed T-Systems to manage its IT infrastructure and at 
least some 2200 computers from T-Systems.  Do you know 
anything about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, I have no recollection of... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you, please, to go to 
Exhibit BB-3(a), Mr Mohamedy’s exhibit.   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   BB-3? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   BB-3(a). 
MR MOLEFE:   What page number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   30.  Three, zero. 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 30, and at the foot of the page, 
please, Mr Molefe at paragraph 12.5.2 under the heading 
T-Systems.  Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   T-Systems said: 
“Mr Mohamedy, Transnet appointed T-Systems 
to manage its IT infrastructure.  However, 
there are matters that relate to this contract 
that I would like to highlight...: 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 118 of 258 
 
 
Over the page. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“Transnet 
Group 
Capital 
was 
paying 
for 
approximately 
2200 
computers 
when 
only 
approximately 1100 were employed by the 
divisions...” 
 
Et cetera.  Of a particular reference then is 
paragraph 5.12.3: 
“They 
key 
issue 
to 
note 
is 
that 
these 
10 
computers were all leased through the T-
Systems 
contract 
which 
was 
subsequently 
ceded initially to Zest Galore and then later to 
InnoVent 
Rental 
and 
Asset 
Management 
Solutions. 
I attached Annexure MSN 40, copy of the 
cession and delegation agreement between 
Transnet, Zest Galore and T-Systems. 
Now Zest Galore and InnoVent are partly 
owned by Salim Essa, a well-known associate 
20 
of the Gupta’s and a majority shareholder of 
Trillian Capital Partners...”  
 
Do you know anything about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No.  No, sir, I do not know anything about 
that.  When was this? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 119 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me take you to the agreement 
because you in fact signed it, the cession from T-Systems 
to Zest Galore. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That will you find in Mr Mohamedy’s 
next volume that being Exhibit BB-3(b). 
MR MOLEFE:   Exhibit BB-3? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Can you ask you, please, to 
go to page 581? 
MR MOLEFE:   581? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
One 
second 
Mr 
Myburgh. 
 
Yes, 
Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  At MSN-581, you will 
find 
a 
cession 
and 
delegation 
agreement 
between 
Transnet, Zest Galore and T-Systems.  Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if I can take you to page 585 at 
paragraph 3.1 under the heading Cession and Delegation: 
“T-Systems hereby seize it’s right under the 
20 
Transnet agreement as indicated in Attachment 
A to Zest Galore...” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “And hereby accepts the cession...” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 120 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you then go forward all the 
way to page MSN 592, you will see that you signed that 
agreement. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
And 
just 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness. 
 
This 
agreement 
would 
have 
been 
accompanied by a memo ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...requesting me to sign the agreement.  I 
do not know if you have it there? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I do not have a memo. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The fact is that you signed it. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I signed it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, can I take you, please, to 
Exhibit 5? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just...  I wanted to check the date of the 
agreement Mr Myburgh.  It is 1 December 2014.  Is that 
right? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That appears correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is also something you dealt 
with in 2014.  Can I take you to Bundle 5, please? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And could you turn, please, to page 
405.86? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 121 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now that is a CIPC search on Zest 
Galore. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you could turn forward, 
please, to page 504.89 and right at the bottom of the page, 
there is a person by the name of Zenad(?) Osmani(?)  Do 
you see that? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Zenad? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Osmani. 
MR MOLEFE:   On which page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At the foot of page 405.89.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know that person? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I just want to put it to you that 
she is or was at the time ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  Page 405.8? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   .89 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that must be... one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I just want to put to you that 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 122 of 258 
 
Zenad Osmani was Mr Essa’s wife.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I do not even know Mr Essa, as I have 
said. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay and we are...  So that is what I 
want to put to you.  Let us carry on with something else 
where Mr Essa features.  I want to turn now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Who was Mr Essa’s wife? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Zenad Osmani. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The person who ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   At the bottom? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have seen it, ja.  Okay? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You would have seen, DCJ, that she 
was a director in the year 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Of T-Systems? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of Zest Galore. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, of Zest Galore. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there was a cession from T-
Systems to Zest Galore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe signed that contract and 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 123 of 258 
 
this lady was a Director of Zest Galore and she is 
Mr Essa’s wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now let us move to another topic. 
MR MOLEFE:   Before, just to put everything in context.  
Well, I accept that I signed the cession.  The reason I 
wanted 
to 
see 
the 
memo 
is 
I 
wanted 
to 
see 
the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The background ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   The background ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and the reasons. 
MR MOLEFE:   And the reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the motivation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but what I do know and recall is that, 
typically, agreements like that of T-Systems would have a 
clause and I say this without having seen the actual 
agreement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   Or it is maybe attached.  Would say that 
this agreement may be ceded and that when the party that 
20 
is ceding the agreement wants to see Transnet or the other 
party may not refuse unreasonable for the cession to 
happen.   
 
So I would imagine it was in that context but I 
think that if this was investigated further, maybe that can 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 124 of 258 
 
be confirmed.  But I think, sitting here, that was the 
context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which is why I wanted to see the memo that 
preceded.  Maybe the memo would have said:  We cannot 
unreasonable refuse to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   And I want to state that I was not...  Well, I 
10 
do not think that I applied my mind to the directors of Zest 
Galore but I did not know that that the person in question 
was Mr Essa’s wife.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But let us carry on then with another 
topic, also relating to Mr Essa and that is the Manganese 
Expansion Project.  Now you will remember, we have 
touched on this at the beginning.  Mr Henk Bester, who 
was then employed by Hatch Consulting, gave evidence 
about this.  Do you remember that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes and when we are talking about 
20 
Mr Henk Bester ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...I think the other day.  I kept – I think I 
kept confusing him with the Bester from Eskom in my head.  
Actually, I do not recall Mr Bester nor how he looks like or 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 125 of 258 
 
what he looks like.  So I do not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the Transnet – that is the one 
that we are talking about now. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes... 
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to take you to five 
paragraphs of his affidavit.  That you will find at Transnet 
Bundle 4 and Mr Bester is Exhibit BB-19.   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if I could ask you, please, to turn 
to BB-19 and turn up page 29? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So at paragraph 19 and you would 
have seen this before so I am going to paraphrase it.  You 
will remember that Mr Bester ’s evidence was that Hatch 
was tendering and that there were people that made 
advances in relation to being appointed as its – the 
supplier development partner. 
20 
 
And at paragraph 19, he talks about a meeting 
where Padayachee and Reddy, amongst the people that are 
referred to, indicated their respective companies to form a 
joint venture if they work with Hatch on phase 1. 
 
Padayachee further explained that they, him, 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 126 of 258 
 
Reddy and their respective companies, knew everything 
about the project and people high up in Transnet.   
 
He said:   
“I understood to mean the Executives, such as 
the CEO, CFO and COO.  Do you have any 
comment to that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I have no comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph 23.  He talks 
about a meeting and he says about five lines from the 
bottom: 
10 
“Basson said that they had an early discussion 
with 
Anoj 
Singh, 
Transnet 
Group 
Chief 
Financial Officer at the time. 
As GCFO, Singh was responsible for signing 
the confinement for phase 1 prior to Molefe 
giving 
final 
approval 
as 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive...” 
 
Can you confirm that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I cannot comment on that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I think we have seen this 
20 
contract yesterday, actually.  But this is the MNPQ(?). 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The Manganese Contract. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but I cannot comment on what Basson 
was saying ...[intervenes]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 127 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sure. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...to Padayachee and Reddy.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at paragraph 29, you will 
see there is a call from Padayachee, who indicated he 
would like to see him again.  They had a meeting.  
Padayachee and Reddy advised that the confinement 
approval was imminent but that Hatch needed to sign the 
addendum to the MOU before confinement could be 
finalised. 
 
He says, over the page: 
10 
“It was clear that they were not happy with 
Hatch’s proposed amendments. 
I understood this to mean, either that Singh 
would not approve the confinement in order for 
Molefe to give final approvement. 
Alternatively, both Molefe and Singh would not 
give the necessary approvals...” 
 
Do you have any comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, I have no comment on it and actually 
I do not know Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  I do not – I 
20 
cannot recall who they are.  I have no idea who they are. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let us then deal with paragraph 
65.  Now this is the meeting that was held at Melrose Arch, 
JB’s Corner, attended by Mr Essa...   
“Essa clearly indicated that he can provide me 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 128 of 258 
 
with the submitted tender documentation from 
all the other bidders. 
He told me that they have already decided 
...[audio cut] Eskom will be Molefe and that an 
announcement will be made in the newspaper 
soon.” 
I have already taken you to that.  I assume you have 
nothing further to say. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja and we have spoken about this meeting 
at length.  By the way, who else was at this meeting? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   It was Mr Essa and Mr Bester and I 
think there were others. 
MR MOLEFE:   There were others?  And the others 
corroborated this evidence? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Have 
the 
others 
corroborated 
this 
evidence? 
ADV MYBURGH:   No one else has given evidence about 
this particular discussion. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I cannot comment on it. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   But, you know, the Chairperson was at 
pains to explain that I should be concerned about it so it 
would be interesting if the Commission could say that from 
the people that were there, they can confirm that this is 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 129 of 258 
 
actually a discussion that took place. 
ADV MYBURGH:   This is a thing that does not concern 
you. 
MR MOLEFE:   But it is a discussion that took place in my 
absence, that does not worry me, that has got nothing to 
do with me. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  Then at paragraph 71: 
“On 30 November 2014 Molefe signed a letter that 
awarded the rail tender to…” 
And this is consortium H to NJV.  And then: 
10 
“The port N Met project was awarded to Flag 
consisting of [indistinct], Amacom and Gibb.  I 
suspect that the appointment of Flag was due to 
Essa’s involvement.” 
Do you want to say anything about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment about his suspicion.  I 
can only say that it was not due to Essa’s involvement.  I 
think that I, if I did award such tender …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   You awarded the tender, did you? 
MR MOLEFE:   Huh? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   You awarded that tender. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, if I did, it was on the basis of a 
recommendation that had been made after due process. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright and then if I can take you to the 
evidence of Deidre Strydom, who also testified on this 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 130 of 258 
 
issue and you will find her affidavit at BB20, in the same 
file that you are in.  So it is bundle 4, BB20. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And if you could please turn to 
paragraph 35 at page 145 and from paragraphs 35 to 38 
she effectively corroborates what she was told by Bester 
but of particular importance presently is paragraph 35: 
“Since the value of the transaction…” 
Perhaps in fairness to you I must just indicate to you that 
Ms Bester (sic) was in charge from Transnet’s side of the 
10 
MEP. 
MR MOLEFE:   Of the NMPP? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, she was at the time I think it was 
the programme director of the manganese expansion 
project. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Bester? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   Did you say Mr Bester was? 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, Mr Bester worked for Hatch. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, oh …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Strydom, Deidre Strydom. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright, so she says at paragraph 35: 
“Since the value of the transaction...” 
And she is talking about his confinement. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 131 of 258 
 
“…was below 250 million final approval of the 
confinement resided with Mr Molefe the then GCE.  
Mr Rudi Basson, ECPG, and told me that the ETC 
value 
was 
reduced 
to 
fit 
in 
with 
the 
GCE’s 
delegated authority, i.e. within Molefe’s monetary 
mandate.  This meant that he had the delegated 
authority 
to 
authorise 
the 
expenditure 
without 
approval required from the board acquisitions and 
disposal committee.  I annex hereto marked DS3 
the approval of the confinement of phase 1 to Hatch 
10 
and an approved contract value of 220 million.” 
The delegation of authority that was applicable at the 
time.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment on the discussion that 
Rudi Basson had with Deidre Strydom. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment on the discussion that 
Rudi Basson had with Deidre Strydom on the corridor. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But did you fit this contract in your 
20 
mandate? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So you can comment. 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not fit any contract into any 
delegation. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 132 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   And then at paragraph 36 over the page, 
146: 
“The confinement was structured as a fixed cost 
contract 
with 
specific 
and 
very 
high 
supplier 
development targets to be achieved by Hatch.  
Singh increased the SD targets further during the 
approval process.  I know this because I had to get 
Gama to sign the approval and at that stage the SD 
value was 40%.  The final value of SD that was 
submitted to Molefe for final approval was 50%.” 
10 
This seems high to you or not? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot recall this specific transaction like 
that.  But what, is the 50% that you find offensive? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja, I am saying is that high?  Does it 
sound high to you? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know in the context of this 
transaction.  I would have to look at the memo that was 
sent to me to approve what I approved but looking at it like 
this, it does not make – it does not ring any bells. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   It also does not look like there is anything 
wrong that was happening here. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, Mr Molefe, there was a lot wrong 
that was happening here. 
MR MOLEFE:   Huh? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 133 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   There was a huge amount wrong that 
was happening here. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, what was it? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, there were attempts by skills 
development partners and Essa to force Hatch to appoint 
them. 
MR MOLEFE:   Was Essa forcing Hatch to appoint them? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, this is – let us just go back to – I 
have told you about the meeting at the Melrose Arch, I 
have read to you what happened. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And the fact that he referred to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I am not aware of that. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So when you say – I mean, I am just 
trying to explain to you – do you see this is very serious 
thing that was happening here. 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I am not aware of all of these that 
were happening. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, no, I am not suggesting you here 
were aware but do you see how prevalent it seems 
corruption was within the organisation because what we 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 134 of 258 
 
have done in the last half an hour, how many times have 
we seen reference to Mr Essa? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, I have noticed that. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja, it is really a lot of times. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So when P Systems is contracting with a 
party that Mr Essa is a director to, you are ceding a 
contract where Mr Essa’s wife is a director, you are 
referred to her by Mr Essa as being the next CEO of Eskom 
in the context of skills supply development partners being 
10 
foisted on Hatch and we know that is, certainly from the 
money flows evidence, it is through supply development 
partners that so much of this money laundering happened. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Yes, 
those 
are 
your 
findings 
or 
observations that you are making and I choose not to 
comment on them. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sure.  Well, it seems –it is what the 
evidence points to, it is not my finding, I fortunately do not 
need to make any findings. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, that is what you are observing that the 
20 
evidence is pointing. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But it is troubling is it not?  It must be 
to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, you know, it would be troubling if I 
knew that I had done something wrong.  So, I mean, this 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 135 of 258 
 
was happening in the background, I was not aware of it 
and if these people have anything to answer to, let them 
answer to it, all I am pointing out is that I was not aware of 
this. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes but what I am trying to get at is 
even now when you see this, is it not troubling to you? 
MR MOLEFE:   I would trouble me if my conscience knew 
that I had done something wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Molefe... 
MR MOLEFE:   I think we have traversed this, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have and maybe one should take 
what you have said before and say you would say the same 
thing but one wants to be sure.  I would expect that if – 
assuming that the evidence that Mr Myburgh is talking 
about were to be true, it is what was happening, it would 
mean that in the organisation where you were Group Chief 
Executive Officer there was a lot of corruption and money 
laundering that may have been perpetrated by certain 
people and assume for present purposes that you were 
innocent and you did not know but just hearing about it to 
20 
say is this what was happening while I was there?  I would 
expect that it would be of concern to you, not to say 
necessarily that you had anything to do with it.  Just the 
fact that it may have been happening or if the evidence is 
true it was happening, taxpayers’ money, people were 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 136 of 258 
 
using all kinds of vehicles to get money illegally. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, then if it was indeed 
happening I am concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright and then to another topic, the 
New Age.  I think you have accepted that under your watch 
investments 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this file can go [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, it can go back, thank you, 
10 
Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, I think that you have – that under 
your watch Transnet sponsored The Big Interview in the 
New Age. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you did that for a number of years? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And I see that in 2016 the cost of that 
advertising was R450 000 per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should I have any bundle in front of me? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, the difficulty, DCJ is that this 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you will mention when I need to 
have one? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 137 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   The difficulty with this and the exhibit is 
that this comes from another stream, it is MM. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, when – it may well be, you 
will assess it, I need to have a file in front of me. 
ADV MYBURGH:   We do have – your registrar has it but I 
want to try and short-circuit all of this.  Mr Jackson – you 
have been referred to this. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja but you said in 2016. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, attached – I have been looking 
through the invoices and I see that in 2016 it was 450 000 
10 
per month. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes but in 2016 I was not at Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, okay, fair enough, I accept that.  
What Mr Jackson says and you have been asked about this 
and you have asked to comment is that he thought that this 
was not at all valuable or really in the interests of 
Transnet.  Do you want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I have in my affidavit, Chairperson, pointed 
to Mr Jackson’s evidence but when I arrived at Transnet we 
were actually advertising in the mainstream media, paying 
20 
a lot of money on the rail crossing campaign and this was 
to alert people to the dangers of rail crossing.  It was a 
noble campaign.  But the way that it was done is that there 
were very gruesome pictures that were printed and even 
played on TV of trains hitting cars and I felt that this is not 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 138 of 258 
 
– and we were paying for that, this advertising, I do not 
know if maybe the investigating team has cared to quantify 
how much we paid for that, for those advertisements in the 
mainstream media.  
And what I said to the branding team was that this 
is not good for the brand to be seen – for our trains to be 
seen to be smashing cars.  This is what remains in 
people’s minds.  I even said that, you know, when children 
associate our trains with the collisions with minibus taxis, 
that is what will stay in their mind and they may not want 
10 
to work for Transnet when they grow up, so we have to find 
another positive way of doing it and I also said we must 
desist from advertising where we pay for a message 
because people read through it.  So if we say we are the 
most effective and efficient transportation company in 
Africa and we have paid to say that, it is not as effective 
as the same message being in the news, in the news, as 
part of the main news.  So we have to move from paying 
for adverts, paying for adverts and move our brand into the 
mainstream news, find a way of moving our brand into the 
20 
mainstream news and The Big Interview was an opportunity 
to do that.  Even though the people, when we sponsored 
The Big Interview, the people that spoke at The Big 
Interview spoke about news, about topical issues and not 
Transnet is an effective and efficient organisation.  So now 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 139 of 258 
 
we were building partners here with people that were 
speaking at The Big Interview to support our messaging 
later 
but 
also, 
whenever 
possible, 
putting 
in 
our 
newsworthy 
issues 
onto 
the 
news 
through 
The 
Big 
Interview and this is the shift that I asked to be done from 
a branding point of view, we should be seen in the news 
and not in the advertising pages from a branding point of 
view.  So this is a discussion that I had, Mr Jackson I think 
was present and he agreed and we agreed that on this 
philosophical or doctrinal issue this is how we were going 
10 
to move forward and that was the reason for supporting 
The Big Interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe we will talk more later on 
on the matter, you may or may not know that when some of 
the Transnet witnesses, who talked on this issue, came to 
give evidence, I had lots of issues, questions to them.  I 
would have thought that if the best way to promote your 
brand is to be in the news is to do things that are 
newsworthy and you are therefore in the news for good 
things. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes as opposed to what you have just 
mentioned, which was mentioned by those witnesses too, 
that in these breakfast shows very often the speakers 
would not be speaking about Transnet. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 140 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would be talking about whatever 
had been planned to talked about. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it did not seem to me that the 
idea that it was promoting Transnet’s brand was as clear 
as it might be to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson, and the idea was actually 
very subtle because these people were newsmakers and 
what we were implanting in them is a positive view of 
10 
Transnet.  We were engaged in the MDS.  At the same time 
we were a lot in the news about the MDS but the idea was 
that whenever, for example, we have a project that comes 
onto the news, these newsmakers would then help to 
promote the positive news on the other things that we were 
doings.  I do not know if you understand what I mean.  So 
there would be a friendly force. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, as you speak, the point that comes 
to my mind is that if you have done something that is 
newsworthy, the media houses will not even pay because 
20 
that is newsworthy. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They will want it and you will be talked 
about in favourable terms without you paying, you know? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 141 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it seems to me that if you or Transnet 
engaged in activities that were seen as good by the 
community and as newsworthy, that is when you would get 
– you promote your brand and you would do so without 
paying. 
MR MOLEFE:   So, Chairperson, let us for example, nè, 
take that we sponsor a news – this programme and the 
person 
that 
is 
being 
interviewed 
is 
the 
Premier 
of 
Mpumalanga and she is going to talk about her successes 
as the Premier of Mpumalanga.  So that is fine, she talks 
10 
about her successes as the Premier of Mpumalanga but we 
operate 
in 
Mpumalanga. 
 The 
day 
that 
we 
have 
a 
newsworthy item and she gets an opportunity to be 
interviewed about a matter that involves Transnet we can 
be sure that she will go out of her way to make sure that 
she portrays us in a very good light.  That was the whole 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I will let Mr Myburgh take it from 
there but if you have done something that is seen as good 
by the community or by the society, the news people will be 
20 
there, you will not need somebody else, you …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Which news people, Chairperson?  The 
media?  These ones? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chairperson, we live in two different 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 142 of 258 
 
countries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe Transnet was not doing 
those things that it should have done. 
MR MOLEFE:   We were.  We were executing the market 
demand strategy, we were announcing all sorts of good 
news every week.  Government was -  generally, the 
problem in government is that despite the overwhelming 
negative publicity there are a lot of things that are good 
that government has done that have not made it into the 
news.  The attitude of our media is that if somebody has 
10 
not died, if there is no scandal involved, they are not 
interested and so this was – I mean, you can talk to all the 
communicators from government, this was a big problem 
for the nineties right through the 2000 and even up to now 
I can say that our media finds it difficult to portray our 
government in a positive light.  That is – there are very few 
people who would argue against that kind of statement, it 
is a – and I experienced it in my entire career that we have 
done spectacular good things but the media was no 
interested in it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine.  I will mention 
one example of my own experience.  I think about two 
years ago I went to the area, the village where I grew up. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And went to the primary school that I 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 143 of 258 
 
attended because the Zondo and Bux Educational Trust 
that was established a few years ago had spoken to 
another trust about the situation in the school which I 
attended of toilets and so on and that trust organised 
funding and they sorted that out and we went there to have 
a function and to say this is what has been done and I 
think somebody must have told the media and some 
journalists went to that rural area and they were there and 
the story was in a number of newspapers about the toilets 
that had been built for the school and a school hall in the 
10 
high school in the area.  We did not pay anything to the 
media for them to put us in the newspapers. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am just mentioning, I think it might 
be a matter of degree.  I am just mentioning one example.  
Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, thank you. 
MR MOLEFE:   I was going to give another example that 
involves you but I will leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Molefe, I am just going to read to 
you, I do not think you have this exhibit before you but this 
is just one paragraph, it is EXHIBIT MM5 at page 10 
paragraph 47.  Mr Jackson says this …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 144 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   Page 10, JFJ10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Jackson says this: 
“My own view was that the decision to participate in 
The Big Interview was not justifiable given that TNA 
was 
a 
new 
publication 
with 
no 
readership 
or 
circulation 
data 
and 
a 
completely 
unknown 
demographic 
reach. 
 
This 
meant 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
evaluate 
the 
newspaper’s 
reach 
insofar 
our 
stakeholders 
are 
concerned 
and 
10 
constituted a significant risk considering the amount 
of money involved.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Does he indicate that he raised this during 
our debates because my recollection is that when we had 
this debate about the repositioning of the brand advertising 
he agreed.  As I say in my memo, maybe it was just 
because to buy my face as he is trying to buy the face of 
his new bosses now.  It is just a reflection of the person 
that he is but I cannot recall that he raised that issue 
20 
either in a memo or in a debate on this matter. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  I would like to move to another 
topic please.  Chairperson, you can dispense with that file 
and if you could now be provided with Transnet bundle 1, 
EXHIBIT BB15 and I would like now to address briefly the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 145 of 258 
 
topic of Mr Gama’s legal fees. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And I would like to start – I think I am 
going to refer you only to two documents.  Can you please 
go to BB15, you should have a tab 2. 
MR MOLEFE:   BB15, 2? 
ADV MYBURGH:   And I see it is consecutively numbered 
so perhaps you can go directly to page 142.  You will see 
at 142 there is a memorandum to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   From a Mr Mapoma, general manager 
Group Legal Services. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And it deals with legal fees, Mr Gama 
versus Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Let me direct your attention to 
paragraph 4. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   You refer to a settlement and it says: 
20 
“The relevant clause of the settlement agreement is 
clause 3.5 which provides that Transnet will make 
contribution equivalent to 75% of Mr Gama’s tax 
costs incurred during his High Court application and 
in respect of his unfair dismissal dispute referred to 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 146 of 258 
 
the bargaining council.”  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So 75% of the costs in his High Court 
application and 75% of his costs in the unfair dismissal 
dispute referred to the bargaining council. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now if you can skip to paragraph 7 at 
page 143 or in fact let us go to 6: 
10 
“Mr Gama incurred legal costs in two matters.” 
You would have seen that from the settlement agreement 
as well. 
“The first is his application in the High Court in 
which Transnet used two sets of attorneys, Bowman 
Gilfillan…” 
It says Deneys Reitz but that should actually, I think, be 
Eversheds. 
“The second matter in which he incurred costs 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I think it should say Eversheds? 
ADV MYBURGH:   It should say Eversheds, yes. 
“The second matter in which he incurred costs is 
the labour matter.” 
And then it says: 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 147 of 258 
 
“The costs in the High Court were granted in 
Transnet’s favour by the court.” 
Do you see that?  So you won that case. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright. 
“These costs were supposed to have been paid by 
Mr Gama.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:    
10 
“On reaching settlement with Mr Gama, Transnet 
sought and obtained the taxed bills from these two 
firms of attorneys and paid 75% of the total 
amounts.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Does that make any sense to you?  So 
you win, he owes you costs, what you land up paying him 
are your costs. 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH:   You win with costs. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was not there. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But this memo was sent to you, I am 
trying to ask…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, this memo was sent to me and all I did 
was to note it. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 148 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   You just noted it? 
MR MOLEFE:   I just noted it, I just – so there must have 
been a request from me to say please apprise me of the 
Gama matter. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But when you note – perhaps I 
misunderstand things, but you noted it - whether you 
approved it or not, did you read the nonsense in paragraph 
7? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, I read it, but I cannot comment on it 
even now. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But, Mr Molefe, just let us have a look 
at what it says.  The costs in the High Court were granted 
in your favour. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   These costs were supposed to be paid 
by Mr Gama, your costs. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   On reaching settlement with Gama, 
20 
Transnet sought and obtained tax bills from these two firms 
of attorneys.  Your attorneys. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And then paid to Mr Gama their fees. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 149 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the question really, Mr Molefe, is you 
may or may not have approved but you noted and you read. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you pick up this very absurd idea? 
MR MOLEFE:   ...and – ja, so I requested, I must have 
requested – there was, I think there was a query from the 
Director General about this matter that I knew very little 
about and I asked to be appraised and this is the memo 
that was sent to me and then I read it but it is a matter that 
was handled by the Board, it was handled by the Board and 
10 
I read this memorandum and these were facts that were 
being presented to me.   
I don’t know if there was expectation that I should 
do anything about it or challenge it or say, I don’t approve 
but it was done at the Board and this was a memo from Mr 
Mapoma who’s a General Manager Group Legal Services 
and he was talking about tax costs and 75% and soon.   
I can’t say that I really understood what he was 
saying, I just noted that there was an agreement that the 
costs would be settled in a particular way. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, if you were asked to approve 
this would have looked at it more carefully, is that what 
you’re saying or not? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I can’t speculate on what I would have 
done if this had come to me for approval.  Perhaps I would 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 150 of 258 
 
have sought more clarity. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let’s look at page 104. 
MR MOLEFE:   104> 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, because earlier in the year you 
had, in fact, approved this. 
MR MOLEFE:   Earlier? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   104, so this memo is dated, that I 
took you to at 142, it’s dated 17 August 2011. Let me take 
you to the memo at 104, this is no 23 March 2011. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see, it refers there, at the 
bottom of the page, the same 3.5 of the settlement 
agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it says, “Financial 
Implications”, over the page, 
“75% of the attached invoices have been paid to Mr 
Gama”, 
 
And then those attached invoices are invoices you 
see over the page Eversheds Attorneys and Bowman 
20 
Gilfillan Attorneys. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that you approved. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, because, as you see in paragraph 2 of 
the memo, the – so this is an agreement that the Board 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 151 of 258 
 
had entered into and had agreed to pay and my approval, 
really, was as a functionary who effected payment of a 
Board agreement, basically. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I’m still – I’m not sure that I – in 
other words, if something is put before you for approval 
you can just sign it? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, if the Board has entered into an 
agreement that a certain payment will be made, and I do 
not see why I would be standing in the way of the payment 
being made. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But  the thing is the Board hadn’t 
entered into that agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   The Board hadn’t? 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
No, 
because 
have 
a 
look 
at…[intervenes]. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
The 
settlement 
negotiations 
were 
sanctioned by the Transnet Board and the Chairman of the 
Board. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...[indistinct]  Mkhwanazi was mandated to 
20 
conclude such a negotiation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct, Mr Molefe, but the point is, 
if you go to 3.5 the clause, Transnet will make a 
contribution equivalent to 75% to Mr Gama’s tax costs 
incurred in the High Court and in the labour matter.  What 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 152 of 258 
 
this memorandum lands up doing, is authorising Mr Gama 
to receive your costs. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but this was in terms of the 
agreement…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, it wasn’t the terms of the 
agreement was that he would get his costs, that’s what I’m 
taxing you about, …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me explain it Mr Molefe.  Mr Gama, I 
think 
when 
he 
was 
suspended, 
brought 
an 
urgent 
application 
in 
the 
High 
Court 
against 
Transnet 
and 
10 
various…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When he was suspended? 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he  was suspended against 
Transnet as an entity as well as a number of members of 
the Board, maybe all of them, I’m not sure but a number of 
them 
to, 
effectively, 
get 
the 
suspension 
set 
aside.  
Transnet 
and 
various 
Board 
members 
opposed 
that 
application and the High Court dismissed that application 
and said he must pay Transnet’s costs as well as the costs 
of those members of the Board who had opposed the 
20 
application, that’s what the Court ordered. Now, Transnet 
and the Board members had gone to lawyers and briefed 
lawyers to oppose this application, so Transnet had 
incurred costs.  So, the order of the Court as far as the 
costs were concerned, was to the effect that Mr Gama must 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 153 of 258 
 
pay Transnet and the Board members, their legal costs.  
Now the – what, ultimately happened, which is what Mr 
Myburgh is talking about is that Transnet – the settlement 
agreement said that Mr – Transnet must pay, I think 75% of 
Mr Gama’s legal costs. 
MR MOLEFE:   That’s what the settlement agreement said? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
that’s 
what 
the 
settlement 
agreement says, even though he had lost in the High 
Court. 
MR MOLEFE:   So, that was the settlement agreement that 
10 
was entered into with Mr Mkhwanazi? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes but leave aside whatever you 
may think of that part of the settlement agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the memorandum – what was, 
ultimately done, was not to look at 75% of Mr Gama’s legal 
costs but to take at the legal costs of Transnet and say 
what is 75% of the costs that Transnet and its Board 
members have incurred in this litigation and then say, we 
will pay Mr Gama 75% of our legal costs.  So, that’s what 
20 
he’s talking about to say, that’s something very, very 
strange. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, Chairperson,  to be honest with you, my 
understanding of this matter was that Mr Gama had been 
dismissed and that the matter went to Court and now we 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 154 of 258 
 
have entered – or the Board or Mr Mkhwanazi] has entered 
into an agreement to pay his costs – entered into an 
agreement to pay his costs and that this was the payment 
in line with that agreement.  I would expect that, if there 
was anything untoward the legal people would have picked 
it up because, in fact, this recommendation came from the 
legal department that we should make a payment, in this 
fashion.  Mr Mapoma was the General Manager Legal 
Services 
compiled 
the 
memorandum 
and 
it 
was 
recommended by the Head of legal at Transnet, Ms Zola 
10 
Stephen.  I took it that it was a payment in line with what 
has been agreed, I must confess that I did not go into the 
intricacies of how this thing - in any case this thing of the 
legal cost is something that I’m yet to understand because 
you know people talk about tax costs, but it doesn’t involve 
SARS and – so I – tax costing is not something that I’m 
confident with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughter], no, not the tax cost’s part I 
can understand, from a lay person’s point of view when you 
say tax costs, where is SARS here but of course, 
20 
obviously, I think if you are required to approve anything 
and there’s something you don’t understand you need to 
ask because you don’t want to approve something that’s 
wrong. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but also when it comes from the Head 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 155 of 258 
 
of Legal and the General Manager Legal Services and it is 
referred to an agreement that was entered into, even 
before my time and – ja the case numbers are quoted 
there.  If you look at the recommendation Chair, it says, 
“Based on the motivation above, I recommend that 
the contribution to the legal fees must be paid as 
per the settlement agreement”, 
 
For me there was nothing to argue, if, indeed it was 
as per the settlement agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Let’s turn to 
another topic please and that is Abalozi, could I ask you to 
go to Transnet Bundle 3 and to Exhibit BB17.  Right, now 
could you please turn to page 499. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say, 499? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Chairperson, 499. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I hope I didn’t misrepresent 
anything, Mr Myburgh about what happened with regard to 
those costs, to Mr Molefe? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is, as I understand it – look I 
20 
understand that Mr Gama, I checked with my junior, in his 
affidavit’s he’s dealt with costs, but he doesn’t seem to 
have said much I understand that he may have a version 
that he will give and that might change things but as the 
evidence stands now, it’s correctly so. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 156 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think I saw that in his affidavit he 
said that High Court costs and costs in regard to the labour 
matter, that’s how he puts it, but I just saw in the 
settlement agreement or the quoted paragraph in the memo 
that you referred us to, it doesn’t say labour matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says, it’s specific, the matter unfair 
dismissal matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, the referral to the Bargaining 
Council. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR MOLEFE: But it will be interesting to see what Ms 
Stephen and Mr Mapoma also say.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he has given evidence and – ja but 
certainly there is evidence and if you’d like to have a look 
at it, it will be available, the transcript. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, Mr Molefe, can we turn to page 
499, are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, we’re dealing now with Abalozi 
and you would have seen these paragraphs.  Mr Tadu was 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 157 of 258 
 
instructed by Bowman Gilfillan he was one of the attorneys 
dealing with the matter and you know up to this point 
litigation 
had 
been 
entered 
into, Transnet 
had 
sued 
Abalozi.  He says that, 
“I was subsequently invited together with one of my 
partners and counsel to attend a meeting with the 
Group CEO, Mr Molefe.  I prepared a note in 
anticipation 
of 
the 
meeting 
which 
briefly 
summarised the key message that I intended to 
communicate to Mr Molefe.  Then he goes on to say 
10 
at 43, the meeting with Mr Molefe duly took place, 
Mr Molefe informed us that the litigation was 
sensitive and that he had been receiving calls from 
a person he did not identify by name, but I assume 
from the context was General Nyanda, asking why 
Transnet was assisting with the litigation against 
Abalozi”, 
 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I can’t recall but I said in the meeting that I 
had been receiving calls from anyone, I can’t recall that. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right, then at 45, shortly before this 
meeting it appears that Mr Selinga had addressed a 
memorandum to Mr Molefe in which he motivated for and 
recommended the rescission of the decision that had 
previously been made to exclude GNS/Abalozi from doing 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 158 of 258 
 
further business with Transnet effectively a blacklisting, is 
that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is correct, Chair, and if I can explain 
this.  I was informed that Abalozi had been blacklisted and 
then I asked, what process was followed to blacklist them, 
and no process had been followed at all and I do know that 
before anyone is blacklisted there has to be a process and 
the person has to be heard and everything must be 
recorded.  Even in the Treasury instructions but also, I’ve 
been dealing with Mr Selinga and the legal department, I 
10 
mean they should have known that it’s a requirement that 
people have to be heard before you blacklist them. So, I 
said, if that blacklisting is challenged, we will not be, so 
we must rescind it immediately because it is illegal and so 
that is how that memo came about. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because they hadn’t been afforded a 
fair procedure? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, why didn’t you just give them 
one? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, the blacklisting had happened some 
time before I arrived. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That I understand but did you ever 
enquire into why they were blacklisted? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 159 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what did you discover? 
MR MOLEFE:   Because they said that they had done work 
– they claimed to have done work which they had not done.  
They said – so it was a contract – I think it was a guarding 
contract and it was about providing personnel for the 
guarding of – I think it was trains and that Transnet was 
saying they did not do the work, however, our head of 
security at the time, Major General Baduza [?] had come to 
me and said to me that Abalozi had not done work is not 
true, Abalozi has copies of the work – proof of the work 
10 
that they have done and somebody here at TFR is hiding 
that, so that they don’t get paid and so it appeared that 
Abalozi was not being treated fairly.  In my affidavit I do 
say, - I did talk about this story and say that subsequent to 
informing me about this, General Dukkha brought the 
information to me and I took the information to Transnet’s 
Risk Committee as well as – I can’t remember which other 
committee, two committees of Transnet and the decision 
there was, then we should settle this matter and I was 
given a mandate to go and settle this matter out of court 
20 
because it would be embarrassing that we have actually 
been hiding proof that Abalozi had done work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you actually establish that there was 
proof that Abalozi had done work? 
MR MOLEFE:   General Dukkha brought it to me, and he 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 160 of 258 
 
said to me, he interviewed people at Transnet that had 
knowledge that the work had been done and that there are 
certain people that are hiding that evidence from Transnet 
– ja from the Management at Transnet.  He investigated 
the matter and brought the proof to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now – so did he bring you statements by 
people who claimed to have witnessed Abalozi perform the 
work, what actually did he bring to you? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
It 
was 
files 
of 
timesheets 
and 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Timesheets that were signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But timesheets can be made without 
somebody working…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, he said that it was proof and that 
there are people at Transnet – he mentioned by name the 
people that were prepared to make a statement to say that 
the work has in fact been done but from what was 
presented at the time, I was convinced that that it was, 
indeed, true that Transnet had done the work. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you ask that statements be 
obtained from people who were prepared to append 
signatures to say, we did see Abalozi perform work there, 
there, and there that day and that day, did you get that – 
then it would mean certain people who were prepared to 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 161 of 258 
 
stand up and give evidence to say, yes, did you get that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I did not ask for the statements to be 
obtained from the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Part of the problem may have been that 
these were people that General Dukkha considered to be 
sources. 
 
General 
Dukkha’s 
background 
was 
Crime 
Intelligence, he had come from Crime Intelligence so, I 
mean, 
perhaps 
– 
ja 
maybe 
he 
should 
have 
advised…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because you don’t need Crime 
Intelligence for this. If Abalozi’s work for example was that 
they must send security officers or certain people to be in 
certain 
guarding’s 
during 
certain 
times 
or 
to 
guard 
Transnet’s buildings in certain places or whatever the work 
was then there ought to be people who were employed by 
Transnet who were supposed to sign whenever there was 
somebody – the guard was there and so on. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is the files that were brought to say 
that this is proof of work done. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the question is, do you know 
whether, what you were provided with…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   Was not fraudulent? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let’s leave out the fraud it may be 
fraudulent.  Did it contain documents where people who 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 162 of 258 
 
had witnessed Abalozi doing what they were contractually 
obliged to do, in other words there were signatures where 
people say, yes…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, that was the nature of the evidence.  
What I was thinking you were asking is, did they make the 
statement, they did not make statements, but these were 
as I said timesheets. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Like these people were here and they 
signed, these people were here, and they signed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but did you only rely on the General 
in terms of those people who had signed or was there some 
investigation…[intervenes]? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, there were two or three people inside 
TFR that had this information and then there two or three 
people that knew that this information had – and had 
copies and gave it to General.  What we didn’t understand 
was, why was this being suppressed, why didn’t this come 
out into the open. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Did 
you 
authorise 
somebody 
to 
20 
investigate who was hiding the information from Transnet? 
MR MOLEFE:   General did, I can’t recall that he ever 
wrote a report on that but General did…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
Were 
those 
people 
confronted…[intervenes]. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 163 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   I do recall saying that this is a matter that 
may require disciplinary action if it was, indeed, a Transnet 
employee that that was hiding the information but people 
who were at TFR would be able to confirm that this was, 
indeed, happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe you know 
that, subsequently Transnet appointed a firm of attorneys, 
HNR to investigate this matter?  
MR MOLEFE:   This Abalozi matter? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, in other words to investigate 
whether – it’s their report that gave rise to the withdrawal 
of the litigation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   People refer to it often just simply 
as the Nupen Report, are you familiar with that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I’m familiar with…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you familiar with the report? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, and do you know whether, in 
20 
that report, there’s any reference to timesheets and this 
information 
and 
evidence 
that 
you’ve 
been 
telling…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, that report was compiled as if that 
information did not exist. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 164 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you explain why that would be? 
MR MOLEFE:   I don’t know, as I say, it would appear that 
somebody had been hiding that information even from this 
investigation…[intervenes]. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 These 
are 
people 
that 
you 
appointed, and they produced a report…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, they were appointed before my time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Nupen was appointed, and he gave a 
report to the Risk Committee, the Risk Committee accepted 
the report, and the litigation was withdrawn. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know whether there’s any 
reference 
in 
the 
Nupen 
Report 
to 
this 
stock 
of 
information…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I can’t recall that there is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if there’s no reference in it, then 
it seems it’s quite questionable…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I don’t recall that Nupen had reference 
to these timesheets, I can’t also recall that he had the 
information that we had. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And, if he didn’t, can you explain 
why, I mean he interviewed people at Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
He 
conducted 
a 
thorough 
investigation. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 165 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know what he’s key 
conclusion was? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You don’t? 
MR MOLEFE:   I don’t remember what  his key conclusion 
was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, his key conclusion was really 
that bodies hadn’t been provided, people hadn’t worked but 
value had been added or things saved. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Bodies had been? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bodies had not been provided, warm 
bodies. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But that savings had been affected 
through certain initiatives. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, by Abalozi? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Do you see the tension, you say 
20 
you’re sitting on a stock of information that proved in your 
mind that people had worked, and bodies had been 
provided. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, the information that we had was the 
work had been done and that the people that were 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 166 of 258 
 
supposed to be provided to do the work had been provided. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  By way of timesheets, you saw there 
were people working? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Ja 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
information, 
timesheets, and reports and so on. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, Mr Molefe one would, I 
suppose, have to study the report, and then reflect back on 
your evidence but let me get to another point.  Had you 
been seeking…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   But the fact of the matter is that the 
10 
information that was brought to us went through the Risk 
Committee, perhaps it may be worthwhile to look at the 
minutes of the Risk Committee where this information was 
presented, that I remember very clearly.  The General 
brought the information and what I did with it, was to go to 
the Board and say that look, here is this information that 
we now have…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So, you confirm you were in touch 
with the General during this time? 
MR MOLEFE:   General reported to me…[intervenes]. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But not General Nyanda it’s another 
General? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, not General Nyanda…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transnet’s General. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, I beg your pardon. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 167 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja General Dukkha …[indistinct]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay had you been speaking at all to 
General Nyanda? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I know General Nyanda, and we may 
have been speaking on other matters even, sometimes,  
playing golf, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He’s a friend of yours? 
MR MOLEFE:   He’s a friend of mine yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because we know Mr Gama also, I 
think, played golf with him, he was obviously an avid 
10 
golfer, the General. 
MR MOLEFE:   You see he played golf with the General, 
you see how it went. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Laughter]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is this the General…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to find out whether you’d do 
better than him against the General? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well, to put it in context, General Nyanda 
has – or maybe used to have, before Covid, an annual golf 
day in Swaziland really to raise funds for people that had – 
20 
in Swaziland that had supported the ANC and Umkhonto 
We Sizwe in the underground in Swaziland.  So, every year 
– I also used to play in that golf challenge and ja, at least 
when we went to Swaziland, I did see him, we did talk but 
even in between we did talk, so yes, I know him.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 168 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So, I’d like then to just move forward 
and wrap up on this.  So, the Risk Committee, ultimately on 
the Nupen Report took a decision that the litigation should 
be withdrawn. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what we then know is that you 
signed the settlement agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, and the agreement was that both 
parties are not proceeding with the litigation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   And that both parties would further 
negotiate a settlement amount. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So, can I just take you please to the 
deed of settlement that’s at page 789 of the same bundle, 
Bundle 3 BB16. 
MR MOLEFE:   Page 89? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  789, are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You’ll see that at – between the 
tramlines is “Deed of Settlement”, are you there? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So, it talks about,  
“Whereas Transnet issued summons etcetera, under 
that, 
whereas Abalozi 
issued 
a 
counter 
claim 
now…[intervenes]. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 169 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, I know that we are trying to 
save time, but I think this document is quite important.  I 
would suggest because it’s not long…[intervenes]. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I’ll read it into the record, thank you, 
I’m indebted to you. 
“...Transnet SOC (Ltd) Transnet.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “Issued a summons against Abalozi 
Risk Advisory Services Pty Ltd Abalozi.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “Previously known as General 
Nyanda Security Risk Advisory Services Pty 
Ltd GNS.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “In connection with security services 
rendered to Transnet by GNS in the period 
2007 to 2009 the service, and whereas Abalozi 
issued a counter claim against Transnet in 
connection with the services.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “Now wherefore Transnet and Abalozi 
have agreed to settle all disputes between 
them in this litigation on the following term.  
One, Transnet hereby withdraws its action 
against 
Abalozi. 
 
Two, 
Abalozi 
hereby 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 170 of 258 
 
withdraws its counterclaim against Transnet.  
Three, Transnet will upon signature hereof 
issue a media statement in the form as agreed 
and attached hereto marked A.  Four, Transnet 
will pay all the legal costs incurred by Abalozi, 
its directors and the cofounders and directors 
of GNS on an attorney and own client scale, 
and five the terms of the settlement are 
settlement 
agreement 
are 
confidential 
and 
shall not be disclosed by any one of the 
10 
parties to any third party.” 
 
Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this was a settlement of all 
disputes between the parties in this litigation. 
MR MOLEFE:  In this litigation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Claim and counterclaim. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, without going into the amounts.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, well the only amounts that are 
referred to is the costs.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So that had to be computed, the 
costs.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Have you any idea, and you 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 171 of 258 
 
negotiated this agreement.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Why did you agree that Transnet, 
first of all why did you agree that Transnet should pay any 
costs?  Transnet had sued Abalozi, Abalozi had sued 
Transnet.  Both parties were calling it a truce, but why 
should Transnet pick up the tab? 
MR MOLEFE:  The advice that we got from, which is why I 
would have said even this agreement must have been 
exceeded by a memo. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You said you negotiated this 
agreement, to settle.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, but there was a memo.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You negotiated. 
MR MOLEFE:  I negotiated? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then I am asking you why did you 
decide that Transnet should pick up the tab? 
MR MOLEFE:  Because we were at fault, because we had 
20 
hidden information.  Our people had hidden the information 
that Abalozi had done the work.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Molefe, that was not the 
finding of the Newton report? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well, that may not have been the finding of 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 172 of 258 
 
the Newton report, but this is what I knew for a fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you, in the negotiations did you offer 
to General Nyanda that Transnet would pay the cost or did 
he demand that Transnet will pay the cost? 
MR MOLEFE:  General Nyanda had that information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  And this is what was going to come out in 
the cause of the litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  And General Nyanda’s position was you 
10 
guys blacklisted me illegally without going through a 
process, because of a something, because of information 
that you had hidden, we as Abalozi had not done anything 
wrong.   
 
It is you who hid away our report and therefore I 
think that we were wrong, and unfortunately I had no leg to 
stand on.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh, let me leave it to you to 
continue.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you, and then why costs 
20 
incurred by Abalozi, its directors and cofounders and 
directors of GNS, why?  Were the cofounders, were they 
even party to this agreement, and the directors of GNS? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Why would you ...[intervenes]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 173 of 258 
 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Well 
Chairperson, 
that 
is 
what 
was 
represented to me as the damage that would have been 
done by the fact that we had been hiding information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Molefe, the business dealings 
were between Abalozi and Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  They were not between Abalozi and the 
directors, cofounders of GNS and all of that.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So why would you owe the directors 
anything on top of owing, let us assume that Transnet 
owed something arising out of this.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would you owe the directors and 
cofounders of GNS on top of owing Abalozi as an entity? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Chairperson, 
I 
mean 
this 
is 
what 
I 
understood to have been the damage that we had done by 
hiding the information.  However ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What damage?  What damage? 
MR MOLEFE:  Having said that, it would have been helpful 
if I would have seen the name that I preceded, I was 
signing this agreement.  Typically there would have been a 
memo that explains everything that is in the agreement and 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 174 of 258 
 
why we are doing what we are doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the directors and the cofounders, 
own founders had not sued Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On our bundles ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  I do not have a recollection of why the 
clause was included as it is, as it was.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  I do not have a recollection as to the 
background of that clause now as I sit here.  Perhaps if I 
10 
go and reflect on it I may remember the reason why but 
what I can think of as I am sitting here is because we were 
in the wrong.  
 
We had hidden away information and caused a lot 
of damage to the company.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What kind of damage did you cause? 
MR MOLEFE:  Reputational, they have been blacklisted 
and they have been known that they have been blacklisted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you publish the blacklisting? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, the matter was in court.  It was at the 
20 
courts.  It was public. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  It was in court, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 175 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they sue you for it? 
MR MOLEFE:  They did.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  That is what, this is a settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that is the counterclaim. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the counterclaim? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but certainly as you sit here, I 
mean you, you ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope you do not say I am patronizing 
you.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You must be careful, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I did not say anything but there 
was a time when you accused Mr Myburgh of patronizing 
you and I thought it was not.  When you occupy a certain 
position. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You know, group CEO of Transnet. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You must be taken to have certain 
knowledge and so on and so on.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So there are certain things that we can 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 176 of 258 
 
take it that you cannot be, you cannot not know certain 
things.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am, my reaction when I saw this for 
the first time, and I can indicate it was, I became aware of 
it after we had been looking at the settlement of Mr Gama.  
Between Mr Gama ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Transnet.  This looked very strange.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to me, when I think of you having 
been CEO of PIC, CEO of ... group CEO of Transnet, I 
would expect that in litigation such as this, even though 
you might not be a lawyer, but your general knowledge and 
experience would have you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But if we settle and pay cost, if we are 
supposed to pay any cost to the entity. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That should be enough. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You know, we should not be paying the 
directors and cofounders and all of that.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I unfair to expect that kind of 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 177 of 258 
 
knowledge? 
MR MOLEFE:  Okay, but let me take you through my 
decision-making process as I recall it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  The counterclaim was about 95 million.  
Sitting 
there, 
negotiating 
and 
finally 
coming 
to 
this 
agreement, even with this clause my quick calculation was 
we were not going to get anywhere near 95, and that if the 
matter proceeded to Court and they were suing us for 95 
million which they said was the damage, I saw that we had 
10 
no leg to stand on.  We had even the information.  So my 
calculation was it does not matter because it will not be 
anywhere near 95.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you bother to say let us get a legal 
opinion as to whether this claim of theirs has got any 
merits and if so ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How close, what risk do we have of 
paying even half of 95 million.   
MR MOLEFE:  Their claim had merits because we had 
20 
hidden the information.  I was ashamed at what Transnet 
Employees had done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you are not answering my question 
Mr Molefe.  You may have thought it had merit but you are 
not a lawyer.   
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 178 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am asking you whether you bothered to 
ask for a legal opinion, people who could say to you in law 
yes, there is a claim and two, it has got reasonable 
prospects and if they succeed, will they come close to 95 
million. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, which is why I was asking for the 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Because my recollection was that this was 
10 
in fact drafted by us, by Transnet legal department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so are you 
saying that your 
recollection is that there was a legal opinion from within 
the ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  No, not a legal opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  But from our side ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  I was not alone in a small claims bar, we 
were in Transnet and I sat with the legal department of 
20 
Transnet, and as far as I recall there would have been a 
memo saying that here is a matter and we recommend that 
we settle in this manner.  
 
This document itself was drafted at Transnet by our 
legal department.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 179 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Perhaps in the process of drafting, if they 
have seen that this was untoward or not possible or 
unreasonable, perhaps they should have advised and said 
this does not get done, but from a global view which is 
where I was, was that well from 95 million to paying cost, it 
looks like a good deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, okay.  So from 95 million, thank 
you Chairperson, to paying cost looks like a good deal.  
10 
When you negotiated this settlement, did you negotiate it 
with General Nyanda? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, General Nyanda was there.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I see. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So let us have a look at what 
happened after that.  If you go to page 807 you were 
written a letter.  Your reference ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  807 Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You had written a letter by Abalozi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see that, dear Brian and if you 
go to paragraph 8 at 808, it says: 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 180 of 258 
 
 
“They propose 40 million.  The 40 million 
proposal or settlement was believed to be fair 
restitution and compensation inclusive of legal 
costs incurred in this matter.  Even the extra 
information required by Transnet in response 
and the detail of lost revenue provided in this 
communication, we think that a settlement of 
60 million would be justified.  It will be prudent 
to have this matter concluded.” 
 
So what they were asking for, you see here, is cost.  
10 
They were asking for compensation for lost revenue, 
etcetera.  Do you see all of that at paragraph 8?   
MR MOLEFE:  807?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  808, paragraph 8.  
MR MOLEFE:  808? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 8.  Are you sure you are in 
the right file Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know if I am in the right file.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You need to be in Bundle 3, BB16.  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, BB16, 808 is a letter to Ningisa 
20 
Hofmeyer.  What is the page number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is this the same bundle that you had 
open when you were looking ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Sorry, what is the page number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  808. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 181 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Sorry, I was on the right 808. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, ja.  It is that time of the day 
when starts confusing the red numbers with the black 
numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, it was happening to me yesterday.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, 808. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay.  So what they say, this is dated 
16 October. 
MR MOLEFE:  Before we did the settlement ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No, this is after the settlement.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This, okay.  So they say: 
 
“The 40 million proposal of settlement was 
believed to be fair, inclusive of legal cost or 
whatever, given the extra information required 
by Transnet and the detail of lost revenue.” 
 
So now they have provided loss revenue. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “We think that settlement of 60 
million would be justifiable.”  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you see, now they do not just 
want cost, they also want compensation for lost revenue. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now let us look what you do, is you 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 182 of 258 
 
respond at 803 and at 803, perhaps I could read this into 
the record.  You address it to Abalozi: 
 
“Dear sir, Transnet / Abalozi Risk Advisory 
Services.  Your letter dated 16 October 2014 
herein refers.  Without admission of liability 
Transnet SOC hereby offers you an amount of 
20 million ...” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “In full and final settlement of all 
legal claims and costs.” 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “We will be pleased to receive your 
response to the aforesaid offer within seven 
days of receipt.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now as you have correctly said, as 
you say, you went from 95 million to cost.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But this amount that you settled on, 
was not settlement for costs.  It was something else.  It 
20 
was cost and lost revenue and we do not know what and 
that is really the problem Mr Molefe, because when you 
look at the settlement agreement that you concluded 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 183 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Transnet’s only obligation was to pay 
costs.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  They write to you and they say well, 
we want 60 million. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Which includes cost and lost revenue 
etcetera, and you go back and say well I will give you 20 
million. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what were you paying this money 
for?   
MR MOLEFE:  If you look at the document before 
...[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, which one?   
MR MOLEFE:  On 801. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  It says: 
 
“The purpose of this submission is to request 
the group chief financial officer ...” 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  “To authorize the payment of 20 million.” 
 
Oh, sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, no we have seen this because 
that came after you had actually made this offer.  So they 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 184 of 258 
 
accepted your offer.  That is not unsurprisingly and then Mr 
Salinga and Singh action payment, but what we need ... 
what I want to ask you, is what were you paying this 20 
million for? 
 
You made the counter offer.  It can only be cost on 
the evidence that you have given.   
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, Chairperson I think I must have made a 
mistake here.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, you must have.  
MR MOLEFE:  Because what we were supposed to have 
10 
paid, was the cost. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You gave away 20 million rand 
actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can tell you Mr Molefe, I would not be 
... I would not be candid with you if I did not tell you that 
when I read just a settlement agreement, I was shocked.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just shocking.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Those terms of the settlement agreement 
20 
are shocking.  In all the years that I was in practice before 
I came onto the bench, I had never seen a settlement 
agreement like this.  I have never seen a settlement 
agreement like the one that Mr Gama and Transnet 
concluded.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 185 of 258 
 
 
When you settle, because the basis of a settlement 
is look, we do not know who was going to win or lose in the 
end, if we proceeded with litigation. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the basis.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us settle.  That is normally the 
basis.  Of course, sometimes there might be other 
considerations.  But normally you would have each party 
paying its own cost.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But sometimes you do have the one party 
making some contribution to the cost of the other, usually 
not all the cost, just some contribution. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe you might have a situation 
where they pay party and party cost.  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or one of the parties in a settlement 
agreement, should pay attorney and client cost.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is something I have never come across.  
I do not know about Mr Myburgh. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, Chairperson may I make a request? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is apart from what Mr Myburgh has 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 186 of 258 
 
just drawn attention to, to say the amount was not just for 
cost, you were paying for much more than that, even 
though 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
said 
Abalozi 
had 
withdrawn its action against Transnet.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  May I make a request Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Because my recollection of this matter may 
be very vague.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  That I go and look at this matter again. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  And then come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fair enough. 
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe by way of a supplementary affidavit 
or something like that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no arrangements can be made, even 
if you come back.  I think, because it would not take long.  
I do not know what Mr Myburgh has to say, but let me 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, I would really like to go and interrogate 
20 
this matter again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, I am happy to leave it there, 
thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 187 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is just one other fact that I 
want to just put to you, and that is Mr Todd if my memory 
serves 
me 
correctly 
said 
that 
the 
costs 
could 
not 
conceivably been more than a million rand, because very 
little had happened in this litigation. 
 
There had been an exchange of pleadings and if my 
memory serves me correctly, I think they might have got to 
a discovery affidavit stage, but this litigation was not far 
advanced at all.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe, perhaps that is something 
that you could think about.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And just to add onto that, you know if you 
look at the, the legal costs relating to Mr Gama, I think in 
their legal cost they had the legal cost of the disciplinary 
hearing which had involved senior counsel and so on, and 
had gone on for about 14 days, two weeks.  
 
The cost for that I think were less than four million, 
less than I cannot remember, but we are not talking about 
even ten million I think, but certainly not 20 million.  Here 
20 
the matter had not gone to trial.  Some pleadings had been 
exchanged.  
 
Had not advanced much. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, please allow me Chairperson to go and 
refresh my memory. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 188 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fair enough.  That is fair 
enough, ja.  That is fair enough.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you.  I would like then, it 
is late in the afternoon Mr Molefe, to deal with the final 
topic, and that relates to witnesses 1 and 3.  Do you have 
Bundle 14d available?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe to, maybe to round off the topic of 
that settlement Mr Molefe.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Myburgh, maybe Mr ... there are 
10 
two ways of dealing with it.  One is that after Mr Molefe 
has studied it and tried to recall what happened, one 
option is that he can come back and then put his 
understanding, 
give 
me 
his 
understanding 
and 
explanations, without an affidavit.  
 
Another one is that he could put in an affidavit first 
to say this is my recollection of how this came about blah 
blah blah blah blah and then if need be he could be called 
after that.  I do not know Mr Myburgh if you have any 
evidence, what do you suggest? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think the latter route might be 
preferable.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because potentially he may not need 
to be recalled then.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 189 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Yes, ja. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
But 
we 
are 
in 
your 
hands 
Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
UNKNOWN:  Chairperson, I thought it would also be 
prudent that we make a proposal on how ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
UNKNOWN:  Or have an input on how we can handle this 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
10 
UNKNOWN:  I still have to get instructions.  So we will get 
instructions Chair, and revert back to Mr Myburgh on what 
will be the best way forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  If that could be, if what 
the arrangement is going to be, can be finalized, if 
possible within the next two days because we do not have 
a lot of time.  So that we at least to say this is the agreed 
way forward.  
 
Then we can take it from there.  
UNKNOWN:  Thanks Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Do you have Bundle 14d?  Can I ask 
you please to go to ...[intervenes]  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 190 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  But Mr Essa was not a director of Abalozi.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, but General Nyanda, your golf 
partner, was the director of Abalozi.  That is a bit closer to 
home.  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, maybe I should say this.  No, 
maybe I should not say, you will put in whatever you will 
put in about that settlement and then we carry from there.  
Ja, okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thanks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not being told about Salim Essa 
10 
in regard to Abalozi.  What bundle did you say we should 
have? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  d, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page, I think it is 15.  One five.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got it.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Molefe, I mean given the 
importance of this, I think it may warrant us going through 
it on a paragraph by paragraph basis almost.  Are you in 
the right file?   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 191 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 15, witness 1.  But perhaps 
before I pick my way through this affidavit, could I just ask 
you to give us a summary of what your response is to 
witness 1’s affidavit, and I suppose in particular from page 
1 through to, it should be 15 through to 24, up to the 
heading threats received.  
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson, firstly I did not know who 
witness 1 is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Myburgh, I think it might 
be good for those who are following, to just give a general 
10 
just of what witness 1 said about Mr Molefe, so that when 
he gives his own the just of his response, then they can 
follow or is that going to be difficult? 
 
If it is going to be difficult, it is fine.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, I think generally by way of very 
broad summary.  Witness 1 says, is that he was effectively 
Mr Molefe’s driver when he was at Transnet and that he 
took him on a number of occasions to the Gupta compound 
in Saxon World and to other meetings with the Guptas, and 
he gave certain evidence relating to money.  
20 
 
That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As broadly stated as it can be.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine.  I just wanted that 
when Mr Molefe gives his response to this evidence, 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 192 of 258 
 
people who are listening can understand what it is about.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson.  I do not know who 
witness 1 is.  But I suppose even if I assumed the identity 
of, who the identity of witness 1 is, it is difficult for me to 
include motive without identifying witness 1.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry, what did you say? 
MR MOLEFE:  It is difficult for me to impute motive 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  For giving this kind of evidence without 
10 
knowing who witness 1 is.  But secondly, witness 1 does 
not say that he saw anybody give me money.  He refers to 
meetings that I had with the Guptas, that I have not 
denied.   
 
However, he talks about bags and a bag as if those 
bags had money, but he had no evidence that there was 
money in the bag.  So really there is very little response in 
the evidence of witness 1.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, we’ll let us just accept for a 
moment that he does not give evidence on your contractual 
20 
of having seen someone give you money, but apart from 
that, would you then agree with this statement or what 
ultimately are you saying?   
MR MOLEFE:  That somebody gave me money? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No, your analysis of his evidence, is 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 193 of 258 
 
he says very little.  He does not give direct evidence you 
say of people giving me money. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But what do you say to the content of 
his evidence, that he took you to all of these places.  What 
do you say about his observations?  Are you saying they 
are all wrong or are you saying …[audio cut] that he does 
not give evidence of someone giving me money. 
MR MOLEFE:  His observations that he saw me with a bag, 
may be true but I would deny that it had money in it or that 
10 
the bag I was carrying, when I went to the meeting and 
came back from the meeting came back with money.  I will 
deny that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So let us just go through, if you go to 
paragraph 10 of the affidavit at page 17.  When you say 
you do not know who witness 1 is, well he says that he 
acted as your driver for three years. 
MR MOLEFE:  Did he? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Three or four years.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, so who is he? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you not also say earlier that you 
know who he is? 
MR MOLEFE:  Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you not also say that you know 
who he is? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 194 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  No, I said I could assume who he is.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  And but assuming who he is, it is not fair, 
because I cannot impute motive on a person based on 
assumption of identity.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But what are you saying, a bad 
motive, that you had a driver who had, who may have had a 
bad motive for this evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, there is a driver that I know with a bad 
motive, but I do not think I can reveal what I think was the 
10 
motive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No, absolutely. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because it would identify them number one, 
and number two, what if my assumption about the identity 
is wrong?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But then Mr Molefe, can I ask you 
why did you not exercise your right to cross-examine this 
person? 
MR MOLEFE:  Because he did not implicate me in wrong 
doing.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, so that is really your defence.  
That there is no implication of wrong doing? 
MR MOLEFE:  There is no implication of wrong doing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So are you prepared generally to 
accept the statement that your main opposition or defence 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 195 of 258 
 
is it does not implicate me in wrong doing? 
MR MOLEFE:  It does not implicate me in wrong doing.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  
MR MOLEFE:  It just implicates me in sometimes carrying 
a bag that I always carry that he took a picture of.  No, he 
did not even take a picture of the bag. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Downloaded from the internet.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  And said that is the bag that I may have 
10 
been carrying or a similar bag.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  Alright.  I might ask you to show 
me your bag later, but yes.  
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
as 
I 
walked 
into 
the 
Commission. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  I may have been carrying a bag, if I was and 
if somebody sees me leave the Commission with that bag 
and says that joh, it looks like it has got money inside, I 
have to answer to that allegation. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So let us go through this.  
He says that or she, I am going to perhaps just refer to he, 
and I do not mean to disclose the gender of the person, but 
it will be easier: 
 
“During the abovementioned period Transnet 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 196 of 258 
 
head offices ...” 
 
So this is 11 to 14: 
 
“Was 
still 
in 
the 
Carlton 
Centre 
in 
Johannesburg.” 
 
Is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, and then it says: 
 
“That on a normal working day I would collect 
Molefe from his home in Irene Pretoria at 
around six o’clock in the morning, transport 
10 
him to the office at Carlton Centre and or to 
meetings during the course of the day and 
drop him off at home in the afternoon.  He 
often attended meetings and functions till late 
in the evenings and on many occasions I would 
only arrive home at around midnight.  I also 
had to work quite a lot over weekends.” 
 
Would that be an accurate description of the work 
of your driver? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then he says, the driver says: 
 
“Usually on Friday afternoon Molefe’s personal 
assistant, PA, would provide me with a printout 
of Molefe’s diary for the following week which 
would inform me of his meeting schedule and 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 197 of 258 
 
movements for that week.” 
 
Would you agree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And at 14: 
 
“Due to the long work hours required to 
transport Molefe to various destinations during 
the week, I requested one of my other CPO’s, 
my colleague during late 2012 to assist me 
with the protection and transporting of Molefe.  
We used to alternate our working schedules so 
10 
that one of us would transport Molefe whilst 
the other one would perform administrative 
tasks.  My colleague continued in this regard 
until approximately December 2014.” 
 
You agree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  15: 
 
“During the end ...” 
 
Sorry: 
 
“Towards the end of July 2014 I was re-
20 
deployed as security manager at Transnet 
Group 
Capital 
Division 
in 
Durban. 
 
I 
transferred back to the Transnet head office 
during January 2016.” 
 
What do you say to that? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 198 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  If it is the guy that was re-deployed to 
Durban there is a lot to say about that but it would reveal 
his identity. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Then 16: 
 
“During the period of providing CPO services 
to Molefe, the following Transnet vehicles were 
used to transport him.” 
 
I am not going to read all of them out.  There is a 
BMW, another BMW, Mercedes Benz and an Audio A8. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  17, the driver says: 
 
“I kept log books of trips undertaken with the 
abovementioned vehicles.” 
 
Would you accept that log books were kept? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, I never looked at them.  I knew that they 
were handed to the head of security, and ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  18, sorry anything else to say? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, 18: 
 
“Used log books from the drivers of Transnet 
20 
executives were handed to General Toka at the 
time 
the 
general 
manager 
of 
security 
at 
Transnet for safekeeping.  I kept my log books 
for audit purposes.” 
 
Any comment on that? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 199 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Well, I am not sure whether this was in line 
with their standard operating processes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  
MR MOLEFE:  But yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then we have the heading meetings 
with AJ Gupta: 
 
“During the period ...” 
 
And this is now February 2011 to July 2014: 
 
“During the period of performing CPO duties 
for 
Molefe, 
I 
transported 
him 
on 
various 
10 
occasions to the Gupta residence in Saxon 
World, 
Johannesburg, 
the 
Michael 
Angelo 
Hotel in Sandton, the Protea Hotel Fire and Ice 
in Melrose Arch and the offices of Sahara 
Computers 
in 
Midrand 
where 
he 
attended 
meetings with AJ Gupta, AJ.” 
 
Do you agree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Generally yes, it is true that there 
were occasions when we went.  I do not have a recollection 
of every single incident. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sure: 
 
“These meetings were not recorded in his 
diary.” 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot recall that they were or were not 
recorded in my diary. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 200 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “I was either informed by Molefe that 
he was going to meet with AJ or I actually saw 
AJ at these venues or both.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 20: 
 
“Copies 
of 
available 
log 
book 
entries 
confirming trips undertaken to the locations 
mentioned 
above 
are 
attached 
hereto 
as 
Annexures W101 to W115, the log book entries 
are summarized in these tables.” 
10 
 
I do not know if you have had a chance to look at 
this table? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what the table reflects, is that in 
the 14 month period between July 2011 and September 
2012, the driver took you to Saxon World on 11 occasions, 
twice to the Michael Angelo, once to the Fire and Ice and 
once to Sahara.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, I cannot comment on it because I do 
not have a clear recollection of every single incident, but 
20 
as I said ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But it seems, would you dispute what 
is said here? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Now you will see that at 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 201 of 258 
 
page 21 after the schedule references in the log book to 
Saxon 
World, 
Saxon, 
Saxon 
World 
etcetera 
are 
all 
...[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:  Paragraph 21? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just above 21.  There is a key there 
where he explains that any reference ready to Saxon or 
Saxon World is a reference to the Gupta residence.  
Reference to the Michael Angelo is the Sandton Michael 
Angelo.  Reference to Melrose Arch, presumably it should 
be hotel, refers to the Protea Fire and Ice, and Midrand 
10 
Sahara refers to the offices of Sahara Computer.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “After September 2012 I no longer 
transported Molefe to Gupta Saxon World 
residence.” 
 
Any comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  September 2012? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He says: 
 
“After September 2012 I no longer transported 
Molefe to Gupta Saxon World residence.  My 
20 
colleague informed me that he has also taken 
Molefe to the Gupta residence on a few 
occasions.” 
 
Any comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Sir, after September 2012 is when he went 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 202 of 258 
 
to Durban? 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Well, 
he 
said 
he 
no 
longer 
transported you. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, but was it because he had gone to 
Durban? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Not as I understand the evidence.  
He says it was towards the end of July 2014 that he was 
re-deployed to Durban. 
MR MOLEFE:  I see, yes.  Ja, okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you agree with that?   
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, I cannot comment on that.  I cannot 
really recall when he ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then at paragraph 23: 
 
“In relation to trips to the Gupta residence 
Molefe would tell me that he would have to go 
and see AJ.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “On arrival at the Gupta residence I 
would wait for Molefe in our vehicle to return, 
as can be seen from the table above the visits 
20 
to the residence usually lasted between 20 and 
45 minutes.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, that is a reasonable assessment of 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 203 of 258 
 
what was happening.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Those are relatively short meetings.  
MR MOLEFE:  No, I mean ja, 20 to 45 not short.  Ten 
minutes would be short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20 maybe would be short. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ten minutes would be short.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And 20 you would say not short? 
MR MOLEFE:  45 is about reasonable time to have a 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I do not have a problem 
10 
myself about 45 minutes being you know, not an unusual 
time for a meeting.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am talking about 20 because I think 
somewhere he says in his, the log book or whatever he has 
put in there, reflects like you would come in there, you 
would go there and spend about 20 minutes and go.  I think 
quite a few times if I am not mistaken. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And it gives me the impression and this 
20 
is maybe I must just say, gives me the impression that that 
might not have you know, serious meetings if it is so short, 
but ja I may be mistaken.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is so short. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 204 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  But generally you do not have 
any quarrel with the kinds of times he gives in terms of the 
duration whenever you went there, more or less you have 
no problem with ...[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  With those times. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, he just does not mention perhaps when 
10 
there were events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When there were? 
MR MOLEFE:  Events.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Events, ja okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, like a function. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  When you would be there 
longer.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, he does not mention those.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps if I, sorry Mr Chair are you 
20 
finished? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no maybe you are going to say what 
I was about to say.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No, no please you are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no I was saying maybe during the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 205 of 258 
 
time that he took you there, there were no events.  That is 
why I have made, that is why ...[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot recall Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just in that regard, could I take you 
back to page 20 please?  Have a look at this ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Paragraph 20? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No, page 20.  The table.  You see the 
first entry at the top, 29 July at 20H11 Saxon World.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He arrives or you arrive at ten, and 
leave ... sorry six o’clock in the morning and leave at 
seventeen minutes past six ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In the morning.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then the fifth entry in the middle 
of the page, 19 t h of October you arrived at ten to six in the 
evening and you left at six o’clock.  So that is a ten minute 
meeting, the first one is 17 minutes.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if you go over the page, to 
page 21, the second entry on the 28 t h of May 2012 you 
arrive at twenty to seven in the evening and you leave at 
ten to seven.  Ten minutes.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 206 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What would you have been doing? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is what he says. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, that is what the log books say. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is, ja but I cannot comment on the 
accuracy of the log book.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But they, what ... can you think of 
what you might be doing for only ten ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  I do not remember what it was about.  I do 
not and I cannot comment that these entries are correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I think what you do say based on 
what you have said before, is you might not be saying they 
are accurate, but your sense is that they cannot be too way 
out.  They, it is more or less. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is more or less what you think. 
MR MOLEFE:  They may not even have happened in the 
way that he describes them in the log book, but I have no 
way of showing that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Because well, that is what he wrote in his 
log book. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
there 
are 
times 
where 
...[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:  So when he made these entries in his log 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 207 of 258 
 
book.  
CHAIRPERSON:  There are times where according to his 
log book you were there for a few hours.  I see at page 20, 
second item ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  9 July 2011, according to the log book, 
his log book you were there from five to ten past nine. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think there are times where it reflects 
you were there for quite some time.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there are times when it shows 
that you were there for a shorter period.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, but what I, you see I do not dispute 
that he did take me there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  And that maybe he kept a log book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  And I was not aware of.  But I am not sure 
about the accuracy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  Of what is in his log book, and really what 
his motive was for keeping the log book.  I do not know if 
he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I guess the log book has got to say 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 208 of 258 
 
when you arrived where you arrived and when you left.  I 
assume that that is part of what they are supposed to do.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, but and then the log book is handed 
over to his general manager for safekeeping.  But he says 
he kept the log book.  So I am not sure what the motive 
was there because as he says here, it was for audit 
purposes.   
 
Well, if anybody wanted to audit his log book, it 
would be found with the general manager of security.  So I 
am not sure what his motive really was.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Myburgh?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  And in fact he may have been in breach of 
their own standard operating procedures because the log 
book was supposed to be handed over to head of security.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then at paragraph 24, at page 22: 
 
“When he visited the Gupta residence in Saxon 
World and the offices of Sahara Computers, 
the security guard would ask who are we 
visiting and Molefe would inform that we are 
20 
visiting AJ.  I would then relay the name of AJ 
to the security guard who would then permit 
access.” 
 
Would you agree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes I would normally visit AJ. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 209 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  25: 
 
“In relation to the visits to the hotels, I would 
park 
the 
vehicle 
and 
accompany 
Molefe, 
alternatively meet Molefe at a restaurant when 
I would at some stage during the meeting see 
AJ.” 
 
You agree with that? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, 
I 
cannot 
comment 
on 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sure.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:  On who he saw or who he identified as AJ. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  26: 
 
“Molefe usually went into the Gupta residence 
with a light brown leather back pack that he 
would carry with him.  The picture of the brown 
leather back pack similar to the one carried by 
Molefe is attached, Annexure W1-16.” 
 
Can you go to that?  That you find at pages 55. 
MR MOLEFE:  Did he say similar? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Did he say similar? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think so.  
MR MOLEFE:  He is not 100% similar.  That is just a back 
pack. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 210 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, that you find sorry at page 66.  
Did you have a similar brown leather back pack to that 
one? 
MR MOLEFE:  Not like this one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you have the one that you have 
got on the chair next to you? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, it was this one.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It was that one? 
MR MOLEFE:  My trusted bag, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There we go. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, so that is a brown leather 
back pack.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, this is a ja, it is a brown leather back 
pack.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And was that, is that in fact it looks 
quite worn.  Was it the same back pack that you had at the 
time? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson I have been everywhere 
with this bag.  I am surprised that ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It is like my briefcase.  It is also 
falling apart.  
MR MOLEFE:  I am surprised that it is accused 2 at the 
Commission.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You see, the problem might be that where 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 211 of 258 
 
ever you went, you went with it.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, so ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  And I still do.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but earlier on you ... I thought you 
said something like looking at, I do not know which page 
you were looking at, looking at I think one of the bags, 
pictures of the bags.  That is what you said.  It is not 
similar, but the impression was, the impression that I got 
was that you were saying there is some resemblance, it 
10 
might be ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No, this is a back pack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MOLEFE:  It is not quite similar to this one.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, that is a brown leather back 
pack I suppose. 
MR MOLEFE:  Well, that is why I was saying this is a back 
pack.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So this is just an [indistinct] back pack.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Molefe, I suppose if it was not 
so serious it might be funny, but do I understand you to be 
saying that that back pack that you have just shown the 
Chairperson, your trustee brown leather back pact was in 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 212 of 258 
 
fact the same one that you had ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, in all likelihood it was this one.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The same one? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, should we not have a picture of this 
one, so we can compare with the pictures here.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  No, I am saying it was likely to have been 
this one.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So then at 27: 
 
“On other occasions ...” 
 
Sorry, 26: 
 
“Molefe usually went into the Gupta residence 
with his light brown leather back pack that he 
would carry with him.” 
 
We have dealt with that.  27: 
 
“On other occasions Molefe would go into the 
20 
Gupta residence without his leather back pack.  
On those occasions he would then re-appear 
carrying a sports bag which appear to contain 
something.  I say this because the shape of 
the bag ...” 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 213 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I am sorry Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have missed something.  26 this 
witness refers to a light brown leather back pack.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That description is the same as the bag 
you say you, is probably the one that you were carrying? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  When he said ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  No, the description ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Light brown leather back pack. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It fits that description. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja, but his evidence is that the bag that he 
saw is the one that he took the picture of here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  So let us go with the description that is in 
this picture then because that is his evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, I 
interrupted you. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  So he says at 27: 
 
“On other occasions Molefe would go into the 
Gupta residence without his leather back pack.  
On those occasions he would then re-appear 
carrying a sports bag which appear to contain 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 214 of 258 
 
something.  I say this because the shape of 
the bag suggested it had contents.” 
 
You want to respond to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  The shape of the bag suggested? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It had contents.  
MR MOLEFE:  I have no recollection of that Chair.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this paragraph you do not recall? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then he says at 28: 
 
“On 18 January 2012, Molefe instructed me to 
10 
deliver an empty leather carrier bag to AJ at 
the offices of Sahara Computers in Midrand.  I 
did so and handed the bag to AJ.  The bag was 
opened when it was handed to me.  A picture 
of the brown leather carrier bag similar to the 
one discussed here is attached as Annexure 
W117.” 
 
We go to that.  That you find at page 69. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What do you say to that? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  I have no recollection of that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we go back to 28, the driver says: 
 
“A copy of the ...” ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 215 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will you arrange for somebody in your 
team to write for example in regard to the bag, picture of 
the bag at page 69 Annexure W117, so that if I read this 
paragraph, it is easy for me to know this is the one 
because it is not written ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, perhaps I referred you to the 
wrong page.  That has been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The W1-17.  That is a cover page to 
each of these things.  That you will find at page 68. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I do apologise.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Oh, you see it is confusing 
because you expect the picture to be ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To be on page 68 when you look at this.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe what should be done is to 
move, to move this to 69 or to find a way to make sure that 
if I look at, if I am looking for this picture and I come to 68 
20 
and I see there is no picture, I do not think that there is 
nothing, and then I go back. 
 
Or maybe there should be a reference to say I must 
look ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Over the page.  
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 216 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over the page, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, we will work on that Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know, two months after now if I am 
working on this I might be confused.  
MR MOLEFE:  Just out of curiosity, does his diary confirm 
these trips? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:  Does his diary confirms these trips? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon?  Well, I wanted to 
take you to the last portion of paragraph 28: 
10 
 
“A copy of the log book entry confirming the 
trip ...” ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Oh, I see.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  “Undertaken to the offices of Sahara 
Computers is attached as W1-18.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Okay.  I have no recollection of that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No recollection.  Then at 29: 
 
“I recall that I also met AJ in the presence of 
Molefe in January 2012, after the African 
National Congress conference in Bloemfontein, 
20 
when I collected Molefe from the airport in 
Bloemfontein.” 
 
You have any issue with that? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
That 
he 
saw 
AJ 
at 
the 
airport 
in 
Bloemfontein? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 217 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  He met AJ, also met AJ in the 
presence of Molefe.  
MR MOLEFE:  No, I have no recollection of what happened 
at the airport in Bloemfontein in January 2014. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If I might just have a second?  You 
have no recollection of that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then at 30: 
 
“I attach a photograph of AJ as Annexure W1-
19 as confirmation that he is the person that I 
10 
have been introduced to as AJ.” 
 
I presume you do not have any issue with that?   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright and then people recognized at 
Gupta residence: 
 
“During 
visits 
to 
the 
Gupta 
residence 
on 
several occasions I have amongst others seen 
the 
following 
people 
outside 
the 
Gupta 
residence, namely Minister Malusi Gigaba, 
former Minister of the Department of Public 
20 
Enterprises, 
and 
Mr 
Siyabonga 
Mahlangu 
special advisor to Minister Gigaba.” 
 
What do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot remember being at the same time 
at the Gupta residence with Minister Gigaba or with Mr 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 218 of 258 
 
Siyabonga Mahlangu.  I, no that I cannot remember. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  One thing I perhaps neglected to ask 
you, earlier on in your testimony when discussing your 
relationship with the Guptas and your visits to the Gupta 
residence, who would you see there? 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr AJ. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, but who else? 
MR MOLEFE:  He is the person that I was discussing the 
bank with. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  He is the person that I was discussing the 
bank with. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, so I would hardly ever see anybody 
else.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  On those occasions when you did see 
someone else, who were they? 
MR MOLEFE:  Sometimes his brother would pop in, phone 
him or his wife or his children.  Ja, they would pop in but 
the person I really saw and discussed with, was Mr AJ. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So do I take it to be then your 
evidence that you never saw any politician during your 
visits there, that you never saw any ...[intervenes]  
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
Perhaps 
when 
there 
were 
functions.  
Perhaps when there were functions, but ja I do not 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 219 of 258 
 
remember being there when there was no function and 
seeing …[audio cut] Shareholder Minister. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright and then there is a heading 
saying Molefe in possession of cash. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Paragraph 32. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“One day whilst attending a meeting in the 
main board room at the Carlton Centre 
10 
Molefe asked me to fetch his cellular phone 
from his bag in his office.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“As instructed I went to his office and when I 
opened his light brown leather backpack to 
take out the phone I was surprised to see 
that the bag was more than half full with 
bundles of R200 notes.  I called Mbele to 
Molefe’s office and I showed her the cash in 
20 
his bag.” 
Now what do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I have no recollection of that incident and I 
just wonder if he did report – he did write it in his incident 
report and if he reported it General Thoga but I have no 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 220 of 258 
 
recollection of that incident. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let us go through this presumably 
you did have meetings on occasion in the main board room 
at the Carlton Centre? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you had left your cell phone in your 
bag would it – might you try and retrieve it by asking 
somebody in the position of your driver to do so? 
MR MOLEFE:  I might have yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is it possible that that happened? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  It is possible that I might have asked him to 
retrieve a cell phone during the times that I was working with 
him from my bag. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  From your light brown leather 
backpack? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So the only issue is you say well if I 
had asked him to do that he would not have come across 
these bundles of R200 notes. 
MR MOLEFE:  No not in the manner that he described them 
20 
as being this much and stacked and so on and so forth. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But he says: 
“I was surprised to see the bag was more 
than half full with bundles of R200 notes.” 
MR MOLEFE:  No not half full. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 221 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But would you… 
MR MOLEFE:  I have no recollection of this incident where 
he says he found half full bag – half full – my bag half full 
with money I have no recollection of that specific incident.  
And on top of that it is – I never carried cash like that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now he says: 
“I called Mbele to Molefe’s office and showed 
her the cash in the bag.” 
Who is that? 
MR MOLEFE:  That was my PA. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So just that I have your evidence 
correctly.  Your evidence is you never kept money or any real 
quantity of money. 
MR MOLEFE:  Come again. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You never kept money or any real 
quantity of money in your light – in the bag you have shown 
us? 
MR MOLEFE:  Not half full just maybe if there was cash.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter. 
MR MOLEFE:  Sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter full? 
MR MOLEFE:  No maybe a R1000.00 maybe R2000,00 I do 
not know how – how that would fill the bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then in paragraph 33. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 222 of 258 
 
“Upon 
his 
return 
from 
the 
meeting 
I 
approached Molefe about the fact that he 
was carrying that much cash in his bag which 
I considered a safety risk.  Molefe was 
visibly upset with my comment and told me 
that it was none of my business.” 
You say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I have no recollection of that and wonder if 
because he says it is a safety or a security risk whether this 
threat – security because that is where he worked – it 
10 
identified a threat according to him was properly recorded 
and discussed with his superiors. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Molefe how does one deal with 
this?  I mean here is a driver and you say really that 90% of 
the statement you do not dispute it is only when the word 
cash really enters the equation that you say you do not have 
a recollection.  You say you could have been in a meeting in 
the main board room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Mr Myburgh I am sure you 
do not intend it there are a number of areas where he said 
20 
he has no recollection. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what you – what you are saying is true 
to the extent that you mean he does not dispute. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I am .. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 223 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Most of these ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that also includes when he says he has 
no recollection.  So – so I thought I would just mention that. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja there is no recollection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. But basically because you do not have 
a recollection you cannot dispute but you – there is nothing 
that you really seriously dispute for most of the part of what 
he says. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I dispute that… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  This particular part. 
MR MOLEFE:  Of the cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the cash ja.  No I .. 
MR MOLEFE:  Where he says he saw cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Where he says if he wants or if you – if his 
desire was to imply that I left the Gupta residence with cash 
that I dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine but other than that… 
MR MOLEFE:  But then I notice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  That he never went that far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but other than that in terms of what Mr 
Myburgh has taken you through you do not have any serious 
issues. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 224 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  No I mean this narrative is built on real facts 
that were happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Then Mr Myburgh I interrupted you 
while you wanted… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To put a proposition to Mr Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes perhaps I can re-style it.  In 
relation to this particular incident that he recounts here 
10 
would you accept that if he had come across a lot of money 
in your bag it would not have been – it would have been a 
natural thing perhaps for him to have raised it with your PA. 
MR MOLEFE:  No.   Let me put it like this because he calls it 
a security threat.  If he had come across a security threat he 
would not have raised it with my PA he would have raised – 
he would have and should have raised it with his superiors 
and in this instance it was General Thoga and there would 
have been a proper incident report. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes but you see what he says is that 
20 
you were upset and you told him that it was none of your 
business.  He raised it with you directly. 
MR MOLEFE:  But it did not matter that I was upset about it 
because his job was security and if he identified a security 
threat there would have been a particular protocol to deal 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 225 of 258 
 
with it.  And so – and so I cannot recall the incident I am just 
saying if indeed it did happen this is what would have 
happened.  He would not or should – or – ja he would not 
have raised it with the PA because he knew that that would 
start a rumour and exacerbate the threat which means that if 
he raises it with the PA the PA might then say to somebody 
else or the next one you will not believe what Mr so and so 
told me today and then it will be a rumour that goes around.  
And so a person of his training and his responsibilities the 
responsible manner to have handled it would have been 
10 
especially that he specifically says that it was a security 
threat or a security risk would have been to raise it with his 
superiors who would then have called me in and said we 
have a problem how do we deal with it.  That never 
happened.  That never – that never happened.  However 
having said that I – I  - ja I dispute that this cash incident 
happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just that I understand it so this your 
backpack that you have shown us with your – if you had left 
your cell phone in your backpack would that backpack then 
20 
be in your office?  Is that – he say I went to his office 
because as you said if you had left your phone and you were 
in a meeting you might ask your driver to go and fetch it from 
your office. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 226 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is that right?   
MR MOLEFE:  If I had left it in my office and I said go and 
fetch my phone – I mean this is hypothetically. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what your – I take it your 
secretary or your PA worked close to your office? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes right next door. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then at paragraph 34  
“I 
furthermore 
frequently 
deposited 
cash 
amounts 
on 
behalf 
of 
Molefe 
at ABSA, 
Standard Bank and Nedbank in and around 
10 
the Carlton Centre in various bank accounts.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“Usually between the 28t h of the month and 
the 5t h of the following month and sometimes 
also around the middle of the month.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What do you say about that? 
MR MOLEFE:  It may or may not have happened on some 
occasions that maybe I asked him to make a deposit for me.  
20 
I cannot recall what it was for – with different things.  Maybe 
society or I do not know, I cannot recall but ja that may or 
may not have happened.  I am not sure about the frequency 
that he is talking about but ja it is true that on one or two 
occasions I may have sent him to go to the bank. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 227 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You drew cash to deposit cash. 
MR MOLEFE:  No not necessarily. Sometimes when we go to 
a burial society and people donate cash and then I have to 
take it and bank it.  Things like that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But would it not… 
MR MOLEFE:  Or sometimes if I am doing it for somebody or 
– for whatever reasons I had personal reasons. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But why not just make an electronic 
transfer? 
MR MOLEFE:  No but if it was cash that needed to go to the 
10 
bank you cannot deposit electronically. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what sort of things would this relate 
to then? 
MR MOLEFE:  Like the society – you know society? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  What type of society? 
MR MOLEFE:  Various societies – various societies. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right what other – what other things? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot recall Chair what other reasons I 
may have had to have had cash with me but… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But there could have been… 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  But – ja there could have been for a number 
of reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that burial society of which you were 
treasurer or something? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 228 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes at the time yes I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  What was it called? 
MR MOLEFE:  Mapala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ma? 
MR MOLEFE:  Mapala 
CHAIRPERSON:  M-a-p-h-a-l-a. 
MR MOLEFE:  L-m-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  L-l-a. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  p-h-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  l-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Burial society at the end. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja it is actually officially it is called 
Investment Society so it is – it is Llaphala - Llaphala  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Was my grandmother’s mother so it is all the 
children that had descended from that root. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  We have a burial society and I was the 
treasurer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you had the treasurer. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 229 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Okay.  It is still there, it still exists 
the burial society. 
MR MOLEFE:  It still exists but we have not met since Covid 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  There is a big debate now about what we are 
going to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then the driver goes to say: 
“The deposit slips and account details had 
10 
been completed by Molefe.” 
Is that what you would do if you required of him to deposit 
cash? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC: 
“The cash amounts would be handed to me 
by Molefe’s PA in envelopes which Molefe 
had handed to her with the instruction that I 
should do the deposit.” 
Would you agree with that? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“I handed the deposit slip to either Molefe’s 
PA or Molefe himself after doing the deposits 
at the bank.” 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 230 of 258 
 
Would you agree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And he says – or the driver says at 35 
“I would count the money or deposit it varied 
in amounts but usually several thousand rand 
at a time.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes several thousand yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So it seems that the main area 
of disputes then or dispute is 27 the sports bag that you – 
you deny that you would leave the Gupta residence – you 
10 
would reappear carrying a sports bag which appeared to 
contain something.  You deny that you ever instructed the 
driver to deliver an empty leather bag to Ajay and then you 
deny this issue in relation to the cell phone and money being 
found in the bag.  Those are the main areas of dispute. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But otherwise by and large I think as 
the Chairperson has asked you – you do not seem to take 
particular issue with the statement, is that – would that be a 
fair summary? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Other than to say that the threats that he 
talks about I have no knowledge of and I notice that you say 
that we do not have a problem with the rest of the statement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It was – yes I am talking about the 
parts that I have taken you to. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 231 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Is this is – As I understand it it 
was reported in the press that there was an attempt on – on 
Witness 1’s life a few days ago. 
MR MOLEFE:  Well – a few days ago.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So have you got any idea I mean the 
person who made this statement is obviously in a difficult 
position in his life the driver.  There is threats being made on 
his life.  It is a sets out the threats that gave rise to his 
driver’s evidence being given in camera.  It – can I ask you 
10 
to address the question of why – why would somebody put 
themselves into this position if their version was simply a 
pack of lies? 
MR MOLEFE:  Which – which position? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The position of fearing for your life. 
MR MOLEFE:  Who is threatening his life? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well the point is that this person and I 
am not suggesting Mr Molefe it is you but what the – what 
this driver has done… 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I really do not understand that you 
20 
are saying that because he made the statement his life is 
now threatened?  By whom? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well you have seen what he says 
about the threats that were made that caused the DCJ to 
allow his evidence to be given in camera.  You have also 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 232 of 258 
 
heard about reports that there was an attempt on his life a 
few days ago.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chair I would really prefer not to be 
drawn into these threats and the reasons for the threats and 
– because I really do not know anything about it and I also 
do not wish to speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Myburgh wanted to put a 
different proposition to you in regard to probabilities or… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I just – I mean why would 
somebody 
falsely 
implicate 
someone 
like 
you 
in 
10 
circumstances where they fear for their life? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja I – I said Chair I could try and impute 
motive but that would identify the witness. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But there is motive that I could impute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I guess – I guess that if this 
statement was full of lots of things that you say are false 
maybe really serious bad things it might – one might look at 
it in a certain way but having gone through the statement 
20 
with Mr Myburgh having taken you through the statement up 
to just before he talks about the threats most of the things 
that he says about you there you do not identify them as 
things that somebody would be saying about you that are 
deliberately false.  There are just two or three areas… 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 233 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you say well here this is not true. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja so Chair the way that the statement is 
crafted is that it is generally true except that there is this 
spice of cash that gets put in and – and that is cleverly 
calculated to imply – it is not even real evidence – to imply 
just to cast aspersions that is what I do not understand.  
This statement is based on things that are true but it is 
designed to cast aspersions without even offering real 
evidence of things that – the – the person saw.  I remember 
10 
when he was giving evidence Chair that you asked 
“So 
when 
you 
found 
the 
money 
in 
Mr 
Molefe’s bag did that money come from the 
Gupta’s?” 
And he said: 
“No.” 
And so what – when an – when a security guard says my 
principle gave me an empty bag to go and deliver what is the 
purpose of making such a – such a statement relating to an 
empty bag to an august (?) commission such as this one? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  I want to take you then 
to Witness 3. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That affidavit you find at page 122. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 234 of 258 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Witness 3 says when dealing with 
these CPO Services to Minister Gigaba. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You would have seen that he says at 
paragraph 22 at page 126. 
“That whilst waiting in my vehicle for Gigaba 
to return from meetings inside the Gupta 
residence I noticed on different occasions 
people arriving or leaving the premises that I 
10 
recognised. 
Individuals 
in 
this 
regard 
included and there you see firstly Mr your 
name Brian Molefe.” 
What do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot comment on that Chair I have no 
recollection.  Actually Witness 3 I even find it difficult to 
speculate about who he is.  So I do not know what he is 
talking about. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But it seems to me that I mean you 
would accept that given the frequency with which you went to 
20 
the Gupta residence that it was possible that you would have 
been seen there. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja but… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  By other people. 
MR MOLEFE:  Witness 3 was attached to Mr Gama was he 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 235 of 258 
 
not? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Gigaba. 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Gigaba ja I have said I do not recall being 
at the same time with Mr Gigaba at the Gupta residence.  
Unless if there was maybe a function but I cannot recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So let us then turn to paragraph 46 at 
page 130.  Witness 3 says that this is under the heading 
Bags received from men of Asian descent at Three Rivers 
Lodge. Witness 3 says and this is at a time when he is 
providing services – CPO services to Mr Anoj Singh your 
10 
CFO.  He says at 46. 
“During 
July 
2014 
Transnet 
executive 
management attended a week long strategy 
session 
at 
the 
Three 
Rivers 
Lodge 
in 
Vereeniging.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would you accept that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“I dropped Singh off at the venue early in the 
20 
week and picked him up on the Friday 
afternoon again.” 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“While I waited for Singh on the Friday 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 236 of 258 
 
afternoon to finish at the session I noticed 
four men who appeared to be from Asian 
descent (they looked like Chinese men to 
me) standing around a Hyundai H1 vehicle in 
the parking area.  Two of the men appeared 
to be busy with a conversation on a cell – 
cellular phone.” 
Any comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I deny that I ever met any Chinese people or 
Asian men at the Three Rivers Lodge during Transnet 
10 
strategy planning sessions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  49. 
“The next thing I noticed how the two men 
(who spoke on the cell phone) took two 
luggage bags from the vehicle, one black and 
the other maroon and went inside the Lodge 
area 
where 
the 
executive 
management 
meeting was held.” 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot comment on – I cannot comment on 
that because that is what he saw I – I did not meet the 
20 
Chinese people at the or Asian men in – at Three Rivers 
Lodge. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  
“At around 15h00 I received a sms from 
Singh 
requesting 
me 
to 
come 
to

conference room where the meeting was 
held.  As I entered the room the two men who 
took the luggage bags into the Lodge were in 
the room together with Molefe and Singh.” 
MR MOLEFE:  I deny that that happened. 
ADV 
MYBURGH SC:  But you were present at this 
conference with Mr Singh? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes there was – although I do not recall the 
exact dates but I do recall that we once or twice had a 
strategy planning sessions at the Three Rivers Lodge. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And when you had these weeklong 
sessions I presume do they finish on a Friday? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At what time would you finish up 
typically with the conference? 
MR MOLEFE:  Well it depends.  It depends on our agenda 
for the day. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You presumably give people time to be 
able to travel back. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In daylight hours. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And this is in the winter time you 
know? 
MR MOLEFE:  This was in the winter time? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 238 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes well it was July. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  2014. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh ja because it was July Chairperson it is 
likely that it was winter time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.   
“Singh pointed to the maroon bag.” 
At paragraph 50. 
“And requested me to take the bag to our 
vehicle that being his – Singh’s vehicle.” 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Aye I do not know anything about that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“I took the bag and I put it in the boot of the 
vehicle.” 
Then at paragraph 50.1 over the page; page 131. 
“I need to mention that the bag was really 
heavy I however did not know what it 
contained at the time.” 
Sub 2. 
“I 
recognised 
that 
the 
bag 
– 
sorry 
I 
20 
recognised the bag as one of the luggage 
bags that the Chinese men had earlier taken 
into the meeting room.” 
Have you any comment on that? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot comment on that – that is… 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 239 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then 51. 
“While I was seated in our vehicle waiting for 
Singh after putting the maroon luggage bag 
in the boot of the vehicle I saw Molefe’s 
driver I cannot clearly recall if it was Witness 
1 or a colleague pulling a black luggage bag 
from the same Lodge venue to the vehicle 
that was used to transport Molefe.” 
What do you have to say? 
 MR MOLEFE:  I deny that I met the Chinese people or Asian 
10 
people at the Three Rivers Lodge.  However the – the taking 
a bag from the Lodge to my car they have maybe something 
that one of my protectors did and that would have been a 
bag that I had come with with my clothes.  So I mean I will 
deny that that bag – if there was such a bag that was carried 
from the Lodge to my car came from the Chinese people.  It 
may have been a bag that I had come with with my clothes 
inside. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes because Witness 3 goes on to say: 
“I recognised this bag as the other bag which 
20 
the Chinese men had earlier taken into the 
meeting.” 
MR MOLEFE:  No then I deny that there was any bag from 
the Chinese people that was given to my protectors. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So just so that we – we understand the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 240 of 258 
 
facts there are two bags on this version that are taken into 
the conference centre.  One maroon bag, one black bag.  On 
this version a maroon bag goes back into Mr Singh’s car and 
the black bag goes into your car.  You see – you follow that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Myburgh I have just said to you that that 
incident as far as I am concerned never happened.  I do not 
know where this guy got it from. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let us see. 
MR MOLEFE:  I am not even in a position to speculate about 
this bag and that bag and this guy carried that. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  I mean the next thing you will be saying ah so 
you admit that it did happen. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am just putting the facts to you on 
this statement Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  I have denied that that incident happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  What I was trying to get at if 
you just be a little bit patient please is I want to track what 
on this statement happened to the maroon bag.  If you have 
a look at paragraph 52. 
20 
“The next Monday Singh drove to the Carlton 
Centre with his BMW M3.” 
You know Mr Singh to drive a BMW M3? 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja I just know he is a BMW guy I do not know 
what type. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 241 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“He left the vehicle in the basement for the 
week and that Friday afternoon I was about 
to take Singh’s vehicle to the car wash.  As 
usual I checked that there was no valuables 
in the boot that could go missing.  As I 
opened the boot I saw the maroon bag that I 
had collected at the Three Rivers Lodge the 
previous Friday.  When I picked the bag up I 
realised that it weighed less than before.  I 
10 
opened the bag to see what was inside and I 
noticed a couple of rolls of R200 notes.  I 
sms’d Singh and informed him that the bag 
was still in the car.  He immediately came 
down to the basement and collected the bag 
from me.” 
So this is his version as to what happened to the maroon 
bag.  I suppose the question is what happened to the black 
bag? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot comment on that.  There was no 
20 
black bag that went to my car Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So I want to just ask you some 
– some more general questions on this.  So the – the 
evidence and I do not want to overstate it but the evidence 
of the money flows, him, research that they have done and I 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 242 of 258 
 
have put these things in fairness to you for the last three 
days points to a large scale money laundering by  
At Transnet.   Of course you right that ultimately that finding 
would have to be made by the Chairperson but that is what 
the evidence points to.   
 
And what the evidence points to is that it is the 
procurement system that was abused by Regiments and Mr 
Essa to facilitate that money laundering.  
 
What the evidence also appears to point to is we 
know that contracts that you were involved in, confinements 
10 
that you were involved in, that Mr Singh was involved in and 
Mr Gama to a lesser extent were contracts that were used as 
a vehicle for money laundering.  I have put all of this to you.   
MR MOLEFE:  All of them? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No I did not – I said some not all 
contracts obviously – contracts. And we have been through 
the evidence. 
 
Now assuming that the Gupta’s were involved in 
money laundering to an abuse of the procurement system 
presumably those people that allowed that I ask you 
20 
presumably there would be some kind of quid pro quo if 
those people were complicit.  Would you agree with me? 
MR MOLEFE:  What did you say? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So I am not suggesting when I put this 
proposition to you that you were complicit in the money 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 243 of 258 
 
laundering but if there were Transnet managers that were – 
that enabled it presumably they needed to be some kind of 
quid pro quo? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot comment – I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because you see … 
MR MOLEFE:  Is that an assumption that you making?  That 
there would have been a quid pro quo? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well I would ask you to – one assumes 
that if you complicit in money laundering and you facilitating 
it as a manager you need to get something in return. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As a general proposition.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know how those things work Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So just leaving Mr Gigaba aside for a 
moment and just focussing on you and Mr Singh.  He was 
your CFO, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And when the two of you to Eskom you 
were replaced – swopped with Mr Gama and Mr Peter? 
20 
Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes, yes.  I think that is what happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja and what these three drivers do to a 
greater or lesser extent is they implicate all of you in … 
MR MOLEFE:  Who? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 244 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  These three drivers.  They implicate all 
of you to a greater or lesser extent in visiting the Gupta’s 
and that did not apply necessarily to Mr Gama but visiting 
the Gupta’s in some instances and… 
MR MOLEFE:  So what do they implicate me in? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well there is the statement. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja the – what do they implicate me in? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well what you – and just bear with me 
for a moment.  They all in relation to you put you at the 
Gupta residence.  A man gives some evidence about the fact 
10 
you say I deny that I came with a pull sports bag back to the 
car.  I deny that I gave Ajay Gupta a leather bag.  I deny that 
there was money in … 
MR MOLEFE:  So what – what do they implicate me in I just 
want to understand that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What they point to is you carrying 
large amounts of money certainly in relation to the cell 
phone issue.  What I am trying to get at Mr… 
MR MOLEFE:  Ah no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  You trying to get to that the Gupta’s gave me 
money? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just bear with me for a moment.  What 
we – what we do know is they certainly say directly that Mr 
Singh received bags of money and they say Mr Singh took 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 245 of 258 
 
the money to Knox Vaults. 
MR MOLEFE:  To? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Knox Vault.  You did not have a safety 
deposit there? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Singh’s replacement Mr Peter 
driver’s also give limited evidence about him going to the 
Gupta residence but they also speak about bags going to the 
Knox Vault.  That was his replacement. 
 
You have read no doubt or listened to the driver’s 
10 
evidence in relation to Mr Gama where that driver gives 
evidence of lots of cash being found in relation to Mr Gama. 
 
You have seen that evidence. 
 
What ties the four of you together is that you had at 
least some connection with the Gupta’s.  You had by far the 
strongest one.  And that there is either direct evidence on 
large 
money 
transactions 
and 
collections 
or 
indirect 
evidence like in your case where the driver says he had a 
half full bag of R200 notes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But he specifically says it did not come from 
20 
the Gupta’s and I deny that there was ever a large sum of 
money in my bag. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Were you ever given money by Mr 
Singh? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I cannot recall that. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 246 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  When you say you cannot recall might 
you have? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I cannot recall that.  I mean maybe for 
lunch or something I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No that is not what I am asking Mr 
Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I was never given – like how much? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well you tell me. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I was never given money by Mr Singh 
unless if you are referring to maybe we were somewhere or I 
10 
needed a R100.00 for lunch or I do not know.  But I was 
never given money by Mr Singh. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Just 
on 
this 
issue 
of 
– 
of 
replacements.  I mean you have seen the drivers statements 
in relation to Mr Peter.  If my memory serves me correctly he 
took him on I think it is 15 occasions to a restaurant in 
Turffontein where he had lunch with Mr Essa. 
MR MOLEFE:  I have not seen that no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let me perhaps take you there.  
We were dealing with – with Witness 3 let me take you to 
20 
that – to that paragraph. 
MR MOLEFE:  So you say Witness 3… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry we normally take a short 
adjournment after two hours we have been here for three – 
just over three hours now maybe we should have a ten 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 247 of 258 
 
minutes adjournment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay 
let 
us 
take 
just 
ten 
minutes 
adjournment.  We will resume at twenty five past five.  We 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue.  Your mic. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Do you still have the 
10 
bundle BB-14(d) open, do you?   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I said I just refer you to the one 
paragraph that you questioned.  Can I ask you to go to 
page 133? 
MR MOLEFE:   Of this one, BB-3? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   14(d), the one we have been in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one we were using before the break. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Page? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 133.  You will see at paragraph 
64 that... that he transported Mr Pita on approximately 15 
occasions to this restaurant in Turffontein for meeting with 
Mr Essa. 
MR MOLEFE:   Page 133? 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 248 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  They would have extended 
lunches and they would drink a lot of alcohol.  There again, 
you see Mr Essa featuring prominently, not so? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   DCJ, we have no further questions 
for Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, he just wanted to show me that 
paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes.  Thank you.  We are going to 
adjourn but you – arrangements will be made and I am 
inclined 
to 
think 
that 
to 
deal 
with 
that 
settlement 
agreement, you may have to come back but I will allow the 
Legal Team to compose – teams from both sides to discuss 
it but it seems to me that might be desirable in which case, 
to the extent that your counsel might wish to re-examine, 
that could be done at that stage.  Is that fine? 
COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did you wish to re-examine today if 
20 
you plan to? 
COUNSEL:   Chair, I have not consulted with Mr Molefe 
about the need for re-examination. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay, okay.  No, that is fine.  Then we can 
hear later on if you think there is a need. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 249 of 258 
 
COUNSEL:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You could make the request then. 
COUNSEL:   [No audible reply] [microphone not switched 
on] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you very much 
Mr Molefe for availing yourself to give evidence.  As I say, 
you probably might come back but your legal team and the 
Commission’s Legal Team will talk about the part that 
remains that you wanted to get a chance to look at and 
then we will take it from there but thank you very much for 
10 
availing yourself. 
MR MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are going to adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow morning we will start at half-past nine and I will 
hear Mr Gama’s evidence tomorrow. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.  I am sorry.  I think, 
Mr Myburgh, is there not something you are forgetting that 
20 
the secretary wanted to say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, ja... 
CHAIRPERSON:   You to deal with.  I am sorry.  It should 
not take long.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I do apologise for having 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 250 of 258 
 
forgotten about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe, there is one thing that I 
want to raise with you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that is.  Yesterday you said that 
– we were speaking, as I recall, about Mr Jiyane. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Or someone who you said could give 
evidence. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it was in that context that you 
said:   
“I will give him your cell phone number, Chair.  
Because the secretary is not very helpful 
because he has issues.  I think it has to do 
with the fact that he once lost a tender and 
lost the court case...” 
 
You remember saying that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you are speaking of the current 
Secretary of the Commission? 
MR MOLEFE:   Reverend Malesela? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, it is Professor Malesela. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 251 of 258 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You understand the seriousness of 
what you said about him? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “He is not very helpful because he  
has issues.  I think it has to do with the fact 
that he once lost a tender and lost the court 
case...”   
 
What ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I do think so Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   If I can explain? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Professor 
Malesela 
was 
part 
of 
a 
consortium of Western House that was bidding for a 
nuclear project at Eskom.  Western House is an American 
nuclear company that was bidding for work at Koeberg and 
they lost that deal before I arrived at Eskom. 
 
When I arrived at Eskom, he approached me 
numerous times to intervene in their favour.  Eventually, 
Western House went to court.  The matter went as far as 
20 
the Constitutional Court.  It was held by yourself, actually 
Chairperson, at the Constitutional Court. 
 
And I think since that time, Professor Malesela 
has got a something to grind with me because the way I 
interpreted the subpoenas and the notices as they came 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 252 of 258 
 
one after another, not responding to our correspondence 
when we asked about what matter we are coming to talk 
about.  We complaint about the fact that the Commission 
was not responsive.   
 
My feeling was because of the Western House 
matter, Professor Malesela is not taking it out during – now 
during the Commission and that his behaviour, certainly, 
towards me, in the context of the Commission, is informed 
by his dissatisfaction that I was not able to intervene on 
his behalf on the Western House matter.  That is how I felt.   
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Molefe, just so that I 
understand 
this. 
 
You 
say 
– 
your 
– 
you 
had 
bad 
experiences with Professor Malesela at the Commission.  
In what respect? 
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps my attorney can explain.  I mean, 
when we received the subpoena ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:   When we received the subpoena in 
December, for example, we – the subpoena did not say 
whether it was a Transnet or Eskom matter.  And we were 
20 
not sure what it was about.   
 
In fact, we were still waiting on submitting the 
documents that were required in terms of Section 10 for 
both Transnet and Eskom. 
 
And then we got the subpoena and then the 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 253 of 258 
 
Commission went dead.  They did not tell us whether it was 
Transnet or Eskom.  We wrote numerous letters asking:  
What are we coming to appear here for?  And those were 
not answered, right through December and January. 
 
We appeared here on the 15 t h of January, after 
having been told – perhaps about a week before that it was 
indeed going to be on Eskom.  And only the documents that 
were given to us, were given to us about a week before we 
came. 
 
On the 15 t h when we arrived here, the first thing 
10 
he said was:  Well, we just got an indication of...  I think 
there was even a meeting with yourself, Chairperson, in 
chambers to discuss the fact that the Commission had not 
indicated what this matter was going to be about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot remember...  Well, counsel will 
normally come and see me in chambers but I cannot 
remember whether it was about that or not. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am not the only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may have been.  I do not know. 
MR MOLEFE:   [laughs] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may have been.  I do not know.  H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but then we – in the end, I remember 
us sitting around the table and Advocate Masuku saying to 
Mr Molefe, attorney Molefe, that:  Perhaps you should write 
a letter directly to the Chairperson.  And that is what we 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 254 of 258 
 
did.  And that is eventually how we got a response.   
 
But our correspondence to the Secretary to 
indicate what matter is was about, right through December 
and January and the manner in which we were treated by 
the Secretary left a lot to be desired Chair.   
 
And the only conclusion that I could arrive at 
was because he was aggrieved that he had lost the 
Western House deal and that I had not intervened as...  at 
that time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you Mr Molefe?  You...  
10 
There was a delay in advising you as to whether the 
summons applied to Transnet or Eskom? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not think it is necessary to spring to 
his defence Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not think it is necessary to spring to 
his defence.  All I am saying ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am not springing to his defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Mr Myburgh is not springing.  
He wants to find out exactly what the ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   No, even the fact that I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR MOLEFE:   And Mr Myburgh wants to go through them 
again. 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 255 of 258 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Let us not speak at the same 
time.  He is seeking clarification as to what it is that made 
you think like this.  Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:   I have just said exactly what made me feel 
like that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, just...  I am trying to 
understand...  So I do understand that you say that there 
was a delay in telling you as to whether the summons 
applied to Transnet or Eskom.  Ja, I follow and you say 
that happened in December/January.  Then ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   It was not just a delay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No reply? 
MR MOLEFE:   No response to our communication. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Right through the month of December. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which caused a lot of anxiety and what are 
we doing, what...?  And at the same time we had to reply 
20 
with a Section 10 Notices and yet the...  And then, 
eventually, they said it is about Eskom and then we were 
requested the documents and ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe, if you just bear with me, 
though.  I understand that.  Then you talk about other 
10 MARCH 2021 – DAY 358 
 
Page 256 of 258 
 
treatment.  Is it confined to the failure to respond to that 
correspondence?  That is really all I want to know. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, it is just the general demeanour from 
the Secretary’s office. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What do you mean the general 
demeanour? 
MR MOLEFE:   Exactly that.  The attitude relating to our 
matters at the... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you need to articulate that.  I do 
not understand.  I mean, you do not deal directly yourself. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   But the need for articulation is to what end? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The need for...? 
MR MOLEFE:   To articulate it.  To what end?  Because I 
am not instituting any legal proceedings or anything. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you make a very serious 
allegation in public ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
...that 
bears 
the
