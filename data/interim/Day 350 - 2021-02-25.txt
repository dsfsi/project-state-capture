PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 25 FEBRUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Myburgh.  Good 
morning everybody.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Chair, 
as 
you 
know. 
 
The 
proceedings today and tomorrow were originally scheduled 
for the hearing of Bombardier ’s Rule 3.4 application which 
you 
granted, 
allowing 
them 
to 
cross-examine 
three 
witnesses and to lead two witnesses of their own. 
10 
 
You will know that Bombardier relates to the 
Transnet stream.  They were awarded part of the 1 064 
Contract. 
 
You 
had 
been 
provided 
Chair 
with 
correspondence that Bombardier wishes to withdraw its 
application and also to an effect take back the affidavit 
that was filed at the Commission. 
 
Bombardier 
is 
today 
represented 
today 
by 
counsel.  Perhaps I could allow him to place himself on 
record and then address you in relation to those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is in order.  If it is going to 
20 
be convenient to speak from there, that is fine but 
otherwise, they can sanitise the podium and you go there.  
You can choose which one suits you, Mr Van Zyl.  But 
then... 
ADV VAN ZYL:   [No audible reply]  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 4 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The mic would need to put on.  
Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   Yes, thank you.  I hope to be quick.  I am 
Fred van Zyl.  I have been instructed on behalf of 
Bombardier 
Transportation. 
 
And 
I 
confirm 
what 
Mr Myburgh has said that the intention this morning of my 
client is to withdraw the previous application and the right 
to cross-examine and lead evidence.   
 
And secondly, to request that we – I am not sure 
what the right terminology would be but to uplift the 
10 
intended affidavits.  And the reasons for that has been set 
out in a letter that has been sent to the Commission which 
I would request permission to hand up formally onto the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  The registrar will take that.  May I 
ask you to speak up a little bit.  I think your voice is soft.  
Maybe it is because I think you are not short and the mic is 
far from your mouth.  [laughs] 
ADV VAN ZYL:   Chair, if I may briefly just place on record 
then 
what 
the 
circumstances 
were? 
 
Bombardier 
20 
Transportation had effectively been taken over by Alstom 
SA as the new mother company and Alstom has the strong 
principle that it appears to that it will not respond to 
evidence to any commission or any authority across the 
world but it has not verified in accordance with its very 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 5 of 163 
 
strict standards of compliance.   
 
It is in those circumstances that we sincerely 
apologise for the inconvenience caused and the time taken 
but my client is simply not in a position to respond to this 
evidence today and out of caution is withdrawing and to 
make its own investigations. 
 
And that has been fully explained in these letters 
and I suppose in light of the recent events, we have to 
make clear that we are in a very much different position of 
not withdrawing or refusing the evidence but simply 
10 
indicating that we are not in a position to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine.  I guess that 
technically insofar as the right to cross-examine that 
Bombardier had been granted and the right to adduce 
certain evidence is concerned, I guess technically what 
you are asking for is, for leave not to proceed with the 
cross-examination and not to proceed to adduce evidence. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if it was before those rights 
were granted, the you could withdraw the application 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN ZYL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for leave to cross-examine.  You could 
withdraw the application for leave to adduce evidence.  So 
now that those were granted already, technically, you are 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 6 of 163 
 
simply 
asking 
for 
leave 
not 
to 
pursue 
the 
cross-
examination and not to proceed with the leading of 
evidence in terms of that order. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   Indeed Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   That is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine.  In regard to the 
request 
not 
to 
pursue 
cross-examination 
and 
not 
to 
proceed to adduce evidence, I have no difficulty granting 
leave.   
10 
 
In regard to whether, as you say, whether the 
correct terminology, withdraw or abort or whatever the 
affidavits 
that 
had 
already 
been 
lodged 
with 
the 
Commission, that might be more complicated than the other 
because, to the extent that the affidavits are already in the 
Commission.   
 
It may well be that one cannot say they should 
be taken away from the Commission, as it were, but it may 
well be that the new owners of Bombardier might, before 
the Commission completes its work, having had the chance 
20 
to look at those affidavits, they might communicate with the 
Commission to say, if that is the position, to say those 
affidavits should not be seen as presenting the current 
owners’ views or position of the current owners.   
 
So all I am simply saying is.  I am not in a 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 7 of 163 
 
position to immediately say I grant leave for you to take 
the affidavits away because it might need more thinking.  
But what I think you might need to do is just reflect on how 
it should be done.   
 
Maybe you might communicate with the Legal 
Team of the Commission and maybe, ultimately, there 
might be, subsequent to publication, to deal with the 
situation.   
 
Then I can apply my mind more fully because in 
effect that is evidence that has already been placed before 
10 
the Commission.  It is just that it is writing, it is not oral 
evidence but nevertheless it is evidence that has been 
placed before the Commission.   
 
So I would say.  Reflect on it to the extent that 
you may need to reflect on it.  Communicate with the 
Commission’s Legal Team and at the right stage, then 
maybe something can be communicated to me and then I 
can ultimately indicate what my final position would be.  Is 
that fine? 
ADV VAN ZYL:   We are clearly taking note of that.  Thank 
20 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   I can tell you that my client has already 
started the process of verification.  I do not anticipate from 
what I have seen so far that that process is going to be 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 8 of 163 
 
able to be completed timeously but I can assure you Cahir 
that my client will most certainly take the invitation and 
what you have said seriously. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   It is most unfortunate that we have only 
the short time had a process but then out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   And then we now found ourselves here.  
But we will - most certainly, we take the work of the 
Commission very seriously and to the extent that we can 
10 
contribute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   My client has given the assurance that it 
will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  It may well 
be that all that might need to be done is that when the 
report is prepared, it should be stated on record that these 
were affidavits that were filed at a certain time.   
 
And that there was a request to – at this time to 
take them out or whatever the terminology is, once there 
20 
were new owners.  So that whatever is made of them, is 
made in the context of whoever were the owners at the 
time.   
 
So but you will get a chance to reflect and then 
indicate what your submissions would be. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 9 of 163 
 
ADV VAN ZYL:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you very much.  I 
think then – I have granted leave in regard to two matters 
and the other one is just left pending because it needs 
further consideration.  Ja, okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV VAN ZYL:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Anyone who wishes to be 
excused, is excused.   
10 
COUNSEL:   ...all my things in place and... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Take this until I am told I need it. 
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Good 
morning 
and 
good 
morning 
everybody.  Good morning Mr Sacks. 
MR SACKS:   Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, you will recall that 
20 
yesterday we had interrupted Mr Sacks’ evidence, dealing 
with the flow of funds and the report he had compiled on 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I have reflected 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 10 of 163 
 
overnight and I have raised with Mr Sacks that in light of 
the issues that the Commission is concerned with, there 
are certain details relating to when payments were made 
and what the amount was.   
 
In 
the 
long 
run, 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
Commission, 
it 
does 
not 
take 
the 
matter 
further 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What we want is the overall picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And – but not only to speed things up 
but also to ensure that we do not lose focus of what we 
want. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So I have raised with Mr Sacks and I 
want to raise with you Chairperson, that the approach I 
want to adopt into the rest or most of the rest of the report 
is for Mr Sacks to confirm the correctness of what is 
contained in the tables with the commentary. 
 
And there are certain matters that are quite 
20 
important for example who were the directors of the 
companies in concern, who were the auditors and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   There will be those matters that we 
will concentrate on and the rest the consideration of his 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 11 of 163 
 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the next matter that I want to 
raise with Mr Sacks is.  You will recall Chairperson that in 
his evidence Mr Sacks said that there were two emails from 
Ms Gaza that raised red flags before the contract had been 
sighed.  It was after the award had been made.   
 
Mr Sacks has now managed to get those emails.  
They are contained in the affidavit that Mr Hodge Bauw(?) 
in response to what Mr Montana had alleged in his 
10 
incomplete affidavit. 
 
So I will ask Mr Hodge because I think they are 
quite reflective of what the contents of those emails – or 
what – how strong the message was.   
 
Then I leave that part and then I roll onto the EM 
100’s because as I have indicated to you yesterday 
Chairperson.  The – some of the investigations that 
Mr Sacks did were based on what was said in the Swifambo 
affidavit. 
 
Now in the CM 100’s or notice to the CM 100’s 
20 
that Mr Mashaba lodged with the master ’s office.  He 
reflects or indicates what the funds were for or where he is 
not happy about payments that were made by Swifambo.  
He indicates what that is. 
 
Now 
Chairperson, 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 12 of 163 
 
Commission, in my view, we need not go – we can dispute 
the correctness of that but we are not in a position to do so 
at the moment but what Mr Mashaba says in those CM 
100’s 
is 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
Commission 
quite 
important. 
 
And that, effectively, if – and I do not mean to be 
crude but that is from the horse’s mouth, as it were, and 
we can take that as representing his position because the 
CM 100 is effectively an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Is that okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that will be in order.  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Sacks, you have heard what I 
have 
communicated 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
about 
the 
approach... 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Now in – you finished at page 
902 of Bundle L.  That is still your report.   
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is...  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where are we going to 
resume from on...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   From page 902 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nine...? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Nine, zero, two. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 13 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of SS-24, Bundle L. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, nine, zero, two.  Okay thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now at 14.2.2, you summarise the 
amounts that Swifambo received and paid but would it be 
correct that you thereafter in Table 5, summarise how 
Swifambo had utilised – well, had utilised the funds it had 
received from PRASA relating to the main beneficiaries and 
you identified yesterday. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Table 5, if you could just indicate 
that – right at the top you say the amount received from 
PRASA was R 2 650 ...  R 2 650 207 950,29.  And then it 
made disbursements of – to Vossloh, Mashaba entities 
linked to these persons.  How much is paid to Vossloh? 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
the 
amount 
is 
R 1 873 474 161,62.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And do Mashaba and Mashaba linked 
entities? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the payments linked to 
20 
Mashaba and Mashaba linked entities is R 102 928 001,75. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Mashele? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the payments linked to Mashele 
is R 39 54 840,00.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then there were other 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 14 of 163 
 
disbursements in the region of R 231 million or a little 
more than R 230 million. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what was the balance in 
Swifambo’s accounts as at the 30 t h of November 2015? 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
the 
balance 
at 
30 November 2015 was R 111 276 943.89. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now just to put the rest of the report 
in context.  The rest of the report actually in respect of 
each of those main figures breaks down which way the 
10 
entities... 
 
In other words, this is the big picture and now in 
the rest of the affidavit, you indicate that this is the amount 
that went to Mr Mashaba himself through this entity, that 
entity and that entity.  Is that... 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson.  These are just 
summaries 
that... 
upfront 
to 
assist 
the 
police 
in 
understanding collectively what money flowed.  However, 
as transfers refer, each transaction as is – including the 
bank statements is detailed in the rest of the report. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now we will go through those to the 
extent that they are relevant.  Let us then look at Table 6 
which 
is 
a 
point 
you 
made 
yesterday 
that 
on 
the 
5 t h of April 2013, Swifambo received the first payment from 
PRASA. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 15 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you looked at how that 
money was distributed.  Is that correct?  
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, it is standard procedure for 
these flow of funds analysis specifically in this type of 
place, 
is 
to 
investigate 
the 
timeframe 
when 
monies 
received and monies paid. 
 
And specifically as counsel refers in Table 6 
under paragraph 14.3, I noted that, as was discussed 
yesterday, 
there 
was 
quite 
an 
extensive 
time-lapse 
10 
between when Swifambo received the first payment from 
PRASA into the incorrect account, Swifambo Rail Holdings 
and when it made its first payment to Vossloh and it was 
116-days later. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then the – would the rest of the 
– of flow interest Swifambo’s account, whether Swifambo 
Holdings or Swifambo Railing, they – you indicate when the 
funds were received and how many days later money was 
sent to Vossloh. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you confirm the correctness of 
those figures? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The one that stands out is the 116-
days period between the first payment that Swifambo 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 16 of 163 
 
received and the first payment made to Vossloh.  Is that... 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the others are in the region of 
three weeks and sometimes one week and so on. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in regard to the 116-days period 
between when PRASA received – when Swifambo received 
R 416 odd million from PRASA to the time it made the first 
payment to Swifambo.  You have done a calculation, 
looking at the bank accounts, of what amounts it had 
10 
distributed to other people. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is what is reflected in the 
first document you presented yesterday.  Chairperson, you 
will remember we had the pictorial representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I still have. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay we just want to go through that 
because it may be quite revealing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  If you just – you just need to 
20 
give the dates and to whom the payments were made and 
what the amounts were. 
MR SACKS:   Okay.  Chairperson, you are looking, I think, 
the first diagram, page 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 1?  Okay.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 17 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:   That is titled: Swifambo Flow of Funds, 
Timing 
and 
Utilisation 
of 
First 
PRASA 
Receipt 
of 
R 460 million on 5 April 2013.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   On the top left corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I’ve got it.   
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, those guys requested me to 
explain this documents.  As you will – as you can see on 
the document, on the left-hand side that shows money 
flowing in from PRASA on 5 April 2013, R 460 million. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   And that, as I – I do noted that it is paid into 
Swifambo Rail Holdings Standard Bank account and I note 
that this money, in terms of contract, should have been 
paid into Swifambo Rail Leasing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   Then as you see the outflows on the right-
hand side.  I have summarised per the bank statements, if 
you were to go to the top, it includes the date, the 
recipient of the money and the amounts of the money.   
20 
 
And there is – on this document shows 1,2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... 16 recipients of 
payments. 
 
And 
the 
last 
payment, 
the 
17 t h 
and 
30 t h of July 2013 is Vossloh for R 290 million.   
 
So the point of this document was to explain that 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 18 of 163 
 
on 5 April 2013, PRASA paid R 460 million to Swifambo.  
On the 30 t h of July, a 116-days later, Swifambo paid 
Vossloh R 290 million.   
 
The balance, the difference of approximately 
R 170 million was in the main paid to the entities, the 
individuals which have been linked which we discussed 
yesterday. 
 
So 
for 
example, 
the 
first 
payment 
on 
8 April 2013, AMCE which is AM Consulting Engineers, 
which is Mashaba’s company, received R 5 million. 
10 
 
So as I do note on this document that within six 
days of receipt from PRASA, Swifambo paid R 102 million 
out of the business to Mashaba, Mabunda, Mashele, WKH 
Landgrebe in a trust which is Mashaba’s – linked to 
Mashaba, NOH which is linked to Mabunda, Nkosi Sabelo, 
Moosa Capital. 
 
So Chairperson, without too much detail, just for 
summarisation purposes, in the bottom left-hand corner, I 
deal with the totals that all these individuals or entities 
received. 
20 
 
And the point of this document is trying to say 
is.  That before Swifambo – Vossloh may receive its first 
payment of R 290 million, a 116-days after PRASA had paid 
Swifambo, R 150 million was in fact disbursed to Mashaba 
who received R 30.5 million. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 19 of 163 
 
 
Mashele, through an entity called Bond Wheels, 
received R 28.32 million.  Mabunda, through an entity 
called NOH, received R 23.68 million.  Parish, through an 
entity called Moosa Capital, received R 13.5 million.  WKH 
Landgrebe, who again were the auditors of many of these 
linked 
entities 
and 
Swifambo 
Rail 
Leasing 
auditors 
received R 16.5 million. 
 
Nels Hoosain received R 10.4 million and Nkosi 
Sabelo 
received 
R 28.5 million, 
which 
total 
at 
R 151.4 million.  These recipients received before Vossloh, 
10 
is the first payment to Vossloh was made. 
 
And in context of – you will recall Chairperson, 
the profit that Swifambo was – the margin they should have 
made of R 180 million, just on the first payments alone for 
funds received from PRASA, greatly exceeded the profit 
that Swifambo was ought to have earned over the duration 
of the entire contracts. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Now I think this pictorial 
representation starkly represents the point you are making 
and if I can put it in a slightly different context.  This was 
20 
the priority of creditors as far as Swifambo was concerned. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the counsel uses the word 
creditors loosely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Creditors.  [laughs]  Ja. 
MR SACKS:   I think the priorities ...[intervenes]  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 20 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I agree. 
MR SACKS:   ...held by directors or influential people 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Certain recipients. 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Perhaps that is a better word. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.   
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yesterday, I said to you one of the 
figures 
that 
stuck 
in 
my 
head 
was 
a 
payment 
of 
R 10 million to Landgrebe.  In fact, it is R 8.8 million on 
the 9 t h of April and then further payments of R 1.2 million 
and then for R 1.3 million and then R 2.2 million. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were quite busy on the 9 t h of April, 
right? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Then at page 906 in paragraph 
14.4, you indicate the payments that were made to Vossloh 
for the locomotives, and you have already indicated that it 
was a little more than R 1.8 billion. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 21 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I – this though is – there is 
something I want you to explain to the Chairperson, what is 
the source of this information? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the ultimate source is possibly 
themselves confirmed to the South African Reserve Bank, I 
stand to be corrected, they in fact received this money and 
using that confirmation from Vossloh themselves I was able 
to marry up the payments out of Swifambo bank accounts 
even though I was missing one or two pieces of information 
but because Vossloh had confirmed the amounts I knew 
10 
that those amounts had indeed been paid. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So it is Vossloh who would confirm to 
the Reserve Bank and that is the information you based 
table 7A upon but you have obviously checked it against 
withdrawals from …[intervenes] 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson, I have confirmed as 
counsel said. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So the other information  in contained 
in your analysis of bank – is derived from your analysis of 
bank account.  This, though, comes from Vossloh itself. 
20 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then …[intervenes] 
MR SACKS:   Sorry, Chairperson, stand to be corrected, 
actually National Treasury that they confirm the amounts 
to.  Excuse me, I just got confused between the two 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 22 of 163 
 
sometimes with the detail. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, I think you do say that in 
paragraph 14.4.2 of your presentation. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Then at 14.4.8 on page 908 
you look at the payments that Vossloh made to Swifambo 
and you say that that totalled R811 508.59 and you break 
down the different payments that were made.  Can I ask 
you, where these came – the concern – or not the concern 
but what stood out for me is Vossloh is doing things for 
10 
which Swifambo needs to pay it in terms of Swifambo 
contract with Vossloh, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now this seems to suggest that it was 
Vossloh, the worker who was paying Swifambo the actual 
paymaster event. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson.  As I stated in 
my report, initially as I stated in my report that 811 000 
which we discussed yesterday, which these amounts that 
were flowing into Swifambo’s bank accounts prior to that 
20 
PRASA received the receipts and as I stated in my report, 
these funds were ostensibly used to fund the setup costs 
of the Swifambo office.  I did state in my report that 
obviously these are subject to confirmation and will have to 
be investigated further. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 23 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now you also said yesterday, and you 
can just confirm it, but it is in your report, where you say 
that Vossloh’s contract with Swifambo was signed on the 4 
July 2013. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now if you look at these payments, all 
except the fifth one were made to Swifambo before the 
contract was done. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And those were the smaller amounts.  
10 
The bigger amount on the 17 April 2014, that is almost a 
year after PRASA had been paying Swifambo, Vossloh 
makes a payment to Swifambo of R448-odd million – sorry, 
R488 000. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Was there any indication what that 
was? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the description within Swifambo 
Rail Leasing bank account, which these tables include the 
bank statement, account details, received the money, the 
20 
date and the description and amounts, the description says 
electronic banking payment FR Vossloh, rent and other 
payments. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Vossloh was paying for the rent in the 
meantime? 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 24 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, we check with the bank 
statements as you read them. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR SACKS:   The actual commercial rationale for the 
payment was subject to confirmation but on face value it 
appears that Vossloh was paying rent for Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I tell you why I am intrigued by this 
and it has only occurred to me now that is why I did not 
raise it with you earlier.  If you turn to table 7A on the 
[indistinct – dropping voice] you will see that according to 
10 
Vossloh it had received money on the 1 August 2013, it had 
received money on the 2 January 2017, the 17 January 
2017, the 19 t h of …[intervenes] 
MR SACKS:   Sorry, counsel, 14. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, 14.  The 19 May 2014 and the 
8 July 2014. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then it then makes this payment 
on the 17 April 2014. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Well, obviously you cannot explain, 
those are not signed off. 
MR SACKS:   Again, Chairperson, at face value it sounds 
odd, as to counsel’s words. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But let me ask you a slightly different 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 25 of 163 
 
question which is not contained in your report.  It seems – 
and that is the reason examining and I take it that is the 
reason you included the payments that Vossloh made to 
Swifambo over this period, over the period 2012 to 2014.  
Is there anything you have uncovered as to the benefit to 
Vossloh of this [indistinct – dropping voice] besides the 
money? 
MR SACKS:   I have – Chairperson, in the course of the 
Werksmans’ 
investigation 
intelligence 
is 
obviously 
performed and when we were looking at – the team was 
10 
looking at Vossloh as an entity and the contract itself we 
were looking at the Vossloh financial statements and I am 
assuming, counsel, that is what you are referring to and, if 
I may – which I found it quite revealing and it was reported 
at 
the 
time 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
Werksmans’ 
investigation as to how Vossloh themselves, the greater 
Vossloh Group, because Vossloh Espana, the locomotive 
manufacturer is a subsidiary of the Vossloh Group at the 
time.  I do understand that there has been a name change 
or transactional activity in that group to another entity, I 
20 
am not familiar with those details but at the time when we 
were doing the investigation – and, if you would indulge 
me, I have briefed counsel what those financial statements 
actually said and if you allow me to I can read them into 
the 
record, 
which 
is 
quite 
revealing 
in 
terms 
of 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 26 of 163 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   …the value that Vossloh placed on this 
contract and in light of the funds flowing to Vossloh and as 
my report will state, money flowing over and above these 
funds, these payments that we talk about, the R800 000, 
be it is a lot of money, there was significantly more funds, 
much more funds that flowed into South Africa from 
Vossloh not through Swifambo, which counsel will deal 
with, but if you bear with me, I will – these are what I call 
10 
pertinent extracts from the public audited Vossloh AG 
financial report and …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  For what period was that? 
MR SACKS:   This is for the financial period ending 31 
December 2013 and they signed the contract with – 
Vossloh signed the contract with Swifambo in July 2013, so 
this is six months later.  I recall at the time when we were 
doing the Werksmans’ investigation we were not familiar 
with that contract between Swifambo and Vossloh, that 
contract was only revealed later in discovery in the 
20 
Mashaba affidavit and we were trying to establish what the 
value was that Vossloh was earning, what was the price 
that they were earning.  We knew what PRASA was paying 
Swifambo and I will read the actual extracts from the 
financial statements with reference to Vossloh stock, per 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 27 of 163 
 
page 8 of the financial statements. 
“With the announcement in the beginning of October 
2013 of a major order from South Africa, Vossloh 
gained renewed interest of investors and the stock 
significantly recovered to the end of November to 
prices above 70 Euros.” 
So obviously the inference is the major order from South 
Africa has a positive impact on the share price – I am 
assuming stock price, in South Africa we refer to as share 
price, has a positive impact on the share price which 
10 
significantly recovered.  The next quote: 
“With reference to Africa operations per page 18.  
In fiscal 2013 Vossloh succeeded in booking a mega 
order from the South African company Swifambo 
Rail Leasing for 70 locomotives.  The contract is 
worth a total amount of around Euro 250 million.” 
And that was the first indication at the time of what 
Vossloh was earning, 250.  We knew Swifambo – PRASA 
was paying 267 million Euros.  Again, if you recall, 
Chairperson, it was Euro priced contract even though it 
20 
titled 3.5 billion.  The next quote: 
“With reference to [indistinct] 11.04 transportation 
systems, per page 74.  The winning of a major 
contract from South Africa in the third quarter of 
2013 for 70 locomotives are Vossloh Rail vehicles 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 28 of 163 
 
in the amount of 250 million Euro, contributed 
significantly to this development.  
With reference to Vossloh Transportation Systems 
per page 75, thanks to the major order from South 
Africa, the order backlog of Vossloh Rail vehicles 
as of December 31, 2013, was an extraordinarily 
high 
level. 
 
The 
orders 
received 
in 
purely 
mathematical terms extend well into the year 2016 
and prove they have a lengthier location with a 
positive sales outlook for the coming years.” 
10 
And the last quote: 
“With reference to Vossloh Electrical Systems per 
page 76, as was already the case in 2012, the 
largest contribution to sales outside of Europe was 
in South Africa.” 
So, 
Chairperson, 
at 
the 
time 
as 
the 
Werksmans’ 
investigation was being performed, this was very revealing 
in terms of understanding how significant this contract was 
not only to Swifambo but to Vossloh themselves and when 
we deal with the flow of funds into South Africa from 
20 
Vossloh, it puts it into context why it was very important for 
Vossloh to in fact get this – and to get this contract. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It may be – and I know it is contained 
in the different part of your …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 29 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I have that page that document you 
were reading from? 
MR SACKS:   No, not, I do not think so, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we should get it, Mr Soni, and it 
could be admitted as an exhibit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please. 
MR SACKS:   And I will forward the Commission the 
financial statements for Vossloh AG as well, where these 
quotes come from. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We will do it in a separate 
supplementary 
affidavit, 
so 
it 
does 
not 
[indistinct 
– 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I must apologise, I only 
found out about this a couple of days ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no, no, that is fine.  I think it is 
important. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It puts the whole picture in 
perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But I know, Mr Sacks, you deal with 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 30 of 163 
 
that later but maybe it is a good time just because we are 
dealing with the issue of Vossloh payments because you 
have mentioned then they made payments to Swifambo.  I 
would like you to turn to page 953 of your report.  Page 
953, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   953. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now you do not have to read this.  
Would you indicate to the Chairperson what you deal with 
in the context of what you have just been saying.  You 
were saying there were major other inflows into South 
10 
Africa from Vossloh.  So will you tell the Chairperson what 
this is. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the Werksmans’ investigation 
team, at the time we again we performed investigations, 
provided with a report which was styled: 
“Provisional report on the Passenger Rail Agency of 
South Africa Matter.” 
This 
report 
was 
prepared 
by 
the 
compliance 
and 
enforcement 
division 
of 
the 
financial 
surveillance 
department dated 15 February 2017 and I stand to be 
20 
corrected, I think that is of the Reserve Bank  and in 
summary …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, just for the record.  What is 
the compliance and enforcement division?  I am sorry, the 
financial surveillance department.  To which department 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 31 of 163 
 
does it belong? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, again I think it is to the South 
African Reserve Bank.  It is a department within the 
Reserve Bank and they were obviously in a position to 
ascertain money flowing into South Africa as – or money 
flowing in and out goes through the Reserve Bank. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And generally what is the purpose of 
monitoring? 
MR SACKS:   It is compliance – and foreign exchange 
compliance and enforcement, I would understand. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Would it not also be to monitor if 
there are suspicious inflows or outflows of money which all 
countries in the world, just given the world we live in now, 
are required to do. 
MR SACKS:   I confirm with counsel, Chairperson, on that 
view.  So, in summary, this report confirmed that an 
amount of R88 991 209.38 – 39 cents, excuse me, flowed 
into South Africa from Vossloh and my report includes 
extracts of this said report and if you indulge me, 
Chairperson, I can say that an entity with the name 
20 
Vossloh Kiepe which I understand is an Austrian division of 
Vossloh 
AG 
made 
six 
payments 
to 
Siyaya 
Rail 
infrastructure solutions and technology between December 
2011 and September 2013 totalling R13.6 million.  The 
category 
for 
these 
payments 
is 
reflected 
as 
legal, 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 32 of 163 
 
accounting, 
management 
consulting 
and 
proceeds 
for 
management consulting and my report includes the details 
of these payments and, Chairperson, Vossloh Espana, 
which we understand is obviously the Spanish subsidiary 
which manufactured the locomotives, made six payments to 
an entity S Investments (Pty) Ltd between February 2014 
and September 2015 totalling R75 328 121.57.  Category 
of 
these 
payments 
is 
reflected 
for 
proceeds 
for 
management 
consulting 
service 
and 
architectural 
engineering and other technical services and, as I state in 
10 
my report: 
“Considering the material nature and amounts of the 
payments listed above specifically as the payments 
were ostensibly made to Mabunda companies, this 
report and the content therein…” 
Being the Reserve Bank report. 
“…needs to be investigated further.” 
But ultimately this report confirmed that approximately R89 
million was paid by Vossloh into South Africa to Mabunda 
linked entities and which - I understand which counsel will 
20 
examine further that the liquidator ’s report deals with this 
aspect as well. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now you say the last paragraph of 
your report: 
“Considering the material nature and the amounts 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 33 of 163 
 
involved R75 million being paid by a person who 
receives, in their words, a mega contract from 
South Africa to an individual who you say is 
significant.” 
And why do you say in this context Mr Mabunda is 
significant? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, as we have explored, Mabunda 
– Mr Mabunda and his entities, linked entities, received 
significant funds from Swifambo.  Not only that, Mr 
Mabunda’s linked entities were significantly involved in the 
10 
tender.  If you recall, Chairperson, one of the first items in 
the tender was to pick up the tender documents and 
someone 
from 
S 
Group 
collected 
the 
documents 
themselves and that was the start of the flow of Mabunda-
linked entities through the whole – from inception of the 
tender to the awarding of the tender to ultimate outflow of 
funds and further to these flows from Vossloh into South 
Africa of R89 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in terms of the analysis you did 
of the major – I do not want to call them creditors anymore 
20 
because – but the major beneficiaries of the outflows from 
Swifambo, Mr Mabunda and his company are a major 
beneficiary. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the flow of funds analysis 
shows 
that 
Mabunda-linked 
entities 
received 
from 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 34 of 163 
 
Swifambo 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
time 
of 
analysis 
R54 651 981 and the entities include names such as 
Inawaste(?) the Siyaya Group entities and Sovo S Group. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So that would mean that in respect of 
this contract Mr Mabunda and his companies received more 
than R140 million, take the 88,4 plus 54 that you were 
talking about. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is more than the profit that 
Swifambo was going to make out of the entire deal. 
10 
MR SACKS:   As per the contract, yes, Chairperson. 
the entities include names such as Inawaste(?) the Siyaya 
Group entities and Sovo S Group. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think you said yesterday but you 
will tell me if I misunderstood, I think – and you said 
yesterday for really doing nothing. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Other than being the middleman.   
MR SACKS:   You are correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now adopting the approach that we 
indicate that we would just deal with the big amounts 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni.  Can I ask this 
question?  And your being an account and a forensic might 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 35 of 163 
 
enable you to answer it.  What are the chances that the 
price for the locomotives that was quoted to PRASA was 
inflated in order to make provision for amounts that would 
have to be paid to the middleman by Vossloh?  In other 
words, I do not see that if I am going to manufacture trains 
to sell to him if their true price is R100 then my profit is 
provided there, that if I allow you to be middleman, I am 
going to still quote R100 especially if your commission is 
going to be quite substantial, it looks like I would have to 
inflate the prices so as to accommodate what I must pay 
10 
and still make a reasonable profit.  In terms of your own 
experience, in terms of your analysis, is that something 
you are able to answer even if not definitively but in terms 
of probabilities based on your experience? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, it is really a question – I think 
the first thing that you can say is if PRASA secured the 
trains 
directly 
from 
Swifambo 
themselves, 
assuming 
Swifambo 
qualified 
to 
provide, 
they 
will 
have 
paid 
significantly 
R120 
million 
less 
when 
is 
a 
significant 
amount.  It appears to me without knowing the information  
20 
and in fairness to Swifambo themselves, we have not 
asked them the question, we have not investigated did you 
charge a fair price to Swifambo, did you give them a 
discount to enable them to make a mark-up?  That 
obviously we would have to – those conversations would 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 36 of 163 
 
have to take place and that is why we were reporting – the 
Werksmans’ investigation team was reporting this very fact 
to go to Vossloh, just ask those questions to Vossloh.  It 
looks like based on how this contract – as we have seen 
how this contract evolved, it did not seem to be a concern 
on the PRASA said, PRASA management side, at the very 
least, what they were paying.  And seeing that once the 
contract price of an amount of R3.5 billion was fixed, that 
is the number, however many locomotives we get for R3.5 
billion, initially it was 88, then the rand weakened, now we 
10 
are getting 70.  It seems like PRASA was irrelevant, really, 
in a sense, on a per unit price.  It was just a contract 
price.  I think you ask a very good question and I would 
certainly think did PRASA pay more than the going rate for 
a locomotive?  I cannot – I was not privy to what the other 
tenderers bid for their locomotives and that is certainly 
something that would have to be looked at in context of the 
whole – the whole – the whole – I hope I answered your 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine.  It may well 
20 
be that trying to establish what similar trains may have 
been 
sold 
for 
are 
elsewhere 
by 
Vossloh 
or 
by 
its 
competitors at that time may help to say – because, as I 
see it, if Swifambo had no previous experience of in this 
sector or maybe in any sector, in this sector, maybe 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 37 of 163 
 
whatever prices they quoted were based on what Vossloh 
may have told them because they just – they knew they 
were going to get them from Vossloh.   
MR SACKS:   So, in other words, Chairperson, it was not – 
they did not act in the best interests of PRASA, they just 
accepted the price that Vossloh was quoting, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but obviously the responsibility to 
act in the best interest of PRASA started with the people 
who agreed to the price at PRASA. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What homework did they do before they 
agreed to the price, was this the going rate, you know, did 
they compare with other manufacturers internationally or 
whatever or did they just take whatever price was quoted 
to them by Swifambo?  So it would interesting – I mean, I 
do not know if you have worked out what percentage of the 
whole amount paid by PRASA for these trains went to 
Swifambo in terms of all these amounts including those 
that may have gone to Siyagena and so on.  What 
percentage in the end …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Swifambo, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Swifambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Swifambo, I think I saw in one of the 
pages some money that came from Vossloh Kiepe or 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 38 of 163 
 
something. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Going to Siyagena. 
MR SACKS:   No, it was Siyaya. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, ja, I mean Siyaya.  Well, Mr Soni 
knows that for quite some time I kept on confusing Siyaya 
and Siyagena.  Ja, so it would be interesting to see what 
percentage went to – ended up with Vossloh, what 
percentage ended up with Swifambo or Mabunda and other 
people connected with Swifambo. 
10 
MR SACKS:   I think, Chairperson, it is fair to say that the 
majority of the R3.5 billion was going to end up in a foreign 
company.  R1.8 billion was paid to them for the delivery of 
13 
locomotives 
and 
I 
know 
during 
the 
Werksmans’ 
investigation, we were looking at that aspect in terms of 
how PRASA – the delivery of locomotives did not accord 
with the money that was being paid, it was almost like 
PRASA was paying upfront.  It was not a favourable 
contract 
to 
PRASA, 
they 
took 
on 
tremendous 
risk, 
performance risk.  I understand there were issues with the 
20 
performance bond which I understand to be that if the 
supplier fails to deliver, how does PRASA recoup their 
money and – so the whole contract itself was not focused 
to PRASA’s best interest and  - so in terms of just 13 
locomotives coming for R2.6 billion being paid of which the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 39 of 163 
 
majority of it went to Vossloh, I think it just stands on its 
own in terms of well, PRASA was heavily exposed just on 
that basis alone in not getting what eventually – never 
mind that the locomotives were not suitable for the South 
African rail network, as it was dealt with in Popo Molefe’s – 
or the application judged by the SCA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it would be interesting to know what 
price Vossloh would have quoted if they were dealing with 
PRASA directly. 
MR SACKS:   I think it is a very good question, 
10 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Into that mix though, Mr Sacks, one 
must also put this because you raised a question, well it 
looked an unfavourable contract, at the time PRASA 
contracted 
with 
Swifambo, 
Swifambo 
had 
not 
yet 
contracted with Vossloh because PRASA’s contract with 
Swifambo was concluded on the 25 t h of March and 
Vossloh’s 
– 
Swifambo’s 
contract 
with 
Vossloh 
was 
conducted three months later. 
20 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So even if PRASA had asked 
Swifambo what is Vossloh going to charge Swifambo could 
not give an answer because there was no contract between 
them? 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 40 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:   Yes Chairperson it was dealt with extensively 
in the Popo Molefe affidavits as well.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I mean it just reinforces the point 
you made that PRASA just didn’t care. 
MR SACKS:   To put it bluntly Chairperson that is probably 
a fair summation by counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is very worrying when people are 
appointed to important State Entities like PRASA, they are 
in high positions, they get paid quite well to look after the 
interests of the entity, but by the way this contract was 
10 
handled it does look like the interest of PRASA were 
subsidiary to something else. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is very worrying. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In regard to the payments that 
Vossloh made to Siyaya which were flagged by the 
financial surveillance department, when your report was 
finished did you send a report to them to say look you 
20 
flagged this, should you not look at this further, or whose 
job, so what I am asking really is whose job is it to pursue 
such information when you get more damning information 
or more suspicious information?   
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I think the obvious answer 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 41 of 163 
 
would be law enforcement themselves, hence I included 
this very important finding in my report, again if we look at 
the Genesis of this report this is just my preliminary 
findings, you know it was obviously intended to move 
forward from there, to say well this is what we have got 
thus far, here is the evidence we have received thus far, 
these are our findings, these are areas of focus and I 
would imagine that was these in-flows from a foreign 
company into South Africa to these individuals and entities 
which should have been or would have been a key focus of 
10 
a law enforcement investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So you would have expected the 
Hawks to take this up and say well look you flagged this, 
we have now got this further information.  
MR SACKS:   At the very least yes, because that is where 
my – Chairperson where my report went to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we know Mr Soni whether in the light 
of the High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal judgments 
against Swifambo, which have been there for some time.  
The Siyaya one is rescinded.  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The Siyangena one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Siyangena one ja.  Whether 
government or PRASA has done anything to try and recover 
some of the money it has lost through the this conduct 
from its officials who makes certain decisions which appear 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 42 of 163 
 
to have either at best for them reckless or grossly 
negligent or may well have been because of some other 
agenda.   Do we know whether anything has been done by 
other than attempts to gain from I mean Swifambo was 
...[indistinct]. 
ADV VAN SONI SC:   Chairperson to the best of my 
knowledge not because it is not a question that was 
pertinently asked for example to Ms Ngoye who would have 
known as the Head of Legal and Compliance, but it is a 
question that must expressly be asked to her so I can 
10 
respond to that at the next sitting or certainly in an email 
to you Chairperson and then we can take it up but then you 
would know formally what the ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, because how much of the 
money that PRASA did pay out at some stage has come 
back? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   63million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   R63million, that’s what the liquidator 
seems to have yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, obviously that is a far cry from the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   From the 3,5billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the billions ja, that were paid out.   
I think that the entity should be looking at investigating the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 43 of 163 
 
possibility of suing everyone who may have made decisions 
that resulted in these losses in circumstances where those 
individuals are not able to give proper explanations for 
their decisions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If I could Chairperson, and I just am 
using the opportunity that has been raised, one possibility 
is a self review to join some of the officials who were 
involved 
so 
that 
they 
cannot 
hide 
behind 
the 
wing 
contractor as it were and then we are left in the situation 
where the High Court is faced only with the version of the 
10 
Organ of State and it cannot identify officials because 
there has been no attempt to say but these are the officials 
and this is what A did, this is what B did, and this is what C 
did and that is why we want to use the Court to hold them 
responsible for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is true, and any of those officials, 
any of those officials who is able to place before PRASA or 
before – let’s start with PRASA, before PRASA evidence 
that there was nothing wrong with the decisions they took 
and PRASA is satisfied that is fine, they don’t have to be 
20 
sued you know but if they don’t put that before PRASA and 
they are sued they can place that before the Court but they 
can explain to PRASA to say well I made this decision, 
these decisions on the basis of this information and it 
seems to me it was a reasonable decision to make under 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 44 of 163 
 
the 
circumstances 
but 
if 
their 
explanations 
are 
not 
satisfactory then PRASA could consider suing them. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because this is a lot of taxpayers’ 
money. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is something that has given me 
sleepless nights Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I mean I think yesterday Mr Sacks 
referred to a page in the course of his evidence a page in 
the report which reflects that a certain Ms Casa I think 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Wrote emails to Mr ...[indistinct] and Mr 
Montana warning them about certain datas in relation to 
computing this contract if I am not mistaken. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is so and Chairperson on reflection 
and having been advised that those emails are in fact 
available I have made a copy of each of those two emails, I 
think one is on the 6 t h of November and the other is on the 
20 t h.   I have made them available to Mr Sacks and I am 
20 
going to ask him, because you will recall that was before 
the contract was signed and those emails certainly it 
reveals Chairperson the very point you are making that 
now you are told by a person who is a member of the Board 
that his is – this is really dangerous waters and you take 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 45 of 163 
 
your slip into those water, and of course the waters eat the 
ship up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay. 
MR VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson I see it is just after 11:15, 
do you want to take the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea break, we will 
resume, it is twenty past, we will resume at twenty five to 
twelve. 
MR VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I didn’t say this when we started Mr 
Sacks but I just mention it now that the oath you took 
yesterday continues to apply. 
MR SACKS:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I interrupted the flow of 
evidence leading to where you identify in detail what each 
of the beneficiaries and the entities got, because we were 
dealing with the Vossloh payment to Mr Mabunda and his 
company. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 46 of 163 
 
 
I want to take you back now, and this shouldn’t take 
us too long Mr Sacks.  At 14.5 you deal with the payments 
that were made to – or you call it payments linked to 
Mashaba, that’s Mr Mashaba personally and to entities that 
…[indistinct – dropping voice] 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And if you look at 14.5.5, you set-out 
the four beneficiaries into which you can divide Mr 
Mashaba’s …[indistinct – dropping voice]. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, it’s just as counsel says, four bank 
10 
accounts – the four bank accounts in these entities’ names 
yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, and the one in regard to AM 
Consulting Engineers, it appears at table 8 which is on 
page 913, the one on Amaroko Makolele [?] Trust appears 
at table 9 on page 914, the one for Mr Mashaba himself 
appears at table 10 page 915 and the one for Vuyinathi 
Properties appears at table 11 on page …[indistinct – 
dropping voice]. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just want to ask you for – and I 
don’t want to be finicky but it your report.  In 15.5.3 you 
say there were 9 payments but when you look at table 10 it 
appears there were 10 that obviously is a typographical. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson as I say my – it was a draft 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 47 of 163 
 
report 
these 
little 
errors 
were 
being 
picked 
up, 
on 
finalisation…[intervenes]. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
I 
just 
wanted 
to 
make 
sure…[intervenes]. 
MR SACKS:   Counsel is correct there’s 10 payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it possible to have a page somewhere 
that just records that …[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I could lead him on that so that the 
record will reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what I’m thinking is, if you lead him, 
10 
which you must do, one will see that in the transcript but 
when 
one 
is 
looking 
in 
the 
Bundle 
one 
might 
not 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, you’re quite right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, it might be helpful to have a page, 
maybe even if it’s at the end that says, in his report at 
page what, what, what this is what it says but actually it’s 
not correct, this is the correct position. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, as you please Chairperson.  
Then we go to the payments and that’s 14.6 payments 
20 
made to Mr – into the bank accounts of Mr Mashele and 
entities in which he has an…[indistinct – dropping voice]. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And those appear at tables 12 and 13 
at pages 919 and 920 respectively, is that correct? 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 48 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you confirm the correctness of 
what’s contained in those tables? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, I’m sorry I was trying to move 
on, there are matters that you mention in relation to other 
interested parties.  Can I just take you to paragraph 
14.5.7.2 at page 911, where you make the point in regard 
to 
AM 
Consulting 
Engineers, 
the 
auditors 
are 
WKH 
Landgrebe and Co.?  
10 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And why do you find that…[indistinct 
– dropping voice]? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, again, W.K.H. Landgrebe, the 
bank account in the name of W.K.H. Landgrebe received 
significant flow of funds from Swifambo in the amount of 
approximately R27.9million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you note at paragraph 
14.5.7.3 that the Directors of AMC Mashaba, a Mr Moloko 
Floyd Sibone and Landgrebe Secretarial Services. 
20 
MR SACKS:   In the capacity as company secretary, yes 
Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Is that usual to have them or were 
they just the company secretary? 
MR SACKS:   I think they were just the company secretary, 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 49 of 163 
 
again, the involvement of WKH Landgrebe was subject to 
further investigation but as stated they were the auditors. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What you …[indistinct] is there 
appears to be a link between that firm and Mashaba’s 
entity. 
MR SACKS:   And the flow of funds, yes Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the flow of funds yes. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then at 14.6 you deal with the 
flow to Mashele, we’ve been through that, tables 12 and 13 
10 
and in regard to Barn Wheels[?] you say their registered 
auditors are Van Wyk Auditors. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What is the significance of that? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, off the top of my head, if I 
recall, I was just recording all these entities, who the 
Directors and who the auditors were but I can be – I do 
believe that van Wyk Auditors did crop up amongst the 
entities, they weren’t specifically beneficiaries of funds but 
I was just stating facts because in an investigation if 
20 
further information is required, if I state who the auditors 
are as recorded on CIPC it would give the – I guess, the 
police at the very least or whoever else is involved in the 
investigation, areas of further examination.  If we need 
financial statements or we need queries, we can ask the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 50 of 163 
 
auditors. So I was just stating this information, just to be 
factual within my report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, I think their name crops up 
as auditors of other entities as well in fairness, that’s how I 
read the report. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then at 14.7 you deal with 
payments linked to Mr Mabunda and his entity. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, I just want to make this point 
10 
because you may not have been aware of it, at paragraph 
14.7.3 you say that the amounts on your investigation, you 
say this is background, that the Siyaya or different 
companies in the Siyaya Group received the payments 
mentioned, R26million, R23million and Siyaya Engineers 
the amount to be determined.  I just want to point out to 
you, when Ms Ngoye gave evidence about the Siyaya 
Group, she said they had done - she been asked to do that 
calculation and she said that from about 2009 they’d been 
paid a total of more than a billion rand.  Chairperson, you’ll 
20 
recall that evidence from Ms Ngoye. 
MR SACKS:   From PRASA? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   From PRASA yes. 
MR SACKS:   From PRASA Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I’m just – you know, there’s nothing 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 51 of 163 
 
wrong with this but…[indistinct – dropping voice] from 
PRASA…[indistinct – dropping voice].  Anyway at 4.7.9 you 
set out the amounts there to each of the entities and these 
are there, detailed at tables 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 
from page 924 to 934. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you confirm the correctness of 
all of those? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then the person who’s name you 
10 
flagged earlier, Mr Landgrebe, you detailed the payments 
made to him. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you confirm that that’s at 
table 21 at page 936, you confirm the correctness of what’s 
there? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And just to, again, indicate why you 
lightly highlighted van Wyk Auditors earlier at 14.8.5, you 
make the point that these things auditors are Landgrebe 
20 
but the auditors for Holdings are van Wyk Auditors. 
MR SACKS:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then at 14.9 you detail payments 
linked to Musa Capital and obviously through that, Ms 
Cynthia Parrish, this is the American citizen …[intervenes]. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 52 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Soni you say, at what? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry 14.9 on page 937. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ja, if you could just mention the 
page number together with the paragraphs that will help. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And this appears at table 22 on page 
938 and you confirm the details as set out in table 22, Mr 
Sacks? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then 14.10 the payments made to 
Sibenza and you detail these at paragraph 14.10 and table 
23. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I’m not going to ask about this 
because in the auditor ’s – sorry in Mr Mashaba’s note in 
respect to the payment to Sibenza he says that Swifambo 
in fact, had paid R110million not R99million and so we’ll 
look at that.  That’s, effectively the head of Swifambo 
saying that that’s the amount. 
20 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I’m not saying that your figures 
are wrong, I’m just saying that if they say they paid 
that…[intervenes]. 
MR SACKS:   We must just remember, Chairperson, at the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 53 of 163 
 
time I performed my investigation I wasn’t privy to 
documentation out of Swifambo, I was purely looking at 
bank statements and obviously…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you didn’t have all the bank 
statements in any case. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Some of these may have been from 
those other bank statements. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    
10 
MR SACKS:   Did you get to know round about when Mr 
Sifiso Buthelezi seems to be a Director of Sibenza 
Forwarding or is that something you never got to know? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I don’t have that date in my 
report, I would have obtained this information from CIPC so 
that it would be readily available but I did note in my report 
that he was a previous Director at this point in time I 
didn’t…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be good to get that information 
to see at what – as from what date he ceased to be a 
20 
Director. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Sacks is going to prepare a 
supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then at paragraph 14.11 you deal 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 54 of 163 
 
with the payments linked to Nkosi Sabelo and you say 
there were two payments again on account of the fact that 
Mr Mashaba sets out the payments that he made to this 
firm of attorneys and the reason for the payment, we will 
deal with this part – or these payments when we deal with 
his note on the CM tender relating to these payments. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does paragraph 14.10.5 which is based 
on Mr Mamabolo’s affidavit which says that Mr Buthelezi, 
the former Chairperson of PRASA Board, if an essential 
10 
link is – which has – it says has a 55% in Sibenza Holding 
does that mean that even though he may have resigned as 
a Director of Sibenza at some stage throughout the time of 
this Swifambo transaction, while he was Chairperson of the 
Board, he had this connection with Hadis that has 55% 
shareholding on Sibenza, do we know that? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, these were allegations made by 
Mamabolo, I cannot confirm if those allegations are true, 
however, it was included in my report because it certainly 
warranted…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something further. 
MR SACKS:   Something further but you are correct in 
saying whereas this individual might not have been a 
Director he might have had an interest, an ownership 
interest in Sibenza. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 55 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Is it possible to look at CIPC 
documents and include this in the further…[intervenes]. 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
CIPC 
doesn’t 
include 
shareholding that information is not readily available so 
that’s why it had to be performed per subpoena or an 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, so only the police would be able 
to…[indistinct – dropping voice]. 
10 
MR SACKS:   That’s my understanding, yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and I guess if the police can do it, 
the Commission could do it as well in terms of issuing a 
summons to produce documents, ja.  Okay, alright, I 
interrupted you Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, Chairperson, we’re at page 
945, these are the payments linked to Mezanni Engineering 
and you say there were 14 payments of …[indistinct] of 
R5million they are reflected in table 25, you confirm that 
what is set out in table 25 is correct? 
20 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the payments linked to Mezanni 
Investments – I take it these are different entities, Mezanni 
Engineering and Mezanni Investments because one is at 
14.12 and the other is at 14.13? 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 56 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, these are bank accounts with 
the names I tried to address – in the investigation if I could 
identify who the company was behind, hence I included 
auditor and CIPC information but this is a name of a bank 
account. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And, of course, if you look at 14.2.2 
you’ll see that the auditors are van Wyk auditors for 
Mezanni Engineers and if you look at 14.13.2 the auditors 
of Mezanni Investments are also van Wyk. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson that’s correct. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So this is the name that kept popping 
up and this is why, I suppose you flagged it and thought it 
was something to look at, not that there is something 
wrong with it. 
MR SACKS:  Yes, Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then at 14.14 you deal with a 
payment made to Knowles Husain Lindsay Attorneys, 
again, this payment is dealt with by Mr Mashaba in a note 
to SEM100, I’m going to go through that with you in a little 
while, I’m not going to deal with it here and then, of 
20 
course, the payment linked to SARS, I mean that’s not a 
matter that concerns us at all.  Paragraph 15 on page 953 
is the matter we’ve been through already. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that’s correct, the payments from 
Vossloh, Chairperson. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 57 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now, before I go on to the next set of 
documents I want to refer you to, I want to refer you to 
page 873 of your report and this is where you make the 
allegation or you…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess, just for the transcript, Mr Soni, 
for those who read afterwards when you said page 873 of 
the report, it’s 873 of the Bundle. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of the Bundle, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The page for the report will be, not 
that…[intervenes]. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, sure, yes, that’s at Bundle L. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, I did mention it earlier and I 
said I was going to raise this matter with you, in paragraph 
11.38 – sorry I’ll just take you back to the context.  You 
were raising matters that had been raised with the key 
people at PRASA and at 11.37 you made the point that, 
according to Mr Molefe’s affidavit, certain matter had been 
brought to the attention of Mr Montana but he ignored 
them, that’s not what I wanted but that’s the context.  At 
20 
11.3.8 you say, Bridgette Gasa, now let’s just identify her, 
what was her position in PRASA at the time? 
MR 
SACKS:   I – Chairperson, I’m not absolutely 
familiar…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay, she was a member of the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 58 of 163 
 
Board. 
MR SACKS:   I understand she was a member of the Board 
yes, that’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, the point you made though is, 
based on what had been said in Mr Molefe’s affidavit she 
had raised serious concerns about Swifambo in an email 
dated the 6 t h of November 2012 to Mr Buthelezi  and 
Montana, let’s just deal with that.  Have you managed to 
lay your hands on a copy of that email? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the standard procedure in the 
10 
Werksmans investigation the team – they forensically 
secure the documentation from the outside investigation 
and in this case there was about 1.4billion documents and 
within this – these documents, this email that counsel 
refers to was located and I’ll read the contents of this 
email…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Before you do that, Chairperson, I 
have a copy for you, it may be easier for you to follow it, 
may I have leave to hand it up and we will obviously 
include it in the further affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that’s fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But at least for now, you have it 
informally and then it will formally be part of the record 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s fine, thank you. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 59 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So, let’s just put this in context.  Ms 
Gasa writes on the 6 t h of November 2012 and she writes at 
19h25, when I say writes, sends the email at 19h25, is that 
correct? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Who were the recipients of this 
email? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the recipients of the email was 
an email address, Sifiso@makana.co.za and as noted on 
the email second recipient was Lucky Montana PRASA 
10 
Corp. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright what does she do within this? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, this is – this email deals with 
her raising the serious concerns and if counsel indulges 
me I can read it into the record. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, if you could read it into the 
record. 
MR SACKS:   So, the subject is, urgent, the attachments to 
this email states Swifambo Rail docex and Mpumalanga 
docex and the email reads as follows, 
20 
“Colleagues I know you are both in Cape Town, 
trying 
to 
rescue 
our 
organisation 
from 
being 
hijacked, I appreciate your efforts and can only 
hope 
the 
plot 
will 
be 
successfully 
arrested. 
Unfortunately I’m not a bearer of good news, I’ve 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 60 of 163 
 
just 
received 
intelligence 
information 
about 
Swifambo Rail Leasing, the company the PRASA 
approved R3billion worth of work over 15 years. 
With all these platforms not being safe I’d like to 
request that you allow me to dig a little deeper. 
Failure to follow this up will sink the organisation. 
Should the intelligence report prove true we need 
an immediate intervention as the Board, signed off 
my Dr Brigette Gasa, MD the Elilox Group Pty Ltd”.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, this seems to indicate that 
10 
there was an attachment to this email do you now – I 
mean, obviously you picked this up from Mr Molefe’s 
affidavit. 
MR SACKS:   Mr Molefe obtained this document through 
the Werksmans investigation, through the repository of the 
forensically secured documents, as I mentioned. I would 
imagine, to answer counsel’s question, if there was an 
attachment it could be, it would have to be confirmed, that 
this would also be – if this email was located in the 
forensic process then the attachments would also be.  I’m 
20 
not familiar as I wasn’t part of that forensic process. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I want to deal with the 
second email and having regard to its contents, make a 
submission to you on how we can take that issue forward, 
Chairperson. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 61 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, obviously she was very troubled by 
the 
intelligence 
report 
that 
she 
says 
– 
intelligence 
information that she says she had received about Swifambo 
Rail Leasing and she asked for – to be afforded more time 
to 
look 
into 
whatever 
was 
said 
in 
that 
intelligence 
information and she says, in effect, if we don’t follow up 
this intelligence information that failure will sink the 
organisation and should the intelligence report prove true, 
we need immediate intervention as the Board. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She makes another important point 
10 
here Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If we look at this as a contract for so 
many…[indistinct – dropping voice] if you look at what she 
says, this is R3billion worth of work over 15 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now that’s even more worrying 
because as I understand it, the State contracts are not to 
be beyond a certain period, three years or five years. I 
recall in one of the – Mr Makwethu’s affidavit he flagged 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I want to come back to how the 
approach 
– 
propose 
an 
approach 
we 
should 
adopt 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 62 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then there is a reference to a 
second email and that is from Ms Gasa again, what is the 
date of that email? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, that date is 20 November 2012. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the time? 
MR SACKS:   10h38am. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And who is this email addressed to? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, again an email was sent from 
Bridgette Gasa and it was sent to Chris Mbatha, PRASA 
Corp, copying Lindikhaya Zide and siphiso@makana.co.za 
10 
the subject being follow up on the Swifambo Rail leasing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lindikyaha Zide, I assume is the one that 
at some stage became a company secretary and at some 
stage Acting Group Chief Executive … 
MR SACKS:  Yes.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Officer. 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And siphiso@makana.co.za that seems to 
be the same email address that we associate with Mr Sifiso 
Buthelezi in the previous email.   
20 
MR SACKS:  Yes.  Yes, it is the same email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So it’s two, about two weeks 
after the first email. 
MR SACKS:  That is it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 63 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:  Please that, I read that into the record Mr 
Chair.  Chairperson the email reads: 
“Dear Chris, I am once again making an attempt to 
extract 
more 
information 
from 
you 
and 
the 
procurement team on abovementioned matter as per 
our initial discussions of the 8 t h of November.  It is 
imperative …” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just sorry, one second.  She says: 
 
“Our initial discussions of the 8 t h of November.” 
That is two days after the email to Mr Buthelezi and 
10 
Mr Montana? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That’s the one that you just read? 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
“It is imperative that PRASA as an organisation 
appoints adequately, capable entities to undertake 
the work under all of its programs, moreover in our 
contract are high in value and are linked to the 
strategy of creating new industrialists in the rail 
sector.  There are concerns have been raised 
20 
around 
this 
particular 
entity 
and 
the 
SCIP 
is 
needing you to confirm that indeed a capacity check 
was properly done in relation to this contracts and 
that 
you 
have 
satisfied 
yourselves 
with 
the 
necessary checks and balances have been done.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 64 of 163 
 
Please proceed to provide me with the information I 
requested from you as time is of the essence and 
will be an anomaly to proceed to conclude contract 
negotiations in light of the seriousness of the 
matter we had raised or which we have not received 
a response from you on.  Kind regards, Dr Zanele 
Bridgette Gasa.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in terms of the last part of her email, 
it would appear that he had not, she had not, that is Dr 
Bridgette Gasa, she had not received information that she 
10 
had requested with regard to this transaction.   
Whether she is talking about information she may 
have previously requested from Mr Chris Mbatha or she is 
talking about the information that she may have requested 
from Mr Montana or Mr Buthelezi.   
One might not be sure.  But it’s clear that she was, 
she had been seeking confirmation.  She of, she had been 
seeking certain information about this transaction.   
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she says she had not received a 
20 
response.  And it is clear from this email that her concerns 
include the capacity of Swifambo in terms of this project.  
Is that right? 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think in the email she refers to 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 65 of 163 
 
capacity does she not? 
MR SACKS:  She does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes she does.   
MR SACKS:  She does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Second paragraph of the second email, 
there are concerns that have been raised around this 
particular entity and the subject is the follow up on the 
Swifambo Rail Leasing.   
“There are concerns that have been raised around 
this particular entity and the FCIP is needing you to 
10 
confirm that indeed a capacity check was properly 
done in relation to this contract.  And that you have 
satisfied yourselves that the necessary checks and 
balances have been done.” 
That is an important issue she was raising and of 
course now that we know what we know, if they had taken 
heed of her concerns, maybe PRASA and …[indistinct] 
would not have lost the kind of money they lost, but 
obviously. 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that, that is quite important.  Well it’s, 
it’s, it may well be that it might be important to explore the 
possibility of calling her.  Because she might be able to tell 
the Commission much more in terms of … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely Chair.   
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 66 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were other issues that she raised in 
the discussions at board level.  And again of course Mr 
Montana should be coming in due course.  But Mr Buthelezi 
looks like would need to come as well.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct] or how, what he did or didn’t 
do in response to these concerns when we now know that 
Swifambo had not checked records.  And …[indistinct] deal 
with these matters.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, this is what I was going 
10 
to propose and that is just to expedite the outcome that 
you want.  There’s we sent, instead of sending a Rule 33 to 
her, because there is no implication in respect of her, is to 
send her a 10/6 Directive.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  To say we have these two emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  These are the concerns that appear to 
be raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Would you please prepare an affidavit 
by whatever date that deals with it, with the matters you 
have raised.  The reaction to these emails.  We don’t know 
if there was a reaction.  And as you have pointed out 
Chairperson what was the board’s approach.  And did you 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 67 of 163 
 
raise it at the board and what was the board’s ...  
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But slightly different.  But same 
thing, but slightly different approach.  Rather than saying 
will you tell us, I would say somebody must try and reach 
her over the phone and say, this is what emerges and we 
would like to you, would like an affidavit for you and we 
would like to prepare it for you.   
And have a zoom consultation.  You will tell us all 
that 
you 
can 
share 
with 
the 
Commission 
about 
the 
10 
concerns you had, that you raised, how did everybody 
respond to them?   
The discussions at board level and on the day that 
it was approved by the board, what were the discussions?  
I take it if we do not already have minutes of the board 
meetings at value when they approve … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should try and get there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as to see whether the whole thing just 
20 
was point of emotions or whether there was a serious and 
proper consideration of the, of the issues that she may 
have been there and she could know.   
So if she gives all the information she knows, then 
somebody within the legal team can prepare that affidavit 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 68 of 163 
 
then send.  It might be a matter of – within a week we 
might have … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An affidavit from her.  So ja, it is the 
same thing, just … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja, okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But what we now know based on 
those 
that 
certain 
persons 
at 
least 
aren’t 
claiming 
ignorance that they were not aware, they were not alerted 
10 
and in law Chairperson, is if you have a duty and you, you 
are asked to investigate and you don’t investigate, that’s a 
breach of the duty.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no.  These email are very critical.  
Or all those that – ja, they were directed to him and it may 
well be that in ordinary things, certain board meetings, she 
raised the same issues so everybody who was a board 
member knew what the issues were. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And, and therefore the net might 
spread wider in terms of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Implicated persons Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I mean one of the, one of the things 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 69 of 163 
 
that the Commission is going to, is looking at with regard 
to SOEs is where boards of SOE did not do their job, or 
what must be done, and was it a matter of incompetence or 
it be that the board or some members of the board were 
party to some agenda which was against the interests of 
the entity.   
But also its, it’s important because it may well be 
that I could consider that subject to issues of prescription 
and so one, and you know the entities should seal them.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct] whatever they can recover of 
the tax payer ’s money. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And also the Commission will have need 
to look at what qualities should people who get appointed 
as directors of these SOEs have.   
And because it must be people who have integrity 
and it must be people who are prepared to make decisions 
that are in the best interest of the entity and not other 
decisions.   
20 
I mean an obvious thing with regard to this is, when 
the board approved this, what information did they have 
before them which indicated that Swifambo was an entity 
that could be given this kind of contract. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 70 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did they know about this entity? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know you cannot just make a 
decision without doing, getting certain, certain amount of 
homework to be done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But clearly when it is not your money … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are supposed to look after the 
public, after public money.  So we have got to look at all 
10 
those things, because there ought to be some change in 
how things are done in these SOEs going forward.   
And this Commission is in a position to come up 
with recommendations to say, going forward these are the 
things that should take.  Then it is up to the President if 
…[indistinct] 
the 
recommendations 
or 
not, 
but 
the 
Commission has a duty to look at why certain things 
happened at SOEs and what should be done to make sure 
they don’t happen again.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now Mr Sacks we have dealt with 
your report and I know, and this was a long time ago now, 
you indicated what the purpose of the report was.  You 
handed this report and we’ve dealt with the issues that 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 71 of 163 
 
arise from it even if one does not know all the facts.   
What did you expect would happen next, after you 
had submitted the report?  And also you had make a 
presentation, what did you expect would happen next? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I think it goes without saying 
that I expected the investigation to continue for, it is, it is 
as simple as that.  Obtain information I required, be in a 
position to perform a second level of analysis required.   
Ultimately what the objective of concluding, forming 
an opinion and advising law enforcement to had engage me 
10 
on what my view, the report in itself speaks volumes as to 
what the findings were already.   
And I guess the remaining information would just 
confirmed further and pointed to other areas that needed to 
be, to investigate, or criminal proceedings to, to proceed. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  If you had been asked after the 
presentation or shortly after your report, or any time after 
your report, do you think any purpose is going to be served 
by continuing these investigations that you’ve largely, well 
not fulfilled, but you have started this process.  What 
20 
would have been your …[indistinct]? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, Advocate Soni my approach in 
performing the investigation? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no, no.  What would have been 
your reaction to a question of that nature?  In other words 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 72 of 163 
 
should this matter proceed?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Is it worth it in terms of money, time 
and possible outcome?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson I think the record, the reports or 
the information contained in the reports stands for its, on 
its own and that’s the investigation, I certainly should have 
proceeded.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now of course it didn’t and you were 
not even briefed on the Siyangena matter which was going 
10 
to be the next brief from the Hawks to you, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:  That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Either than that obviously is the 
question who should be held responsible for – you could 
see the outcome?  We see where PRASA – well I mean the 
PRASA the …[indistinct] contract is and the accrued losses 
that have been incurred.   
Plus the liquidator will come in after Mr Sacks to 
explain what the position is at the moment, but, but 
whatever the position is, from the position of good 
20 
governance somebody ought to be held responsible for not 
acquiring, not on the allowing, but the acquiring Mr Sacks 
to pursue to the logical conclusion, this investigation that 
he had stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have noted …[indistinct]. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 73 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now Mr Sacks, after you presented 
your report, you didn’t, you have not heard from the Hawks 
since? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now we, you have heard what I have 
indicated to the Chairperson should happen about that.  
I’m going to take you to something else.   
You have now been shown a report prepared by the 
liquidator of Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Rail.  Do 
you – a report to stakeholders dated the 18 t h of February 
10 
2020. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in asking you to prepare for the 
presentation of your evidence, I have indicated to you, I 
would like you to just consider having regard to the flow of 
funds that he sets out in comparing it to what yours are.   
What, what, or the general impression created by 
the flow of funds?  What, what is the difference in views if 
any? 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
Chairperson, 
the 
liquidator ’s 
report 
20 
corroborates the findings contained in my report with 
regards to the flow of funds.  As simple as that.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Not necessarily in every detail, 
because you didn’t have all the information.  Would the 
further 
information 
he 
has, 
it 
reinforces 
the, 
the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 74 of 163 
 
correctness of the conclusions that or the correctness of 
what you have set out in your report. 
MR SACKS:  That’s, that’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And all one would need to do is just 
add the, the further investigations that have been done 
since as a result of the powers that be.   
MR SACKS:  That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now but there is nothing in his report 
that raises concerns about the cogency of your … 
MR SACKS:  That’s correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now then can I ask you, I also said to 
you that after the liquidator had submitted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you proceed, let me just 
get this qualification Mr Sacks.  Is it correct to say when 
one looks at what one can call your findings in your report, 
one should limit one to the flow of funds section, because 
whatever came before that was just the background that 
would make the flow of fund, transaction understandable.  
Is that correct? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson you are correct.  I include as you 
20 
correctly state, I included all that background information, 
but my actual mandate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SACKS:  Was the flow of funds and that was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 75 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:  I guess the – as I detailed, that was my 
detailed findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And of course part of that is 
why I am raising that, is that you will remember yesterday 
we – I tried to establish what was preliminary and what was 
not preliminary in your report.   
And you, you did say the report was a draft 
preliminary report.  But you did say there are parts of the 
report which reflect your findings.  And I think what you are 
saying is that your findings are only those that relate to the 
10 
flow of funds.   
And I guess that because if the, if, if money did 
leave account A and went to account B, there’s not going to 
change as that is final.   
MR SACKS:  That’s correct.  That’s, that cannot ever be 
disputed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please.  Now sorry, before I 
deal finally with the report, I have been told that there is a 
report in the Swifambo application, which deals with a 
20 
comparison between what the tenderers, the different 
tenderers had tendered.  Are aware of that? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I, I am aware of that what was 
contained in that Popo Molefe affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in light of the fact that the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 76 of 163 
 
Chairman has indicated that is a matter that must be taken 
into account, I am going to ask that you look at the report 
and indicate in the supplementary affidavit precisely what 
is contained in that report to, as a comparator between 
what Swifambo was charging and what other tenderers 
were charging.   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson I will attend to that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The background to that Chairperson 
is, apparently it is, it is, it is said by Judge Francis that the 
tender if, if the specifications imposed by Mr Mthimkulu 
10 
had not been taken into account, another tenderer would 
have won.   
But apparently there is a report which sets out 
precisely what that is.  And we just don’t want to be talking 
without all the, all the relevant facts.  But it, it may also 
then raise further questions about the bona fides of the 
decision making.   
But that we will get Mr Sacks to, but I thought 
before he leaves, you ought to note Chairperson that that 
would be a further matter that he will address neither. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that’ fine.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now in his report, oh sorry.  
The liquidator filed his report to stakeholders on the 18 t h of 
February 2020.  Thereafter in July Mr Mashabo filed a 
thickened CM100 in each of – in respect of each of 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350

Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Rail.   
Now the – I just want to ask you if you’ve had an 
opportunity to look at the new CN10s – CN100s, sorry.    
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson I have.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I just want to – I know Mr 
Sacks 
is 
not 
the, 
the 
– 
was 
not 
the 
recipient 
of 
…[indistinct] but obviously when you see what the CM10 
deals with or some of the matters it deals with, it, it goes 
into some of the issues he has raised in his report.   
And I thought it is only fair that Mr Sacks be given 
10 
an opportunity and I see that and I accept that to the 
extent that Mr Mashaba says this, and it’s, it’s consistent 
with the bank accounts.   
I cannot have any difficulty with it, having regard to 
the fact that I didn’t have regard to – I didn’t have all the 
information that the police should have provided me with.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So I am going to ask you – sorry 
Chairperson, we are now dealing with Bundle E1 and it is 
EXHIBIT 
SS4. 
 
That’s 
the 
liquidator ’s 
report 
to 
20 
stakeholders.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we using red numbers here? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Red numbers on the right-hand side 
as you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes you may proceed.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 78 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 159 hey. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, page – I’m not going to – the 
liquidator will deal with the report.  It’s just those matters 
that concern Mr Sacks.  And they are dealt with starting at 
page 214.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  214.1. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I have got it.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I should just indicate by 
10 
way of background why that numbering is like that.  The 
liquidator when he filed his report, obviously didn’t have 
the 3M, the revised …[indistinct], the new CM10 – 100s.   
They were included after our consultation with the 
liquidator because we indicated to him the importance of 
tying up the two reports, the liquidator ’s report and 
…[indistinct].   
Now section, page 214.1 is the first page of the new 
CM100 in respect of Railpro Holdings.  You see that? 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Do you know why it’s now called 
Railpro Holdings? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson I am not familiar why Railpro 
Holding or I don’t know why it’s called Railpro Holdings.  
I’ll answer that question directly. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 79 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, you can take it for granted that 
refers to Swifambo, what was Swifambo Holdings.   
MR SACKS:  Yes, and I, I have seen that same back 
account as Swifambo Holdings. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  Okay.  But the name has been 
changed to Railpro Holdings. 
MR SACKS:  Yes, yes Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to that CM document, 
the CM100 the date of that document is the 6 t h of 
December 2018.   
10 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson on page 214.3.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right.  Then at 214.18 is a so-called 
replacement CM100. 
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now that was, that is dated and you’ll 
see it on page 214.20 that is dated the 13 t h of July. 
MR SACKS:  That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now it is this that – I don’t want to go 
too much into Railpro Holdings, but except in note 2 which 
appears at 214.35.  Sorry, can I just ask you in respect of 
20 
notes to CM are you familiar with that or would I or should 
I rather leave it? 
MR SACKS:  No, I’m not familiar with it.  Okay I will say to 
me in my view it is just additional information that is being 
provided.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 80 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But what is said there is at all material 
times, Holdings was a non-trading entity.  Two, at all 
material 
times 
Holdings 
permitted 
leasing 
to 
deposit 
amounts into its account on the basis where such amount 
where the property of Swifambo Rail Leasing and for 
reasons that are unclear, Holdings entered into contracts 
with certain service providers including its auditors on the 
basis and understanding that all liabilities therefore, all 
liabilities arising there from were payable by and or with the 
account of Leasing, and Holdings accordingly is entitled to 
10 
recovery from, I mean Leasing is entitled to, Holdings is 
entitled to recovery from Leasing.  
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is what, I just thought that I will 
tell you that that is the relationship that is now said to have 
existed between Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Leasing. 
MR SACKS:  Okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now for present purposes we need not 
go much further then to say that on page 214.38 the original 
CM100 in respect of Swifambo Rail Leasing was filed and 
20 
then if you look at page 214.56 the new CM100 in respect of 
Swifambo Rail Leasing was filed. 
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that is dated about the same time 
as the, the, the second CM100 in respect of Holdings.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 81 of 163 
 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I just so that we all know what we 
are looking at, I want to ask you if you could just please 
turn to note 1, which appears at 214.70.  Oh sorry, before 
you go there.  Can I just ask you to look at page 214.63 and 
214.64.  This lists the creditors of Leasing.  Would that be 
correct?  214.63.   
MR SACKS:  214.63 yes, because debts due to the 
company, so it is assets.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
10 
MR SACKS:  Debtors.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, the ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:  Debtors. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Debtors of leasing. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in respect of each of them, there 
is said to be a note.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I want you to look at page, at note 1 
which appears at page 214.70, because this deals with what 
20 
Mr Mashaba now says or is the basis on which Leasing has 
claims against the various debtors that are reflected in 
those pages I have referred you to, and if I could just 
quickly go through, I just want to ... he says on the 6 t h of 
December Oswald Mashaba purported to sign, purported to 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 82 of 163 
 
sign a CM100 statement of affairs and then in the second 
paragraph he says AM has been advanced by attorney 
Cameron that Oswald Mashaba has been advised by Mr 
Cameron a course to prepare a new statement in order to 
comply with the sections of 366 of the Company’s Act and 
he has engaged the previous auditors of leasing to perform 
a forensic audit and he says this is the outcome of the 
audit.  
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  Then can I ask you to go to 
10 
page 214.108.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat the page Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  214.108 Chairperson.  So if you could 
keep your finger on page 214.63 while we are looking at 
this, because you will see that note 19 refers to its claim or 
its alleged claim against PRASA and you will see that at the 
top of page 214.64.   
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now he says at paragraph 3, 
and remember you have indicated the amounts that Leasing 
20 
and Holdings have received from PRASA.  He has indicated 
the link between Leasing and Holding.  Now in paragraph 3 
he says: 
 
“Oswald Mashaba has been advised that the 
sum of a 109 million rand remains to be 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 83 of 163 
 
recovered by Leasing from PRASA and ought 
not to be offset against any claim that PRASA 
may have against Leasing.” 
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What is your reaction?  I mean it is not 
for you to, I am not asking you to comment but just looking 
at the flow of funds as you have outlined and as you say is 
more or less confirmed by the liquidators report on the 
same issue, what is your reaction to that?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, this is a claim regarding 
10 
payments that Mashaba said that Swifambo paid to Sibenza.  
Other than confirming the bank records of Swifambo in my 
analysis that Sibenza received 99 million rand.  Mashaba 
purports 
or 
claims 
to 
have 
provided 
supporting 
documentation 
for 
those 
payments. 
 
If 
you 
recall 
Chairperson, the contract between Swifambo and PRASA 
says the costs of shipping and falling is for the cost of 
PRASA.  So other than this paragraph 3 confirms that 
Swifambo made some payments to Sibenza that is claiming 
from PRASA.   
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But he goes further and he says 
PRASA must pay this before its claim against Swifambo can 
be determined.   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, based on what I see in my 
reports, these are Mashaba’s claims.  I do not know if 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 84 of 163 
 
credence could be given to his claims, based on his other 
claims contained in this document which I have read.  It is, I 
understand where counsel, what counsel is asking but it 
needs to be seen in context of the bigger picture.  I think 
simply put he is saying that, Mashaba is saying that well 
Swifambo made payments to Sibenza and those payments 
must be paid, Swifambo must be reimbursed by PRASA.  I 
am not sure on the legalities of whose claim supersedes 
whose, but that is how I read this document.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Maybe the liquidator because he is the 
10 
person who is looking after PRASA’s interests, will deal with 
that.   
MR SACKS:  Ultimately Chairperson, that is a point that you 
so put as to what was the, for 13 locomotives a 100 million 
rand.  How much money was PRASA paying to bring one 
locomotive into South Africa.  Here is, which was not 
available to me at the time before my analysis, here is 
internal documentation from Swifambo that talks to these 
payments and this would be a starting point for an 
investigation to say here is Sabena’s purported tax invoices 
20 
as provided by Mashaba in his affidavit.  That will be my 
first point of investigation.  Let us go analyse this 
documentation which myself, perhaps the liquidator has, 
which 
the 
liquidator 
would 
in 
the 
ordinary 
cause 
of 
assessing claims, this documentation would be investigated 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 85 of 163 
 
further.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then can I ask you to look at note 22, 
and keeping an eye on what 22 refers to, this refers to the 
claim of Mr Mabunda.  
MR SACKS:  On page 241.130? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And I am saying that is confirmed by 
the fact that at page 214.64 ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SACKS:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  He flags it as note 22.  
MR SACKS:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now what does he say about this 
claim?  Can you read that, Mr Mabunda’s claim please?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, what Mr Mashaba says about 
payments in the amount of 28.8 million rand that is reflected 
on the schedule on 214.64, sorry.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no, no that is page, it is 214.130. 
MR SACKS:  130.  So with reference to those payments, 
20 
Swifambo made or Mr Mashaba claims that Swifambo made 
payments of 28.8 million rand to Mr Mabunda and in 
Mashaba’s view on note 22 he stated: 
 
“Mr M Mabunda, although having offered advice 
and 
having 
made 
available 
consultancy 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 86 of 163 
 
services through a number of entities forming 
part of the S group, was never employed by 
Leasing and accordingly it is not understood 
apparent 
as 
to 
why 
he 
received 
various 
amounts and in aggregates in the amount in the 
excess of 20 million rand.  By virtue of the 
aforegoing it is contended that Mr MM being Mr 
Mabunda is indebted to leasing unless Mr 
Mabunda is able to furnish information and or 
documentation indicating the legal basis upon 
10 
which 
he 
received 
various 
amounts 
from 
Leasing.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now when you were identifying the 
entities from which Mr Mabunda had received money, the 
Swifambo entity, it is quite clear that all that money came 
from Swifambo entity, is that correct?   
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And those entities were effectively 
under the control of Mr Mashaba. 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, Mr Mashaba does not state, he 
20 
just gives a total amount, whereas in my report I detailed 
which payments make up the amounts that I categorize as a 
Mashaba payment, linked payment or Mabunda linked 
payment.  In this instance Mr Mashaba just throws the 
number out.  To answer counsel’s question, [indistinct 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 87 of 163 
 
00:13:06] nonsensical is Mr Mashaba claims to be the 
managing director of a company, now he is stating I do not 
understand why he received 28 million rand.  This makes no 
sense.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Although the companies that made 
those, I am the managing director of the companies that 
made them?   
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then can I ask you to look at note 25 
which appears at 214.133.  This is the payments made to Mr 
10 
Sibelo and other people and perhaps what I should ask you 
to look at, is page 214.135 which is the next page where he 
schedules these claims.  You see that?   
MR SACKS:  I see that Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I am just trying to present the context. 
MR SACKS:  Yes.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So if you could tell the Chairperson 
what he alleges this claim against these individuals is for?     
MR SACKS:  It, in summary ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no, no it is important that we know 
20 
what it means.   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I will start at the back and work 
my way, I will work my way back.  So on page 214.134 
Mashaba contends: 
“By virtue of the aforegoing the donations by 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 88 of 163 
 
Leasing for the benefit of the ANC never 
reached the ANC and MG being Maria Gomez 
and GS being George Shabeza have unlawfully 
received and retained the sum of 79.4 million 
rand 
and 
accordingly 
these 
amounts 
are 
refundable to Leasing.” 
So if we, in essence what Mr Mashaba is 
alleging, is that Leasing, Swifambo Rail Leasing made 
payments in the amount of as shown on page 214.135, 
made payments to or the schedule, he calls a schedule of 
10 
donations to ANC.  He lists payments paid to Nkosa Sabelo 
Incorporated, NCI, NCI paying into trust accounts of Noels 
and five payments to Similex which I am assuming he has 
not totalled it up on his schedule, which I am assuming 
adds up to 79.4 million rand, saying Swifambo made these 
payments, but there is no, there is no rational for these 
payments, even though it is his company and they must be 
recovered from the recipients being Maria Gomez and 
George Sabelo, an amount of 88 million rand.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  In the context of why he says these 
20 
payments were made, it is strictly speaking intimately 
connected with the award of the contract.  That is why I 
wanted you to read from paragraph 1.   
MR SACKS:  Okay, sorry.  Excuse me counsel, so I will read 
from paragraph 1, note 25: 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 89 of 163 
 
 
“Shortly 
after 
leasing 
was 
awarded, 
the 
locomotive tender by PRASA Mr Mashaba and 
Mr 
Mabunda 
were 
approached 
by 
two 
individuals who held themselves out to be 
fundraisers for the African National Congress, 
ANC.  The two persons referred to in one, were 
Mrs Maria Gomez who is MG, an attorney 
George 
Sabelo, 
at 
that 
stage 
a 
partner 
shareholder in a legal firm by the name of 
Nkosi Sabelo and it is GS, George Sabelo.” 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  If you could just stop there.  He says 
here that this was after the award of the tender, you 
remember that?  I mean you note that? 
MR SACKS:  Yes, I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I do not need to go to this, but 
you will recall that in his affidavit replying affidavit in the 
Swifambo matter, Mr Molefe had said that Mr Mabunda had 
approached Mr Mashaba and asked him to be the front of 
the tender that was, that still had not been issued.  You 
recall that?   
20 
MR SACKS:  I recall that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, okay.  I just wanted to make the 
point that this is inconsistent with what he said to Mr 
Molefe.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  I will carry on 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 90 of 163 
 
reading, paragraph 3 of page 214.133: 
 
“Under 
pressure 
from 
Gomez 
and 
Sabelo, 
Mashaba 
on 
behalf 
of 
leasing 
agreed 
to 
arrange for a donation to the ANC of an amount 
equal to 88 million rand and which would be 
dealt with as follows.  Mashaba would receive a 
handling fee in the region of eight million rand 
and the balance in the sum of 80 million rand 
will be paid as and when directed by Gomez 
and Sabelo.  At that stage it was indicated to 
10 
Mashaba that a company owned by Sabelo, 
being 
similar 
to 
Pty 
Ltd 
would 
generate 
invoices 
to 
Leasing. 
 
Arising 
from 
the 
aforegoing, payments were effected to Gomez 
and Sabelo and in aggregate the amounts of 
79.4 million rand as indicated in the schedule 
which is annexed hereto as Annexure A.  At the 
Section 417 inquiry Sabelo testified that he has 
never been paid a fundraiser for ANC, and the 
only part that he and MS played in Leasing was 
20 
to collect amounts invoiced by Similex to 
Leasing and where after he dispersed amount 
received, presumably into the trust account of 
MS as directed by Maria Gomez.  By virtue of 
the aforegoing, the donations by Leasing to the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 91 of 163 
 
benefit of the ANC never reached the ANC and 
Gomez and Sabelo have unlawfully received 
and retained the sum of 79.4 million rand, and 
accordingly these amounts are refundable to 
Leasing.”   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is his claim now in respect of all 
those amounts, because you will see that the amounts paid 
we know Nkosi Sabelo and Similex are all included in this 
total amount.   
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just one thing I thought may be worth 
pointing out, and that he had agreed to pay 80 million rand, 
this is Mr Mashaba, but he was going to charge a handling 
fee.  If you look at paragraph 3.  
MR SACKS:  Yes, I see that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And so the amount that was going to 
go to the ANC was 80 million rand.  His handling fee was 
going to be eight million rand.  Do you know where that 
eight million rand was going to come from?   
MR SACKS:  The eight million rand came from PRASA, 
20 
Chairperson.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then can I ask you to please look at 
note 32 on page 214.149.  Now this here refers to if you go 
back, you do not need to but it refers to the payment made 
to the S group or Mr Mabunda by Swifambo, I mean by 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 92 of 163 
 
Vossloh.  It is the 75 million rand we were talking about. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What does he say about that? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, if I may read from this page, that 
214.149, note 32.  Paragraph 1: 
 
“Subsequent 
to 
leasing 
concluding 
a 
subcontract agreement with Vossloh for the 
sale 
of 
70 
locomotives, 
and 
without 
the 
knowledge of Leasing and its consent, Vossloh 
paid to Mr Mabunda S Group an amount of 
10 
approximately 75 million rand.  It is Mashaba’s 
contention that this amount should have been 
paid by Vossloh to Leasing as some form of 
rebate and according to Leasing liquidators 
need to recover this amount from Mabunda, the 
S group. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So this money he now wants the 
liquidators to recover from Mabunda as he wanted the 
earlier amount that Swifambo had paid to Mr Mabunda. 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, in my mind, this is Mashaba’s 
20 
contention, his view but the audit confirms to me that 
Mabunda received the 75 million rand.  The commercial 
rational as Mashaba is talking over here, or I do not know.  
Any conclusion can be drawn.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But does that no reinforce the point 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 93 of 163 
 
you made much earlier that there did not seem to be any 
commercial rational for many of these funds.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, and then the final one I want 
you to look at is note 33 at page 214.150.  Now this you will 
see are payments, if you look at page 214.65 this relates to 
payments made to the Siyaya group. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what does he say about that?   
MR SACKS:  Read from page 214.150, note 33: 
10 
 
“From time to time Siyaya Consulting Engineers 
was 
paid 
amounts 
totalling 
R7 243 773-00.  
See Annexure A hereto.  Mashaba bears no 
knowledge 
as 
to 
the 
reasons 
for 
these 
payments and accordingly disputes that Siyaya 
was entitled to these amounts.  The only 
documents that have been located in regard to 
the alleged services rendered by Siyaya to 
Leasing are annexed hereto.  In regard to the 
alleged scope of work detailed in Annexure B4, 
20 
Mashaba disputes that the consulting services 
indicated 
therein, 
were 
ever 
rendered 
by 
Siyaya 
to 
Leasing 
and 
accordingly 
the 
liquidators of Siyaya one of them is Mula who 
is a co-liquidator of Leasing should be called 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 94 of 163 
 
upon to investigate whether his services were 
rendered by Siyaya to Leasing.  In addition to 
the aforegoing, the Leasing liquidators should 
lodge a claim against the insolvency estate of 
Siyaya.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The Siyaya too is under liquidation or 
has already been liquidated.  
MR SACKS:  I have been informed of that Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Well, he is talking about the 
insolvency. 
10 
MR SACKS:  Yes, yes sorry Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So what is quite clear from these, the 
main payments that were made to Mr Mabunda and his 
company, either by Swifambo or by Vossloh, he is, Mr 
Mashaba is saying, must be recovered from Mr Mabunda.  
MR SACKS:  That is what Mashaba is claiming Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And he is also saying that the money 
that was paid purportedly for the benefit of the ANC which 
did not receive the benefit according to him, must be 
claimed back from those whom he gave the money to, 
20 
because he believes it was for the ANC.  
MR SACKS:  I agree with that contention Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And again, come back to your report.  
As you were going through your report you said but it does 
not look like they did anything in respect of the contract 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 95 of 163 
 
that we see, the contract that PRASA or the locomotive 
contract, ja and in respect of what he says now these are, 
what is your, how do you feel about what you have said 
earlier?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, Mashaba confirms that all these 
amounts dispersed by Swifambo were of no benefit at the 
very least to Swifambo had no purpose.  He is even 
claiming that he will be paid back, even though he was the 
one I would imagine as the managing director, if not made 
the payment, approved the payment but in summary these 
10 
payments have no commercial rational.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I see it is one o’clock.  I, 
that is those are the issues I wanted to raise with Mr Sacks.  
I do not know whether we, you have any issues that you 
want to raise with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I wanted to make sure that if 
possible, we adjourn for lunch only when you are done with 
him.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes, I am done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are done, ja.  Thank you very much 
20 
Mr Sacks for coming to assist the Commission.  Should the 
need arise we will ask you to come back, but we hope that 
or you will, you may have to come back because you have 
some homework to do for us.  So but some of the homework 
maybe might be supplementary after this is filed with the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 96 of 163 
 
Commission without the need for you to come back for oral 
evidence, but I have no doubt that we have, if we do need 
you, you will avail yourself.  
MR SACKS:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for assisting us.  
MR SACKS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
We 
are 
going 
to 
take 
the 
lunch 
adjournment then and then we will resume at five past two.

EXAMINATION BY ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Muller, you are 
one of the two joint liquidators that have been appointed to 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 98 of 163 
 
deal with the estate of Swifambo Holdings and...  Oh, 
sorry.  Swifambo Rail and Swifambo Holdings, now known 
as... 
MR MULLER:   Yes, in Swifambo Rail Leasing, we are 
three liquidators.  It is Aviwe Ndyamara, Professor Mandla 
Matlala and myself.  And in Railpro Holdings it is Mr Timco 
and Aviwe Ndyamara. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  But you are one of the 
liquidators involved? 
MR MULLER:   I have been appointed.  I have been 
10 
handling the administration. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And in regard to both these entities, 
although you have co-liquidators, you have – what is the 
state of your knowledge in regard to the investigations 
where you are at the moment and the reports that have 
been prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you answer, face this side Mr Muller. 
MR MULLER:   Yes.  Commissioner, I have been intimately 
involved with the day to day administration in both entities. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you prepared a report dated the 
20 
18 t h 
of 
February 
2020. 
 
It 
is 
headed: 
 
Re[ort 
to 
Stakeholders.  Is that correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Mr Commissioner. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, that report appears at 
Bundle 3.1, SS-4, PRASA reference 160 – starting at page 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 99 of 163 
 
161 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  What is the page? 161? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is starts at 161.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   161, that is where it starts? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now Mr Muller, you – have a look at 
the document that starts at page 150 – well, 161 of Bundle 
3.  Is that the report you prepared? 
MR MULLER:   That is the report. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that report ends, the report itself 
ends at page 171. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And whose signature is that there 
which signs on behalf of the joint liquidators? 
MR MULLER:   Oh, that is my signature.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you can confirm that what is 
contained in this report is true and correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is so. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now Mr Sacks, and you must be 
20 
aware of it because you have been – you came in 
yesterday as well and you came in earlier today, not while 
he was testifying but you are aware. 
MR MULLER:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He is a Forensic Investigator who did 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 100 of 163 
 
investigations into the affairs of Swifambo but that was 
before it was liquidated.  Are you aware of that? 
MR MULLER:   I am aware of that, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now can I ask you.  Did you see his 
report, the reports that he presented to the Commission? 
MR MULLER:   No, I have not seen it.  It only came to my 
knowledge very recently. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I mean, you are aware of the 
report? 
MR MULLER:   I am aware of it, yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Are you aware of the general 
conclusions that he talked...? 
MR MULLER:   I am aware of the general... 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I raise that with you Mr Muller in 
this context.  Mr Sacks told the Chairperson that in 2017, 
he prepared that report.  He made a presentation to the 
Hawks on that report.  And he left the report with them on 
the understanding that they would come back and assist 
him to finalise the report.   
I am just putting that, the context.  He says...  
20 
Sorry, just to indicate to the Chairperson verbally that you 
understand that ...[intervenes] 
MR MULLER:   Yes, I understand. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now he says in addition, that from 
the time he presented his report in 2017 up to now, a 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 101 of 163 
 
period of maybe four years, the Hawks never came back to 
him.   
MR MULLER:   [microphone not switched on.] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is his evidence, okay?  I am just 
placing 
that 
on 
record. 
 
Now 
as 
I 
understand 
it.  
Mr Mashaba in a 10.6 – or in an affidavit that he submitted 
to the Commission, having been directed to do so in terms 
of 10.6 Directive, indicated that you had laid charges 
against him.  Is that correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now when were those charges laid? 
MR MULLER:   In May 2020. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And could you just indicate to the 
please that:  Look, I believe Mr Mashaba should be 
charged with the following offences?  Or, did you give them 
a set of documents that justified why he should be 
charged? 
MR MULLER:   ...background, it was a comprehensive 
report and all the figures were detailed in that report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As I understand it, that report was 
20 
your affidavit and annexed to that were a series of 
supporting documents confirming what – confirming why, in 
your view, he should be charged. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And who had prepared that 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 102 of 163 
 
Chairperson?  I mean, Mr Muller. 
MR MULLER:   I was assisted by senior counsel, Mr Jaap 
Cilliers who prepared the charge. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now that you say was in May 2020. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   About eight months ago. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I ask you?  Have you heard 
anything from...  Oh, sorry.  When did you lay the charge? 
MR MULLER:   It was the Hawks in Pretoria at their 
10 
offices. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Have you heard from them since? 
MR MULLER:   Yes, we had a follow-up.  After the charge 
was made, we had a follow-up meeting.  I cannot recall the 
date and then early December, I visited their offices again 
and where the – I had to sign an affidavit, containing all 
the evidence and all the information I gave them in May. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I am not understanding you.  You 
gave them an affidavit with supporting documents. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In support of why Mr Mashaba should 
be charged. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But as I – was it only Mr Mashaba or 
did you ask for other individuals as well? 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 103 of 163 
 
MR MULLER:   Yes-no, there were other individuals 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It does not matter.  I am just... 
MR MULLER:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But you... Now, you then say you had 
a meeting with them.  How did that meeting come about? 
MR MULLER:   Chair, it was just a follow-up meeting to get 
more information.  I was assisted by my senior counsel, 
just to give them a more comprehensive background. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Who asked for that meeting? 
10 
MR MULLER:   It was on the request of the Hawks. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of the Hawks? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They wanted more information from 
you? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Did you give them that information? 
MR MULLER:   Yes, we did. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you say there was a 
meeting in December. 
20 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What happened in December? 
MR MULLER:   In December...  I think throughout they had 
consultations 
with 
the 
forensic 
investigator 
that 
we 
appointed which was not Mr Sacks.  And they compiled a 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 104 of 163 
 
comprehensive affidavit which I then signed mid-December. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  And since then, what has 
happened? 
MR MULLER:   I have not heard from them since. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you sign one affidavit in December 
or did you sign two? 
MR MULLER:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I understood you earlier on that one, you 
lodged the complaint with the Hawks in May 2020.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the Hawks initiated a meeting 
that 
they 
wanted 
more 
information 
and 
this 
was 
in 
December. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you have told me that the 
Hawks were contact with the forensic investigator that you 
had used and the comprehensive affidavit was prepared.  I 
think you say in mid-December if I am not mistaken. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct.  The last affidavit I signed 
20 
was in December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So I just want to find out whether it 
is one affidavit that you signed in connection with this 
matter in December or is two affidavits in December? 
MR MULLER:   No, it is only one affidavit, yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 105 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is only one? 
MR MULLER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that affidavit, the Hawks 
assisted in compiling. 
MR MULLER:   Yes, they used all the information that was 
given to us to... 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Has anybody from the National 
Prosecuting Authority contacted you in relation to your 
complaint or your complaints? 
10 
MR MULLER:   Not, as far as I can recall, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, no, no.  Either they did or they 
did not. 
MR MULLER:   No, they did not. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
between 
May 
2020 
and 
December 2020 
when 
the 
Hawks 
asked 
for 
more 
information, had you been informed who at the Hawks 
would be responsible for investigating the matter? 
MR 
MULLER: 
 
 
We 
have 
dealt 
throughout 
with 
Colonel Trollip.  There was regular communication from our 
20 
and from his side to get more information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MULLER:   And then the affidavit I signed was with 
Captain Simon(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in terms of who the – who was 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 106 of 163 
 
in charge of the docket as well as the investigation, were 
you told, do you know, between May 2020 and December? 
MR MULLER:   The person I communicated with was mostly 
with Colonel Trollip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Trollip? 
MR MULLER:   Trollip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  You understood him to be the 
investigating officer or not necessarily? 
MR MULLER:   That was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He conducted the ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MULLER:   The communication we had was with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But you cannot identify the person 
who was an overall control of the investigation from the 
Hawks in Pretoria? 
MR MULLER:   No, I cannot. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you said that in December, they 
compiled a second affidavit which included matters that 
had been looked at by a forensic investigator that the 
liquidators have appointed.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in regard to the commissioning 
of a forensic investigator.  How did that come about? 
MR MULLER:   We had to - in our investigation we found 
that as a liquidator you are only have, you know, limited 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 107 of 163 
 
resources and you have access to documentation but to 
have that, somebody had to go through it in detail.  Also 
create the flow of funds for us to have a condensed version 
on which we can make decisions going forward. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you have indicated to me and I 
am just placing it on record so we know what concerns you 
have.  That at present, and it has been ongoing for some 
time 
now. 
 There 
is 
ongoing 
litigation 
between 
the 
liquidators and Mr Mashaba and other persons invested in 
the Swifambo liquidation. 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
One 
of 
those 
persons 
is 
Mr Landgrebe. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He is an auditor for, I think, 
Swifambo Rail. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now as a result – and I understand 
there was going to be an inquiry today in relation to the 
Swifambo matter. 
20 
MR MULLER:   Inquiries has been ongoing in the – we 
have had various, several inquiries in this matter. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   One – but one of the hearings was 
today. 
MR MULLER:   There was a hearing this morning, yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 108 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   One of the matters that were raised 
is that you – that liquidator should accuse them. 
MR MULLER:   No, it was asked that the Commissioner in 
terms of Section ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry the Commissioner. 
MR MULLER:   Act...  Ja ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry.  I am ...[intervenes]  
MR MULLER:   ...before the Commission can refuse it. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But in separate applications, 
10 
Mr Mashaba has also asked that you be – your firm be 
removed as the liquidator. 
MR MULLER:   Ja.  I am appointed in my personal capacity 
but he has asked us for the removal of... 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So you have indicated to me that, 
having regard to the ambit on matters that I should ask you 
questions, you would prefer that I stick mainly to the 
report. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is just as though not to give fuel 
20 
to either the civil litigation or give them fuel to fight you in 
regard to the civil litigation or in regard to challenging your 
authority and other matters relating to the liquidation itself. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Now I am going to do that and 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 109 of 163 
 
I have given you and your counsel that assurance.  I want 
to concentrate mainly on the main findings you made in 
regard to who were the beneficiaries of the funds flowing 
from Swifambo. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I will just tell you, and I have 
already indicated to you that what I found intriguing about 
this matter is.  When the liquidation application – and it 
was Swifambo which brought the application to liquidate 
itself about the Swifambo entities.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR MULLER:   It was a voluntarily liquidation by way of a 
resolution. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  And Mr Mashaba on that 
occasion signed a CM 100 in regard to both Swifambo Rail 
and Swifambo Holdings. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You then submitted this report on the 
18 t h of February 2020. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You have since received a new CM 
20 
100 in respect Swifambo Rail and a new CM 100 in respect 
of Swifambo Holdings.  Is that correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now just to get one small matter out 
of the way.  We talk about Swifambo Holdings but it is now 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 110 of 163 
 
called Railpro Holdings.  Is that not... 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So when the documents in the CM 
100’s and so on, are referred to the entities, they – the 
matter in regard to what was Swifambo Holdings is now 
Railpro Holdings.  And the matter in regard to Swifambo 
Rail is still Swifambo Rail. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now just to get another matter out of 
the way quite quickly.  If you look at page 16...  Oh, page 
10 
167 in the bundle in which your report is contained, the 
one on the right-hand side.  You will see...  Well 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say one, six, seven? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   One, six, seven.  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, you may continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chair.  Now if you look 
at page 167.  It is a continuation of what was started on 
page 166 which deals with the legal proceedings.  And then 
the second set of items you record there is the inquiry.  
20 
And you itemise the dates on which the inquiry took place.  
What inquiry was that? 
MR MULLER:   That is an inquiry in terms of Section 41.  It 
is a secret inquiry in terms of Section 417 and 418 of the 
Companies Act into the affairs of Swifambo Rail Leasing 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 111 of 163 
 
and Railpro. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I see that, if you look here, 
there 
were 
several 
people 
called 
whose 
names 
are 
mentioned as people who received money from Swifambo.  
One of them is Mr Mashaba.  The other is Mr Sabelo.  The 
other is Mr Mabunda.  And towards the bottom is T Makonzi 
Mashele. 
 
On 
the 
24 t h, 
the 
second 
name 
on 
the 
24 t h of February 2020. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When in regard to the level or lack of 
10 
cooperation, will you just tell us what was Mr Mashaba’s 
attitude in regard to cooperating at the inquiry? 
MR MULLER:   We did not receive no cooperation from 
Mr Mashaba at all.  He appeared once.  The second time, 
he came with senior counsel and insisted on a Shangaan 
translator.  And then the third time he came was with his 
current attorney where he state that he did not recognise 
the proceedings and he did not recognise – you know, he 
was not prepared to... 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, everybody I suppose has an 
20 
opportunity to make their own law Chairperson.  [laughs]  
They recognise what they want.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We are smiling because that is 
exactly ...[intervenes]  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 112 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like it does that with recognising 
and then the recognition gets withdrawn later on because 
with the Commission too he received Regulation 10.6 
Directive.  He complied and filed an affidavit.  But it was 
only after he had received a summons that he seized to 
recognise processes coming from the Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now also, you point out that then – 
then Wheels Solution is under liquidation. 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   or has been liquidated. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Then at 6.8, you say that 
you have brought an application to confirm jurisdiction 
against Ms Gomes.  This is Maria Gomes.  Would that be 
correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what was the purpose -or what 
did you want jurisdiction in respect of her to be confirmed 
20 
for? 
MR MULLER:   To actually was – she is a debtor of 
Swifambo for money she received and we confirmed that 
the jurisdiction to attach her house. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
And 
you 
put 
a 
figure 
of 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 113 of 163 
 
R 40 140 000,00 on that.  
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Is that what the house is valued at? 
MR MULLER:   No, I do not know what the house is valued.  
I think it is in the region of R 12 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, I see.  So but your claim against 
her is for R 40 million? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  And you needed jurisdiction 
confirmed against her because she is a non-South African.  
10 
She is Peregrine’s in terms of law. 
MR MULLER:   That is how I understand it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  So I have got out of the 
issues that in a sense of peripheral to the matters, I want 
to ask you about Mr Muller.  And if I can ask you to look at 
paragraph 5 on page 162 of the bundle? 
MR MULLER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you say from the information 
obtained a flow of funds can be summarised as follows, at 
paragraph 5.  Do you see that? 
20 
MR MULLER:   Yes, I see. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I just want to ask you.  Is that 
after the forensic investigator whom you appointed had 
done a forensic investigation of the flow of funds? 
MR MULLER:   I think this was – the flow of funds, the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 114 of 163 
 
basic flow of funds was done by our legal team and myself. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And when he did his investigation, 
did he confirm ...[intervenes]  
MR MULLER:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...to a large extent what was 
contained ...[intervenes]  
MR MULLER:   The figures as contained in the report 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MULLER:   ...has been confirmed, yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So I ask Mr Sacks, having – he 
having done his own flow of funds investigation and he 
says he came to more or less the same conclusion as you 
do in your report or you came to the same conclusion as he 
did.  And I just say this because his report is the earlier of 
all the reports. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in regard to the forensic 
investigator. 
 
Were 
you 
aware 
at 
the 
time 
you 
commissioned the forensic investigator that the Hawks had 
20 
asked Mr Sacks to compile a report for them based on a 
criminal complaint laid against individuals connected with 
Swifambo. 
MR MULLER:   I was not aware of it at all.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And between the time you hired the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 115 of 163 
 
forensic investigator and the time he produced his report, 
what was the time period? 
MR MULLER:   It must close on a year or going for a year. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I do not want to know figures 
because it is not right to air in this public, you performing 
a public function.  Was it a report that cost a fair amount of 
money? 
MR MULLER:   It cost a lot of money because all the 
detail.  We would have saved a lot of time if we had known 
about the Sacks report.  That would have been a very quick 
10 
basis for what we were after.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And at the time, you handed your 
affidavit to the Hawks and thereafter, they asked you to 
include 
what 
was 
contained 
in 
what 
the 
forensic 
investigator had found or to include aspects of that.  Did 
they tell you that:  Look, but we do a forensic report here. 
MR MULLER:   No, Chair I was not told at all.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  So those are all the 
preliminary matters...  Can I just ask you?  As far as now 
the monies – 5.1.1, you record that there are – it is the two 
20 
entities that is Railpro Holdings and we know that is 
Swifambo Holdings.  And Swifambo Rail Leasing received 
different amounts of money.   
More or less, when you looked at Railpro, that is 
Swifambo Holdings, how much did they receive if you just 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 116 of 163 
 
sort of add up those two figures? 
MR MULLER:   That is just over R 900 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And there is no need to emphasise 
this point and there is no need to ask you.  The first 
amount was received on the 5 t h of April 2013. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That was received by Holdings. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the first amount received by 
Leasing was the 6 t h of December 2013. 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You are looking at about eight 
months later.  Now can I just say to you, and I do not know 
if it makes a difference to you but the contract between 
Swifambo and PRASA said that all payments must be made 
through Leasing, not to Holding.  It did not say must not be 
made to Holdings but in terms of the contract all payments 
were to made to Swifambo Leasing.  Were you aware of 
that? 
MR MULLER:   I was aware of that, yes. Vossloh  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And so when you look at it from point 
of view of a liquidator and I know this time it will not make 
a difference but what – would that raise any concerns that 
a R3.5 billion contract requires payment to be made to 
entity A and the very first payment is made to entity B, it 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 117 of 163 
 
may be a related entity.  Will that raise concerns for you? 
MR MULLER:   Yes, that will raise concerns. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what is the nature of those 
concerns? 
MR MULLER:   The entity that was paid was not a party to 
the contract, so yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I mean, you cannot draw a link 
between the contract and the payment. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then you deal at 5.2.2 with the 
10 
payments made by these two entities. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now we have been through with Mr 
Sacks the payments made by the entities and who were the 
beneficiaries of those payments.  I do not want to go 
through all of them.  Can I just ask you, when you look at 
the first name that appears under the payments list as 
5.2.2.1, who is that? 
MR MULLER:   It is Mr Landgrebe, he is the auditor of both 
these companies. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what was the amount he was 
paid? 
MR MULLER:   R30 554 000. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And this he was paid by Holdings? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, that is how I… 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 118 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then there is a payment to Mr 
Mashaba.  How much is that? 
MR MULLER:   1,68 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then there you say there are 
various entities controlled by Mr Mashaba. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now the total of R146 375 880.16, 
does that include all the payments made by Holdings 
including those to Mr Landgrebe and Mr Mashaba? 
MR MULLER:   Those are all the payments as per point 
10 
5.2.2, that would include Mr Landgrebe, Mashaba, Right 
Wave Aim Investments.  Yes, that would include. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then on the next page, Holdings – 
you record that Holdings made a payment to Mr Makhensa 
Mabunda.  How much was that payment – how much was 
paid to him in that regard? 
MR MULLER:   22,664 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then were four entities under the 
control of Mabunda, as you describe it, and the payment, I 
take it, the total reflects the payment to Mr Mabunda and 
20 
companies under his control. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So Holding made payments of 63-odd 
million – or more than R63 million to Mr Mabunda and his 
entity. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 119 of 163 
 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then the next one you deal with that I 
am interested in is Musa Capital.  Do you know where 
Musa Capital fits into? 
MR MULLER:   Really, I have not been able to establish 
that, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  As I understood Mr Sacks’ 
evidence it was one of the directors of Swifambo – I am not 
sure it is Holdings – I think it from Swifambo Leasing who – 
her name is Cynthia Parish who was Musa Capital. 
10 
MR MULLER:   As far as I – yes, it was Mrs Cynthia Parish 
and a Mr Jameson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, he is the present director, as I 
understand it. 
MR MULLER:   It think they are both American citizens. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Thereafter you deal with payments 
made under 5.2.8.  Will you tell the Chairperson what those 
are and who the recipients were? 
MR MULLER:   Those were payments made to Similex, 
which is Mrs Gomes’ company and they were paid to Nkosi 
20 
Sebela Incorporated, 31 million, and to Noels Hussain, 
10.4 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that R41 400 000 that you – that 
is your claim against Mrs Gomes. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 120 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I mean, that is the basis on which you 
said you were required to find jurisdiction. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then at 5.2.9 there is an entity 
reflected there which received R500 000.  What is the 
name of that entity? 
MR MULLER:   It is Sanco, sir. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Have you investigated what that entity 
is? 
MR MULLER:   No, we have not. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then there are other recipients of 
money from Holdings and they do not feature in anything 
that we have looked at or Mr Sacks thought was unusual, 
though he is not saying the payments were justified. 
MR MULLER:   Ja, it does require further investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Right, thereafter at 5.2.3 you deal 
with payments made from Swifambo Rail Leasing.  So this 
is now Leasing.    
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We are going to identify the 
20 
payments.  The first person you I identify there is Mr 
Mabunda and that would mean in his personal capacity, 
what amount would he have received? 
MR MULLER:   1,23 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay and then there were entities 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 121 of 163 
 
under his control which received monies, is that correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now we have come across some of 
these companies but the one that I am interested in is the 
one that is listed last and that is 5.2.3.2.6 and that is 
Sterling Living.  Do you see that? 
MR MULLER:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now, Mr Muller, I just want to say that 
you have presented us with an update to your report, is 
that correct? 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairman. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  May I have leave to hand up – it is 
not a very – it just effectively says this is what happened 
since February last year in relation to this, it does not 
chance the picture but the reason it is important in regard 
to this question is reflected in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Perhaps – sorry, before I do anything 
with this, these notes, as you call them, were compiled by 
yourself, Mr Muller? 
20 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, together with the input from 
my legal team. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But I mean you take responsibility for 
them. 
MR MULLER:   Yes, I do. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 122 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now you confirm their correctness to 
the extent that you have been able to investigate and so 
on. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I am just wondering – 
because it is directly concerned with the report itself 
whether we should not include it as an annexure to the 
report at the end of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think we can include as an 
annexure to the report but I think what you mean is put it 
10 
immediately after the report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Immediately and call it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would still be a standalone document. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it will be immediately after the 
report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then it will be headed Notes on 
Matters Raised in the Report. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please, Chairperson.  And if 
you take the numbers, 171.1 to 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to the issue of Sterling 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 123 of 163 
 
Livings, you refer to this matter on the last page of the 
notes, Mr Muller, and it is at note 3.  You do not have to 
read there but will you just tell the Chairperson why this is 
significant, that this amount was paid, what it was paid for 
and how you came to know that it is connected with Mr 
Mabunda? 
MR MULLER:   Sterlings Living, when we instituted action 
against Mr Mabunda, Sterlings Living informed us that they 
concluded various agreements with Mr Mabunda in his 
personal capacity.  So it was paid from Swifambo but 
10 
Sterlings Living, this payment was made for kitchen 
cupboards in a house which we later established was 
registered, a notarial deed of extension of a lease term in 
November 2014. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The amount reflected here is R5 
million. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now correctly or not, Sterling Livings 
justify …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni, I thought I heard 
20 
where you were but I think – I thought you went to page 3 
of the notes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, it is still page 5, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 5 of the notes? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, of the notes, yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 124 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is where note 3 is dealing with 
Sterling Living. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, I must also clarify, you said the 
first page of these notes would be 171.1? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  171.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then it goes on. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And this will be 171.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright, so you are on the last 
page. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  So effectively for the record, 
171.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Let me just get that one.  So the 
property you were talking about is – I think you might have 
to just go back to that question about I think the property 
and 5 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So you were saying, Mr Muller, that 
you uncovered this payment quite by accident because you 
had made a claim against Mr Mabunda and then it emerged 
that this payment which had been made by Swifambo had 
20 
been made in respect of kitchen cupboards to his house in 
Waterfall, Equestrian Estate in Midrand, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me start - start by identifying the 
payment you are asking him about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh, sorry. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 125 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which payment? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, Chairperson, if one goes back 
to the report itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Report, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is at page 163 and it is a payment 
that is reflected as 5.2.3.2.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   5.2.3.6? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, .2.6 Chairperson.  These are 
entities under control of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   5.2…? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  .3.2.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know when you have got so many 
things they got confusing.  I have got 5.2 and then I have 
got …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  At page 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh what is the page number of the 
bundle first, to make sure I am … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  163. 
CHAIRPERSON:   163? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  163, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, right and the …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you will see it is 5.2.3 as the 
big number and it says Payment from Swifambo Leasing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can that, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is to Mr Mabunda.  Then in the 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 126 of 163 
 
second set of entities it is the last entity, Sterlings Living. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is – I thought that is the last 
one on the first set of …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright, but that is the one you 
are talking about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is the one we are talking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is a payment of R5 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paid from Swifambo Rail Leasing to 
10 
Sterlings Living. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, now I know which payment 
you are asking about, then you can continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Now you then try to identify 
what this payment was for because it had been made by Mr 
Swifambo (sic), would that be correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And it is in pursuance of that inquiry 
that you found out what the R5 million payment to Sterling 
20 
Livings was for. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what did you uncover? 
MR MULLER:   This payment was made for kitchen 
cupboards of the property of Mr Mabunda in Waterfall 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 127 of 163 
 
Equestrian Estate in Midrand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So I was a bit kind, Chairperson, 
when I said it was for the kitchen, it was just, as I 
understand it, for the cupboards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Ja, no, no.  Yesterday I think 
we understood that it was for the kitchen. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is what I thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So even more… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now can I just ask you, in regard to – 
and it is Sterling Livings confirm that that is what Mr – 
well, that is what they had charged and had been paid for 
in respect of those cupboards. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to that house, did you 
make any enquiries?  I know it is a trust but did you make 
any enquiries? 
MR MULLER:   Yes, we did, Chairperson.  We noticed that 
20 
Mr Mabunda and his wife Cindy Mabunda registered a 
notarial bond of extension of a lease term on 13 November 
2014 in terms of the property.  On the same day a notarial 
deed of cession of the lease was also – wherein the lease 
was ceded to the Makhensa Family Trust. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 128 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And have you been able to ascertain 
what the value of that house is or what the cost was? 
MR MULLER:   No, we have heard numbers but there is 
nothing I can confirm on the numbers.  The numbers we 
heard was R75 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The house, the property itself, is it 
owned by Mr Mabunda or by an entity controlled by him or 
is it a rented house? 
MR MULLER:   Chairperson, no, as I understand it, it is a 
99 year lease. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But in whose name – okay, so it looks 
like the lease in the name of the Makhensa Family Trust 
but who is the owner of the property? 
MR MULLER:   I do not know. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But what you do know is that the 
trust has a 99 year lease over that property. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I assume that that means you have not 
seen the actual lease because otherwise you would know 
20 
who the lessor is. 
MR MULLER:   I will have to get the advice from my 
counsel on that, I personally have not seen that lease, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, now the total amount that 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 129 of 163 
 
were paid by Swifambo Leasing to Mr Mabunda and his 
entities is how much, Mr Muller? 
MR MULLER:   R17,552 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Soni, I am trying to make sure 
we are on the same page. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Page 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is that reflected, is it still 163? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then you deal with the payments that 
10 
were made to entities controlled by Mr Mashaba, is that 
correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And there you list five entities.  What 
is the amount paid to them – that figure, Chairperson, it is 
right at the bottom of page 163. 
MR MULLER:   That is 22,7 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then on the following page, page 
164, who is the beneficiary of the first amount reflected on 
that page? 
20 
MR MULLER:   Mr Chairman, it is the Jacob Zuma 
Foundation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And to what extent did it benefit? 
MR MULLER:   R150 000. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you say these two sets of 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 130 of 163 
 
payments need to be investigated further and they amount 
to about R727 000. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right.  Then you say payments made 
to AMCE.  Now what is AMCE? 
MR MULLER:   It is AM Consulting Engineers, one of Mr 
Mashaba’s companies. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So these were payments that that 
entity made to different people. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And let us look at the bigger figures 
there, who is the first major beneficiary? 
MR MULLER:   It is Mr Landgrebe. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what is the amount of the benefit 
he received from AMCE? 
MR MULLER:   55 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I just want to look at – if I can 
ask you, and I am sorry to do this, Chairperson, but there 
is no other way to do it, to go back to page 162.  Now 
remember there is …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   162? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now at 5.2.2 you identified who had 
received monies from RailPro Holdings.  The first name in 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 131 of 163 
 
that list is Mr Landgrebe. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And the amount there is R30 million. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you have now told us that 
from AMCE he received 55-odd million. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Is that now a separate amount that is 
paid to him? 
MR MULLER:   That is a separate amount. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So he has received payments of about 
85 million. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And interestingly on both occasions 
namely payments from RailPro Holdings and payments from 
AMC, Mr Landgrebe gets quite a big amount from that to Mr 
Mashaba. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Mashaba on each occasion gets 
1, something million.  Mr Landgrebe gets many more 
20 
millions than that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I had not seen that and you are 
absolutely right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I have not see it, Chairperson. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 132 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And you are quite right.  Alright, then 
we have the entities who received benefits from – oh sorry, 
entities under the control of Mr Mashaba who received 
benefits and what is the total amount of benefits that they 
received? 
MR MULLER:   16,6 million, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then you have got Siyaya Rail and 
you say that is associated with Mr Mabunda.  These are 
still payments from AMCE? 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what is the amount of that 
benefit? 
MR MULLER:   5,999 – call it 6 million, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay and then at 5.2.4.6 is a person 
who receives a benefit who is – I mean, an entity that 
receives a benefit. 
MR MULLER:   That is Similex, Mrs Gomes’ company. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then the next payment is to Hover 
Dynamics. 
20 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And you have put something in 
brackets, what is that? 
MR MULLER:   As far as we could establish that was a 
payment for a helicopter. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 133 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  A what? 
MR MULLER:   A helicopter. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And how much was that – what was 
paid for that? 
MR MULLER:   11,074 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that was paid by – that was a 
payment made by AMCE? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Do you know if the helicopter was 
purchased or leased or…? 
10 
MR MULLER:   I do not know, Mr Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what do Hover Dynamics do, do 
they sell helicopters? 
MR MULLER:   As far as I understand, that is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then there is listed at 5.2.4.8 a 
payment in respect of motor vehicles.  What is the amount 
paid in respect of motor vehicles by AMCE? 
MR MULLER:   8,6 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then there is a payment made to 
Garcia Jewellers.  What is that payment? 
20 
MR MULLER:   445 000. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you list a number of 
transactions that need to be investigated. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairman, that is where we 
did not have more details. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 134 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then you list – you have two sets of 
figures – or two sets of entries relating to property and the 
first at 5.2.6 you say that these are properties acquired by 
Mr Mashaba and entities under his control and you make 
the point that these were acquired after the payment had 
been made from PRASA.  I take it to Swifambo. 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  So you have listed under 
Zedacore Six (Propriety) Limited three properties, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now before I go on with that can I just 
ask you to look at the notes that you have now submitted 
because, as I understand it, all that is reflected on note 1 
at page 171.1 is – sorry, note 1 which appears at 171.1 to 
171.3, that you have now updated what has happened in 
respect of these properties, is that correct? 
MR MULLER:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So there is no change in respect of 
the 
purchase 
of 
the 
properties, 
the 
identity 
of 
the 
20 
properties, there is no change in them. 
MR MULLER:   There is no change except some of the 
properties were sold. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, yes, they were sold by whoever 
the purchaser was. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 135 of 163 
 
MR MULLER:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So in – and what is the link between 
Zedacore Six and Mr Mashaba? 
MR MULLER:   As far as I can understand, he is one of the 
directors of Zedacore Six or shareholder. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right and number 33 Sturdy(?) Mews?  
That is the next set of – that the next entity that purchased 
the next three properties. 
MR MULLER:   That is also one of Mr Mashaba’s 
companies. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you still looking at the notes, Mr 
Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no, no, sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, each time you move just let us know. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I will, I will, I know it is – I have been 
through it so many times it is automatic for me, but I 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you have gone to page 165? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  165, number 33 Sturdy(?) Mews.  
Have you go that, Mr Muller? 
20 
MR MULLER:   I have got it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now you say that is in business, what 
does that mean? 
MR MULLER:  It is just a status of a company that is not in 
any deregistration or something like that … 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 136 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh. 
MR MULLER:  It is with SIPS it’s still in business.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that company acquired three 
properties as well. 
MR MULLER:  That is correct.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And you have indentified? 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What is the total worth of the 
properties acquired by Mr Mashaba through these two 
companies? 
10 
MR MULLER:  Nzetha Cor, it’s a 32 – 39 million.  And 
Sterdy Mews, it’s 13,7 million or there about.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now 52 million rand in property is 
acquired by Mr Mashaba after the ...[indistinct] payments 
done by – after Swifambo received ...[indistinct]. 
MR MULLER:  No.  There’s a further lest, Mr Chair of Clear 
Bubbles Trading on the updated notes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh sorry. 
MR MULLER:  It’s quite clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no, before you proceed.  The 
20 
figure that you gave earlier on to the question was it 52 
million? 
MR MULLER:  Or … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  82 Million. 
MR MULLER:  What I did, I didn’t totalled that up.  I just 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 137 of 163 
 
totalled that up now on those two companies.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MULLER:  But if you take all the companies that fall 
under the control of Mr Mashaba, the total properties 
bought after the is 92,4 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But you, have you got the – on 
which page do you have that total of 92 or you just added 
up mentally? 
MR MULLER:  I just no.  I just added it up just before we 
started here.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MULLER:  Because there were no totals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not on the, on the, on the report. 
MR MULLER:  It’s not on there.  No it’s not on there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It would help if there is something 
in writing.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What we will do as well, we’ll put a 
note in Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That this is what the total is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and also just a complete list. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MULLER:  I’ll provide you with that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 138 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I am a bit, well not including, I 
just want to make sure that I am not misunderstanding.  On 
page 165 of that’s your main report, SS4, right?  Mr 
Muller?   
MR MULLER:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Page 165. You have been looking at 
it.   
MR MULLER:  I’ve got that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  5.2.6 And 5.2.7.  Sorry, 5.2.6.  You 
have got two blocks, fixed property. 
10 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in note 1, you say it consists of 
an update.  Are there more properties in note 1 or under 
note 1 than there are at 5.2.6? 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, would you just quick – are you 
able to do it without taking up too much of time, which are 
the new properties on note 1 that are not reflected at 
5.2.6? 
MR MULLER:  Okay, we dealt with the Nzetha Cor 
20 
properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Note 1 again being page 171.1 hey? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to page … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  171.3.   
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 139 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  
MR MULLER:  Then the Nzetha Cor properties it’s those 
three properties as mentioned under 5.2.6.  Then the 
Sterdy Mews is as mentioned in 5.2.6.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh I see.  Okay. 
MR MULLER:  And then there are further properties in 
Clear Bubbles Trading 100 Pty Ltd.  Those are, it’s an erf 
in Waterkloof, 1219 Waterkloof.  The evaluation is 6,5 
million.  It’s SS Kylemore of 9,5 million.  That property has 
since been sold on the 18 t h of February 2020.  So it was 
10 
bought after 2013, but it has since been sold.  It was 
bought for 9,5 million and sold for 12 million.  And then 
further properties that were bought after 2013 was Avras 
Park, Farm Vleurdeluis for 3,2 million.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But isn’t there an easier way of 
identifying them?  And I say this with respect to you Mr 
Muller, if you look at page 171.1 the notes, in the second 
block you identified the same three properties that you 
have identified in 5.2.6, in the first block at 5.2.6 at page 
165.   
20 
MR MULLER:  Can you just take me to, to 170 – no.  I am 
on 165 and I have got the first three properties. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right, you’ve got the first three 
properties.   
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 140 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now look at page 171.1.  There those 
are your notes.   
MR MULLER:  I have, I have my bundle does not contain 
those notes.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, will give you some notes then. 
MR MULLER:  I got ...[indistinct].  Okay I have got my 
notes.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You’ll see in the first, in the second 
block on page 171.1 you list three properties.   
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Are they the same properties that are 
reflected in the first block on page, on page 165? 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So then we know that that block 
corresponds with that block? 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  If you then look at 33 Sterdy 
Mews, you have listed three properties there. 
MR MULLER:  That corresponds … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  On page 171.2.   
20 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that corresponds with the three 
properties listed in the second block on page 165. 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now that means the six properties 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 141 of 163 
 
that are reflected in 5.2.6 are in those two blocks, all the 
other property are not reflected. 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I don’t know if I am just 
trying to show the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The correspondence between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no.  I think ultimately you … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You got it.  Ja. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It’s just that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Otherwise it’s going to be a time 
consuming exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It really is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You can just take out two blocks and 
say everything else is ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, that’s fine.  Ja.   
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can I and I am just going by because 
I’ve read Mr Sack’s report, in fact I can say I studied Mr 
Sack’s.  The reason you didn’t include some of the 
properties as, you were not aware of the link between Mr 
Mashaba and some of the entities that acquired those. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 142 of 163 
 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Like for example we are now Neaty 
Properties which appears at 171.2.  The last property.   
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So, so I mean that’s, that’s the only 
reason that they are different.  You now see that there 
were other entities connected with Mr Mashaba and you 
want to then say that when you are looking at 5.2.6 which 
reflects the properties that he acquired after receiving 
payment, add the properties listed in note 1. 
10 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, now in regard to Chairperson I 
will do that, I have it in my head and it’s meant to be an 
easy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no, that’s fine.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then at 5. – although you call it 3.2.6 
that’s, that’s error is it not?  No, it should be 5.2. 
MR MULLER:  That must be an error. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  We will correct that as well 
Chairperson.  Now in regard to Mr Mabunda in his own 
20 
name after Swifambo received payment from PRASA he 
received, I mean he acquired certain property.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Let’s start off with where you were 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 143 of 163 
 
before you compiled the notes.  He and entities in which he 
had an interest had, had acquired 10 properties. Is that 
correct? 
MR MULLER:  That was at the stage that I drew my report 
...[indistinct]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Your report. 
MR MULLER:  I was, I was aware of, yes.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  How many, which properties though 
are new?  I’m not looking at those that are sold.   
MR MULLER:  There are, in my notes there are two 
10 
properties in Erf Cosmosdal, Extension 55. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Well just tell us who the – under 
whose name it was bought? 
MR MULLER:  That was bought under the name of Nsobo 
Holdings.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What page is that of the notes? 
MR MULLER:  That’s page 3 going over to page 4 of my 
notes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh, okay.  Alright.  And there are two 
properties there.   
20 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 171.3? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That’s 1. – 171.3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 144 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And when you look at the properties 
that Mr Mabunda acquired, forget those that were sold, but 
just the amounts that were paid, seemingly from what 
PRASA had paid to Swifambo.  Just the amount, the total 
amount in property acquisitions by Mr Mabunda. 
MR MULLER:  The total amount after the contract was 48,7 
million of the properties bought.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, that to a large extent deals 
with the Court’s report, except for paragraph 10 which 
appears at page 169 of the report itself Chairperson.  
10 
MR MULLER:  Right. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As the bundle in which the report is 
contained.  Page 169 Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got 169, what about it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, paragraph 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Muller now as I understand it, 
Vossloh has been taken over by a German firm called 
Stadler.   
MR MULLER:  It’s a Swiss firm. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh sorry, a Swiss firm I beg your 
pardon. 
MR MULLER:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in regard to – and they have 
taken over the whole of Vossloh? 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 145 of 163 
 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And without revealing anything that 
you shouldn’t, what is the present State of the dealings 
between you as the liquidator of Swifambo, which owes 
those 
billions 
to 
PRASA, 
what 
is 
the 
state 
of 
the 
negotiations or the communications between you and 
Stadler?  Without revealing anything that can be used this 
time in the process ...[indistinct]? 
MR MULLER:  We are in an advanced stage of negotiating 
with both Stadler and PRASA in order, in terms of which 
10 
Stadler has, has made certain propositions where they can 
adjust the trains to suit our local rails, where they will 
refurbish the local, the unsold trains which we have, or the 
locomotives.  And which were sold by the liquidators, they 
will supply spares and back up.  It will be to the benefit of 
PRASA, to the extent of over a billion, billion and a half.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But at the end of the day, PRASA if it 
wants to acquire, still acquire these locomotives, is going 
to have to pay. 
MR MULLER:  No, not as, as we currently stand there are, 
20 
are different options being pursued like in lieu of their 
claim. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But whatever else, it won’t be that 
PRASA will acquire 70 more locomotives without paying 
any more money.  That’s more or less what it had paid 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 146 of 163 
 
Vossloh.  In terms of its contract with Swifambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may be because there are 
negotiations.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Which ...[indistinct] no, no. 
MR MULLER:  I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very much. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, ja, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not be to able to answer certain things 
because then when the negotiations are going on … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You need to be, to have options to … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Hold your cards to your chest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No sure. 
MR MULLER:  We’re trying to negotiate a settlement 
which, which will be beneficial to PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now finally Mr Muller, you might 
remember I said to you that Mr Mashaba had filed new 
CM100s.   
20 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that he did in July, about five 
months after you file your report to the stakeholder. 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now have, how long have you been a 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 147 of 163 
 
liquidator? 
MR MULLER:  This is my 37 t h years. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Are you, have you had a situation in 
these years, and I’m saying this because I’ve consulted 
with you, have you had a situation where a second CM100 
is filed? 
MR MULLER:  No never. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And can I just, just to show the, the 
unusual nature, the CM10 – the CM100 is actually an 
affidavit by the person in control of the entity to be 
10 
liquidated.   
MR MULLER:  It’s an affidavit stating the assets and 
liabilities. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  On of? 
MR MULLER:  Of, the liquidator end. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  On oath. 
MR MULLER:  That’s under oath. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And so now what you’ve got is a new 
CM100 is filed in respect of each of these entities and if 
you had a look at the, the two sets of CM100s? 
20 
MR MULLER:  Yes I have. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And how do they compare with one 
another?  Are they relatively reconcilable.  Or they are 
irreconcilable?   
MR MULLER:  They are totally irreconcilable.  At the one 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 148 of 163 
 
hand it is insolvent to the tune of call it 3 billion.  On the 
other hand it is solvent.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But, but anyway that’s what you are 
now faced with because that’s what you have been given.   
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I just want to deal with a – Mr Sacks 
dealt with most of these matters.  And I just want to look 
very quickly at some of the, the notes that we made.  And 
Chairperson I am aware that we dealt with these in some 
detail with Mr Sacks, but the fact of the matter is they were 
10 
handed to Mr Muller as the liquidator.  And it would be 
important to confirm in fact that that is what he’d received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As part of the CM100s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that’s fine.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now can I ask you to look at the 
report again and that is the one at 161 of Bundle C1.  
Sorry that starts at 161.  Okay.  We can leave out the 
notes now because we’ve exhausted the notes, is that 
correct? 
20 
MR MULLER:  Okay, that’s good. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now can I just ask you to look at page 
214.70.  .70.   
MR MULLER:  .70? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.   
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 149 of 163 
 
MR MULLER:  I’ve got it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  This is in regards to leasing.  There 
does not seem to be much in regard to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see, I see Mr Soni that we will have to 
be careful here, for purposes of the transcript.  Because in 
the document that we have paginated as pages 171 and 
171.5 where he said to note one note 2 and so on.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I see here at page … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  214.70 That there is note 1 as well and 
there is no 2. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You’re absolutely right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when we refer to note 1 or note 2 we 
have got to specify. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, absolutely.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  This will then and we must make a 
20 
conscious effort here Chairperson of saying the notes to 
the CM100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, that’s fine.  Failure, failing 
which it will … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No absolutely. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 150 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will just say page whatever. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Or yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without saying note 1 or note 2. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because in the end it does not make a 
difference. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So and Mr Muller, if we all can just be 
conscious of that, that it would be preferable for the 
10 
purposes of the record to refer to page numbers.   
MR MULLER:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now at page 214.7O, Mr Mashaba 
which is a note to his CM100, Mr Mashaba explains why he 
is filing the thickened CM100 affidavit.   
MR MULLER:  Yes I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  And he says that the original 
document that he signed, the CM100 that he signed, or he 
purported to sign fails to completely and accurately reflect 
the financial information that the Company’s Act requires.  
20 
You’re a liquidator.  What does that strike you that you do 
not comply with what the Company’s Act requires you to do 
on oath? 
MR MULLER:  There, I have got no comment on that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, and that is sharing.  Okay. Then 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 151 of 163 
 
he explains that Mr Cameron, his present attorney – I take 
it you’ve, you’ve had interactions with Mr Cameron? 
MR MULLER:  Yes I have. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  He says that based on advice 
he’d received from Mr Cameron they decided or he’s been 
advised to submit this new one.  He says something that 
quite impressing.  He says at paragraph 4, he says: 
“From the new statement it is self evident that 
leasing is factually false.” 
 
And that I take it would be part of liquidation 
10 
process and part of court applications and all that.  But I’m 
just placing it on record that that is his contention in these 
liquidation proceedings. 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then he makes a point that the 
claim of PRASA which had paid from 2,8 billion rand to 
Swifambo is not reflected as this would need to be 
quantified in an action which Mr Mashaba has been 
advised, needs to be instituted by PRASA against leasing, 
that’s his position.  And I’m not asking you to comment.  I 
20 
am just saying that that is his ...[indistinct]. 
MR MULLER:  I understand. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And you understand that that is his 
position? 
MR MULLER:  I do. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 152 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And, and that’s why Chairperson if I 
can just make this comment, Vals Dickens said: 
 
“The law is an ass.” 
 
Because here is a company which paid 2,8 – a 
public company, 2,8 billion rand in purportedly if I could 
use that word, forming a public function.  And it’s told that 
you don’t have a claim, you must go to court and get your, 
your money back.  Anyway, can I now ask you to look at 
note 19.  Oh sorry, page 214.  Page 214.108.   
MR MULLER:  Can you please repeat that? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  214.108. 
MR MULLER:  I’ve got it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, now these are the claims that 
Mr 
Mashaba 
says 
Swifambo 
paid 
when 
in 
fact 
the 
obligation to pay for forwarding charges rested on PRASA.  
You understand that. 
MR MULLER:  I do. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  These are the claims that are made 
by Sademzi.  He says they paid and the amount they paid 
was about 109 million rand so Sademzi.  You are aware of 
20 
that?   
MR MULLER:  I’m aware of it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I don’t want to make too much of 
this, I’ve raised it with your attorney.  But there is 
something odd about some of the amounts reflected here.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 153 of 163 
 
If I could just ask you to look at page 214.11.  That’s an 
invoice dated the 21 s t of November 2014.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat the page. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh sorry.  214.111.   
MR MULLER:  Is it 110. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  111. 
MR MULLER:  111.  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So this is an invoice rendered by 
Sibenza on the 21 s t of November 2014 to Swifambo.  You 
see that Mr Muller? 
10 
MR MULLER:  I do. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Well let’s forget the fact that the 
contract said, and this is a fact.  The contract said that 
PRASA is responsible for forwarding costs.  These amounts 
on Mr Mashaba’s version and it seems to be reasonably 
correct.  Swifambo paid to Sibenza.  Okay.  And now you 
keep shaking your head.  I need an answer. 
MR MULLER:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I just want you to look at this, 
the claim reflected on that invoice.  On the first line you 
20 
will see it says, customs VAT of R7 925 489,32.  Now what 
– I understood VAT is payable on expenses you incur, for 
goods you buy.  Or am I wrong? 
MR MULLER:  I’m not a tax expert, but that is how I 
understand it. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 154 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So we’ve now got a line, a line item of 
a claim for R8 000 000,00 but it would appear that 
Swifambo simply paid it against ...[indistinct].  Again I’m 
just, I don’t want you to comment, I’m just pointing it out to 
you.  And all I’d like you to say, that is what is recorded in 
the document. 
MR MULLER:  That is what I see, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then if you look at the next one on 
page 213.1.2 you’ll see that a similar thing occurs where a 
VAT amount is reflected without any expenses being 
10 
indicated.  The expenses for the charges and so on.  And 
you will see also that the VAT amount they claim, that is 
claimed at the bottom or the second last figure on that 
page, on page 214.1.1 reflects the VAT on the amounts 
claimed for the services rendered, plus this R320 000,00.  
You see that? 
MR MULLER:  Is that page 2 – 214.112? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MULLER:  Yes, I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  And if you look I am just going 
20 
to take one more example.  If you look at 214.1.1.4 you will 
see again customs VAT of R1 230 000,00 and that VAT is 
added to the VAT for the services.  You see that? 
MR MULLER:  I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I highlight that, because 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 155 of 163 
 
of the concerns that have been raised about an entity 
which has no obligation to pay, paying these amounts and 
it, it as you can see at least one of the amounts is a million 
rand.  I, I’ve looked at more of them, but I merely make the 
point to say that that is a matter that needs further 
investigation.  Certainly if the matter, if that’s claimed from 
PRASA, it is a matter that PRASA would need to look, 
because they are obviously saying now, we paid on behalf 
of PRASA, pay us back.   
MR MULLER:  We will follow that up. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then can I ask you to look at note 20 
– oh sorry.  To page 214.130.  Now this is the claim that Mr 
Mabunda or one of his companies made for payment of a 
total of 28 million rand.  And Mr Mashaba records that Mr 
Mabunda did offer advice through various companies, but 
he was never employed by leasing and it is not understood 
why he received 28 million rand from Swifambo.  But that’s 
what’s recorded here.  That’s all I’m saying.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MULLER:  Yes I saw that. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But that’s something you can respond 
to, because the payments are made by Swifambo or 
Swifambo related companies. 
MR 
MULLER: 
 
We 
have 
instituted 
various 
actions, 
including against Mr Mabuda to recover monies that was, 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 156 of 163 
 
that was spent to him. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But the interesting thing though is 
that Mr Mashaba appears to turn on Mr Mabunda and say, 
pay this money back.  But did your ...[indistinct], I can 
understand you have an arm’s length relationship with all 
the beneficiaries.   
MR MULLER:  That ...[indistinct]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mabunda has been a beneficiary 
because we’ve been through it of the two entities that 
received money from PRASA, that’s Rail and leasing.  No 
10 
sorry, Holdings and leasing.  And now … 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Mashaba says, he shouldn’t have 
been paid anything. 
MR MULLER:  I see. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I want you then to please look at 
page 214.1.3.  Now remember you said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  214.? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  214.1.33 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You remember you said you had a 
claim against Mr Gomez for R41 400 000,00? 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I am just alerting you to this 
because it is a matter that we are interested in as well.  
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 157 of 163 
 
And if you look at page 214.135 that is two pages down.  
Mr Mashaba says this is a schedule of donations that were 
intended for the ANC.  And the amount he reflects here is 
79 odd million rand.   
MR MULLER:  I see, I see. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now if you go back to page 133 he 
explains how that came about.  And he says that after the 
contract was awarded, Mr Mashaba and Mr Mabunda were 
approached by Ms Gomez and Attorney Sibelo.  And under 
pressure from mister, from Ms Gomez and Ms Sibelo, Mr 
10 
Mashaba on behalf of leasing arranged to make a donation 
to the ANC in an amount equal to 88 million rand.  But I, 
I’m, I want to deal with what I regard as the punch line.  
Now I want to make a donation of 88 million rand, but I will 
charge whoever it is a handling fee of R8 000 000,00.  
That’s what he says at 3.4. 
MR MULLER:  I see. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then the amount that was paid, 
he says was R79 400 000,00.  Now in fairness to the ANC 
and to Mr Mashaba he then says that Mr Badelo testified at 
20 
the 417 inquiry and said that these amounts were not 
distributed to the ANC.  You were at that inquiry.  Is that 
what happened?   
MR MULLER:  I can’t recall the exact details, I will have to 
go and double check on that sir. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 158 of 163 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And so he says the amount owing by 
these two individuals is not R41 400 000,00 but in fact 
79,4 million. 
MR MULLER:  That’s correct, I see. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Well I mean, that’s what’s recorded 
here and you will keep that in mind as Mr Mashaba saying 
that’s what Swifambo paid to these people. 
MR MULLER:  I will, I will follow that up. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then finally, well perhaps not finally, 
but at page 214.149.  This is another claim from – oh sorry, 
10 
this is the main one that I – but perhaps if I could ask you 
first to look at 214.150 which is the next page.  This is 
another payment that was made to Mr Mabunda or one of 
his companies, and it was for 7,2 million rand and Mr 
Mashaba says no value was obtained in respect, in respect 
of this payment. Swifambo wants the money back. 
MR MULLER:  Yes I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, but now I want you to look at 
note 32.   
CHAIRPERSON:  At page? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh, sorry.  I am sorry Chairperson.  
Page 214.149 it’s the one just before.  He says subsequent 
to leasing concluding a sub contract agreement with 
Vossloh, and without the knowledge of leasing and its 
consent Vossloh paid to Mr Mabunda or his companies, an 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 159 of 163 
 
amount of approximately 75 million rand.  It is Mr Mashaba, 
he continues in the CM100 as it is my contention that this 
amount should have been paid by Vossloh to leasing as 
some form of rebate and accordingly the leasing liquidators 
need to recover this amount from Mr Mabunda for his 
...[indistinct]. 
MR MULLER:  Chairman I can’t see how we can have a 
cause of action against Vossloh, not being party to that 
payment.  I do not know how, how we are able to recover 
that money from Vossloh.   
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  But suppose what he is trying to 
demonstrate is, the extent to which different people who 
were not entitled to benefit or produce nothing of value in 
respect of the contract, received such benefits and now the 
company is in liquidation, he wants those monies back. 
MR MULLER:  Yes Mr Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now those are all the aspects of the 
new CM100 relating to leasing that I want to raise with you 
now Mr Muller. 
MR MULLER:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I have raised all the 
matters that I wanted to raise with Mr Muller and I have 
deliberately, I did of course stray on the one occasion 
when you pointed out, but I did try to keep it within the 
confines of what Mr Muller would be ...[indistinct] Chair. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 160 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That’s the evidence we want to lead 
from Mr Muller. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no.  That’s fine.  Thank you very 
much Mr Muller.  I have no reason to think your counsel 
was to re-exam now, re-examine.  Mr Cilliers? 
ADV CILLIERS SC:  Nothing from our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you very much Mr 
Muller, 
we 
appreciate 
that 
you 
came 
to 
assist 
the 
Commission.  You are now excused. 
10 
MR MULLER:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is the evidence that we intended 
leading this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And we’ve gone through all the 
witnesses that we eventually thought were necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We’ve taken note of the matter that 
have been raised.  We may require perhaps a day or two 
20 
more for PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Depending on, on what happens next. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It may be one more day.  But it won’t 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 161 of 163 
 
be more than that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja you may, you may require time 
for some of … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Those investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The witnesses you have mentioned today. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of, in terms of others that 
you may have lined up from the beginning, you have 
covered more or less all except maybe one or two? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Indeed Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But we just want to consider our 
position without giving any names at this stage.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  If you will recall we had the Siyagena 
and the Swifambo contracts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Before you.  We just need to consider 
really we’ve exhausted all the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, no that’s fine.  It’s 15:50.  I am 
20 
going to – I think for you that’s the end of the, the day at 
the hearing.  I’m supposed to hear the evidence relating to 
the law enforcement agency for my evening session, but it 
was meant to start at 17:00.  I don’t see the evidence 
leader around.  Because if he was around we would not 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350 
 
Page 162 of 163 
 
wait for 17:00, we would start … 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Earlier.  But I’m going to adjourn and if 
it’s possible to start before 17:00 we will start before 17:00 
failing which then we start at 17:00.  So we are going to 
adjourn so that the – I will return later for the evening 
session.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And we are excused Chairperson, the 
10 
PRASA team? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you are excused. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Thank you Chair.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Soni for staying.  Ja, no, 
no it appears that although I initially may have thought we 
would again be hearing the evidence relating to Mr Joubert 
today, apparently ultimately it was adjourned to next 
Tuesday.  So there is no evening session for today.   
20 
Yes so we will adjourn and tomorrow I will hear 
evidence relating to Eskom.  That is for the benefit of the 
public.  One must welcome every opportunity to have only 
one session yes. 
We adjourn. 
25 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 350
